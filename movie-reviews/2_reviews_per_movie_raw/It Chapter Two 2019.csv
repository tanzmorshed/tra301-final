","It's been a while since I've read the book or seen the first movie; so I apologize if I get some things wrong.<br/><br/>TLDR; The film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares. This means little character interaction (which is part of what the first movie had going for it). By the time you get to the final confrontation with Pennywise, you're just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you're not really rooting for the losers. And if you are, it's mostly because of what was established in the first film.<br/><br/>Pros:
<ul><li>The film starts off great. Somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first.</li><li>Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise and is creepy as hell.</li><li>Stan's speech in Richie's second flashback is great and actually funny.</li><li>Casting is, for the most part, really good. I think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they've matured over time. Adult Richie is too kid-like while Bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable.</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:
<ul><li>Bowers is half-assed. Literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else. Either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in Derry.</li><li>The final form of Pennywise is unsatisfying. It's literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body. They needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book. I think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though.</li><li>Stan's letter at the end cheapens his death. Instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of IT, his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others.</li><li>There's next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters. I blame this mostly on the middle 90 minutes where they all split up. It's totally different from the first film where they are actually a team.</li><li>Speaking of which, this part where they all go their separate ways to find their ""tokens"" is so contrived. The story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long.</li><li>All of the monster scenes except the ones with Pennywise have terrible CGI. They might be gross and/or startling but you can see them coming and they don't contribute much.</li><li>About 1/3 to 1/2 of the jokes just kinda fell flat.</li><li>The constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch. It was just a constant cycle of ""pan to character, give a little backstory, jump scare, repeat"".</li></ul>"
"daniellemobsby","5","922","1176","7 September 2019"," Call me ""old fashioned,"" but CGI monster overkill does nothing for me
","I really, realllly wanted to like this film. As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).<br/><br/>The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining. That was a real, completely horrifying image that has stayed with me 30 years after I First saw the movie. I don't understand the obsession with CGI when there's no need for it.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie was just a drawn out bore."

","Only ""God"" knows how I wanted to love this film.<br/><br/>As a big fan of the (masterpiece) book, I was eager for part II. I liked the first part. I didnt LOVE IT, but it was a good adaption.<br/><br/>In the other hand, the second part is... Slow. I didnt feel the ""chemistry"" between the adult version of the Losers Club. Dont get me wrong, the acting is good, but... Something's off.<br/><br/>I didnt get the insinuations about Ritchie's sexual orientation (why? And it wasnt in the book either), and the way they chose to kill Pennywise. That was SHAMEFUL. Ultra-simple solution and it made me feel dumb... SIGH.<br/><br/>Oh! Last but not least: THE CGI FEST. I really dont like CGI in horror flicks. I dont think it is IMPOSSIBLE to use it, not at all, but God... What a CGI MONSTER FEST...

"sophiakhan-66615","1","252","332","5 October 2019"," Failed attempt at horror and comedy
","Firstly, those people giving this a 9 and 10....what did they put in your popcorn?! Did you see a different movie?! Should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad?! Some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie...do you not feel any guilt!<br/><br/>This was AWFUL! Its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I'll leave these points here:<br/><br/>1. The terrible acting. It was awful. The actors were either bored or overacting (Bill, Mike, Richie). Seriously terrible.<br/><br/>2. What on earth was the need to make this a 3 hour movie?! It was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly boring<br/><br/>3. The story had no story. Mike tells them there's an Indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for 2 hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual...WHAT?! What was the point of that?! Ben threw into the fire something he'd held dear in his wallet for 27 years for...no.....reason??<br/><br/>4. Seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character development<br/><br/>5. Erm what happened to Bills wife? Bev is kissing all the guys but is still married. They turned Bev's character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss Bill then choose the wealthy and better looking Ben for his boat?!<br/><br/>6. What in the name of all that is Mike Myers was that terrible CGI about?! The old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a 15 foot naked zombie like monster<br/><br/>7. Speaking of zombies...Bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum? If zombies can do that, why did Pennywise need Bowers?<br/><br/>8. Speaking of Bowers...what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama? He did nothing. Except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely fine<br/><br/>9. Stanley's suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself?! The act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear...not as a human sacrifice<br/><br/>10. The grand finale. After spending 2 hours looking for tokens and Mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner's pottery class, turns out all you had to do was hurt Pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby? I have no words....really<br/><br/>People do yourselves a favour, avoid this at all costs"

","...it is a disgrace because it is a gross betrayal of the original book. IT - the book - is a psychological thriller about friendship, about relationships, it is about the deep fears we have as kids and which grow with us until we are adults; it is about how we learn fighting and ultimately defeating these fears.
IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.
Shame on this movie!"
"raquel_pompey","5","149","203","13 September 2019"," I really wanted to love IT!!!!
","Okay so saw the first remake of the movie, was absolutely in love. I went and saw the second one today and didn't feel any where near close to what I felt for the first one. It was super long but that isn't even what upset me. It was just lacking in delivery! Pennywise was hardly in the movie. He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite. This one, I definitely should've waited until it came out on DVD. Just being honest. The first one was way to good for this to be part 2. It didn't deliver the expectation that the first one set."

","""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you. I've missed you!""<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>The casting director very much shines in the spotlight here. If there is a category for Best Casting Director in the Academy Award, I am all in to bet that It: Chapter Two's will not just get nominated, but win very big. The casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger-selves from the predecessor.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You will feel the emotional impact of The Losers' Club as a whole. The fear that feeds their souls, the memories that hunt them &amp; the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within &amp; about.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The various &amp; disparate forms of IT should give a blast of excitement to the audience. This is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other-worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek-a-boo! It is gross, weird and definitely strange.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The heartwarming story of The Losers' Club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year. The connection they have is so strong and palpable,</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>An excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another, giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure.</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch, however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow. This is the main problem with the IT movies, it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare. Even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures' features.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The real form of IT is upsetting and disappointing. I can strongly say that the majority will love IT's true form from the 1990 Television Mini-Series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier, deadlier &amp; more realistic.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It is super slow and draggy that it doesn't need to be at almost 3 hours mark. 2 hours should be the best run time for this movie like IT Chapter One. It has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour. Reunion, get together, a few jumpscare parts. That's all there is to it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The second act of the movie (halfway) feels as if you are watching 5 to 6 different short films instead. Because it has that slow-burning nature, the scenes feel disjointed from one another. It spends around 45 minutes to an hour to look at every members of The Losers' Club being haunted by Pennywise.</li></ul><br/><br/>Verdict: IT CHAPTER TWO is certainly fresh and enjoyable. Hopes up not, its extremely slow-going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode. IT CHAPTER TWO walks you into a journey of the insidious Derry town albeit its lack of formidable creatures."
"martinaskoe","3","282","412","6 September 2019"," If you're scared of CGI and don't want to get invested in the main characters, this is just for you..
","Well, this was a waste..
This movie is just a long run of jumpscares (all the f'ing time), not at all scary CGI monsters and reusing of the same jokes and ""scares"". I don't think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture.<br/><br/>There is no tension or character-investing in this movie, and the director manages to make the cast (who works with What they have been giving) look terrible in their acting. It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).<br/><br/>If you like a horror movie, where you don't need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..
But hey, it's just my opinion.."
"Darkside-Reviewer","5","141","203","6 October 2019"," Tim Curry in a clown costume is more terrifying than any CGI monster
","I personally didn't enjoy IT 2017 so I didn't have much hope for part 2 but I was expecting them to at least tone down the CGI instead they went overkill with it no imagination used here just in your face flashy CGI effects that look fake and plastic the only thing frightening about this movie is that sadly because it made money at the box office more Stephen King books are going to get remakes and it won't be long before we get an all CGI Maximum Overdrive movie remake.<br/><br/>There are more scenes with Pennywise transforming and creating twisted ways to mess with the returning losers club members but sadly they are all done with CGI and are all standard copy and paste scenes from the original mini series and when the movie finally gets to it's climax the makers of this ""Horror Movie"" think by simply making Pennywise bigger it instills more fear into the audience when really all it does is scream CGI and all the suspence is watered down to bigger pixels on screen than there where before ""Terrifying""<br/><br/>The only and I do mean only saving grace this movie has is the cast they all do a great job on screen especially considering they have to pretend to be scared and flee in terror from a green screen it's not the actors fault this movie was a big let down.<br/><br/>I recommend watching the original IT mini series if you haven't already seen it Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise is the reason why people who grew up in the 90s have a fear of clowns because a great actor in the right role can make all the difference in a movie Tim Curry will always be Pennywise no matter how many remakes are made just like Judy Garland will always be Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ there performance makes the movie so memorable and it can't be re-created no matter how much CGI you use."
"Darthfrodo58","2","293","444","6 September 2019"," Much longer than Chapter One but half the enjoyment
","After seeing Chapter One I expected so much more, unfortunately IT didn't deliver. The film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it's honesty. And things just go downhill from there. The Loser's Club of the first film reunites 27 years later to have another go at defeating Pennywise, but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them, the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film. The film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults. The effect is that you never really care about them as adults, they're just an excuse to show CGI monsters that never really scare you on any level. The pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next, while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you'll have to endure. The middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (verbatim quote and all) a little bit of Toy Story erector spider, a dash of Poltergeist's Native American mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they're up against. James McAvoy's character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck (a nod to the book) and unfortunately this film doesn't improve on the novel. It's just an overly long series of vignettes that tie to Chapter One in an unsatisfying way."

","'IT chapter 2' is a film based on the Steven King's novels, that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of Derry. The direction is poor, seems like they didn't even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show. I remember a scene in the theater where I would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders. The cast looked like they were bored every minute of it, being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained. They did not make any try to act, just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it. The story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time. There were many points during the film where I was annoyed, even bored, ready to sleep on my chair, the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it. To sum it up, 'IT chapter 2' is a movie for young kids aged 10 - 14 because they would be the only ones to appreciate it. I would not recommend it for anyone over that age plus I would not pay to watch it again. It was a really bad try, I would add, pathetic at least."

Lots of jumpscares, all so predictable, I was so bored, I thought: oh please, not another one. And why do they always feel the need to change the plot? For instance the one about Bill not being really sick? Why do filmmakers think they know it better than Stephen King? Or steal from other movies (the Thing) And the end, the end, that was the last straw for me. If you read the book you know what IT really looks like. I was sooo hoping for a fantastic monster (they used enough CGI, didn't they) maybe a little like the Queen in Alien?(the one in the miniseries made me laugh). But no, what a mess.

I remember when the trailer came out--people began to rave about how good this film would be. Well this film sucked. Monumental waste of three hours. It was painful to watch. For lots of reasons. Jessica Chastain mailed it in. Bill Hader echoing F-bombs every other word. Ransome is a guy you want to punch. The only scene I enjoyed in the film was the scene with the old woman-and even that was ruined because the entire scene played out in the trailer. Worst, the movie wasn't even scary. CGI trickery. It was more like a Tim Burton film. And one other thing-the silly, over-the-top attempts at humor greatly diminished the film. For a film positing itself as the scariest adaptation of a King novel, the audience spent far too much time snickering at lame jokes. I want my money-and my three hours--back."
"jtindahouse","8","392","630","4 September 2019"," Not your average horror movie
","Very early on in 'It Chapter Two' there is some wink wink dialogue about an author writing a great book, but messing up the ending. Anyone who is familiar with the 'It' book or original mini-series will know the ending was not well liked. Here now though they had a chance to rectify things, and I can assure you they did. Not just in terms of the ending, but the entire second entry is actually a fantastically made film and in my opinion superior to part one.<br/><br/>The film is exceptionally long for a horror movie at nearly three hours. The thing is though I can't see it having the same impact if it were much shorter. There was a lot of layers to fit in. This isn't your average ""fast-food"" horror like the 'Conjuring' universe films. This is as much a drama in a lot of ways as it is a horror. The first half of the film especially. A long time is taken reintroducing us to the characters, showing us where they are with their lives now and building up their résumés again. Then in the second half of the film (and yes I'm talking about almost an entire 90 minutes) the film kicks into hyper-drive with non-stop, in your face horror - and it is a sight to behold.<br/><br/>The cast were again all perfectly selected. Bill Hader in particular steals the show. He is given some great one-liners to work with, much the same as Finn Wolfhard was, and he nails every one of them. There is also a great Stephen King cameo. This isn't just a case of blink and you'll miss him, he is given an entire scene with some hilarious dialogue. I wasn't sure whether 'It Chapter Two' would be able to stick the landing and give the story the ending that it deserves, but it certainly did. I had a great time with this movie and I think any lover of the genre will as well."

That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.<br/><br/>The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.<br/><br/>What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.<br/><br/>I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie."

They were just that: characters.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised the movie opened with the Adrian Melon scene. This scene is one that makes the story of IT (and many other stories of mr. King) so great: besides the obvious evil of Pennywise, there are also ""real"" threats, like homophobic villagers.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed in the fact the storyline of Beverly's husband was completely cut, and the storyline of Henry Bowers was butchered. The fact that the Losers weren't only fighting Pennywise, but also had to dodge attacks from real people (so more rational fears if you will) was what made the book and the mini-series better than this flick.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an ""okay"" movie. Not great, not terrible, just ""meh""."
"MirkoS","1","160","251","8 September 2019"," Was this intended a comedy?
","Look, I don't mind being entertained at the movies, but there does come the expectation with such an adaptation of one of the best and most beloved horror novels ever written that it accord some respect while remaining true to the source material.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film lies in its tonal inconsistency. I could never tell if it was attempting to set a somber, foreboding, menacing feeling, or if it was trying to create an atmosphere conducive towards a lighthearted, hilarious jump-scare filled marathon. In one moment it hangs heavy in emotional gravitas (the opening scene is especially brutal and difficult to watch, and Stanley's suicide is also fairly dark), and the next, it's so ludicrously over the top and in your face in its execution of its ""horror"" elements that it produces a jarring sense of tonal discord. What exactly is this film attempting to be? The horror was so absurdly explicitly comedic in its execution (not helped by questionable effects work) that I must assume that was the intent. Yet in taking such a directorial approach, it effectively nullified the entire foundation that the movie required to establish and help foment the dreadful tension, atmosphere, and tone necessitated by the narrative (and of which made the book so stellar), and further relegated all the work by the actors and all other aspects of the film that had helped establish it up to that point void. If it wasn't intentional, then it does nothing so well as to exemplify how the filmmakers hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what actual horror really entails.<br/><br/>""IT Chapter Two"" spends much of its runtime plodding through a mindless, rote, predictable checklist of the characters recovering their artifacts from their youths, to the same tired, mindless, rote, predictable jump scares thrown at you one after the other which you can see coming from a million miles off which further robbed them of all their potency. How am I supposed to care at all about the protagonists' emotional plights (which are portrayed in a serious light) when their antagonist and its supposedly evil forms who are responsible for them are utterly stripped of their malevolence and are portrayed in such a formulaic, repetitive, explicit, and laughably juvenile manner? Yes, I know ""IT"" manifests itself also as a Pennywise who does utilize a childlike humor to lure his prey in, but that doesn't mean it wasn't the only way nor that the entity wasn't terrifying in all the revelations of its truest forms. They were terrifying in the novel, and here they're a downright riot. A little subtlety, suggestion, imagination, minimalism and unpredictability goes a long way and would've done this film wonders, as that's where the real core of any effective horror resides. It would've not only have helped maintain tonal consistency, it would've made it genuinely unsettling. My theatre was howling at every turn, and I'm completely left at a loss as to whether that was what the director intended.<br/><br/>As is, this film suffers an identity crisis. It is inconsistent, predictable, ludicrously (and unintentionally?) hilarious, redundant, overly drawn out to the point of boredom, and worst of all, a downright insult to King, who I'm shocked made the cameo he did in tacit approval of this screen adaptation abomination of his finest work. The glaring tonal juxtaposition and abysmal execution robbed me of all interest in witnessing The Losers' Club finally confront this ultimate evil terrorizing a small Maine town every 27 years, because in the end, it wasn't an ultimate evil at all......it was a goddamn mockery of one.<br/><br/>And due to that, I walked out. Truly, truly awful."

","More of a slow romantic comedy for the most part. Not scary at all. It was trash.. slow, cheesy and completely fake. I mean zombies driving cars, a normal human man getting stabbed in his heart damn near and didn't effect him, a spider head. I mean it was horrible. I went with someone but if I had went alone I'd have walked out, and I've never ever even contemplated doing that. I literally would have. I was on the edge of my seat, only bc I was ready to leave!!! It's 3 hours of my life I'll never get back and it was pulling teeth to get through it. One of the worst movies I've ever seen and you'd have to pay me literally hundreds of dollars to watch again fully. Not sure how much exactly but it would hundreds if not a cool 1k. Didn't feel like IT. Felt like another movie entirely."

","For anyone who believes that this movie was scary or even a decent movie clearly has no taste in films. From the script right down to the acting it was horrid. I didn't have much expectations after the first movie but this was surprisingly bad. There was no point in this movie that I was scared or even felt suspense. The most I got out of this movie was a few laughs at just how horrible it was. I highly recommend not ever watching this movie unless you enjoy corny and predictable movies/acting."
"hunter-friesen","6","76","120","15 September 2019"," ""It Chapter Two"": Too Long for Too Little
","In 1913, Henry Ford introduced the assembly line to the Ford Motor Company. He made a ton of money and was hailed as a leading innovator. Now just a hundred years later, director Andy Musciehtti brings that same assembly line principle to It Chapter Two as he serves up his scary products in the exact fashion as the one before.<br/><br/>This sequel to the highest-grossing horror movie of all time (unadjusted) takes place 27 years later in the same town of Derry, Maine. The rambunctious kids are all adults now and have gone on their separate paths to some form of success. Unfortunately, the good fortune for each is put to an end by the return of Pennywise, who seeks more victims for his twisted games. Being the only ones that have stopped the evil force, the adults must come together again to put an end to this bloody mess.<br/><br/>Director Andy Muschietti returns behind the camera after the record-breaking success he earned from 2017's ""It"". For the second time around, Muschietti goes even bigger and bolder than before, both in terms of the horror set pieces and the length.<br/><br/>When it comes to giving audiences what they came to see, Muschietti delivers on adding even more blood, gore, and creepiness. Pennywise's indescribable powers get even more creative as his prey are stalked and slaughtered with unnerving brutality.<br/><br/>The biggest fault that plagued the previous film was its recycling of cheap jump scares that were meant to artificially hold your attention. That same problem is even more glaring in the sequel as any scary moments are just startling moments where something pops out at the screen. The more they happen, the more predictable and boring they are to watch.<br/><br/>A runtime is never indicative of quality by itself, every movie should earn its length through skill and craftsmanship. And at 170 minutes, ""It Chapter Two"" falls way short of earning its record-breaking runtime. Instead of the horror being a slow burn, it's more of a slow churn as the recycled jump scares quickly lose their minuscule luster and make this already long film feel even longer.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Gary Dauberman takes up the impossible task of adapting Stephen King, a challenge that has killed the careers of countless adapters before him.<br/><br/>Dauberman tries his best to break away from the ridiculousness within King's novel, but his efforts end up backfiring on him and make the film even more awkward as some elements are left in and some left out. The story wants you to take it pretty seriously, but keeping in the weird elements make that almost an impossible task.<br/><br/>Muschietti didn't do much to justify the excessive length, but Dauberman should shoulder more of the blame with his uneven pacing. The film starts great with the together and playing off each other with a fun and brisk pace. Then, against all logic, Dauberman has them split up for ninety minutes, severely slowing things to a crawl and forcing the jump scares to keep you awake.<br/><br/>The highest regards should go to casting director Rich Delia as he has brilliantly put together a group of adult actors that uncannily look like their younger counterparts. Unfortunately, good looks are the only quality some actors possess here.<br/><br/>James McAvoy does fine as Bill. The most evident acting trait he shows off is his struggle to hide his Scottish accent with a less than convincing New England one.<br/><br/>Having a rocky 2019, to say the least, Jessica Chastain follows up the bomb that was ""Dark Phoenix"" with another subpar performance. She doesn't shine as brightly as Sophia Lillis' younger Beverly despite being the more acclaimed actress with a lot more screen time.<br/><br/>The standout performances come from the two Bills in the cast, Hader and Skarsg책rd. Hader plays adult Richie and fairs the best in the cast at toeing the line between drama and comedy.<br/><br/>Skarsg책rd as Pennywise is a sight to see but unfortunately doesn't get seen for long stretches. Between him and Heath Ledger's Joker, future performances for clowns now have an insanely high bar to reach.<br/><br/>With over five hours of material between two films, the ""It"" series has come to a less than satisfying close with ""It Chapter Two"". There are some things to admire Muschietti and co. for doing or trying to do. But for every great Bill Skarsg책rd moment (which is all of them), there were just as many moments of wasted potential due to unoriginal filmmaking. Overall, between its highs and lows, ""It Chapter Two"" makes for a semi-enjoyable time. Just make sure to bring a seat cushion."
"psycadelix","1","101","163","7 September 2019"," How could they get it so wrong?! Gutted.
","Anyone who's read the book will find this an abomination. Anyone expecting a horror film, it isn't. I enjoyed the first, it had suspense, Pennywise had his dark, crazy moments, just the way he would stare for a second or 2 had a creepy factor. This has nothing, NOTHING. When a supposed horror film has the people laughing at 90% of what's going on, they've done it massively wrong. They tried to make IT a comedy!. I know a lot who haven't seen it yet will find that hard to believe, but it's true. There are so many ""comedy"" 1 liners thrown in at times when a normal person just wouldn't react that way, it's unbelievable. The CGI is terrible, real bad and they use it for 95% of everything going on. It doesn't follow its own certain rules that it sets down in parts. Many, MANY of the things wrong with this film I won't say due to spoilers.
SPOILER FREE about the end. If you thought it couldn't get anymore ridiculous than what you know from previous, well...you'll see.
The acting was decent, that's the 1 star.
IT is the only book I've read twice and enjoyed just as much the second time round as the first and everyone knows how big the book is. I'm gonna read it again to try and rid the memory of this terrible, terrible vision.

"mjjenkins-40538","10","447","775","4 September 2019"," I think some maybe even most people are treating this as if it were a straight up sequel when they really shouldn't.
","Although Stephen King's IT novel is more of back and forth from adult to kid and back and forth from adult to kid and so on, IT : Chapter 2 should be looked at like it's the 2nd half of one big story, which is exactly what it is rather than a sequel. It's really not a sequel. Just like the 2nd half or ""adult half"" of the 1990 TV Miniseries/movie is not a sequel, it's just the 2nd half of one big story/movie. Let's face it, unless they're the Godfather Part 2, Aliens, Terminator 2 : Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, The Empire Strikes Back, and maybe a couple of other big time hit sequels, the sequel almost always gets hated on, critiqued to death, disregarded as ""unoriginal"", ""same old same old"", ""not very creative"", treated like the ""intruder"", etc etc....it's the same for 90% of remakes..but people need to realize and understand that IT : Chapter 2 is not a sequel and that IT : Chapter 1 and IT : Chapter aren't remakes to the 1990 TV minseries/movie either.<br/><br/>Secondly, almost every negative review on Rotten Tomatoes or YouTube or on the Internet somewhere (and I'm pretty sure they'll make their way onto here sooner or later as well) have complaints about the runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes and that it's ""too long"" and blah blah blah. I don't see how you can make this whole story put to film not be at least 5+ hours long (Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 combined)..at the VERY least. The novel is over 1,100 pages long ! 1,138 pages to be exact. ""IT"" should have been a 10-15 1 hour episode series on Netflix to be done properly, to be honest..but if you go the cinema route with it (and they did, obviously), between Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, it has to be, at the very least, 5 hours or so if the Director or Writers want to be even remotely faithful to King's novel and make fans of King and the novel at least somewhat satisfied. And you also have 7 protagonists..SEVEN..6 of which are main protagonists. That's A LOT character developing and character story arcs that have to be told and take place unless you want a lazily and poorly directed and written film with terrible story telling and bad or no/next to no character development.<br/><br/>This film delivers great character development and great character and story arcs for all of the main protagonists/characters of the film. This film is really entertaining overall. There are pacing issues but those really seem minor when you step back and look at this film as a whole. This film was really good on it's own and holds up very well on it's own. Yes, it relied on Chapter 1 some, obviously, because Chapter 1 is part of the overall story (Again, it's NOT a sequel. I'm really talking about how well Chapter 2 is made when saying ""it's really good on it's own) but when you put Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 together and make it one big story/film like it should be, it's AWESOME. Pennywise is also at his most serious and gruesome in this one. This one doesn't cut away just as someone or a helpless kid is about to get bitten or eaten until after you see and hear plenty enough, if you know what I mean. More gore in this one. It definitely earns every bit of it's R rating. Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain, Bill Skarsgard, and James Mcavoy are excellent, especially Hader and Skarsgard. Nobody was bad though..everyone was, at least, good. The CGI was also much better in this one..of course it would be though because it had a much bigger budget to work with than Chapter 1 did.<br/><br/>My biggest con..and it's the same as my biggest con for Chapter 1. Too many ill timed funny jokes. 2 or 3 jokes when it's the right time for them are great and it works. It lightens things up even if just for a few seconds and during the RIGHT times. And this film has a few well timed funny moments as well, don't get me wrong. But the funny/comedy/jokes at the wrong times, especially in a horror movie, just suck, to put it simply. It ruins scenes especially scenes that are supposed to be or should be horrifying and terrifying and scary and making you nervous and tense and scared and such. And unfortunately, this film has those ill timed/placed jokes as well.<br/><br/>Overall though, this film is great..especially when you look at as whole with Chapter 1."

","""Omg the cast is just so perfect"" isn't grounds to call this a good movie. The casting is indeed spot on and most of the actors (adults and kids alike) are great, but not even the best actors in the world can save an uncompelling story such as this one.<br/><br/>Most of the 2hr 50min runtime is the EXACT same movie as the first chapter, except this time the jump scares come even cheaper. It gets old very quickly. Trim it about...hmm...an hour and a half and then we may have something.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing about It: Chapter Two is the way it so carelessly handles both the origins of Pennywise (including the way to actually defeating him) and the deeper themes and challenges of these characters. There was so much potential for emotional depth in this story, instead that was traded for the same sort of anthology type structure of the first film that, as stated before, overly relied on cheap scares. Ironically, this movie isn't scary at all because of that.<br/><br/>Despite the length, this chapter added next to nothing to the original story. Go for performances and funny character moments.

The casting choice is the best I've ever seen, especially with Bill Hader as Richie, Finn Wolfhard in the first movie was the highlight for Chapter One and this time Bill Hader is the highlight for Chapter Two. The final confrontation is amazing, I was not disappointed with it at all, the giant spider from the original TV miniseries as a huge disappointment but the monster for this film is AMAZING. Going to be honest, I am interested to see if there will ever be an IT Chapter Three movie, if there ever will be one, I hope is an origin movie for Pennywise and maybe we can get a scene with the Turtle fighting IT."

The rest of the cast are equally poor and the script apart from the occasional one liner from Bill Hader is dreadful. The CGI 10 foot naked granny was an abomination and not in a good way. The hastily put together flash back scenes (clearly shot after the original movie) with clear CGI on the kids who have now of course aged, was rubbery and tough to look at. The long drawn out ending was completely over the top and self serving. I mean we have only known these characters from one movie but the last 20 minutes was rolled out as if we had a huge emotional development toward each one of them. Every ""scare"" was more ridiculous than the last. The scene in the Chinese restaurant at the start with the half baby spider coming out of the fortune cooking was embarrassing. Within 10 minutes you can tell how awful this movie is going to be and it doesn't get any better. If they somehow pull a 3rd movie out of this, which I assume will be based 54 years ago, then they need to change each and every member of the crew that worked on this utter shambles of a film. The one mark I have given is A. because I can't score it a zero and B. For the occasional chuckle at a Bill Hader joke."
"theterminator-92378","9","120","214","7 September 2019"," A worthy follow up to the 2017 film while expanding the story of the losers club
","What to say about IT Chapter 2 that have not been said this movie is just incredible Stephen King movies have been on the rise in recent years and this one and the 2017 original have been the best that have been adapted to screen and while chapter 2 may be the follow up it expands apon the original movie while also being able to tell the story of the adult losers and ends what is the best of the stephen king stories.
the story of the losers takes place 27 years after the original story where the losers are brought together to fight IT and the build up that sees how the losers have aged and while Stanley takes his own life in order for the losers to kill IT and i think that in a way this motivated the losers to do what they have been waiting 27 years for there fight against the thing that has been tormenting Derry for so many years. Another part that was very well used was the parts showing the young losers club and the parts imbetween moments from the original with digital de aging of the losers who have since grown up in real life and they have some great moments where they develop the story of the group and what they have been through and why they are such great friends and the scenes in the club house where they have parts that go from the young to the older losers and it's really my favorite parts of the transition between young and old.
The cast is incredible with Jessica Chastain {Beverly Marsh} James McAvoy { Bill Denbrough} Bill Hader {Richie Tozier} Isaiah Mustafa {Mike Hanlon} Jay Ryan {Ben Hanscom} James Ransone {Eddie Kaspbrak} Andy Bean {Stanley Uris} and Bill Skarsg책rd {Pennywise} with the returning young cast of Finn Wolfhard, Jack Dylan Grazer, Sophia Lillis, Chosen Jacobs, Wyatt Oleff, Jaeden Martell, Jeremy Ray Taylor and Nicholas Hamilton they reprise there roles from the 2017 IT and it is great to see the young cast back it breathes fresh life into the story and feels much like the book in the sense that it cuts betwen the POV of the young losers and then on to the older ones.
It Chapter 2 was incredible it completed the IT story while also being able to make us want to rewatch the orginal IT after seeing this to get a fresh prospective on the kids stories i love this movie and it shows how hard that they work to bring to life this king story and really is such a blast"
"aaron-203-411674","4","57","96","5 September 2019"," Couldn't wait for IT to end!
","Hugely disappointing! I loved the first movie a lot and was so exited to see this, but half way through we were close to walking out; and a few moments later another group did. I'm sure all those giving it high scores must be huge Stephen King fans that can't ever admit to disliking one of his adaptions.<br/><br/>What I hated the most was how loud and obnoxious some of the adult characters were. I get that they are trying to bring out the characters their young actors portrayed in the first movie but in the real world children grow up and mature. Children acting like children can be endearing, adults acting like loud annoying children is, well, annoying. The characters did become more tolerable in the second half of the movie as their personalities begun to mellow a little.<br/><br/>Watching the second half was more like a seeing rehash of the first movie. I felt like I was sitting through it all again when watching the house and some of the cave scenes. I'm not sure how the book went, so perhaps they were trying to keep it true to the book, but I felt like they needed to change the setting for the second half of the movie so it didn't feel like a repeat.<br/><br/>There was lots of other things that bugged me about this movie, don't get me started on how a guy can be stabbed deep with a blade to the cheek and moments later be patched up and talking like nothing has happened. Not to mention how he survives so long having been impaled by a giant claw and is still able to crack a joke. The flash back scenes with the kids were probably the only shining moments of the film, but even some of those fell a little flat for me. It's rare I score a movie under 5 or 6, unless I really disliked it. Sadly this is one of those movies.<br/><br/>I would like to note, there were definitely some very confronting scenes in the movie where they didn't hold back. The bashing of the gay men at the beginning was extremely brutal, I mean you can hear the bones in his face smash as he gets repeatedly punched and kicked. The domestic violence scene where a women gets punched by her partner was also confronting, though makeup did extremely well with hiding any bruising to her face *roll eyes* There is also a scene that strongly suggested that child molestation was about to take place. All the above scenes is enough reason to not let young children or even young teenage kids see this movie. However that didn't stop some parents from taking their 12-15 year olds to see it at my local cinema."

","Simply put it's too long, and even then does not have enough time to do justice to the story. Long horror films can, and do work - The Shining being a great example, with plenty of time devoted to character and creating an unsettling atmosphere. Here though with so many characters, and so much backstory, everything gets abbreviated down into a short flashback, followed by a series of jumpscares. Now this might just work for a regular 90 minutes, but for something almost twice that length it just becomes tediously repetitive. Then with the film concentrating on the scares there is even less time for the very capable cast to do something with the flimsy material. In a good horror there should be a quite tension, broken only by the gasp or well placed chuckle, to break the tendiont. Today there was more an air of boredom."

It's not scary when you do the same thing repeatedly, you expect it to happen. Then there is a surprising amount of comedy in this movie. Frankly too much. It completely kills the tone of the scene when you are switching from horror to comedy in the same scene.

It was updated, fresh and focused a lot on the characters and their relationships. Fabulous! Maybe a tad too much cheap CGI, but not overkill.<br/><br/>Part 2, has just seemed to lose it's way. The opening was actually quite good...and dark which is what i was hoping for (i won't mention what happens in case you decide to watch it) But then as the film progressed i felt like i was watching a comedy? a comedy with cheap jump scares and absolutely no character focus or development. I genuinely did not care about any of the adult characters, at all. For some reason Muschietti seems to be more focused on (really bad) CGI jump scares than the authenticity or the development of the characters. At least in Tommy Lee Wallace's original starring Tim Curry, props and costumes were used rather than this cheap, non scary effects. When a film is filled with CGI it loses it's realism and i lose interest. It's like, they couldn't be bothered to make the effort to scare it's audience and a lack of effort really shows in this film.<br/><br/>I will usually see a film through to the end but i has to turn this off. I was so bored and after 2 hours of bad effects and boring characters, i didn't want to waste any more of my time.<br/><br/>Disappointed and gutted as there was mass potential to be scary."

Boring.<br/><br/>It felt like a disjointed connect the dots thing like ""lets see what happens to this person next, now this person, oh big surprise its something relating to their childhood phobia"" like some sort of kids book.<br/><br/>Also, there were so many rip off references not to just to other Stephen King movies (not even counting his cameo as the shop owner) and ripping off a scene from The Visit from M Night Sham. It was not cute. And there were too many references to the book having a bad ending while still having a bad ending.<br/><br/>Major plot holes, not going to give them away, you'll figure it out. It was like there were 5 different endings that were all equally cheesy with unbearable dialogue and outcomes.<br/><br/>Cannot stress enough that nothing was scary. I temporarily suspended my prediction filter to try and be jump scared but it didn't work. I wanted to be jump scared, or scared, I really did.

We eagerly awaited IT 2 for well over a year, expecting a sequel that would be on par with the first part, and we were grossly disappointed. Yet another example of Hollywood catering to the lowest common denominator with graphics and gratuitous violence, instead of producing a good story, which the story of 'It' really is. Very, very surprised that Stephen King himself agreed to be in a cameo for this terrible rendition of his novel. In the end, I guess it's all about $$$$ in mainstream filmmaking, which is sad. I hope that sooner rather than later, Hollywood will finally catch on to the fact that intelligent people - people with $ to spend, you know - go to the movies for quality filmmaking, not for CGI garbage.

The one big thumbs up is towards the casting which honestly saved me from walking out of the theatre. The whole movie was a disappointment and a bit of a let down to the book.

"Amthermandes","9","15","23","6 September 2019"," Pennywise isn't freakin' kidding.
","It: Chapter 2 was almost everything I wanted it to be. Almost.<br/><br/>The sequel feels like a direct continuation of the first part, only slightly amped up with more scares and intensity. There were some let-downs however, so I'll start with those:<br/><br/>-Yes, it's long, but it didn't really feel like it until they started wrapping things up at the end.
-There was also too much use of CGI, albeit there being some really awesome, scenes with it (like, for example, a brilliant reference to a certain John Carpenter classic... ""Trick r' Treat"" anyone?).
-More scares indeed, but some felt either too forced or predictable.
-There was a bit too much profanity, which isn't something I'd normally criticize, but much of it felt too unnecessary.
-As far as I could tell, there weren't any, or as many, ""subtle scares"" as the first one.<br/><br/>Aside from these nit-picks, the movie does not disappoint. It dives more into the emotional attachment the characters have to each other, and to It. Unlike the classic 90's version, it also explains more of It's origins. Not only does it follow the first part well, it also uses plot elements and themes in the book, and twists it into something new. So it's so much like the book, yet, it's not, and in a satisfying manner. And while a few scares may be a tad flat, it's still quite intense. And yet, like the first part as well, manages to maintain a balance of horror and comedy. It's more brutal than the first, and just about as fun. It was relieving to find the way they ended it all in the movie was handled VERY well, considering how strange and cerebral it was in the book (don't look into the light!!!).<br/><br/>And if you heard, or read, any rumors about it possibly being the ""bloodiest film of all time,"" don't get your hopes up. It does have its moments, but it's nowhere near ""Evil Dead"" or ""Dead Alive."" Or even ""A Nightmare on Elm Street.""<br/><br/>""It"" started well, and ended well.

I understand that a book and a movie are different ways to tell stories and to perceive them. But this movie just added things over and over again, which made the plot poor and unplanned. We couldn't see any real character development and that made me do not understand their decisions.

","I cannot believe this movie is currently sitting at above 7/10. It was not bad but awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I created this account just to write this review. But, where to begin?<br/><br/><ul><li>Character Development: I liked the first one. What I think made it special was the character dynamic. In this movie, you have the ""same"" characters, as in, the characters in adulthood; however, the problem is it's not the same characters and you never build a relationship with any of them. This would have been possible if there was an attempt at character development, but it seems the writers were ok with just going, yep, it's the kids you loved all grown up! Enjoy. I didn't.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not scary/chilling/dark: With the exception of Bev going home and the short interaction with the older woman, this movie was not even remotely scary, chilling or dark. The CGI was silly, as is so often the case. The jump scares certainly didn't make me jump, however cheap they may have been.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not funny: There are a few clever parts. Some witty one liners, but nothing particularly funny, despite all the pathetic and constant attempts at humor.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Indian Ritual: So, Mike has this idea that everything is tied to this ancient indian ritual and they have to perform it in order to kill IT...or something. So, we lose about an hour or more of the characters exploring the demons of their childhood gathering what can only be called ""horcruxes,"" only for them to be totally ineffectual. I guess this is supposed to be where the characters are developed, but the focus is more on jump scares and other nonsense. No real development takes place.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bowers: I haven't seen any discussion of this, but what in the world is going on with Bowers? Is he possessed, just pure evil, why did he turn out this way? This is never ever touched on. It's just so strange. Also, why is he even in the movie? What purpose does he serve? Perhaps worst of all, a convicted murderer (Bowers) escapes from an asylum after murdering a guard and no one seems to care. No cops, no reports, it's not even addressed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Length - Wow. Long. 2 hours and 50 whole minutes. And let me tell you, it feels like it. Honestly, if this were 1.5 hours I probably wouldn't be writing this review. A kooky clown movie doesn't need to be three hours long.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>""The Losers"" aren't Losers: With the exception of Mike, and even then it's debatable, the Losers aren't really losers. They're all somewhat successful, good looking and ostensibly well-adjusted. Part of the appeal of the first was these rejects getting revenge and working together to fight against this wicked evil force. Totally lacking in Chapter 2.</li></ul><br/><br/>I'm sure there's more but that's really all I can think of. Some people have said you shouldn't give this one star if you haven't read the book. However, the movie should be able to stand alone. It's obviously not written exclusively for the people who have read this insanely long book. And, if it is so much like the book, then I can say with the confidence the book blows, just like the movie."

I felt there was a zombie for literally every character, when it should've only been for Eddie, maybe even Mike.

A lot of time is wasted on pointless drama, reminiscing about the past and soul searching to a point that by the time the interesting part starts, I have already lost all interest in the plot.<br/><br/>Despite following a source material, the entire film feels forced and pointlessly long. The film does have good acting and some hillarious laugh out loud moments but it all gets lost in the excessive talking, thinking and building up for cheap scares. I could not wait for the movie to end and that doesn't normally happen when I go to the cinema."

In the second part of the film, one of the Losers Club, calls them back to Derry to end Pennywise, once and for all.

Pennywise maybe had only 4 Scenes in Real, and the rest is a CGI Animation.

This Clown looks like a Middle Age Harlequin Knock off, and not like a Clown you could see in Circus.
And this makes the Movie also less terrifying.<br/><br/>In the 90s mini Series, ""IT"" was so horrible due to the Fact that he looked like a Clown! He looked like Beepo the Clown in my Hometown Circus and that makes it so horrible. If you would meet a Clown like IT in the Remake, do you would think it is a funny Clown?

"thesandfly77","8","18","30","8 September 2019"," IT Evolution
","33 years I've waited...<br/><br/>..Since reading the book in 1986, then again twice over the decades.<br/><br/>The 1990 miniseries was kitschy treat, making an icon of Tim Curry's Pennywise and introducing stubborn non-reading retards to a slice of the wondrous freaked-out cosmic horror hidden within the novel's 1100 pages; at school I was failed in a term exam for an essay on IT by a teacher who labelled it 'Satanic drivel', yet professed to never having read it :)) Yes, the world's full of them...<br/><br/>2017 IT was a surprise - a realy great surprise as it delivered sometihng akin but deliciously different to the original adaption. Trouble was...<br/><br/>They created a monster all over again. In this age of connectivity, IT - Pennywise - became a juggernaut of cultural reference, almost ubiquitous in everyday lives, instantly recognisable to multi-millions of consumers however invested in the actual story they were. He was the original killer clown and he had returned to take over the world.<br/><br/>So how the hell do you conjour a second part to the tale, remaining faithful to the source material and somehow incorporate this all-pervading pop-culture icon without it becoming a blandishment of clown-memes?<br/><br/>Well, they certainly went for an angle, and I commend the reach - further than I thought they would go but not as far as I would have liked.<br/><br/>Pennywise was never going to have the same chiller-killer impact of 2017 so the move towards lashings of dark humour infused with the shlock-horror was a brave one and very meta - recognising the part that clown has come to play in the consumer psyche.<br/><br/>So we get something that echoes the original Evil Dead series for sardonic black comedy and still manages to hold together the book's struggle of mere humans battling cosmic evil.<br/><br/>Most admirably, they managed to make it entertaining over the 3-hour run-time.
Pennywise gets a slew of great moments and each adult actor is given the chance to inhabit the grown-up Loser to the best of their abilities; and note that they all do a splendid job.<br/><br/>The effects are absolutely fine - lol at the facebook-smart intellectuals who parrot the 'poor CGI' line; you gotta ask why none of those creative geniuses didn't step in and offer their services to save the day. They'll be sat on the couch with the 'look at me, I'm not scared' crew when the DVD comes out.<br/><br/>Some people just don't get it, or IT...<br/><br/>The dread of IT was always beyond impactful first-level boogeyman frights - as soon as the book opened up the exposition into realms of ancient inter-dimensional cosmic horror I was blown away. Stephen King, brilliantly drug-addled, took us on a trip into primeval darkness, from the unsettling events in a small American town to the abyssal terrors of the universe itself. The reach was epic and they made a grab for that here too, almost fulfilling the wishes of many who wanted the deep lore, the trippy light-fantastic backstory revelations of the novel.<br/><br/>So very nearly, but this cultural monster had to deliver at the box-office, had to sate the demands of the casual jump-scare popcorn junkie and so the compromise was reached; entertaining, chilling, sentimental and twisted, comedic and vicious, with a shot of lore to add some depth.<br/><br/>They managed to keep a lot of the plates spinning and deserve praise for never allowing the span of the film to lapse into dreary segments of character development or predictability - there's always something round the corner, even if you're expecting it, you're still guessing it. I though the pacing was excellent for the most part.<br/><br/>Ultimately, you can criticise IT chapter 2 for its level of personal-expectation fulfillment - e.g was the end true-form reveal a cop-out, a compromise or a clever concept? - but you can't criticise the crew's commitment to doing a classic book and cultural phenomenon justice over what is a sprawling but consistent and worthwhile epic movie.<br/><br/>Thank you, Andy et al, I very much enjoyed your celluloid realisation of decades of wonder."

"morrison-dylan-fan","6","58","114","4 September 2019"," IT:The Dud Chapter.
","Having found the first IT (2017-also reviewed) to be fantastic when I caught it on disc,I was happy when a friend told me a IT double bill was taking place at cinema. Finding the first to be even better than I remembered,I got set for the second chapter.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>The lone person to return from the writers club of part one, the loss of Chase Palmer and Cary Joji Fukunaga is one greatly felt in Gary Dauberman's adaptation of the second half of the novel,, where once each member of the Losers Club was given a progression in their character arc of defeating their fears and a growth in maturity, is here replaced by Dauberman with keeping them all largely in one place, (with only Richie being given the sliver of change.)This is most notable in the poor writing treatment of Beverly,whose suffering of parental/spouse abuse is revealed to leave her with deep scars, none of which leads to a cathartic release that the films had appeared to be building towards.<br/><br/>
Staying true to the opening of the adult time-line in the novel with a horrific homophobic attack from thugs, Dauberman begins a recurrent theme of presenting what should be major events in the Losers Clubs lives,only to leave them hanging,from the opening attack, to Bill trying to save a child who gets killed by Pennywise, leading to Bill crying for five minutes, only to completely move on and no hint of the psychological effect it has had on him being offered. Bringing a new Comedy element into the tale, for the first hour Dauberman actually makes it work, via the sarcastic jokes they share actually establishing the bonds the adult Losers Club share, which builds to a Chinese meal reunion set-piece (the highlight of the film) that balances laughs with Pennywise shocks.<br/><br/>Digging ""going underground"" (both physical & mentally) as being the main theme of the title, Dauberman shovels up the suppressed memories of the Losers Club,and buries the film. Going into long individual flashbacks,Dauberman takes them to a repetitive dead-end,due to Pennywise clearly not being a threat in the sequences due to it being flashbacks,and all of them going round in circles which instead of adding depth to the characters, lands on miss-placed gags.<br/><br/>Running a gag across the film that people hate the ending,Dauberman ends the adult time line in the Losers Club epic fight on a hollow note, because of a failure by Dauberman to build arcs underground, but incredibly,at the last minute finds the spirit of the first IT,and delivers a touchingly poetic quality to the fading childhood days of the Losers Club.<br/><br/>Craning down to the Losers Club on their bikes, returning director Andy Muschietti displays in his close working with cinematographer Checco Varese, (replacing Chan-wook Park's regular cinematographer, the far superior Chung-hoon Chung,who did IT 1) a striking skilfulness in capturing a fading memory of childhood summer days atmosphere, spinning on long crane/panning shots of the Loser Club kids cycling down the sun-lit streets of Derry.<br/><br/>Continuing a motif first drawn in Mama, (2013-also reviewed) Muschietti links the chapters with excellent, highly-stylised transition shots/ overlapping images,turning the pages to the unresolved childhood traumas overlapping in the adult lives of the Losers Club,and in the two stand-out jump-scares, (in a house of mirrors and at a sports game) Muschietti offers a glimpse of using shadows in making Pennywise an imposing figure.<br/><br/>Making a drastic change from the first, Muschietti places most of the jump-scares to take place in daylight,which without the aide of the gloomy lighting from part 1, in the cold light of day look shockingly poor, amateur hour,flat CGI creations. Going underground for the final, Muschietti and Varesecharge at the End of Level Boss the films have been building towards, and ruins it all by covering the entire 40 minute set-piece in strobe lighting which jabs the viewer in the eyes,and makes it almost un-watchable.<br/><br/>When not masked in a overload of naff CGI, Bill Skarsgård makes a chilling return as the animalistic Pennywise, whilst Bill Hader gives the stand out performance in the Losers Club as Richie,thanks to Hader using his comedic skill of giving out dead-pan one-liners,to actually build a character arc for Richie,with Hader capturing Richie's gradual fear that they are all about to write their final chapter in life."

"The-Sarkologist","3","10","15","9 September 2019"," So Long, so flat
","Honestly, this movie was just ultimately boring. Personally, I'd probably leave it at that, and also, in a way, I feel that I have certainly been dragging my feet when it came to writing this review (though a part also has to do with a lot of other work that I have had to do as well). Mind you, it isn't as if the sequal was unplanned when the first movie was released - for those who are familiar with the story would have known that the movie actually would need to take up two parts, and this is the second part is where the heroes of the first movie return as adults.<br/><br/>The story goes that most of them have left Derry and made their way in the world, some of them in good positions, others of them not so good. However, one of them has remained, just to keep his ear to the ground, and to see if Pennywise decides to return, as he suspects he would namely because there was a consensus that they didn't quite beat him as kids. Not surprisingly, twenty-seven years later, the reports start to emerge that Pennywise has indeed returned.
One interesting thing is that one of the guys has become a successful author (and in fact it seems that they have all gone out to become quite successful, another one of those rather annoying tropes that seems to appear throughout Hollywood films, though to be fair, the original novel also had then quite successful as well). Well, the thing is that even though he is successful he simply does not know how to write an ending. Mind you, I do sort of wonder whether it is actually possible for an author to be able to become successful it the author can't write an ending - I thought that was a necessity when it came to penning good literature.<br/><br/>Yet, the thing was that with the original film, we all absolutely loved it, but when the ending came along, we pretty much all rolled our eyes and cried out 'we waited four hours for THAT!'. Actually, some of King's best works are pretty awesome books, but have pretty abominable endings (such as The Stand). So, it turned out that they decided to try a make the ending of this film somewhat more engaging.<br/><br/>I'd have to say it did work. I did actually appreciate Pennywise's true form much, much better than the original, though it does seem to suggest that we aren't really all that sure as to what is actually his true form. Remember, Pennywise is a master of illusion, and that is the theme that is constantly running through the film. We never quite know what is real, or what is not real. Still, the thing was that this film simply did not seem to be anywhere near as thrilling as the original - Pennywise was so much scarier in that one.<br/><br/>Yeah, I had to admit that I really, really wasn't all that impressed. In fact it certainly did feel as if this film was a complete and utter waste of almost three hours, though I do have to admit that the ending to this one was a little better, even though we never truly found out what Pennywise was, beyond an alien that is - that was something that was pretty clear.<br/><br/>Oh, the other thing that really annoyed me with this film - there were so many cut scenes back to the first film. In fact the number of cut scenes really did feel as if the producers suspected that most people wouldn't remember the first film, so decided to rehash some of the scenes from that. Granted, that was the case with me, but honestly, I'm not all that sure if it was really all that necessary. In fact, it was these cut scenes that really did make me feel as if the film was overtly long, and as soon as I realised what was happening, my immediately thought was 'I've already seen this!'. Then again, I also suspect that without the cut scenes, we might not have quite realised what was going on, especially if we hadn't seen the first one for quite a while, and would have simply been confused, and scratching out head. I guess you can't have it either way."

That illustrates how the sequel of the remake ""IT"" felt to me.<br/><br/>Look at the character of Bowers, for example. I thought he died in the last movie. Why is he in this movie? To create more jumpscares? Usually, with characters like him, he would be what we call ""plot device"". He was a... what, scare device?<br/><br/>The scene with the little girl being eaten?

The sequence of events throughout this movie is very haphazard - especially in the beginning.

","Returning to their home-town, the now-adult group of friends finds they've been gathered to fulfill the childhood promise that the killer clown Pennywise has returned and is on the loose in the town, forcing them to put aside their past traumas to defeat the malevolent being once and for all.<br/><br/>This was a woefully underwhelming and overblown effort. Among its many flaws is the most obvious issue in that there's just no reason for the running time to last this long at all. So much of this one could've been cut down or outright removed, from the introduction of the gang one-by-one to see where their lives are like now that goes into plenty of detail that could've been accomplished easier, to the incidents in the asylum tormenting the residents inside or just the seemingly endless scenes depicting the escaped inmate under the clown's influence. That these are done in conjunction with utterly boring flashbacks and storytelling that shows how they used to be as kids that just go on forever, serve no purpose to the storyline at all and just seem to focus on seemingly random incidents that just plain dull to get through. It highlights the fact that the main clown does absolutely nothing here with so little screen-time as we're focusing on the kids' flashbacks interacting with the clown or building the romance angle instead of in modern times. The other factor to lower this one are the entirely overblown scare attempts that fall completely flat. The CGI here manages to undo so much of the attempts that the scenes of the food coming to life in the Chinese restaurant is laughably inept with the black pool looking like a deformed blob-like mess that's incredibly cheesy looking and makes no sense in the storyline how that works, much less comes off like any other expected outcome from the very start. Likewise, flashbacks to show the kids interacting with Pennywise, featuring the confrontation in the apartment, the statue coming to life in the park or the appearance from the sewer grate are all laughably bad and underwhelming with how crude they are. It's pretty disheartening to see so much wasted time in a film this long feature so little chances for something to happen and then showcase such underwhelming and laughably bad work when they do appear, really undermining this one and making for a troublesome effort. There are only a few select aspects that work here. Despite generally being underwhelming, the encounter with the kid in the hall-of-mirrors at the carnival stands out as a wholly enjoyable and solid enough effort that works off the darkness of the setting, the overall creepiness of the concept in general and stellar practical effects that are usually missing from these other scenes. As well, the spirit of unity and brotherhood that they display in the finale when they band together to take on the true form of the creature in the underground sewer lair of Pennywise which is not only a great idea to see play out but has some energetic albeit comically over-the-top action that at least puts some life into things. Combined with the creepiness of the main clown and the ability to kill off kids with graphic results, these are all that work for this one.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, underage smoking and continuous violence against children."

First, there was no story, no character development, no lessons to be learned. Zero. And if a movie doesn't have a story it's just a bunch of cheap scenes plastered together with no purpose or connection.
Second, the ""movie"" had a huge problem with the tone. Was it supposed to actually be a parody, is that the reason everyone next to me in the movie theater was laughing? I also laughed at how bad it was. Cheap, overrecycled jokes, repeated till they were annoying the crap out of everyone, horrendous CGI monsters, by the look of it designed by 3rd graders, ridiculous and extremely overused jumpscares, which were not creepy, not scary, just poorly executed. I believe the purpose of the ""scares"" was actually torture for the viewer. Maybe it's a new trend in Hollywood, ""horror"" is actually the feeling of waiting till the damn movie is over so you can do literally anything else with your life afterwards.
Lastly, this piece of crap has absolutely nothing to do with the book. Dear book lovers, please be warned, stay away from this disaster or you will feel insulted. In fact dear everyone, do yourself a favour and pick anything else, you too will feel insulted even if you've never read the novel. This movie will suck the life out of you and all you will want, is to find the closest exit door, run and erase the stupid existance of this movie out of your mind and soul."

The plot arc of this movie is just dumb it could have been written and handled much better. The screenplay is clicheic, predictable and uninteresting. The acting is average but with a screenplay like that it can't be any better. The scariness and mystic of the first movie is gone, except for a few good jump scares and creepy moments. The only few positives about the movie was Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise performance which was as excellent as it was in the first movie and the adult casting of the looser's club in regards to similarity in their looks with their younger counterparts.

"MrDHWong","9","49","98","5 September 2019"," A solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work
","IT Chapter Two is the sequel to the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel of the same name. Starring Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Isaiah Mustafa, and Bill Skarsgård, it is a solid follow-up to the original that continues the streak of excellent adaptations of King's work.<br/><br/>Twenty-seven years after the events of Chapter One, the Loser's Club have all grown up and left the town of Derry, Maine, with the sole exception of Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), who chose to remain as the town librarian. One night, Mike realises to his horror that IT has returned and has resumed feeding on scared children. Before IT can claim more victims, Mike calls up his childhood friends one by one to reunite them and fulfill the vow they took when they were younger to destroy IT permanently.<br/><br/>Much like its predecessor, IT Chapter Two relies on scaring the audience through building up a creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and inner torment within the main characters, rather than with typical jumpscares. In spite of that, this film was considerably more drama heavy with less horror elements, likely due to the previous film featuring children a great deal more and the protagonists now being mature adults. The grown-up Loser's Club cast in this film each do a fantastic job mirroring their child counterparts. All of them bring their own uniqueness to their characters, with Bill Hader standing out the most as the grown up Richie, who injects some much needed comic relief into some of the film's more dramatic moments. However, once again, it is Bill Skarsgård as IT, in particularly his clown form Pennywise, who is truly terrifying as a supernatural force to be reckoned with. Despite the 170 minute runtime, the film is never boring and is brilliantly paced and edited thanks to the creative direction of Andy Muschietti. This really does feels like the conclusion to what could be considered the ultimate Stephen King adaptation, complete with all of the usual tropes and even some surprising references to his other work. With that said, IT Chapter Two is certainly worth watching, provided Chapter One has been viewed first of course.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

I think that this movie might have even broken a record for most amount of blood used in a horror movie.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgard did an amazing job portraying Pennywise. He was completely invested in his character. I enjoyed his performance much better in this movie than the original. It might be because he got more lines in this movie. He completely knocks it out of the park in this horror movie.<br/><br/>The whole cast of the Losers Club were terrific and acted perfectly.

He knows what scares these characters, even as adults, which often manifests itself in strange, vivid ways. It's the stuff of nightmares, even when they're wide awake in broad daylight. But his omniscience and omnipresence tend to vacillate, and the collaborative power that ultimately challenges him isn't too different from what we saw in the climax of the first movie.<br/><br/>
Perhaps the best scene in the whole film is the one in which old grandma holding her smile for couple of seconds, and her creepy body action."
"evrivali","7","26","49","5 September 2019"," Good enough I guess
","Look, It Chapter Two is probably not going to blow your mind but it's not going to disappoint you either. There is a lot of hype for this movie and the trailers and everything made it seem such as the movie would be a lot better than it actually was, I assume that's the whole point of promotion, but considering that the first movie fully met my expectations I would have expected something a little better (I'll explain).
Pros
The acting is great and the casting is flawless. All the actors are a perfect match to their children predecessors and they approach their parts with respect towards the characters we all met and loved as kids. It has some very good moments with creepy jumpscares and wacky characters and achieves to balance between comedy and horror. As an ending to the whole it 'franchise' it's what you would expect without any unpleasant surprises and it's going to leave you satisfied and kind of nostalgic.
Cons
I personally didn't like the backstory that wad given to 'It' and they way they suggested would be right to defeat it, although I haven't read the book and I don't know if that kind of material was included in the original story. 3 hours was too long for this movie and it made me a little tired towards the end. I also didn't love the cgi, I have the feeling the the previous movie had used better effects.
Conclusion
'It Chapter Two' is a solid conlclusion to the story and it has the thrills to excite horror movie enthusiasts. The cast has chemistry which makes the movie even better and if you loved the first movie then it's worth your time but don't expect to get the same feeling with the original.
Rating: 7/10"
"WillsFilms","8","17","30","12 September 2019"," It: Chapter Two Floats My Boat
","It: Chapter Two, despite not being as good as Chapter one, is an amazing conclusion to the story of It. The cast in this movie is phenomenal. Every actor gave an incredible performance as their respective loser. Bill Hader and James McAvoy stole the show in every scene they were in. The conclusions to the character arcs established in Chapter One all make perfect sense and wrap up the stories of these characters incredibly well. However, there was one character resolution that felt rushed, especially with how well it was built up in the book. Stephen King himself makes a cameo in the movie. It's a really clever scene that die hard Stephen King fans will find absolutely hilarious. Bill Skarsgard continues to shine as Pennywise The Dancing Clown. Pennywise, in this movie especially, is so despicably evil that you're really rooting for that clown to go down.<br/><br/>If I had one problem with the movie, it's that the climax goes on forever. The final battle went on for about half an hour and, though I was still excited, it was far too long when that time could have been spent on more character centred scenes. The movie has an absurdly long runtime, which they should have used to their advantage instead of making the climax so long. The movie also has problems with its tone. After a scary scene, a character will make a joke. This is an issue as the movie often doesn't know wheather it wants to take itself seriously or not.<br/><br/>In summary, It: Chapter Two is a great conclusion to the It duology with a final battle that goes on 15 minutes too long and some rushed scenes, but has great acting and mostly great writing, while maintaining the first movie's strong message about friendship. It's definitely the inferior of the two movies, but it's still a phenomenal watch that I highly recommend."

"ajaychemnitt","5","15","26","27 September 2019"," First movie made money, Let's make a second one!!
","I would have to say the casting director of this movie has done a great job of putting together actors that resemble the characters of their younger self not to mention the big chubby Ben has now become a hot daring Ben. But that's where the niceties of the movie ends.<br/><br/>If the most scariest scene of the movie was a giant naked CGI generated grand ma, then the movie is seriously missing some of the natural free flowing expression of the first movie. It almost seems like the makers were trying too hard to make the movie more scarier than the last time but only to come up with a series of long and predictable jump scares from zombies in the beginning in order to reintroduce characters and a series of pointless chases from the clown in the end.<br/><br/>I can only assume lack of creativity when the most important scene in which they perform the ritual to kill the clown turns out to be a damp squib. 'Turn the light into dark' they say a countless times until your earing apparatus become deaf only to see a balloon pop out, which is honestly more painful than getting a hit in your balls while playing baseball. And for the first time probably in the history of cinema, the villain is killed by calling him names.<br/><br/>The tone of the scenes in the movie switches from inconsistent to confusing. The horror scenes are mixed with comical overtones, the emotional scenes are made worse by mundane dialogues - 'we must stay together', 'if you believe you will kill' or using the nostalgia card far too often, and the comical scenes are far and few between. In the end, everything is juxtaposed to leave you with neither horror nor something touching or comical and doesn't do justice to the famous and popular novel (according to Maria Serova who read the book)<br/><br/>In short, Seeing the CGI zombies for 3 hours, yes 3 hours, and the letters at the end just tests your patience as much as your grandmother who was advising you to get your life together in your teenage years. If you miss your grandmother, It's a must watch otherwise a pint at your local bar is better worth the money."

"elijahfuchs-60353","5","9","14","8 September 2019"," Rather disappointing
","The sequel to the 2017 hit follows the adult versions of the Losers Club, as they confront Pennywise 27 years later to kill him once and for all. I liked the first ""It,"" however I don't feel it is as good as people and critics say it is, and does contain some noticeable flaws. ""It: Chapter Two"" does feature some impressive aspects, but overall feels very long, repetitive, and filled with script troubles. The casting choices, which I'm sure is pretty much a consensus, we're brilliant, and the adult versions of the kids from the first film truly look like the grownup versions of their characters. Along with the casting of the losers club, Bill Skarsgård is back, and really shines in his performance. There is some genuinely cool imagery, and it is fun to see the certain abominable figures that Pennywise manifests himself into. While I didn't wholly dislike this film, I do have problems with this movie that I couldn't stop thinking about throughout the film and need to be addressed. First off, the characters are so much more bland than they were in the latter film, featuring almost no character arches at all. What made the characters so much better in the first film was how the character's personalities and traits changed throughout the course of the film because of their teamwork and the adversity they were facing. In ""It: Chapter Two,"" there is not really any change of heart in the characters, and most of them feel the same from the beginning until the end. Certain characters may have somewhat of an arch, but it didn't feel very well earned, and sort of predictable. This film is extremely long as well, and features very little tension, (with the exception of one scene in my opinion) with a heavy emphasis of jump scares surprisingly. The formula for how the scenes escalated became very repetitious due to the focus on providing a jump scare. Another issue I had with this film is one I share with the predecessor, and that is the over reliance on CGI. While CGI can look good, this film is scattered with very obvious CGI, and it takes away from the film's reality and scariness. One plot point tries to explain Pennywise's origins, and it felt very jumbled and confusing. Overall, this film was entertaining, but disappointing for the fact that I expected better filmmaking and story writing quality. It's not a terrible horror film, but isn't really much different from a lot of other things that you may see out there."

","First and foremost, I had poor expectations when going to see the film just due to the fact that the first one didn't excite my palate. I thought Pennywise was lacking and the kids forced a little too much humor. But all of that said, this movie blew me right out of the water. It was very true to the novel and the adult cast was pristinely chosen to match the children in a way that completely ties the two movies together. As soon as I watched the first scene, I knew this movie would be great.<br/><br/>The theme of the underdogs overcoming their sadistic and unforgiving competition is executed very well in a ridiculously satisfying kind of way. Everyone dogs on how it drives away from the horror aspect, but that isn't what the story is about. It's a story of self acceptance and overcoming past trauma with a can't be defeated attitude. It tugs at your heart strings, disgusts you, makes you laugh, and instills a certain sense of hope in a quite unanticipated way and for that I was thoroughly impressed.<br/><br/>It's character development could most certainly use some tweaking, but how can you expect a motion picture to entirely nail an eleven hundred page novel's atmosphere? For what the movie did nail, it nailed precisely. So all in all it's a great watch and I would recommend the movie to anyone!!"

","AMAZING! ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!<br/><br/>I really like this movie! For starters I have seen the original Stephen King's IT the ( 1990 ) tv series version of course and I had nightmares as a child because of how well Tim Curry portrayed Pennywise and I gotta say I think Bill Skarsgård did an awesome job!<br/><br/>
This movie of course aims to put fear into adults because the first IT Chapter 1 aims to the fear of a child and it's like now that IT Chapter 2 has come out , finally, some people are being really negative towards this movie. What I don't understand is that the audience asked for more scary because the first film didn't give them that. And now that they have revived it in IT Chapter 2 it's ""oh this movie is too long!"" Or ""Oh it's still not that scary!"" What more do you all want?!<br/><br/>
The acting was good! The jokes were funny! Every scene from beginning to end was just great to me! And I don't normally say this about some horror remakes or just any remakes at all! But this one really had me interested. It gave me what I expected. I cried and I laughed and that's fine with me! I'm not about to sit back and watch a whole movie for two hours if I'm not interested.<br/><br/>
Now I will say this though I really felt uncomfortable when seeing Stanley's suicide, which I already knew that he was going to die because he died in the original IT. But in this one, we (the audience) get's a chance to see and watch Stanley hurt himself. And I didn't want to watch him do that to himself again. I was also sad when I found out about Richie's Background which was a MAJOR plot twist!<br/><br/>
The biggest plot twist that I've ever seen! And then we find out that Richie not only seen Eddie as a best friend but as something more. And that just hurt my soul even more to see that. And I'll be honest I cried. R.I.P Eddie and Stanley. Oh! Can I also point out the fact that Pennywise killed that little kid so brutal when Bill tried to save the kid?! IT SHOCKED ME! I literally said that this dude isn't joking! Like he's serious. Also sometimes most of the scenes would make angry with the decisions that the characters made. LOL and that's expected because that's how some movies are. I also like how the Adult version of the kids got a chance to see their younger selfs while having flash backs. Just so much happened that I could go on forever but I won't. Just know that this movie was really good.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In closing, those bad reviews aren't really called for, but at the end of the day people are entitled for their opinions. And well mines is that this movie was just really really good! Great Job Everyone that contributed to the film! I know you guys really worked your hardest! Also I would like to thank Stephen King for giving the new generation a chance to experience something terrifying that they'll never forget!"

","This review may be unpopular, but It:Chapter two is one of the best movies this decade! Not just in horror genre, i'm talking generally!
First of all, the actors are amazing, especially the Old Version character they impersonate their younger selves perfectly!
And Bill Hader is seriously the best in the movie!!!
Second of all, the production is a masterpiece & the music is great.
Bill Skarsgård again did a great job being Pennywise, i wish we saw him more though!
Some of the jumpscares were predictable but the others we not and they were amazing!
Andy Muschietti did a great job again!
It Chapter 2 is way better than the first in my opinion! (i loved the first so much)
There's a lot to talk about this movie, unlike other people those 3 hours were really fast!The Movie Was Quite enjoyable!

","I thought they did a great job tying all the stories in together with the flashbacks from the younger versions to the adults. The special effects were amazing without being over the top, perfect amount. That old lady, holy crap. I love creepiness more than just scares or blood or kills but this has everything you could want and more I think."
"queenoflab","10","17","31","8 September 2019"," Hilariously Terrifying
","Usually when I laugh at a horror film it's because it's bad. But It: Chapter 2 was genuinely hilarious. Even the scary parts had me laughing with amusement & confusion. Not only did it bump up the laughs, it's was also way more disturbing and creepy and terrifying than the first. And at the end your hit with the feels cuz you're so invested in the squad fam 😢 My only complaint is that my FAVOURITE character died, but at least he shined throughout the movie, and the rest was so freaking epic. The cast was so great and the writing was just so good. Didn't feel like a hours at all. It was such a great movie. WATCH IT"
"StephenIsADumb","10","17","31","6 September 2019"," Don't be turned off by ""meh"" reviews
","I only rate movies highly when I truly believe they are something special. Not gonna say that this is the best movie of all time nor the best horror film but it is incredible nonetheless. Maybe some think it goes on too long, others think it is nothing special...that if you saw the first then you aren't gonna be surprised. If you enjoyed movies like The Shining, another Stephen King classic, you will more than likely love this. It has some extremely disturbing moments, some predictable but awesome jumpscares, and even some great campiness not dissimilar to a Sam Raimi film. SFX this time around were somehow even better albeit a little excessive (looking at you final showdown) and the camerawork was top notch. If you like an engrossing horror story then you won't be disappointed either (did I mention how long this was?).<br/><br/>All in all a great experience that reviews cannot determine and a beautiful end(?) to an insane story."

","When the Stephen King's 'IT' remake came out in 2017, it had much to live up to, - just given the way King's films are potrayed, it hd to live up to the thirll like his other flms have done, while remaining true to it's origins as well as book portions - which it did - I gave IT 8/10 previously.<br/><br/><ul><li>Casting -</li></ul><br/><br/>The kids in chapter one were stellar - and the casting director was spot in with the choices that he made to select the high school kids to face the crazed clown.<br/><br/>This film was no different. not only did the casting director pick five adults who portrayed the resemblance of the young kids very well, but also casted 5 'adult' characters that complemented each other on screen very well.<br/><br/>It literally felt like they were the same kids 27 years ago growing up in the small town of Berry - I don't think there has been a film to depict such a great resemblance in all the movies i have seen with a continuous story attached to it.<br/><br/><ul><li>The fight back -</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The 27 year return to the small town felt like a smoothe transition for the viewers and I at least felt that these kids who had seemingly 'defeated' Pennywise before could do it again. i felt every fear that these grown adults now were facing to face the crazed clown.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The 'token' segments even gave us more inside stories to what happened when they were kids adding even more depth the film's story and built up the ultimate showdown of why these kids must defeat the pennywise - who'm they have been fearing this whole time.</li></ul><br/><br/>-The film really thought of everything to add to, to make the smoothe transition towards the final battle between the now older kids. Everything just meshed so perfectly together.<br/><br/><ul><li>The only downfall I would say is how the kids from Berry had figured out how to defeat him - no spoilers here , but at first I felt with what the writers came up with , was a tad bit dull - but then you have to actually think about the given message in the film, as to why it worked , and why it hadn't worked before.</li></ul><br/><br/>The messages might seem clear to some , and not clear to others - but I am not spoiling it just for the fact I would want you to get that satisfaction of figuring it out yourself - within that given message the defeat of the clown makes sense , and although , the final battle scene could have had a few minor tweaks here and there, it ultimately wasn't too bad, it still worked.<br/><br/>#Duration<br/><br/><ul><li>The length of the film is nearly 3 hours and although some might be complaining about that - it honestly needed to be. The film flowed so perfectly and kept me intrigued for the entire time - It had to be that long because there was so much they needed to add, and they added the right segment to conclude the IT series. The writing was superb and excellent</li></ul><br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 - It had everything you could ask for - the adults were just as funny as the kids were / the chemistry was there all the same / the resemblances to the younger versions were spot on / there was actually some jump off moments, although predictable on some occasions, it still was brilliantly done.<br/><br/><ul><li>I also did watch this in IMAX so it added some extra fright with the sound fx and music, but oh by gawd , i paid full price for this film, and honestly i would have paid double (maybe... thats a lot of money for a film - would definitely pay it for both films together)</li></ul><br/><br/>Really enjoyed the film and its a definite buy when it comes out.<br/><br/>Watch the first one on Netflix because you honestly have to get the origin story and then go watch this ASAP , you wont be disappointed.<br/><br/>-"
"nishasuperboy","9","17","31","5 September 2019"," Not as bad as I expected
","One thing I can assure is that ""IT Chapter 2"" is not a mediocre horror movie. It starts off really promising but only to an extent the movie could keep its promise.
In 2 hours and 49 minutes, IT could have shown us a lot better things rather than focusing on flashbacks and many unnecessary things.
Expected a lot of moments with pennywise which turned me down, but his screen presence plays a huge impact in the movie, nailed every scene in which he was present. Especially some death scenes were really touching.
The climax was emotionless like as if the film was pretending to make audiences happy. Its chapter 2 wasn't as great as the prequel, but definitely a good sequel."
"pedroquintaoo","9","17","31","5 September 2019"," A good ending
","I liked! Has the same vibe of the first film, the cast is incredible, there are a lot of creepy and thrilling moments, the jokes are really funny and the plot is awesome.
I don't think the runtime is too long, there is no space for boring scenes, it's always happening something interesting in the screen.<br/><br/>The two weakest problems in my opinion were the CGI, I mean it's good but sometimes it's also too much (I don't know how to explain better, but they could use practical effects in some scenes, would make some elements more realistic), and I didn't like how the movie sometimes forgets some characters during a lot of time.<br/><br/>
If you enjoyed It (2017), I'm sure you're going to like this sequel. If you hated, stay away from It Chapter Two."

","Pennywise bites a kid's a little girl's head off and bites a little boy's face off. Pennywise turns into a giant spider and Pennywise hybrid. Eddie dies/gets killed by Pennywise/the hybrid spider. Stanley slits his own wrist. Beverly and Ben end up together. It reveals that Bull feels terrible and responsible for Georgia's death because the day that Georgie was killed by Pennywise, Bill was lying to Georgie about being sick because he just didn't want to go out and play with Georgie. The homosexual man, Adrian Mellon, hate crime and him getting finished off by Pennywise below the ""kissing bridge"" scene from the book is in this film. Pennywise also kills Koontz the security guard when Pennywise breaks Henry out. The leper makes an appearance or two. Richie has a thing for Eddie but it's only one sided and Eddie keeps it a friend relationship. Richie carves he and Eddie's initials on the kissing bridge at the end of the film. Bill is with Audra, his Wife. Mike talks about finally movie out of Derry at the end of the film. Henry Bowers is back and is real threat to the Loser's Club again.<br/><br/>I highly enjoyed this film. Yes, it has some weird/ackward parts and too much joking and comedy at times and it seems to drag a little here and there but it is also gory, creepy, scary, has great writing and dialogue, great character development, has great acting (Bill Hader steals the show), it's horrifying (I mean seeing a little girl get her head bitten off under the bleachers at a football game is horrifying enough), the Loser's Club all have great chemistry even though they're not together as much in this film. An overall great film/horror film. Well done."
"larrydelacruzph","8","30","60","4 September 2019"," A Satisfying Final Act
","As a massive fan of the first chapter, I counted down the days until I get to feast my eyes on the closing segment of the saga. And while CHAPTER 2 certainly delivers on ramping up the production (more blood, brutal kills, intricate set pieces) a compelling aspect of the first part was sorely missing.<br/><br/>What made CHAPTER ONE absolutely bone-chilling was that the terror wasn't confined to Pennywise alone, but by other residents of this mysterious town who are hellbent on terrorizing these poor kids. From the adults to the parents to the bullies, fear was at every turn, and the killer clown was more than happy to exploit this.<br/><br/>And while it does occasionally touch upon this in this second half (the brutal hate crime, the bullied little girl with the birthmark) that element seems to be discarded altogether, giving the viewer less chance to feel absolute dread for the new batch of victims in this go around.<br/><br/>Of course, they are not the focus of the story. With the grown-up Losers Club returning to Derry with all their baggage in hand, the horror seems surface-level, at times even comical and groan-inducing. You don't really get the teeth of the terror, as in-your-face as the brutality may be.<br/><br/>What does translate is the tremendous chemistry between the actors much like the cast of its' predecessor. There is a fair amount of levity (albeit misplaced at times) that equals the first chapter and a genuine sense of camaraderie between the actors. The highs are high and the lows are heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Shortcomings aside, its still a fitting end to a saga that deals with some heavy topics coupled with effective scares and even a dose of heart. It's not even a question of ""is it worth watching?"" If you've seen the first one, the answer simply is ""yes""."

The cast was perfect and the plot sublime. I was into every minute of this Iconic 3hrs horror fest. The SFX and CGIs were excellent as well as the town of Derry, where SK does all his movies...his horror screen. From the Losers Club, I found myself as one of them and how Pennywise zeroed in on each one. The story was somewhat different from the original novel. However those slight changes made the adaptations of the mini-series with Tim Curry to Bill Skarsgard was fantastic.

Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd was amazing as always as the terrorsome Pennywise, although not as terrifying as the first half of this 2 part movie. the flashback scenes that people have complained about, please shut up! they are part of the whole ending to destroy Pennywise, despite it not working.

Cast, screenplay, direction, cinematography, bg scoring were felicitous. Pennywise's performance was great. Many jumpscares were there, not just for name sake but it was along the storyline. Many bashed the movie just because critics did, trying to be intellectual. There were cons in the movie like very silly jokes on a serious shot(atmost 5 times), few poor choices of dialogues.

","IT once again doesn't disappoint. The pacing of the film is very well done and doesn't bored you. The film opens with a great hook of Pennywise returning after 27 years and eating his first victim. The scene is intense and to be honest scary. Not horrifying but scary enough to freak out about the scene. Many people complain that the movie is too long but don't realize you have to build up a story. I truly believe that chapter 2 is creepier than chapter 1 with Pennywise being more creepy as ever. Go a check this film out. Your in for a ride."
"cruise01","10","16","29","7 September 2019"," It delivers scares, thrills, and is epic for a horror film.
","It Chapter 2 (5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>It Chapter 2 is awesome, insane, and it delivers for a supernatural horror film. I loved the first movie with a terrifying Pennywise stalking Derry and a group of kids trying to stop it. The plot follows 27 years later, Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), and the rest of the Losers club return to Derry to stop It once and for all.<br/><br/>The film opens with a haunting beginning about a young guy getting attacked and stalked by Pennywise. The rest of the film builds up the characters with the Loser club being adults. Bill is a famous writer for Hollywood and writes books with terrible endings. Beverly leaves an abusive relationship. Richie is a comedian. Ben works for a corporate company. Eddie is still a neat and health freak. Stanley is living a normal married life. And Mike still lives in Derry while investigating the current disappearances. Their own worst fears comes back to haunt them when they reach Derry. One by one they face this mysterious clown. While trying to save other children from being lured by the clown.<br/><br/>The film is a little bigger than the last movie. It is longer and a lot more happens with the plot. The origins of It and how they are supposed to stop it. Some past bullies comes back to haunt the Losers club. I am not sure how faithful this film is to the novel. But it is nearly similar to the original movie/series with Tim Curry. The film has plenty of thrills and scares to make this film one of the best horror films of this year. The cast ensemble is perfect. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, and Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise. They all were great with their characters. The film brings back the original children actors back as it explored more of the events of that summer when they first encountered It. Those kids personality and the adults were a perfect combo.<br/><br/>There is also one suspenseful scene with Bill going into a haunted walk through house ride at a fair. Trying to save a kid with mirror maze hallway. Which is thrilling. The climax of the movie is epic. There fight against Pennywise is insane. Characters are separated and faced with their own fears. The ending is satisfying with a conclusion to the characters and the story itself.<br/><br/>Overall, It Chapter 2 is a great film. Even though it was 2 hours and 48 minutes long. The story is well spread out to develop the characters and their encounter with Pennywise. The cast is perfect. The direction delivered enough scares and thrills to make this film a great horror film."

","I rarely make a review! But by the reactions of some critics, I felt I should do!<br/><br/>First of all, the direction of the film is masterfully done, because it is not easy to convey all the drama of trauma caused to the boys for them as adults. Second, creating the image of who the IT creature is and how it maintains its existence is even harder, and the director did both exceptionally well!<br/><br/>The performance of the children and adults are flawless. All of the second act was very well elaborated by being faithful to the book with the flashbacks! The effects are great and effective and I thought they were necessary to build the most complex scenes. Pennywise is amazing and much more scary and violent. It has some very heavy scenes, some good scares and many chair-holding scenes.<br/><br/>The film is also very funny and with this, relieves a little weight leaving the film more balanced. I understand that some complain about the time but for me, I did not see the time pass. The end manages to raise a lot of emotions and then the perfect climax.<br/><br/>I am sure that Stephen King is very proud to see one of his best works honored this way!

"HorrorFlickFanatic","9","15","27","10 September 2019"," Reviews negatives are over-exaggerated
","I came close to dismissing this movie and missing out on its theater experience because of over-exaggeration of its' negatives. It isn't a perfect movie, some criticisms are valid. One of the valid criticisms is there is an overabundance of CGI scenes that doesn't add to the story such as a scene at a Chinese buffet. I am usually critical of over-the-top CGI in movies and I do agree that Hollywood relies too much in it. But the CGI doesn't ruin this movie.<br/><br/>The runtime doesn't bother me either. It was certain scenes that progressed slowly in the middle of the film so I think those scenes could have been infused with more story telling.<br/><br/>What I did like about the movie were the new flashbacks that blended the younger cast members and their older selves on screen. It added more story material to chapter 1 that we did not know from the original movie and it made for a good transition from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2. As others have mentioned, the casting is superb. They did a phenomenal job casting the actors.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of King's IT, don't let the negative reviews dissuade you from the theater experience for this film. You might end up regretting not haven't gone when you see it on video next year. Judge for yourself and watch it on the big screen. To many sheeple hop on the bandwagon because they think it's cool.<br/><br/>Again, it's not an excellent film, but it's far from the mediocrity of mainstream slasher and possession films, or even other Stephen King adaptations with the exception of Kubrick's' Shining which in my opinion still remains as the best adaptation of Stephen King's books. I think its an 8.5/10. Besides, Marvel is the epitome of overabundance in CGI because its cheaper than hiring great screenwriters. This isn't a Marvel film, it's a Stephen King movie and it is certainly worth a movie ticket. I got more than my money's worth today."

Although it was a 2 hour and 50 minute film, personally, it only felt like 1 hour 30 minutes- 2 hours(different with everyone though). Casting was superb! Looked like the kids actually would look like that when they are older(and obviously great actors as well).<br/><br/>Ok, so this is where ppl are under rating it, so yes, I do agree that at SOME parts (not all) the CGI was a bit naff and I did think it could have spent a bit more time and money on it, however I also think that the monsters weren't supposed to look completely realistic?! Although it was very funny, I did think that some parts should have been a bit more serious, (this is kind of a spoiler but not really...) but whose trying to be funny after being stabbed in the face?.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely worth watching and please ignore bad ratings! You'll float tooðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆ"
"gpapakyprianos","9","15","27","6 September 2019"," Heartbreaking
","This movie sums up the story of the losers and it does it with a heartbreaking way. Personally i felt like the book came to life. So many similarities with the incredible Steven King's novel, especially Eddie's death. Obviously i loved the added scenes that answered many questions from chapter one and the fact that the clubhouse played a significant role in the film. At this point i have to agree with what Jessica Chastain said ""it is more than a horror film, it's a coming of age film"". All the emotions, all the flashbacks and the present storyline is everything we needed as an end. Finally i have to admit that King's cameo was brilliant and made the movie way better. At last but not least, Bill Skarsgard's performance was one again unforgettable. He brought the villainous character of Pennywise back as no one ever possibly could.<br/><br/>To everyone involved in both chapters of IT, thank you for making those movies as great as the book."

","Boasting sensational performances by the cast and a decent screenplay, It : Chapter 2 delivers a thrilling movie experience loaded with chills and laughs, even though it does not reach it's full potential.<br/><br/>The movie often feels a bit stretched and somewhere in the middle looses its sense of direction (although it is only for a little while) , it makes it up with its exceptional ending, guaranteed to leave goosebumps. Although the movie isn't nightmares-giving scary, it is on a good amount of scary, which I personally thought was a good thing (but some may not agree).<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie is that it perfectly blends horror elements with the comedic ones, something that is difficult to achieve.
Verdict : If you loved the first movie, you will definitely love this one. The movie features the thrills, the scares, the laughs and a satisfying conclusion (not to mention a dream cast). It Chapter 2 can be declared as a worthy second half."

Bill Hader, funny as hell, I thought he would ruin the movie, Couldn't be more wrong,
the rest of the cast great scenes<br/><br/>story: I love that the movie took its time to everyone's past Or showing every one reaction for the phone call for the reunion but there's a lot of time or scenes to show their friendship, ( scenes where all are kids and say nothing ) just to remind us how important friendship is.<br/><br/>IT: Bill is amazing as it, the faces, the moves, the Creepy smile he does, but In this movie , pennywise focused in being creepy and scary, and he did great but I miss the sarcastic and funny clown like Tim Curry version,

","I have always been an advocate for long films. If I see that a film has a 3 hour run-time, I am usually thrilled. That is because I believe a truly great story needs time to develop characters and commit the viewer to the experience. It Chapter Two is a prime example of a film that boasts a long run-time without using it properly, and it becomes a real drag. Many times the stunning visuals and costume design in combination with a gut-wrenching performance by Bill Skarsgard would have me at the edge of my seat, only to slowly sit me back as all momentum slowly burned out. It also dawned on me that the horror if IT is best viewed through the lens of a child protagonist. Some moments with a full adult squad just felt disingenuous."
"dhainline1","10","23","45","7 September 2019"," Pennywise Better Watch Out! The Now Grown Losers Club Will Kick His Ass!
","When we last left the Losers Club, the six boys and one girl made a blood vow to come back to Derry, Maine to finally destroy the evil, shape-shifting clown, Pennywise. It was late summer 1989 when the vow was made and the children except lone black character Michael Hanlon (Chosen Jacobs as young Mike, Isaiah Mustafa as grown Mike) have left Derry.
The club members are wildly successful except for poor Mike who has stayed in the cursed town and is waiting to see when and if the members will fulfill the oath they made as children. William aka Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Martell as young Bill, James McAvoy as grown Bill) is a very successful writer who is married to Audra (Jess Wexler). She is an actress who is staring in a movie based on one of Bill's books. Everyone agrees Bill is a good writer but they criticize his book endings. The lone girl, Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis as young Beverly, Jessica Chastain as grown Beverly) is a wonderful clothing designer married to Tom Rogan who abuses her horribly. Bill Hader is Richie Tozier the club comedian who doesn't write his own material. Finn Wolfhard plays young Richie. I think the adult actors really look like the children actors with James Ransone nailing Jack Dylan Grazer's Eddie Kaspbrak mannerisms to a T! Andy Bean has a short, memorable role of Stanley Uris and he channels Wyatt Oleff's mannerisms and hair quite well! I can also see Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben Hanscom growing up to be quite a hunk like Jay Ryan! Last of all, Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is back to his own tricks and this Pennywise is truly terrifying and in a rage!
The catalyst for Mike's contact of his old friends is the hate murder of a gay man named Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) in 2016 at the Derry Carnival. These hateful punks beat up Adrian and his boyfriend Don Haggerty. They throw Adrian in the canal and Pennywise, just waking up and starving after 27 years, takes a bite out of Adrian. As the movie goes on, the flesh of Adrian doesn't satisfy the clown for long. He feeds on a little girl named Victoria who has a birth mark on her face. Pennywise tricks her into thinking he can cure her mark but devours her instead. He also eats a young boy in the fun house in front of Bill.
The Losers all come together in their old town with the exception of Stan who cuts his wrist in the bathtub after Mike's phone call. Pennywise is determined to make the Losers relive their childhood traumas. He even breaks Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) out of Juniper Hills institution to exact revenge. Henry killed his father Butch Bowers as a boy and was committed. The scares come on after another! The spider Pennywise with Stan's boy face is way more scary than the fake looking creature from the almost 30 year old TV movie! Well, to give the TV movie credit, TV has a more limited budget than movies and the producers and directors did their best with what they had. I never really liked Stephen King acting in the movies based on his books, but I thought he was great as the antique store owner who sells Bill the bike Bill had as a boy. Bill missed his beloved Silver and needed it back.
The Losers stick together and finally defeat Pennywise. Eddie is killed by the spider and Richie is heartbroken because he had a crush on Eddie but never told anyone he was gay. This movie did follow the classic TVmovie in some scenes especially with the Chinese restaurant and the special fortune cookies. Pennywise says ""Kiss me, fat boy"" to young Ben like TV Pennywise (Tim Curry) said to TV Ben (the late John Ritter). A rain slicker clad Georgie also confronts young Bill and grown Bill and tells both that it's their fault he is dead.
All in all, I was satisfied with this movie and the cast! Both Bills (Hader & Skarsgard) were awesome! It's safe to say that Bill Skarsgard and Tim Curry before him have ruined clowns for everyone! I recommend this movie as a satisfying swan song to this movie!"
"jamesmgarand","10","23","45","7 September 2019"," Too many negative reviews for a really good film overall. Yikes.
","If you're immature, have zero patience, haven't read the book, or have a very short attention span, you'll not only dislike this film, you'll probably hate it. Yes, there are poorly timed jokes and funny one liners and such, and there's too much CGI (Then again, Chapter 1 had lots of CGI as well but not nearly as many people complained about it) BUT the writing in this film is good overall, the character development is great, the character and story arcs are awesome, the acting is really great, the cinematography is brilliant, the visuals are fantastic, loose ends from Chapter are tied up, it's more faithful to the book than Chapter 1 is, it actually made Chapter 1 even better than it was, there were so many easter eggs for IT fans, horror movie fans, and Stephen King fans in this film (I don't want to spoil anything but Stephen King's Christine makes an easter egg appearance, Stephen King's Dark Tower series makes a little Eeaster egg appearance, Stephen King's The Shining makes a few easter egg appearances, IT : Chapter One makes an easter egg appearance, John Carpenter's The Thing makes an easter egg appearance, the 1990 made for TV IT miniseries/movie makes a couple of easter egg appearances, Andy Muschietti and Stephen King both make appearances in this film, A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 5 makes an easter egg appearance, etc etc...<br/><br/>Yes, this film could have been better, no doubt, but it was still really good overall. It has a bit of everything..horror, humor, sadness, etc...it plays on so many emotions depending on who you are or if you have a pulse or not. Way too many people are butthurt that it wasn't what they expected so they're just trashing and bashing this film instead of being open minded. Trying to be ""critics"" when they just need to enjoy the movie especially when they couldn't make a movie even half as good. Besides, most ""critics"" have no idea what they're talking about most of the time anyway. They thought ""The Last Jedi"" was ""phenomenal"". Most of them are so bad, they need to find another profession because being a ""critic"" ain't it, Chief. LMAO, enough said.

"burkholdermicah","10","29","59","5 September 2019"," Best Horror Movie Of The Year!
","Andy Muschietti's 2017 film version of one half of Stephen King's sprawling 1,100-page novel It is amazing! That Movie succeeds at the most basic task of adapting a terrifying book: staging horror scenes that are genuinely creepy. Its sequel, It Chapter Two, seems as though it's taking a similar approach, opening with a sinister carnival populated by King's signature evil bullies-along, of course, with the clown that traumatized a generation, both in fiction and in real life. Then, suddenly, you're three-quarters of the way through this 170-minute film, and you realize that, although the horror imagery has only accelerated, your heartbeat has been slow and your fists unclenched for a while now. This Movie has it all and it definitely follows the second-half of the book really well; it has some funny jokes, a couple of really good performances, impressive creature and set design, and pleasing cinematography. It Chapter Two was exactly what I wanted and what I want to see in other Horror films.
The biggest question going in to Chapter Two was who would play the grown-up versions of the Losers Club, the preteen outcasts who booted Pennywise the Clown into the screaming cosmic void at the end of the first movie. Happily, this aspect of the film is excellent, with casting that's so spot on that Muschietti shows it off in a shot morphing together the faces of one young actor and his adult counterpart halfway through the film. Summoned by a phone call from Mike Hanlon, the one member of the clique who never moved away from their hometown, the adult Losers-Bill Denbrough, Beverly Marsh, Richie Tozier, Ben Hanscom, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris, each of whom has changed dramatically in some ways, and not at all in others-feel strangely compelled to return to Derry, Maine, although they can barely remember anything that happened while they lived there.<br/><br/>Once reassembled, they slowly begin to remember the summer of 1989, and everything that they went through in the sewers underneath Derry. As Mike explains to them over a Chinese-food reunion dinner, their efforts that year weren't entirely successful, and the 27-year cycle that's seen centuries' worth of children murdered by the immortal Pennywise has started up again. Would they be willing, Mike asks them, to try to kill It again, this time for good?<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is built around this return, in an episodic, repeating structure that splits up the Losers and sends each of them into their personal nightmares twice over-once to gather an artifact that will help them perform a Native American banishing ceremony known as the ""Ritual of ChÃ¼d,"" and once again when the ritual spins out of control. Some of these personal journeys are better developed than others; the most psychologically compelling belongs to the unsinkable Beverly Marsh. Bev's return to her childhood apartment, where she's confronted with memories of her abusive father in the guise of a demon disguised as a kindly old woman, is the most nightmarishly evocative sequence in the film, matched by an intense scene later on where Chastain tries to break out of a barricaded bathroom stall that's rapidly filling up with blood. Compared to these, most of the film's scare scenes, several of which are direct callbacks to more effective scenes in the previous It seems awesome.
But where Bev's storyline is the most compelling, Hader's performance as Richie ""Trashmouth"" Tozier-who, in a contemporary update, has grown up to become a stand-up comic rather than a radio DJ-is by far the most magnetic. Even more so than Finn Wolfhard did as a young Richie in Chapter One, Hader picks up the whole movie, puts it in his pocket, and walks away with it. Although it's not an overtly flashy performance, Hader's charisma in the role is difficult to understate, and the eye wanders naturally towards him every time he's on screen. Hader is also the only member of the cast for whom the film's quip-laden dialogue makes sense. (If you don't get the meta joke about Bill's inability to write a decent ending to one of his books the first time, the next half-dozen uses of the bit should suffice.) It's as if the script, once again from screenwriter Gary Dauberman, was given a punch-up by Trashmouth himself-which is great for Hader, but terrible for any sort of sustained suspense. The deployment of these comedic asides is often spectacularly ill-timed, particularly in a callback scene where Eddie confronts ""the leper"" that's been haunting him since childhood. The scene is grimy and unnerving-that is, until Muschietti drops in a brief blast of the cheesy AM Gold hit ""Angel Of The Morning"" right when the terror is peaking, popping the balloon of dread instantly.<br/><br/>Speaking of, Richie also gets one of the better visions of Pennywise amongst the adult Losers, a vision of the evil clown floating down from an animated Paul Bunyan statue with a bouquet of red balloons that will be familiar to readers of King's novel. (What won't be familiar is an additional subplot that implies, without making explicit, new information about Richie's sexuality.) The film is so spread out, however, that Pennywise isn't as palpable of a presence here as in Chapter One, although SkarsgÃ¥rd commits just as completely to the role, his eyes wild and his chin dribbling with psychotic drool. In fact, the best Pennywise scene in It Chapter Two is one that was invented for the film, where the clown lures a lonely little girl under the bleachers at a high school football game, then chows down on her head with its layers of deep-sea creature jaws.<br/><br/>King's novel is, admittedly, also spread out and repetitive in its structure, so in this regard It Chapter Two is technically more faithful to the original than its predecessor. But in terms of adaptation, Chapter Two cuts out much of the connecting tissue that makes King's Losers a single living, breathing organism, making them less bronchi in a lung and more isolated cells floating down the same bloodstream. To wit: Although he's been restored to his rightful place as the Losers Club's semi-official historian, Mike is nevertheless pushed to the margins of the story by the removal of a key historical interlude in King's novel. This reframing, from the intergenerational trauma of the fire at the Black Spot to Mike's personal guilt at being unable to save his drug-addicted parents, is part of a larger shift away from the theme of ancient evil shaping history and towards a theme of childhood trauma and how it carries into adulthood.
The pursuit of the Losers by their childhood bully Henry Bowers, here freshly escaped from the mental institution where he's been locked up for the past 27 years, is very well played out and the subplot that sees Beverly's abusive husband chasing her to Derry is excised completely. The result is the defanging of one of the most interesting elements of King's book: the massive, inescapable scope of Pennywise's evil, replaced by a more rote internal, individualistic struggle. Perhaps predictably, then, those hoping to see the cosmic strangeness of King's novel translated to the screen are going to be disappointed, as those elements are corralled into into a handful of truly amazing CGI sequences. And while we won't delve into the details of the ending here, suffice to say the apocalyptic scale of Derry's fate has been scaled back significantly, replaced with a sentimental farewell to the lifelong friends and their shared ordeal.<br/><br/>This is all presented in a beautiful package: The film's color palette is rich, and Muschietti skillfully blends past and present with sweeping camera movements that take us from flashbacks and the present day without a single cut. The art direction and production design are both top notch and full of tactile detail, and the entomologically inspired creature design nods both to King's novel and such imaginative influences as Jan Svankmajer, the Brothers Quay, and Rob Bottin's special effects work on John Carpenter's The Thing.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an amazing Horror Movie that stays true to the source material and gives something that both King Fans And Horror Fans will adore, you will not be disappointed. It: Chapter Two is an amazing Movie and it's by far my favorite Horror Movie Of 2019!"

"matthewssilverhammer","7","13","23","13 September 2019"," Struggling with this review...
","It was a cool, confident 80's-style throwback, whose strong visuals and rare timbre made it a standout among the lame high-concept, overly dark excuses for terror we normally get. My enjoyment led to reading the novel, and I'm glad I did. Not only because it's great, but because I think I would be emotionally lost by Chapter Two otherwise. While it certainly hasn't lost any of the boldness of the first film, much of the actual storytelling skill and tonal control has been lost under an effort to shove 6+ hrs of story into 3. What we're left with is ultimately not a very ""good"" movie, but one with enough sincerity and fantastic individual moments that it's sloppiness can almost be overlooked.
We find The Losers all grown up, returning to Derry when their clown-friend begins wreaking havoc again. Despite perfect physical casting, the chemistry among these grown up performers comes nowhere near the endearing heights of the younger cast. When the kids return, it serves as a cheap but effective reminder of why we love these characters. The gentle naivete and fear of a young outcast teen proves to be paramount to the success of the horror, so this sequel seems to choose to either move away from scares altogether, or it falters.
Instead its strengths lie in individual scenes and unique themes. The Losers must relive their traumatic pasts, which not only provides the best 45 minutes of the movie, but beautifully and tenderly speaks to the effect childhood has on identity and engrained fear. It's a brave movie, even if kind of a ""bad"" one, which is a combo I prefer to safe (boring) ""good"" movies."

The visual horror was rendered to perfection. There is plenty of it. Quite an achievement and well worth the ticket price. Be warned that it ain't subtle.

"wickedalwayswins","9","12","21","16 September 2019"," Let me first address all the negative reviews..
","..because they all seem to have the same complaints:<br/><br/>1.) The Runtime:
Okay, you knew going in that this movie was 2 hours and 49 minutes, and if you didn't think a movie like IT needs such a long run time, you're clearly not a fan. The book is 1,200 pages long, and the first movie was 2 hours long and only covered half the story, so 3 hour run time for the second half of the story is more than justified. Yes, it feels long. But never are you bored. I will admit it does drag a bit in the middle, but that's mostly because the beginning was so fast paced. And they still left out subplots from the book, so it could've easily been longer!!<br/><br/>2.) The Comedy:
This film has no more comedy than Chapter One, and that was a highlight for people when it came to the first film, so not sure why it's such a drawback here. I don't know when comedy in a horror movie became such a negative factor for most people. Richie's whole character is a comedian who does impressions, and they're all childhood best friends, i'm Impressed that these friends can still find time to have fun after all the trauma they've been through.<br/><br/>3.) The Lack of Pennywise:
This is such a stupid complaint for many reasons. Pennywise is one of It's many forms, and let me tell you this movie includes much more of Pennywise than the miniseries, or the book. Had the ending stayed closer to the book, he'd be in it even less! But they found a way to include him and we should all be thankful. He is in it less than Chapter One but like I said, this movie isn't about a killer clown, it's about a shapeshifting entity that eats children and likes the taste of fear.<br/><br/>4.) Too many flashbacks:
Okay. The kids are not in this film as much as some people seem to believe. There's one flashback for each loser, and that's about it. This is the part of the movie where it starts to drag, but they're all relevant to the film as they have to remember things that we the audience didn't see in Chapter One.<br/><br/>Some people want this film to be closer to the book, but if it was, most people's complaints would be amplified, like a longer run time, less Pennywise, etc. Clearly there's just no pleasing people. Don't listen to the naysayers, Chapter Two is a much more satisfying conclusion than the second half of the miniseries was. I don't think it'll be remembered as well as Chapter One, but most of the problems in this film exist in the miniseries and therefore come from the source material. They would have to seriously detour from the book to please everyone. This one covers more from the book than the miniseries while also giving us something entirely new. You can tell how much Andy Muschietti appreciates and understands the source material, and that's rare. The director of the miniseries hadn't even read the book, and it shows. The miniseries May be a more faithful adaptation, but so is Stephen King's The Shining from 1997, and we still remember Kubrick's film."
"kellylane17","1","12","21","9 September 2019"," Disappointing, boring and far too long.
","I never really thought IT was scary as such
a few cheap jump scares but nothing that would give me nightmares, However I do love the story, chapter 1 is enjoyable and I am invested In the characters, so I was excited for chapter 2. However about half an hour in and I felt like I had been sitting there for two hours. Around halfway through, two other people got up and walked out. I seriously considering going with them.<br/><br/>I lost all interest in the characters and couldn't have cared less if they all died. I just wanted this film to end. This film is far too long with many scenes that just felt regurgitated from chapter 1.
As others have said the CGI just takes away from the scare factor. And it's just not believable. How you can be scared of penny-wise I just don't know.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money going to see this at the cinema. Don't even buy it on DVD. Maybe if you really have nothing better to do and this film is on one of the many streaming sights give it ago. But then again just watch the first one but imagine them 27 years older!!"

This series has put the level of Horror at the sky thanks to it's big budget otherwise many horror movies just depends on there tune and makeup but this series showed us the real fear that is above ghosts.<br/><br/>But the truth that no one can ignore is The first chapter was the most scary movie of all time and I don't think any film would be able to dethrone it because of It's ending where every character found their strength in their own imagination."

","Magnificent!<br/><br/>What I really like most is that it's both its own film, and is respectful of the mini series. There are several homages, and I have to say that Bill Skarsgård is absolutely outstanding in the role, especially when you consider how iconic Tim Curry's performance was. Was very creepy, and MUCH better than the first part which I think was finding its feet. Everybody panned the alien spider in the miniseries, but with a bigger budget, essentially Pennywise's true form is just a fancier version which to be honest is the most accurate way of showing him (our puny minds can never properly see IT, only what the mind interprets), so vindicates the original mini series somewhat, maybe will be rewatched and reappraised? Casting was okay, but I preferred the adult casting in the mini series better, and the 50s setting worked better IMO - gave it a 'Stand By Me' vibe. Overall, a superb job of bringing a difficult book to life."

"TwistedContent","8","11","19","10 September 2019"," Both Awesome and Underwhelming At The Same Time
","This was without a doubt one of the years most anticipated horror movies for most people, including myself, a life-long lover of Stephen King and definitely a fan of the 2017's ""It"". While I did enjoy this, I'm not gonna lie, ""It: Chapter 2"" wasn't the movie I wanted it to be.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize the hits of this movie before the misses, because they're quite strong. The first, a very sure hit, is the acting, pretty much all of the performances are mildly perfect - it was amazing to watch such a stellar cast working together (and also alone & apart, for at least half of the screen time...). Hader, McAvoy, Ransone, and, of course, Skarsgard are the absolute highlights. While the acting is top-notch, the character treatment is questionable. Specifically the treatment of Pennywise - there was less of him here than in the 1st part, and it also felt like he's much more ...unimportant. I think there was unused potential to give Bill more screen time to shine. Give him more substance. The next hit of ""It: Chapter 2"" is cinematography and FX. Sure, a lot of people (way too many actually) complain about the extensive use of cgi, but, in my humble opinion, it's the highest tier stuff, masterfully made and blended in with some practical FX and a truly crafty, imaginative cinematography. Another popular complaint is the pacing, here I beg to differ. It was not the pacing that bugged me, I felt like it went by at an even speed and there are quite a lot of shorter movies that have felt longer than this. What bugged me is what I consider this movies biggest miss - the script, the story. For me it seemed like the filmmakers aspired to put more in this than would actually work. ""It: Chapter 2"" made me confident in that the best way to adapt this novel is tv-series - 20 episodes, easily. The result of this script was a disjointed, choppy movie with a lot of scenes that felt unfinished and scenes that felt unnecessary or just plain confused. The most underwhelming moment (arguably) is the ending, or the climax. I don't usually give any spoilers, so I can only say that it was actually kinda lame. It's ironic that Stephen King often gets criticised for his endings & so does Bill's character (who's a writer) - Indeed the endings of both ""It"" and ""It: Chapter 2"" could be their weakest spots. Oh, and a nice bonus was a lengthy (for cameo standards) Stephen Kings cameo, the first cameo in a movie based on his writings since 1996's ""Thinner"".<br/><br/>Thankfully, I liked the movie a lot more than I didn't, if that makes sense. The ingredients were there, the promise, the potential, the hype, but something didn't quite click and the result was an awesome romp of ups and downs, but awesome is what matters. I'd like to think that there was a true effort and love put into making this. My rating: 8/10."

","The Horror in this movie is untraditional so that, for one, is going to turn a lot of people off. I didn't read the book so I can't compare, but I can tell it came off of the book's page because of how the events were transpiring in the movie.
For a NEARLY 3 hour movie, I never felt bored, pacing never dragged, though in the final act things did kick into high gear, but we didn't lose any info while it was happening. As for all the effects I genuinely jumped more than a few times (Dolby Cinema), though I found Pennywise more horrific in the first one.
The only main thing I can complain about is letting the characters have their own adult lives, we saw them AS adults but they revert back to their childlike mentalities. I just wish we learned more about THEIR lives, so they could've added character, the movie mostly drew off of flashbacks.
Other than that, dialogue, acting, were above average, script is the only thing that was ok. But of course the cast elevated it.<br/><br/>Really an 8/10 but I'm evening out the rating."

It simply does not have enough screentime to make that possible - and thats funny, seeing how the movie already runs close to three hours.<br/><br/>The movie is looooooong. Is that a bad thing? Nope. The screentime is well deserved, but no kidding, when i left the theater it felt like i had spent 27 years there already. Again, the movie sure does need this, even though it can feel very longstretched at some bits. It does also heavily rely on the first chapter. While it was exciting seeing the young cast, it did not bring anything new into the movie except some new scares and also some refreshing for the adult counterparts. The movie does rely on quite a lot of cgi, and i cant push this enough. This movie would have been so much more effective without the cgi. Use practical effects. You do not hire someone like Javier Botet and then still rely on cgi.<br/><br/>But again, this movie is still amazing, and is a great addition to both the first chapter, but also the steven king universe in general. Wait, was that a Stephen king cameo i saw? Thats just flipping awesome. Now go watch this movie, but expect to spend atleast 27 years there."

My rule of thumb is that sequels are usually worse than the originals, but I don't think that is the case here. The adult versions of these actors not only greatly resembled the characters' looks, but they also captured the original attitudes EXTREMELY well. Bill Hader is worth seeing this movie alone, because his comedic moments are stellar.<br/><br/>As far as plot and story goes, this movie far exceeds the first one. Pennywise is also much more prevalent in this film, if that's even possible. Bill did a PHENOMENAL job in the first It and this one too. The special effects for this movie are also stunning. Way better than some other horror movies. What I also loved about this movie is that it had touching and funny moments mixed with the terrifying ones. It provided a great laugh and scare.

"aidanratesmovies","10","16","30","7 September 2019"," An Unforgettable Horror Epic (as promised)
","IT Chapter Two is a outstanding epic of horror and is truly a one of a kind sequel. My expectations for the film were high, considering I loved the first one and am a huge fan of the original novel, and i'm glad to say they were met. The story was handled almost perfectly in this adaptation, and brought a smile to my face nearly the whole runtime- which is surprisingly almost 3 hours long. Many may be affected by the runtime but I found it only appropriate considering the depths of story they delve into with each individual character, and I was pleased to see most of the routes they took to get there. The beginning of the film where they summarize what the adults have been up to, I will admit, is a bit choppy, but rightfully so, as it is probably the least important part of the film. Most likely the beginning was as edited as they could make it, as the filmmakers were probably trying to shorten the runtime as best they can, especially considering the film is so long already in the first place. Still, despite a long runtime, I would have much rather had a better conceived beginning to a film like this, rather than a forgettable one to a remarkable film. Besides that gripe of the film, the only other problem I had was some mediocre acting, also more towards the beginning of the film, but with only smaller characters. As for the things I liked about it, I found the film easily well crafted. The balance between the adult characters and the bits we see from the kids were handled oh so well, and all performances were needless to say brilliant. The casting for the grown up Losers is brilliant as well, with Bill Hader, James McAvoy, Isaiah Mustafa, and needless to say Bill Skarsgard returning as Pennywise the clown being the standouts for me. The film also has mostly clever pacing, and it's surprisingly funny, interesting, and downright creepy. It is easily a film that will not easily be forgotten, with excellent direction and executed atmosphere, fantastic visuals, and some obvious but well appreciated notalgia. It will be hard to pass another series of Stephen King books, or even a single book, as his best adaption after these two.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
"Anurag-Shetty","10","16","30","7 September 2019"," Perfect conclusion.
","It Chapter Two(based on the second half of Stephen King's novel) continues with the story of the Losers Club, 27 years after the events of It(2017). After facing off against the horrifying clown, Pennywise(Bill Skarsgard), Beverly(Jessica Chastain), Bill(James McAvoy), Richie(Bill Hader), Ben(Jay Ryan) & the rest of the Losers Club, have all grown up & left Derry. Then a shattering phone call, brings them all back to Derry.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is an excellent film. Director Andy Muschietti has retained all the ingredients that made It(2017), an absolute delight to watch. The horror set pieces have been perfectly blended with hilarious one-liners. There are one or two perfectly executed jump scares. The climactic set piece is awe-inspiring. However, if I had to choose, I'd say I liked It(2017) a tad bit better than this movie. The highlight of this franchise is that you care about every single main character. The younger cast's adult replacements are just as flawless & are a perfect match to their younger counterparts. Jessica Chastain is spectacular as Beverly Marsh. James McAvoy is outstanding as Bill Denbrough. Bill Hader is mind-blowing as Richie Tozier. Isiah Mustafa is great as Mike Hanlon. Jay Ryan is brilliant as Ben Hanscom. James Ransone is awe-inspiring as Eddie Kaspbrak. Andy Bean is good as Stanley Uris. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader, Mustafa, Ryan, Ransone & Bean share this natural camaraderie, that was also shared by the actors who played the younger versions of their characters in It(2017). Bill Skarsgard is the star of the show as Pennywise. Skarsgard once again gives his all, in his unforgettable performance as Pennywise. Jaeden Martell, Wyatt Oleff, Jack Dylan Grazer, Finn Wolfhard, Sophia Lillis, Chosen Jacobs & Jeremy Ray Taylor are amazing as the young versions of Bill Denbrough, Stanley Uris, Eddie Kaspbrak, Richie Tozier, Beverly Marsh, Mike Hanlon & Ben Hanscom, respectively. Teach Grant & Nicholas Hamilton are awesome as Henry Bowers & Young Henry Bowers, respectively. It Chapter Two is a must watch for fans of It(2017) & fans of Stephen King's source material. Go & experience a roller-coaster ride of emotions."

","As one of those who've read IT at least 6-7 times, I'm pleasantly surprised. Much better than chapter 1, this one sticks decently to the book. There's a lot of monster scares and such, but it's not too bothersome, though the movie's terror relies on those effects rather than the storytelling. Small changes to the storyline are acceptable, you'll see. It's not really a 10 movie, probably 7-8, but I'm going 10 to offset the haters. It's hard to get good book adaptations, especially King's stuff, so this movie is probably the best so far"

","Before watching ""It chapter two"" , I have predicted that this movie's going to be really disturbing like the previous one and I guess my prediction is correct. The monsters or ghosts are weird. I get dumbfounded and highly motivated after watching it.<br/><br/>My mental condition went up and down when I watched this because all the casts did freaking awesome job. They played with our minds.. There are a lot of scenes that will make you realize that your mind is the scariest. If you only wait for never ending jumping scare scenes, you'd better looked for other movies as this movie is super different with the others. The genre that this movie offers is more into psychological horror, so it is not only frightened your feeling but it also has something to do with your mind. Be careful."

They were remembering their childhood after all and the last time the characters were together was when they were kids so they acted based on their good childhood memories such as joking around about mothers and stuff kids their age do and had done last time they were together. The only disappointment was Pennywise not being on the moon when Henry Bowers was in the mental facility. I really wanted to see SkarsgÃ¥rd's face and voice on the moon. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will probably see it a second time in theaters."

"flameboy300","10","10","17","7 September 2019"," Great climax to modern horror
","Where to start. The problem I find with many horror films these days is that they either lack character depth, the story line and plot isn't that gripping or the special effects are lacking. However I feel that 'It: Chapter 2' does not have those problems. Firstly it fills in many blanks left from the first film through the second chapter. It also has a more adult feel to it but still hold on to the child like horror and scares from the first film. Many modern day horrors leave the feeling of 'well it was ok but it was wasn't scary enough or was not realistic enough' however I believe this film quashes all those perceptions of other horror films. In my opinion it is what avengers: endgame was to super hero movies, the best in its genre"

","As a fan of Stephen King novels, and especially IT, I absolutely loved these movies. The first chapter was great but certain lacked certain depth and story building. I understand this was due to the nature of the horror genre as it stands today and to keep audiences interested you need to saturate your film with ""gotcha"" moments (laughs or scares). I was able to overlook the lack of story or character backstory in chapter 1 mainly because of how great the kids were together and how absolutely terrifying Bill Skarsgard was as the clown.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 dove into the depths and explored the lore and the Losers club in a way that I was expecting some of the first chapter to. Again, I felt there were some weird and misplaced jokes in this one as well, but with a 3 hour runtime, and having to tackle such a complex story, I'm happy with what they managed to cover. The cast was yet again brilliant and Andy Muschietti's direction was incredible.<br/><br/>My verdict,<br/><br/>Beautiful and breathtaking set pieces, cast top notch, stays faithful to the book, Pennywise and his many forms were super cool, jokes and jumps land a little off at times but definitely one of the best King adaptations."
"rebeccarage-11322","9","10","17","7 September 2019"," IT CHAPTER TWO SPOILER FREE REVIEW ðŸŽˆ
","IT CHAPTER TWO, SPOILER FREE REVIEW.
I'll start with the positive. IT is basically Goonies for horror fans. Pure nostalgia. Wanting that last adventure with your friends before you're too old. (God that's depressing) Anyway, my biggest fear for this movie was that it would fail purely because let's face it in the book and the original mini series, the switch over to the kids from the adults is pretty boring. So I'm super happy to announce I needn't have worried, this switch over was seamless , it was cast perfectly to the point they looked like the kids had made a wish on Zoltar to be big, and I actually enjoyed this more than part one. The chemistry between the cast was spot on and I it felt like watching real friends. I was totally immersed in the story from start to finish, I didn't find myself zoning out for any of the run time.
Look out for the cameos and the nods to all your favourite 80's horror.
Ok now for the bad, same criticism as I had for the first one, TOO HEAVILY RELIANT ON CGI!! I thought there was missed opportunities for scares that were ruined by the heavy heavy CGI. Skarsgard has perfect control of Pennywise but when the CGI kicks in it becomes cartoonish. I don't wanna spoil it so I'll just bullet point the dodgy.
1. CGI
2. The first 15 minutes felt like a totally different film, that's not to say it wasn't good, just different. (And yes I've read the book)
3. CGI
4. Angel of the morning???
5. Small Pennywise
6. CGI
7. Too much Georgie
8. How much I cried in the end
9. The de-aging CGi and voice overs, especially Eddie.
10. Oh and as I final point did I mention the CGI?"
"jerrykcookus","9","10","17","6 September 2019"," An amazing piece of the big picture
","First of all, don't expect a ""horror"" movie. King's best attribute when telling a story is how amazing human beings can be and how powerful the mind and heart are. And Andy has this on full display in this second part of his screen adaptation.<br/><br/>If you have never read or even listened to an audio book of ""IT"", you're doing yourself a disservice. There are so many elements to the story that could easily make another 2-3 movies after this sequel. From the history of Derry, to the origins of IT, and even the macro-verse, so much is left out of the movies to simply tell the best version of the story.<br/><br/>The book is all over the place. There is no chronology as it mirrors each confrontation the losers have with IT back and forth from adulthood to childhood. In between these events we get sprinkles of deep character development, history, and cosmic spirituality.<br/><br/>This movie took the best, most screen adaptable parts and allowed us to follow the adult trials of the losers. Less time was spent on Audra (Bill's wife) and the night Bev and Bill spent together in the novel was simply a kiss in the movie. You could see the effect the ""love triangle"" had on Ben and how strong a person he really was by never allowing the others to know in order to maintain the bonds they had.<br/><br/>Over all, this telling of the story itself is light years ahead of the beloved mini series most of us watched. It focuses directly on the 7 and pennywise: the way he impacted their lives directly and indirectly, the love they have for each other, and how powerful connections with others and the mind can be when focused on a collective goal.<br/><br/>The CGI was better than the previous movie, but still not great. That is the only reason I gave a 9."

SFX / Sound Design: Powerful, interesting
Pacing: Not rushed
Casting: Unbelievable (might be the first time you'd think ""they got it right"")
VFX: Far beyond expectation in execution and artistry
Originality: Meets expectations, exceeds projections
Transitions: Synchronous, hypnotic
Emotional shifts: Rich, if not slightly exhausting<br/><br/>The scares were exhilarating and did not leave the imagination wanting for any greater payoff than what was abundantly delivered.
The scare-reveals far exceeded expectation in their detail, artistry and morbidity.
The score was markedly brilliant and matched the theatrical expectation of a cinematic experience.
The sound design and voice modulation SFX were crisp, with rich harmonics, overtones and punchy bass.
The casting decisions prove: that careful effort will produce amazing results
for continuity-in-storytelling and suspension of disbelief; expertly executed here -in multiple ways.<br/><br/>The presentation of victimization by the antagonist is so talent-fully executed,
the audience feels split between sadness and satisfaction as characters meet their demise.<br/><br/>One scene, truly emulates what it might be like for a mammal to act like a reptile;
and how it might go about doing so -right at the exact moment its prey finds itself
entirely inside that predator's kill zone (cheers to the actor, director and editor).<br/><br/>This film genuinely straddled two incompatible worlds fluidly; one of horror, shock, torment and terror; with another of actuality per how humans speak and think, how they make decisions differently from each other, and somehow too;
a parallel world where humor remains a legitimate mode of thought even despite
any level of absurdity-of-circumstance.<br/><br/>This film can be watched -easily once every year and half or so, with friends or by oneself; and not be bored. Other films like 2001, The Goonies, Caddyshack -all also have this quality.<br/><br/>The theater staff DID float a red helium filled balloon inside the room during the film; causing the words ""oh (hell) no, oh (hell) no..."" to be audible from folks in the back of the theater LOL!<br/><br/>All in all; very satisfying.

Very well acted, I especially loved James McAvoy, clever casting.<br/><br/>On the downside, it's the scariest, most messed to book I've ever read, that horror didn't translate well, I felt like I was watching an adventure thriller for teens at times, it had lots going on, lots of thrills, but horror? No. It was a bit formulaic, each character hot their respective item, and each was terrorised one by one, it needed more surprises, more shocks.<br/><br/>I preferred the first part, but I think they did a good job here, I hope it's released with both chapters linked.

The movie had everything that a horror movie could possibly have to make it entertaining and a bit scary. The fact that they can add comedy into it without being cheesy was great. I don't see that too often. Sometimes comedy works with horror and sometimes it doesn't. For the most part, people seemed to love the movie based off of the reviews I've read, not just on here but on social media as well. However, I still decided to see it despite the few negative reviews. Sometimes you can't please people. Also, people compare this to the 1st one an awful lot and some think the 1st one is better. I couldn't disagree more. I like part 2 the best. To be honest, I've never seen the original 80s version of these films so I cannot compare the two, nor do I want to.

","It's so good, it doesn't feel like 3 hours at all! Comparing to Avengers where i and other friends of mine always sleep watching all of them, i find that NO ONE in our theatre even went to the toilet while it runs. Everyone seems like enjoying it. The humor, the scare (yep jumpscare included), the drama, and Losers Club chemistry were perfect. Feel like they're really bestfriends even though adult Losers looked like don't have strong bond as when they're kids. It's much better then the what 1990 miniseries actors show back then. They didnt feel like close at all. And i lovee the way they show Chud ritual, and use bullying as how to defeat Pennywise (since they knew how little they felt when being bullied). Some cameos are exhilarating! I try my best to not screaming or clapping inside 🤣<br/><br/>Since i joined in some of Stephen King fans groups, i can tell You guys that most of avid fans who read the book were satisfied and absolutely loooove this movie. I mean it's a huge thing! Since Stephen King's Constant Readers (as any other authors constant readers) were hard to impressed. Some fans even already watched the movie for 3-5 times cause we find more easter eggs and hidden message everytime we rewatched it.<br/><br/>Dear people who go all out saying how much You hate it and give ridiculously 0-1 stars, what You did isn't cool.

"Duveteux","9","9","15","7 September 2019"," King's realm
","This recent incarnation of It is not scary, but I still love both films regardless. They feel really true to the 80s/90s adaptations of King, which are indefinitely flawed and stray from the origin stories, as well, and arguably they are not very scary, either...<br/><br/>There is a massive preference for humour over scares in the second instalment, which I actually think is a wise move.
It starts off uncomfortable and dark with the homophobic attack from the book and you think It has also come of age and that the film will be more adult in theme, but as soon as the Losers are back together you also feel like you're in the company of friends again. It becomes, like the first film, a story of friendship and overcoming personal demons rather than a horror story.<br/><br/>I was worried the adult cast would ruin the warm feelings I had for the Losers, because the kids were so great. I would only question Mike's portrayal which is unhinged and considering he plays the pivotal role in the book as the narrator, he comes across like he's just lost his mind in this film and he's the least likeable or noticeable character... The book gives the black guy the ONLY voice for once by making him the narrator and that is completely diminished in this film, which I do have a problem with.
Derry is a rotten and prejudiced place, regardless of whether the clown has an influence over that or is to blame for that (I don't believe It is the cause, I think King was commenting on the evil in humanity and the clown just takes advantage of the fear we create in our own communities) and it's important to keep that at the forefront. It is always going to be relevant.<br/><br/>It feels like the same kind of production as Christine and Thinner and Dreamcatcher and Stand By Me and Creepshow and the original Pet Sematary. And the King cameo helps this film feel like it's a nostalgic, warm and familiar place to be, too. We are back in Maine and back in King's bizarre and surreal realm where let's face it, even if It was a perfect adaptation of the book, everyone would still exit the cinema with similar questions!"

"alexaserra","8","8","13","11 September 2019"," Not perfect but still pretty good
","It chapter 2 is a good movie. Not perfect by any means but still stands up on it's own. It's not a sequel, it's the second part of a whole story which is too long and complex (as is the book) to fit into one continuous film, hence the 3 hr running time. A lot of bad reviews derive from this fact so let me tell you something. We are watching a movie based on a 1200 page book with 8 main characters (It+losers club), and I'm not counting Derry which is a main character in of its own. You have to develop 8 main stories, not once (Childhood), not twice (Adulthood) but three times (Flashbacks). You have to intertwine them and elaborate on a lot of detail. Granted, there is A LOT of dragging in some parts but you can't tell a story that has so many details and it's so complex in less than two hours. It just wouldn't stand.<br/><br/>The casting and acting are both outstanding. The under-use of Skarsgard as Pennywise is criminal, this movie needed more of him on screen. King's cameo is genius. Very tasteful and surprising not to mention well deserved.<br/><br/>They definitely went overboard with the CGI and poorly timed comedy. It takes away from the dark and ominous mood of some scenes. Also, Too many CGI loaded jump scares, it desensitizes the audience and turns horror into comedy.<br/><br/>But despite its flaws, I welcome this movie to my list of top horror movies of the last 20 years. It's a very well crafted, adapted, produced, acted and shot piece of cinematography that does absolute justice to the book that birthed it."

Not once to I hear I single scream out of anyone, after almost 3 hours I didn't jump once. The ""monsters"" looked like they were straight out of the goosebumps movie, just over the top CGI.

"onlineoutlaw","8","6","9","9 September 2019"," IT Was a Great...Comedy?
","Yes, you read that correctly. Comedy. This movie had the tone of not wanting to take itself seriously and simultaneously wanting to be your standard, cliche drama/horror film. Honestly, I loved it, and thought it was genuinely funny. Call me heartless or sadistic, but I let out some chuckles when Pennywise struck three of his four victims (the exception being Eddie, that death was actually done a lot better in terms of emotion in this film than the Tim Curry miniseries). Here's why, though: I can't take the thought of some killer clown that sounds like Winnie The Pooh on a bad day (I kept waiting for him to say ""Oh bother"" during the film) seriously in the slightest. There were maybe three parts in the entire film that made me genuinely startled, and of course they were the jumpscares I saw coming. My brain has yet to learn after all this time to always expect it to happen at any time. Now, I went to see this movie last night only because my friends had goaded me into it, because I've never really been a fan of present day horror films or It in general. I'll watch the original miniseries if I'm bored or really want to see one of the subjectively best performances Tim Curry has given in his entire career of acting. But I ended up loving this movie, not because I liked the source material, not because it was a good movie, but because it went from being overly brutal (like the scene of Adrian being beaten by those teens at the beginning) to so over to top to genuinely funny, I couldn't place any emotion to feel but joy and humor for just how far this movie would go to try and be creepy. Other scenes like the final fight between the gang and Pennywise (besides the incredibly annoyingly over the top part where Georgie kept yelling ""You lied and I died"" during Bill's last hallucination scene--One time would've done it for me, but the creepy factor went sour with an overexaggerated performance), the scene where Mike drugs Eddie so he can see his visions and memories, and one other scene I can't seem to remember as of right now (but it caught my attention for sure) were pretty cool and interesting scenes. The camera angles and some of the transitions were very smooth and construed all the emotion I needed to feel during said scenes. The one time I was genuinely confused and could only laugh by cracking a joke related to one of our friends was the scene where Beverly visits her old apartment and runs into the old lady who decides to strip and chase Bev through the apartment complex. Though I must say, while I was completely indifferent towards this just like with 90% of the 90s miniseries, this time around the story was actually memorable to me. Likely because I actually enjoyed it, as was mentioned before. Whether or not the writers or anyone else involved aimed at it to be an unexpected comedy horror is unknown to me, but if it was meant to be genuinely scary, that makes it all that much better. So if you want a great laugh and ponder upon whether or not the movie knows what genre it wants to be, I definitely recommend this movie (plus there's a cameo by Stephen King!!! :D). Cheers!"

","What i really liked about this movie was the fact that the ending was a real ending. The book is closed and there are no further questions. The story however of chapter 2 can be told in much less than 3 hours. The shocking parts were good but it wasnt really scary. I also didnt like the fact that pennywise hasnt talked as much as in the first movie. Chapter one was much better to my opinion. The shocking parts in chapter one for example were better, but also the way they portrayed pennywise."

","IT Chapter Two is the most recent movie I have seen this year. So it is still fresh in my mind. Having said, this movie had a lot of potential to be great. Let's start off with the Cast. Nothing was wrong with the Cast at all. Every Actor and Actress were so perfect for the older Losers Club. (Especially Bill Hader). On a Comedy level this movie is great just like the first. But unfortunately the scares were average. Though a scene when Pennywise eats a kid with McAvoys character in a glass maze was one of the film's best scenes. This movie also starts off really strong when one half of a couple is
the first victim of Pennywises' return. The 2nd act is where this movie loses its steam. Right where the characters wander off on their own to find out why they've return to the town gets really slow. (Also the movie never really touches on why the Losers Club can't remember almost anything. It's just glossed over) Fortunately, the movies 3rd act is solid and redeems the very slow 2nd act. The wrap up for the movies is strong. I still recommend seeing this movie if you were a fan of the first movie. Just don't go into it thinking it's going to be GREAT."

Never seen anything like it. It has a dark ominous tone that you would expect, sandwiched with comedic one-liners and disturbing but funny imagery (i.e. what a Pomeranian looks like if you're on a bad acid-trip, ha ha).

","This takes all the things we love about the first- humor, scary factor, characters- and seems to amplify it. It isn't as witty as the first and seems to rely more on excessive cursing for the comedy, but makes up for it plenty with the plot. There is much more gore and jump scares in this one than the first- and I found it to be slightly less scary- most ""scary"" scenes were shrouded with comedy. Aside from that, the true beauty of this film is the character development- we learn much more about the characters, their secrets, hidden fears, their pasts, what became of them, etc. and it does a good job of executing the character arcs. Most of all, the ending is absolutely beautiful, and the way they wrapped up the story and the characters was done very well. The ending monologue is a tear jerker. I'd say that aside from a few flaws, it was slightly stronger than the first."

","When seeing It chapter 2 is like going on a rollercoaster it's scary weird and it make you feel uncomfortable!<br/><br/>The most intressting parts in It chapter 2 whas when everyone was looking for their own tokens with all the flashbacks with each of them got scared by pennywise. It also made me glad that i as a watcher haven't thought about what happend when they where splitted up and thats so fun that the filmmaker thought about so many details to make it even more intressting.<br/><br/>What It chapter 2 stick it out from the first one is that it takes up more important subject like the rage that Bill had over Georges death and the depression you feel with Beverly after what she had gone thrue and when stanley realize that suicide is the only way for him to make it stop.<br/><br/>
I know many of you though it was to long and i personally feel like it's a good thing cause then the filmaker really got their time to fill in intressting parts and not make it like a deleted scene or just cut it afterworth. I also heard that people wasn't happy with the ending and i can see that but i also think it's hard to make a (not lame) villian death .<br/><br/>Why i gave this movie 8 and not 10 whas that it was a little bit to messy sometimes and could have made it's backstory a little bit better!"
"hiraishinnojutsu","9","7","11","8 September 2019"," 9/10, if you consider this as not a horror but a fantasy movie
","The Guys (and girl) back at it again! After 27 years had passed, the evil entity that is a metaphor for humanities' fears and negative emotions/thoughts/feelings is back to haunt them again by utilizing chilling illusions backed by great VFX to remind them of their childhood pains and fears. Great storytelling, as each of the protagonists experience the return of the demon by their own unique way, where each is pushed emotionally to the brink of madness, but at the same time, helps them to find and gain strength to unite and move forward in order to kick the devil's clown ass back to oblivion, but this time, it'll be once and for all (without another 27, 54, 81, or 108 years of waiting to return). I love the added childhood flashbacks which, to me, give the first movie more color than it does to the last one while also giving us one important message: not all frightening childhood is bad in the long run as it can also bind people together with unbreakable bonds even after separated for nearly 3 decades, and a little loss of memory of a particular event and place. There is one more important message in the final moments of the film which I'm not gonna mention here, I urge you to go watch it by yourself because the ending is very beautiful, comparable to the last year's 'Blade Runner 2049'. Don't listen to the critic too much for you will find it's beauty that they will never discover."

They could've done better to film."
"eelen-seth","8","7","11","8 September 2019"," A frightening yet touching story of forgotten friendship and lost opportunities.
","The sequel to the 2017 box office success 'It' starts exactly where it left off. Almost no explanatory flashbacks to the situations the Losers Club got themselves into, fighting the terrifying Pennywise. Only difference in 'It Chapter Two' - they're all grown up and ready to end It, once and for all.<br/><br/>27 years ago, a fear-indulging creature tried to feast on every teenager alive in small town Derry. A group of friends, defeated the being (disguised as a clown) and moved on with their lives. Or so we think.. After a brutal killing one evening, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) decides to call every single one of his old friends, begging them to come back to their hometown. Barely remembering the events of almost three decades ago, they catch up over dinner and drinks and memories start to flow back. Sooner than they'd expect, It strikes again and the returning members of the Losers Club feel betrayed by Mike, luring them in knowing well enough they'd have to fight their common enemy once again. Mike did a whole lot of research to figure out It's origin and also knows how to defeat this being. But our group of friends has to stick together to successfully finish this fight against evil.<br/><br/>Andy Muschietti is back to direct the second chapter to the well known Stephen King novel. It seems like he grew up, just like the Losers Club did. The jokes matured, as did certain subjects within the story (domestic abuse, sexual orientation..). Another impressive note is Benjamin Wallfisch's score. Simply eerie and unsettling. While I thought his score for 'It' was a bit bland and boring to listen to without the visuals, he decides to go bigger and bolder in this film and it really pays off.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of inventive sequences, which sometimes will blow your mind in how well constructed they are. A few of them are re-used from the previous chapter, but in a different and more terrifying way. The production design is next level perfect. While I thought 'It' relied heavier on jump scares, Chapter Two uses them less. There are still quite a few of them that actually work, but they don't seem as forced as the ones that came before. Whenever a new CGI-monster comes along, you simply ask yourself who designed these creatures. Some are straight up nightmare fuel.<br/><br/>For fans of the younger cast, don't worry, they are still present through the use of flashbacks. But the focus is all on the adult versions this time. The true standout is by far Bill Hader, who plays grown up Richie - an alcoholic stand up comedian with a secret he can't seem to express to the outside world. His acting and comedic timing breaks some of the horror-tension, but never in a way it becomes annoying. He's genuinely enjoyable to watch and has an emotional arc to feel for. Other surprisingly great performances come from James Ransone (grown up Eddie) and Jessica Chastain (adult Beverly). James McAvoy (adult Bill) isn't bad, but it seems like he's playing one of his personalities from Split/Glass, with his accent being a bit too thick and an over-the-top lisp. While Mustafa, Jay Ryan (Ben) and Andy Bean (Stanley) just didn't get enough screen time to be rememberable. Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise, and while I thought he was brilliant in 'It', I kept wondering how much CGI they used to put him in this film. It became quite distracting, especially in the second half.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is the better half of the story, which explores the very interesting origin of this evolving menacing force and shows the devastating consequences of its wrongdoings towards a group of children. It not only shows that it's okay to be a loser or someone that doesn't entirely fit in to today's society, it makes us think of what we are capable of by just believing in ourselves. A frightening yet touching story of forgotten friendship and lost opportunities."
"vwheable","2","7","11","7 September 2019"," Hugely Disappointing
","After looking forward to this film for so long, I was really expecting to enjoy it. How wrong I was! The story makes no sense at all, and the scenes just felt randomly put together at times. Every time Pennywise appears it feels like the same scene over and over... no new scares. There were two memorable scenes in the whole film, and they were both in the advert. Save your money!"
"sirfran","9","7","11","7 September 2019"," IT Chapter One is Pennywise's Film, this is a film about the Losers
","This is less of a horror film and more of a character driven film. This is about the characters and with a perfect cast featuring a stand out (and an arguably oscar-worthy performance by the brilliant Bill Hader) It Chapter Two provides an interesting and thoughtful story that suffers from some non-traditional pacing issues. This movie is long at 2 hours and 50 minutes, but there is a whole hour missing to this film and with IT being one of my favorite novels, the pacing issues aren't because it is slow or too quick, but rather it certainly feels like there is a lot missing (for example, without providing spoilers, a specific character has much more to do, but instead he is introduced and does a couple things much later on and there is a lot more to his arch that I assume was already filmed).<br/><br/>This isn't a scary movie and it isn't supposed to be a scary movie. This is a film about the characters and that is the film's biggest strength. Now we need the 4 hour cut of this film that director Andy Muschetti said existed."

"stevendbeard","8","7","11","7 September 2019"," Nice Conclusion
","I saw ""It Chapter Two"", starring Jessica Chastain-Dark Phoenix, Interstellar; James McAvoy-Atomic Blonde, The Last King of Scotland; Bill Hader-Barry_tv, 22 Jump Street and Bill Skarsgard-Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde.
This is not really a sequel but more of a part 2 to the 2017 remake. It is best if you have seen chapter one because the kids from that one are in this one too, both in new and old scenes from chapter one. The adults playing the kids are all pretty good matches in looks-you might think that it is what they would really look like as adults. This is also not one to take the little kiddies to-I saw several people with little ones in tow, including a few babies. I guess they couldn't get a babysitter. Anyway, if you saw chapter one, you know that Pennywise pops up every 27 years and terrorizes the citizens of the little town of Derry. Jessica, James and Bill H, along with the rest of the Losers, get a phone call from one of their group, telling them it's been 27 years and it's time to come back to Derry to put an end to Pennywise, played magnificently by Bill S. All except for one of them have moved away and moved on with their lives-the one that stayed in town is the one that called them all back. Some of them are reluctant to come back but they did make a blood pact when they were kids. The violence is much more graphic and there is some partial nudity-don't get too excited, it is not a very pretty site. You do get to see Bill S out of his Pennywise make_up and Stephen King makes a cameo appearance-keep an eye out for the shop owner selling a bicycle.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.
I thought it was a nice conclusion to the first part and I would buy it on Blu_Ray."

I was honestly impressed because not does it feel like a natural conclusion to the first chapter, but it is also a great film in its own.<br/><br/>I will not talk about the story in order not to spoil it, but I will say it is very well written, some changes have been made from the original novel to make it much more cinematic, but they work, they do so astoundingly as it is a really great movie, its writing is pretty solid.<br/><br/>The performances are amazing for the most part, James McAVoy, Jessica Chastain, and Bill Hader are amazing as the grown-up versions of Bill, Beverly and Richie, but I will say that acting-wise it felt as if the rest of the Losers were not as good as their younger counterparts, history does repeat itself it seems.<br/><br/>I have to dedicate an entire section to the astounding performance of Bill Skarsgård, he is nothing short of amazing and my only grief is that he does not have as much screen time as I would have liked, but his performance is terrifying, give this man an Oscar.<br/><br/>All in all, I found this sequel to be awesome, I will give it 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>This spectacle led by the ever capable Andy Muschietti is a satisfying conclusion to the story, and when you watch it, and you should watch it, you'll all float too."

"anupapu8","9","7","11","6 September 2019"," ll time favorite Horror Movie.
","IT CHAPTER : 2 - Damn this movie was so satisfying and fulfilling. i loved it. It gave me a completion which satisfied my inner heart. A satisfaction almost on the level of completion what Harry Potter 8 and Dark Knight Rises gave me (well yes slightly less than those two movies , but you can understand what i am trying to say). Its has now became my most favorite Horror Movie of all time.<br/><br/>Chapter 1 was a really awesome movie by itself. And to top that was almost an impossible hurdle. And from most of the reactions and reviews it seems like the audience is not exactly satisfied with the film. I don't understand what they were expecting. For me the last movie in any series must give you the feeling that this was the way it must have ended. Just like Dark Knight Rises was not needed to be like Dark Knight. It had to be something altogether different because it was the concluding movie and it did that particular thing brilliantly. That same thing is now done by IT CHAPTER : 2 , at least for me.<br/><br/>OK first and foremost i am gonna address the things which has been criticized most about the movie by the reviewers.<br/><br/>1] Was it a movie too long than it actually should have been ? No. Not at all . I was never bored. Yes there were 1 or 2 scenes which could have been edited. But that would have shortened the movie by may be only 5 mins. Which would have been totally meaningless. In-fact i was so much involved in the atmosphere of the movie that i could have happily seen 15 more mins of this movie.<br/><br/>2] Was the D-Aging of Child Artists for flashback scenes too distracting ? Hell No. I wouldn't even has recognized those effects if i haven't read about the same thing in the reviews before watching the film.<br/><br/>3] Was the ending too bad? No No No. I don,t understand why the ending of this movie (which is also the ending of the book) has been disliked by so many people. Its good. Simple yet effective.<br/><br/>4] Lastly did the flashback scenes were unnecessary for the film? Are you kidding me. Those were some of the greatest scenes of the movie. So great that if those scenes would have been in the first movie instead of this one than the first one could been a better movie by itself. But that would have made this one lesser good.<br/><br/>So that's about wrap up all the complaints. Now about what i liked? The VISUAL EFFECTS mixed with PRACTICAL EFFECTS and PRODUCTION DESIGN was the top thing about this movie. Oscar nomination worthy. The 70m$ spent on the movie (doubling the budget of the first one) was clearly visible on the screen. And the money has been spent in a very innovative way. This one is also definitely the most Beautiful (in a horrific , scary and dark way) looking movie of all time.<br/><br/>Then obviously comes the Cast. Bill Skarsgård has made Pennywise so much his own as much as Heath ledger had made Joker of his own. There is nothing much to say about him. He was just out of this world in a very crazy way. But the standout performance of this film was Bill Hader. His comic timing, was 200% spot-on. There were so many awkward situation where the writer has given him the jokes that any other actor could have done wrong. But not him. I also loved the fact that neither the director nor James McAvoy & Jessica Chastain tried to use their Stardom too much. They both just mixed-up with the bigger assemble cast and never tried to chew the scenes anymore than needed. Not a single actor has done a job which is below good.<br/><br/>The background score was a little underdone than the first part. i would have liked more creepiness. But it was not bad at all. Same goes for the cinematography which goes perfectly with the movie but didn't stand out as the first movie did.<br/><br/>The last showdown ? O my my. It was so good. So great. Pretty long (in a very satisfying kind of way where you don't want something to end very quickly). i cant praise enough that particular act. It was heart crunching, in a literal way.<br/><br/>And than there was the extended ending. So emotional. Such a tribute to true friendship and nature of scarifies. Very very very fulfilling.<br/><br/>O yes, almost forgot (because i never watch Horror movies as just Horror movies), this one definitely had larger number (and better too) of horror scenes than the first one. I judged that by the number of screams i was hearing from the audience.<br/><br/>So just watch it<br/><br/>8.8/10<br/><br/>by ANuP APu KuMaR"

","The casting of this was great and I was hoping for a good send off for this story. Sadly Ch 2 is mediocre, sluggish, and too long. As a King fan I am familiar with this story so I know how the book ended and I didn't expect the movie to be exactly like the book but some of the changes they made were so different from what King wrote that it just doesn't sit well.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>The losers kill pennywise by forcing the creature into a baby's form and then tearing it's heart out and smashing it as a group. The reason I have an issue with this being the ending is we see the characters we are supposed to love and relate to who have been bullied their entire lives become what they hate the most, bullies. They have to defeat the dark by becoming dark themselves. I personally didn't like this and I don't understand the point of turning the losers into bullies to kill pennywise. I'm not sure why they chose to turn the losers into what they stood against so they could defeat pennywise but I thought it was a bad ending. I would've rather seen the ending how it was in the book.<br/><br/>All of that aside parts 1&2 combined equal almost 5 & a half hours, there is too much unnecessary material here for the average viewers and they should've just had one long movie. Chapter 1 didn't have any pacing issues but this one felt extremely sluggish in parts and like some of the scenes were just rehashed from the other film.

At two hours fifty minutes, it could easily lose an hour's running time with little difficulty - a generic 'getting the gang back together' riff being one of the chief offenders. It drags so much, that by the time the final hour or so rolls around, I was just tired. It's a pretty diverting final hour, but it too is needlessly extended.

When will filmmakers understand that every truly scary, tense and memorable horror film contains very little in the special effects dept, instead depending on atmosphere, credible performances and great writing/directing...(Phantasm, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974, The Exorcist, Hereditary, Dawn of The Dead 1978, Suspiria 1976, It Follows, Hour of the Wolf, Nosferatu 1922 and 1979)...the exception probably being The Thing 1982 which is very poorly referenced in this shambles.

Sprawling but structurally-unsound and meandering horror story is full of hoary convolutions (including ""rules"" delivered with such solemnity they can't possibly be taken seriously) and repeats scare sequences with too little variety; as in the first film, when the ""jumps"" arrive, they're followed by explosive laughter instead of screams (despite Skarsg책rd's best efforts, his ""clown prince of evil"" is still far sillier than it is terrifying). Only Hader really stands out among the main cast, and he provides the intentional jests to go along with the inadvertent variety; the film's potential status as an accidental comedic masterstroke, however, is spoiled by far too many profitless detours and flashback reiterations that drag this thing out close to three hours. The protracted climactic showdown provides yet another piece of evidence in the argument that gargantuan digital effects do not mix well with fright flicks.

","Terrible. Of all of the horrors I've seen, I've never been as disappointed.<br/><br/>Just how part 2 can differ so vastly to the first I don't know. Part 1 had a natural chemistry between the actors, who we could all root for and feel part of the action. It was succinct and not drawn out, and whilst a bit silly in parts, I very much enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Part 2, I could go on for hours, but we don't need that. But what I didn't need was gratuitous CGI to generate any possible horror character any 10 year old child has ever dreamt up. Zombies, skulls with spider legs, flaming skeletons, you name it and it's in there.
That would be fine, if it actually suited the plot or storyline and wasn't just thrown in as an excuse to create a computerised monster for the sake of it, like some form of horror bamzooki.<br/><br/>Indian tribal rituals and shouting nasty words like ""Bully"" and in fact calling a clown, a clown, is the answer to defeating this extremely powerful being that can generate some form of photosynthetic energy through the back of its head to incapacitate all the cast. I should have seen that one coming!
An absolute shambles from start to finish and under no circumstances did the thinly built plot require a 3 hour cinematic.<br/><br/>To think of how strong the message and storyline is from the book and original film/series, yet this far into movie making that's the best we can do?<br/><br/>Skarsgard's acting, of which there is not enough of, is mesmerising and the only saving grace.

","Review:
Well, that's 3 hours of my life that I won't be getting back! I was really disappointed with this film because the plot is all over the place, and the whole back and forth in time thing, made the movie drag. The horrific Pennywise scenes were a bit random, and I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters like I did in the first film. On the plus side, there are some ""jump out of your seat"" moments, which were pretty scary, but you don't get to appreciate the attention to detail because it's mostly shot with a dark palette. I did enjoy the first movie, which is why I was so disappointed with this sequel, and I personally don't know why it's nearly 3 hours long. Anyway, in 2016 Derry, Maine, Don Hagarty witnesses his boyfriend Adrian Mellon being murdered by Pennywise after a gang of homophobic teenagers beat them up and throw Adrian off a bridge while leaving the annual Derry carnival. Overhearing a police scanner, Mike Hanlon (Isiah Mustafa) discovers It has returned and calls his childhood friends, Bill (James McAvoy), Eddie (James Ransone), Richie (Bill Hader), Ben (Jay Ryan), Stanley (Andy Bean), and Beverly (Jessica Chastain), back to Derry to honour the promise they made in 1989, to kill It if it came back. While the others travel to Derry with only hazy memories and a sense of dread, Stan slashes his wrists in the bathtub soon after getting the call. The Losers meet for dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where Mike refreshes their memories, while they are tormented by hallucinations and learn of Stan's death. Richie and Eddie decide to leave until Beverly reveals that ever since she was exposed to Its Deadlights, she has been experiencing visions of their deaths should they fail to leave town without fulfilling their promise. Mike takes Bill to his library abode and shows him, via a drug-induced vision, that they can stop It for good. After the others agree to perform the ritual, Mike explains that the ritual requires seven personal items from there past to be sacrificed. Henry Bowers, who survived being pushed into the well at the Neibolt house and was arrested for murdering his father in 1989, escapes from a mental institution with help from It. Meanwhile, in the Losers old clubhouse, Mike advises the others to find their artefacts by retracing their steps following their falling out after first entering the Neibolt house. Beverly finds Ben's love letter at her old home, still believing Bill wrote it and encounters It posing as Mrs. Kersh. Ben recalls his childhood encounter with It at high school before realising his artefact is the yearbook page Beverly signed which he kept in his wallet. Both Richie and Eddie recall their own personal encounters with It while retrieving their artefacts, a game token from an abandoned arcade, and an inhaler. Pennywise taunts Richie about his sexuality, leading to him deciding to leave again and reconsidering again after recalling Stan's bar mitzvah, before menacing Eddie in the guise of the Leper, but flees when Eddie standing up to It causes the being to shrink in size. Bill finds his childhood bicycle and recovers the paper boat from the storm drain where Georgie was killed. The group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers, and they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth ages ago. The ritual appears to work in trapping the Deadlights in the sealing jar, but they escape after It emerges from the jar in a giant spider-like form. Will the Losers finally kill It with there new ammunition? You have to watch the 3-hour epic movie to find out! Although they used established actors in this movie, and they gave each of the characters some depth, I didn't feel the emotion that I did in the first film. Also, the storyline didn't seem to flow properly because it looked like various sketches pieced together. In terms of a horror film, it didn't have the same shock value as the first film, and for a movie in this genre with a 15 rating, I don't know what type of audience this was made for. With that aside, it still made a profit so I wouldn't be surprised to see a third movie in this franchise. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Andy Muschietti, who also brought you Mama and It. With only 3 major releases, he has done a good job, in terms of box office takings, and now that he's working with established actors, the only way is up for this newcomer. With 9 movies in development, which include Dracul, Time Machine, Attack on Titan, The Howling, Robotech, and DC's, The Flash, which is due to be released in 2022, he's obviously become a bankable director that studios are willing to take a risk with.<br/><br/>Budget: $79million
Worldwide Gross: $473million<br/><br/>Genre: Drama, Fantasy, Horror
Cast: Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, Andy Bean, Bill Skarsgard, Javier Botet and Xavier Dolan. 4/10"

","Another load of crap basically. The previous, updated It (one) was full of awful child actors who had no idea how to act. This sequel is full of overacting (except Jessica Chastain, of course) whose lines were so childish and... simple... or even cartoon-like script. This is no movie! This is some dirt that someone has scraped off the pavement (Gary Dauberman is the guilty party here) and served to a gullible public.
I tried to like this film (after trying to watch it twice) but each time I just switched off and thought, Nah, this is just rubbish. Even though Stephen King is vastly overrated, I thought maybe a Setphen King sequel not written by him might be good... but nah... this is bad, really bad.

","To the guys at the top, that's an easy answer. Yes.<br/><br/>To the general public. Probably.<br/><br/>To the Stephen King fan. No.<br/><br/>Obviously covering an over 1000 page adaption is going to run into problems having just 6 hours to do so. But even at that, there was plenty of wasted time (especially in Episode 2) that could have been cut for more of the novels material. Just little things like explaining why it's an eye that comes out off Richies fortune cookie or a dead baby bird out Mikes. There's just so much that could have been changed and made no difference to the time. I mean, how much more would it have taken to show Beverley seeing that the doorbell said ""Marsh"" at first, then it change to ""Kersh"". The end ""fight scene"" was ALWAYS going to be a nightmare to put in front of an audience as it's easier in the book when you can let your imagination do the work and I think that's why there's the running joke all out through the movie about Bill's books having bad endings. The twist at the end was kinda cool and I actually hoped that they'd do it this way rather than the book as it's heartbreaking to see them forgetting who each other is all over again.<br/><br/>All in all it is a fine movie but there's no scares whatsoever and it just seems like some different shape of the actual ""IT"" is tearing towards the camera shaking their heads in a weird way (think the alley scene in ""Jacob's Ladder"").<br/><br/>Worth it for a one, maybe two time watch and overall for the series together:<br/><br/>Chapter One - 8

","This movie is somewhat of a bland and substance-less
Movie with aspects that fall short. It: chapter two is the second half of its succesful predecessor and story.
Based on Stephen kings best selling novel, it does not stay true to its roots of horror. This movie relies heavily on jumpscares and never truly makes us feel afraid and anxious as the first one did. It was a fun experience and a enjoyable movie, but a disappointing let down since it is a step back from the first movie. The atmosphere is off and not fearful, and the movie feels as if it was made for pre-schoolers, and maybe then, it would not enduce as much fear as the first one. The absolute most disappointing part is the build up to the return of pennywise the clown. It's anti-climactic feeling of powerlessness that pennywise carries is saddening. It: chapter one portrays pennywise as the devil, the monster, the all powerful clown, and it: chapter two portrays him as a lacklustre man in clown make-up trying to get revenge on the losers' club, even though he show's his cosmic power."
"paul_haakonsen","6","2","2","6 October 2019"," Not as good as the first chapter...
","In comparison to the first chapter of this remake, then the 2019 ""It: Chapter Two"" was just a massive step back in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>Why? Well, first of all, Pennywise wasn't scary at all. In fact, it was progressively getting more and more difficult to take him serious as an embodiment of evil as the movie progressed, because he was just too goofy. And whereas he was genuinely disturbing in the first chapter, the clown was just loosing it in chapter two.<br/><br/>And running at close to three hours, ""It: Chapter Two"" was just too long, and too much of a drag to sit through, especially when so much of the contents just felt like it was there to fill in the movie and add to the play time of the movie. There were so many things that could easily have been trimmed away without the storyline suffering.<br/><br/>The CGI was good, and definitely carried the movie a long way. But some of the CGI such as the long-limbed old woman chasing Beverly was just too comical and didn't really feel like it fit into the movie.<br/><br/>It was nice that they actually had Stephen King himself in the movie for a short cameo.<br/><br/>They had a good selection of casted actors and actresses to perform in the movie as the adult versions of the children that Pennywise stalked and fought. It was really nice to see James McAvoy in the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this wasn't really a fulfilling conclusion of the first chapter, and I was left with a feeling of 'was that really it?' when the movie ended.

","After what I thought was a brilliant first installment of ""It"" by director Andy Muschietti, I felt this follow up was somewhat anti-climactic. While the first film had some genuinely horrifying and unexpected moments, this one seemed to tread on the borders of the phantasmagorical with a make it up as you go sensibility. As adults, the members of the original 'Loser's Club' didn't appear to have the same camaraderie so much as a duty to return to Derry and battle the malevolent evil that resurfaced after twenty seven years. I did get a kick out of the Stephen King cameo, and it would have been neat if the name of his character's antique shop was called 'Needful Things'. There was also that nod to ""The Shining"" with the 'Here's Johnny' sequence played a couple of times during that frantic exchange. It probably didn't help that I had a hard time with the theater's sound system causing me to miss some of the dialog, and I probably missed some nuance with the characters. IMDb reviewers as I write this give the film a 7.0 rating compared to part one at a 7.4 which I guess is fair enough, though as I mentioned, my top rating of a '10' for 2017's ""It"" diverges somewhat more compared to this flick."

2. The jump scares are over used. Pennywise is a sinister villain but sometimes particularly with horror less is more and this is a classic example. The sinister pennywise from part 1 is now a parody of himself in part 2.

The climax takes some liberties with the book. To be frank, I found the climax of the book to be somewhat lacking, and the film recognises this criticism and has some fun with hit with, one assumes, Stephen King's approval, given that he cameos in the film.<br/><br/>That's about it, really. The cast are moderate adult representations of their younger incarnations (Bill Hader is wonderful as Richie Tozier), there is a surprising amount of humour, the kids also appear (digitally de-aged) and the film incarnation of monster-It as appreciably better than the book or TV miniseries version.<br/><br/>Watching both movies will consume 5 hours of your life, so plan carefully."

"aGlassofCinema_com","5","2","2","19 September 2019"," It... should have been way better
","Full disclosure, the original Stephen King novel It is something I talk about with great reverence. The 1000-something page book is a fantastic piece of horror fiction for a lot of reasons. So perhaps I'm being too harsh when I say that It: Chapter Two fails to meet the standard set by both the book and the first film in the duology, and frankly is not really worth your time.<br/><br/>Chapter Two picks up 27 years after the 2017 movie, and Pennywise has returned to continue his Derry-based buffet. Mike Hanlon (played by Old-Spice-commercial legend Isaiah Mustafa) never left the town since the original ""Losers Club"" thought they beat the monster. After he finds a blood soaked message, he calls his old friends one by one to bring them back to defeat the monster once and for all. After reuniting and remembering one another, they are sent off to find ""tokens"" from their past somewhere in town in order to complete the ritual of Chüd that will hopefully put Pennywise in the proverbial ground.<br/><br/>The above ensemble cast play the grown up versions of the kids from the last film, and do a fairly good job. When they're together and they aren't mostly screaming, the chemistry between them is great. Bill Skarsgård is still absolutely horrifying as Pennywise... when director Andrés Muschietti actually uses him in the film. There is one particular scene (partially featured in the trailer) where he lures a little girl below the bleachers of an ongoing little league game. She quickly realizes that he's not someone to be trusted, causing him to begin to cry and explain that no one likes him because of his scary makeup. The girl happens to have a large birthmark on her face, and she tells Pennywise she understands because people make fun of her face too! They laugh, and suddenly he promises to blow that mark right off her face... on the count of three! Oneeeeeee, twoooooooo, and then there's a 3 second beat of silence where Pennywise says nothing and only drools and stares..... before HE EATS HER FACE. The scene is a fantastic example of what the movie could have been. Its a travesty that he barely has any other opportunities in the movie to monologue like this, and is instead relegated to lines like ""kiss me fat boy"". It feels like the character could have reached the heights of a psychotic Hannibal Lecter. But alas, not in this adaptation.<br/><br/>Aside from a segment with a creepy old lady and another in a dimly lit hall of mirrors, nothing in the near three hour run time ever again comes close to this moment, and is mostly jump scares populated by CGI monsters. It's predictable yet exhausting for the viewer. Stories like It have the opportunity to affect terror and long-lasting fear through slow burn scares like the segment above. But the movie falls into a predictable and tiresome formula: character is alone, they hear a voice, they proceed to an isolated area, the music swells enough to make my ears hurt, cue jump scare, character runs away, end scene. The first movie is like this as well, so if you're here for more of the same you might be satisfied. However one difference that doesn't help the movie is that the tone is all over the place. It was clearly a horror movie, while Chapter Two has a multitude of one liners and awkward directing choices that cut through the tension and deflate many of the scenes. Is it a drama comedy? A fantasy epic? I'm still not sure.<br/><br/>There are also a few minor changes that I found to be distracting and unwarranted, one of which involves Richard Tozier (played by Bill Hader) who is suggested to be gay. This seems like a blatant attempt to make the movie ""socially relevant"", and while multiple scenes dropped hints, they added absolutely no value to the story. It makes even less sense when you note there was absolutely no mention or suggestion of this in the first movie. Another issue is that the numerous flashbacks of the Losers Club were riddled with de-aging CGI effects, which was super distracting and made the fear more difficult to appreciate on the faces of the kids. It was like they'd all gotten Botox injections right before they filmed their scenes.<br/><br/>So to summarize, the music is annoying, the scares are cheap, it's not even a horror movie, and worst of all, the star himself has no opportunity to shine. For a movie that should be about floating, it spends most of its time sinking."

","I enjoyed Chapter 1, but Chapter 2 feels completely different. Poorly stitched together story line, uninteresting characters, not at all scary. Awkward flashbacks to child actors in scenes that were not in Chapter 1, so they felt out of place rather than filling in back story. It's almost like they realized that they hadn't finished the child story lines in Chapter 1, so they finished them for Chapter 2. But the flash backs were unnecessary except to correlation adults to child actors. My wife left with 15 minutes remaining. I almost regret staying. It was too long and a waste of time."

"kjproulx","7","2","2","15 September 2019"," A Solid Follow-Up, Even if it Falls a Little Short
","Back in 2017, the majority of audiences praised the fact that such a great Stephen King adaptation had been made in It. The television mini-series from 1990 was a very corny version of the story and it went without saying that it deserved a better treatment. Now, the second instalment of that great first film has hit theatres, and like the mini-series, the second portion of the story just isn't as interesting as the first. It: Chapter 2 does warrant a viewing though, especially if you liked the first movie because although it's not exactly great like its predecessor, there's a lot to like here.<br/><br/>Picking up 27 years after the events of the first movie, Pennywise (the clown) has returned to terrorize the town of Derry once again. Reuniting as they promised each other they would, this cast of characters come together to face him one last time. Through various side plots that each character find themselves on, this film may feel slightly long for some viewers at a beefy 169 minutes, but I found that the events unfolding and the performances surrounding them was enough to keep me interested.<br/><br/>Even if you find this film boring at times, it goes without saying that this is once again a stellar cast. Just as they brilliantly cast the kids in the first film, everyone here is on the top of their game. From Bill Hader stealing the show on multiple occasions to the star power of Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy leaping off the screen, there is an endless slew of great character moments. Where this film slightly fell apart for me was in the fact that this movie relies heavily on the past.<br/><br/>Almost seeming to be afraid of letting the past go, this movie flashes back and forth from past and present, showing moments from their childhoods that coincides with current situations. It worked simply due to the fact that the cast of both films is great, but it really did feel like it unnecessarily made the movie longer than it needed to be. With that said, I feel that will be the complaint for most people, but I actually didn't feel the length of this movie. That might have been because I was just in the mood to watch it, but I digress.<br/><br/>In the end, It: Chapter 2 has a great dramatic backbone to it and these performers are giving their all, but the sense of terror and tension is lost a little here in favour of the former. Still, I'm a sucker for a good drama and this film definitely delivers that tenfold. Both of these films feel like they have a sense of finality at the end of them, which is why they both work on their own. The fact that this movie constantly switches between past and present actually makes it easier to watch for those who missed the first movie, which is something I always love. While it's not going to be remembered as a great film on its own, I believe these two movies will work as a great double feature. It's absolutely worth seeing."
"ha77y73ad97","7","2","2","13 September 2019"," Lost a little heart by the end
","This is certainly a second chapter to a wider story and not just a sequal for the sake of grabbing money by the studio. As most people who know the story of the infamous Stephen King novel it chapter 2 was planned from the start and the movie certainly proves that!<br/><br/>The casting of all the losers club were prefect, to match adults to kids is rarely scene normally its the other way around, from James McAvoy to Bill Hader to Jay Ryan as Ben (honestly one of the stand out choices) the club bands together to fight off Pennywise once more. The first time the adult club meet really brings back the reason why the first film was such a success. The chemistry of the whole cast mirrors the first prefectly from the reactions to jokes and heartfelt conversations sitting around a table bringing the characters to the forefront. And special mention to clown of course as Bill Skarsgard kills it as the creepy and torturing demon that lives beneath Derry. Again living up to the first chapter and the original in another prefect casting from the start.<br/><br/>For me the first 2 acts the the better of the film again centring around the characters and what Derry/ Pennywise means to them. They all differ in their reaction to receiving the call from Mike that after 27 years the clown has returned. Bill Hader steals this part with the nervous reaction of throwing up just before hes comedy road show. James McAvoy has come a long way from his turn in Narnia from other masterpieces along the way but to turn a stutter on and off through fear after the call came though shows a total understanding of the character. Again when they first meet back in Derry is again prefect direction and casting. The second act solely consists of facing their fears from the first chapter, Bill buying hes old bike (with a great cameo from Stephen King) to find the boat of Georgies, Beverley finding the postcard in her childhood flat (with possibly the best scene in the film with a creepy woman who now lives in the flat with the trademark style zombie/ demons that King loves to add to these stories), Eddie finally facing his germs in the basement of the pharmacy, Bill retrieving his year book page with another grewsome incounter with Pennywise, Mike already having his 'token' and Richie facing the fear of the clown during rhe first encounter whilst they were split up.<br/><br/>Then this is where the movie falls down in my opinion they went for the big cgi budget final confrontation which totally detracks from the character building for 1 and 2/3s of this movie series. This just leaves a lot to be thought about during this scene and with the death of Eddie was timed well but still with the fighting a 30 feet Pennywise detracks from the gravitas of this.<br/><br/>The final scene is a great piece of art as the adults stare at there reflection and transition to their younger selves with Eddie and Stanley by their sides. With a movie that consisted of more good than bad it was a satisfying ending to a 2 part movie but with a fair amount things that could be improved. This the possibility of a supercut with extra footage on the hirizon i wouldnt mind seeing that!"

","Listen, you have to like the story of IT to like this movie. The same with the first, because it's out there. If your familiar with the story, you will be familiar with how this movie plays out. I was however surprised to see some really terrible CGI at times considering the high budget, but most of the CGI is fine, possibly too much CGI. Bill Hader steals this movie for me, as a fan of his comedic performances I was skeptical he could pull this off, but he did 10 times over. Brilliantly cast, and brilliantly executed. People who are complaining that this wasn't scary enough needs to notice this movie on IMDB is listed ""Drama, Fantasy, Horror"" in that order. Which means it's not your average horror movie, just has jump scares and a spooky plot. All in all this is a good follow up. I enjoyed the first one more as a whole, but I enjoyed the actors in the Chapter 2 equally as much. Enjoy."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","2","12 September 2019"," A fulfilling end to Stephen King's masterful story despite flaws
","Stephen King's masterful horror epic ""IT"" captured both the trauma and beauty of childhood in such a captivating fashion in 2017. The adaptation not only became the highest-grossing horror film of all time but was a mesmerizing and unforgettable game changer.<br/><br/>Twenty-seven years after we last saw the Losers' Club seemingly defeat Pennywise, the demonic dancing clown entity, the now-adult gang of misfits is forced to return to Derry, Maine to fight It once and for all.<br/><br/>This was one of my most anticipated films of the year due to my adoration for the first film and King's original novel. ""IT: Chapter Two"" is successful in concluding the story it started two years ago, containing yet another blend of action, scares and heart that pays great tribute to its source material. However, it doesn't live up to the expectations set upon it due to a less focused plot and struggling to find a proper pace.<br/><br/>Yet again, returning director Andy Muschietti had a vision that brings this story to film beautifully. That said, the director struggles this time on how to initiate his vision in addition to making the film a little too long at 169 minutes.<br/><br/>The big step of casting the Losers' Club as adults couldn't have been handled better. James McAvoy is terrific as Bill Denbrough, who while still guilt-ridden over the death of his younger brother, Georgie, has become a famous writer. Jessica Chastain portrays Beverly Marsh, who brings both fierceness and sweetness that makes us admire her as a character.<br/><br/>My biggest issue in the depiction of these two adult characters is how little time they spend together despite their past chemistry. Bill and Beverly had a sweet romance in the novel that was a treasure to read. But, in the film, the two barely talk to each other and act as if they never loved each other as kids.<br/><br/>Ben Hanscomb (Jay Ryan), now thin and fit, has fulfilled his dream in becoming an architect and is still in love with Beverly, creating a slight love triangle before Bill and Beverly's connection simply fizzles.<br/><br/>Bill Hader is spot on as Richie ""Trashmouth"" Tozier and fulfills the role as the funny guy after becoming a successful stand up comic. Hader offers great comic relief and is also able to show his dramatic talents consistently. The character of Richie is taken into a slightly changed direction, which isn't explored enough to become compelling.<br/><br/>Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransome) has become a successful businessman, yet remains a paranoid hypochondriac. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is the most reluctant to return to Derry to defeat Pennywise out of fear and finds his loyalties to his friends tested. Meanwhile, Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) is the sole member of the gang to remain in Derry, who spent the last 27 years as a librarian, researching how to kill It.<br/><br/>""Chapter Two"" struggles to make the adult characters as compelling and emotionally investing as the children. The kids from ""IT"" were charismatic and relatable, who accurately captured the struggles of growing up, whereas the adults aren't able to emulate that same spirit of the kids' performance.<br/><br/>To instill an emotional core to a higher level, the film brings back a seemingly endless amount of flashbacks to when the Losers were kids, which varies between heartfelt and unnecessary. At times it feels like Muschietti doesn't trust his audience enough to remember the characters when they were kids and forces us to spend a tremendous amount of time with the kids once again.<br/><br/>While flashbacks are necessary for this film, the staggering amount of screen time the kids get distracts us from the focus of ""Chapter Two"" and makes the adults feel like extended versions of the kids and not changed characters who have developed over the last 27 years.<br/><br/>""Chapter Two"" strangely mixes up its momentum by rushing through the reintroductions of each character to take them all back to Derry. It would have been much better to spend more time with each of the Losers in their new lives after such a long-time period instead of each getting one scene with just a brief glimpse of their lives.<br/><br/>In Derry, the storyline becomes a tad misguided when each individual is forced on solo missions that take each into flashback sequences of their own, detracting from the current conflict. It's as if Muschietti forgot he already had each kid face their fears in the first film, and for some reason, decides to show us what they're afraid of yet again with scenes similar to what we've already seen.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is just as creepy and extroverted as before. While we get to see a larger variety of forms that It takes as an entity, the form of Pennywise is by far the best. Most of the monsters we see are very creepy and well designed digitally, yet it's Pennywise that we all want to see. At times the monsters depicted on-screen feel rather goofy and weird as opposed to frightening, making it hard to be scared and take the film seriously.<br/><br/>That said, ""IT: Chapter Two"" gives us an epic climax that is impossible to turn away from. The Losers get the ultimate showdown with Pennywise in one of the most memorable action sequences filled with character-driven emotion and arresting CGI.<br/><br/>While slightly disappointing, the second half of ""IT"" is an exciting and heartfelt ending full of heart that is centered around a group of characters impossible not to care for and concludes Stephen King's masterpiece epically, giving fans of the nearly 1,200-page novel what they need to be more than satisfied."

"Oz-Sultan-Schmooz","8","2","2","12 September 2019"," A panoramic psycho funhouse fantasy horror
","A sleepy backwater town in New England is once more about to be violently disrupted and manically stalked by the sinister and psychotic Pennywise, the dancing clown. The film picks up twenty-seven years later. A series of events rouse the fears and calls to action the one friend who chose to remain, waiting for the inevitable return of IT.<br/><br/>Six phone calls later, and we are given a glimpse into the lives of the six friends that turned their backs and moved away from the town with its dark history.<br/><br/>It's a slick and quick profile of the friends who are reminded of a promise, a promise to return to that town of childhood memories, memories that have been buried deep in the psyche. They are once again reunited, all except for one.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent and reflects the young actors so accurately from the first installment, including another mesmerizing performance from Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise.<br/><br/>The dynamic is quickly restored and so too the memories begin to awaken and with that, the audience is drawn into the first fantasy horror sequence that will be used in more intense scenes later.<br/><br/>Overall, the film works and reflects an authentic attempt to give cinematic life to an ambitious novel from a (if not 'the') master of the horror genre, who treats his fans to a brief cameo role.<br/><br/>This is much more than a clown and demonic desire to kill and feed on the flesh, firstly the clown is just one manifestation as will become apparent throughout the film. The essence of this story is overcoming the deepest, darkest fears we experience as children and then to return as adults, six, forty-year-old childhood friends to once again face those fears, those disturbing memories and the dysfunctional parental/family issues that haunted them and have tried to suppress over all those years.<br/><br/>Pennywise, represents the imposing fear, larger than life, in a way we amplify our problems and fears to appear more sinister than what they really are.
The film unfurls with charming moments of nostalgia that resonates in all of us, particularly if you are of a similar age to the friends reunited. I would go as far as saying that is the beauty within this slick horror flick.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the film culminates in the grand confrontation and a panoramic psycho funhouse portrayal leads the six friends to challenge the various manifestations of Pennywise. There was an element of looping ideas from the first installment, which felt a little lazy, maybe a deliberate attempt connecting the two films, whilst all the gory, twisted, CGI horror scenes flash across the screen.<br/><br/>The ending to this orgy of horror in some ways imitates the 'lead' character Bill Denbrough, a local and internationally renowned author who is further renowned for the bad endings of his books and maybe that is an ironic inside joke between the director, the screenwriter and original author. But I felt the ending did not satisfy my compulsion and invested intrigue over the two installments. That being said it is a richly entertaining and fascinating portrayal that does justice to the majestic novel published in the mid-eighties."

Bill Skarsgard is still great has Pennywise, I mean he was so good, makes me wonder why was he not cast has The Joker. On some levels the 1990 mini series did some things better, then this film did. But there are other things that this film did better then the 1990 mini series. Some times the humor overshadows the horror parts.

","There's way too much going on in this film, I was going to say it was a case of bad editing but I don't think it was edited at all and thats why it was so long. I'll bet even those who are rating it high couldn't wait for it to end either. It reminded me of scoobydoo on one had, a group of goofy people seeking for clues about a ghost/clown and trying to unravel the mystery. On the other hand it had the zombies of the Evil dead, so a bit more x=rated than scooby
How to sum up this story?
Every clown must have its weakness I suppose, just as people are scared of clowns (for some unknown reason) and of what they say and do, maybe a clowns weakness is that it is scared of people, and of what they do and say."

","I thoroughly enjoyed the film, but it felt a little off. There's justice for the racism displayed on Mike, there's justice for Ben with the whole 'fat kid' thing and him finally getting the girl, but Richie's arch felt a little .. like queerbaiting.<br/><br/>It's HEAVILY implied that he's a part of the LGBT+ community, but he never gets justice, never resolving his arch of hiding and being ashamed of who he is by coming out and being him. And because of this, the last scene of him adding 'E' for Eddie on the bridge makes you question whether he liked him, or was just grieving. It felt lack luster and like Richie was never able to have a resolve.<br/><br/>I'm of the opinion that ambiguous endings is a little lazy in most cases, especially when it comes to a resolve of a character and I wasn't a fan of what they did with Richie, however, that was my only complaint of the film."

"sarahkaye-30024","10","11","20","13 September 2019"," Exceeded my expectations!
","For all the naysayers, you seem to come in two categories-those who are fans of the book, and those who have never read a Stephen King story in their life.
To the fans, of course the films are not 100% true to the books-that would be impossible without making the film a week long in duration. Every adaptation has huge chunks taken out and new, dramatic scenes placed in.
To those that have never read any of Kings work, this is NOT a sequel. It's the second part of 1 story. The novel is written as a back and forth between childhood and adulthood, this would be impossible to play out on screen so it was written in two chapters instead. IT is a beast of a novel, so it would also be impossible to condense the story into one 2.5 hour film.
Now for my review...
Wow. Just wow!
I went into this with extremely high hopes for two reasons. 1, I'm a huge fan of the book-it might be my favourite novel of all time, and 2, the first chapter was outstanding! I was not disappointed!
Any adaptation of a much loved story is always a little nerve wracking, in case they fail spectacularly in their vision-but as far as I'm concerned they hit all the right notes this time! I loved the original adaptation, it was terrifying at the time, but much of the humour from the book was missing. This time around it's all there. Of course some of my favourite parts were missing, but they included most of the important ones.
The casting is outstanding, they managed to find children and adults who do actually bear strong resemblances to each other. Bill Hader as adult Ritchie is absolutely genius, the funniest lines in the film all belong to him and his younger counterpart Finn Wolfhard.
It's hard to say any more without rambling on for days, but I will say this: Never in my life have I laughed so hard whilst also hiding behind my hands out of terror.
That, and spot the cameo!"
"pdjackson-85572","10","11","20","10 September 2019"," THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL!!!! GET IT IN YOUR HEADS!!!!
","Seriously, to start off, the amount of people coming on here leaving reviews and saying that Chapter 2 is a sequel to 2017's IT, get it in your heads, Chapter 2 (the title gives it away) is NOT a sequel. Hence the reason it is called CHAPTER 2. When you read a book and finish chapter one, do you think 'I will have to read the sequel next'? No, you don't. You carry on reading and move on to chapter 2 as it's part of the same story. IT Chapter 2 is the second half of one whole story. Not a sequel.<br/><br/>Secondly, people complaining about the run time, you should have known how long the movie was before going to see it. It is not hard to either come on imdb and check or simply look at the difference in show times at the cinema. Additionally, if you had any idea or knowledge of the novel by Stephen King, you would understand that this is an epic storyline. The book is over a thousand pages. This story could have been made in to a 10 or 20 hour TV series easily and would still be full of scenes that didn't get anywhere near 2017's Chapter 1 or 2019's Chapter 2.<br/><br/>To summarise, if you are going to read and take the side of all these low scoring reviews, do the film makers and Stephen King fans a favour. Just stay away from both movies. They are not for you. The film makers have done a tremendous job in bringing the story of Pennywise the Clown and the Losers Club to our screens while staying as true as possible to Stephen Kings novel (seriously, if you have read IT by Stephen King, you will agree).<br/><br/>If you go in to this movie thinking it's going to be a fright fest, you are going to be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there are a few decent jump scares here and there but as with all Stephen King stories, they are about characters, people, struggle and resolution.<br/><br/>Thank you to the film makers for bringing this to our screens."

","Wow.. This movie is probably the best movie I've seen in the last two years at the movie theater. The movie theater has been turning out garbage for a while now. People are staying home and watching HBO, ShowTime, NetFlix, Hulu, etc. I would rather stay home and watch good tv then spend money going to the movies with the crap they have been playing but my 77 year old Father still loves going to the movies and keeps holding out that one day when we go they will play a good movie like the good old days. I've told him that time has come and gone. So today I didn't hold out any hope that he would stay awake, since he sleeps thru or parchal almost every movie I take him to. But this more than 2 hour movie he stayed awake for and was engaged with questions. Even if he got a shushe from me ;) I hate the political stance that King has taken, I think he's lost a lot of fans, but being a movie fan and historian I was very excited to see him do a camo for more than 3 minutes. It was awesome. I will be going to see this again. This time with my son and catching all of the details I missed the first time around. GREAT MOVIE..."

"Heisenberg999","5","17","34","6 September 2019"," A bit of a letdown with some redeeming qualities
","If you're reading this review and you haven't already seen Chapter two, and you didn't rewatch the first Chapter, go rewatch it if you want to get the best out of Chapter two. This film doesn't stand on its own at all.
I liked the first Chapter way more than this film. Instead of improving on the mistakes of the first film, Chapter two was an even messier film.<br/><br/>
Let's start with the good things. The film looks beautiful. It's filmed beautifully and visual design of monsters and creatures is very imaginative and unnerving. All that is supported by the beautiful production design, which only suffers in act 3, when it's too dark to tell how the background looks. On the technical level in general, the film delivers. Sound mixing really helped to build an atmosphere, and the makeup and costumes were on the point. Regarding the acting, the majority of the actors were very unutilized. James McAvoy's and Jessica Chastain's characters were far more interested in their child form. Those two were completely wasted because of the bland script. Star of the film, and easily the best part of it was Bill Hader. Every scene in which all of them were together, he outshined them completely. In every scene he was in, the spotlight was on him. Besides comedic chops, he showed his capability to deliver a great performance in more serious and dramatic scenes. Bill Skarsgard was also fantastic, but I wished he was a little bit more in the film.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I have with this film was its tone inconsistency. This film has huge tonal issues. The film is filled with humor, but that wouldn't be a problem if the humor was dosed and appropriate. In the majority of the film, the humor and scary scenes intertwined. They intertwined in a way in which you don't know if the scene is supposed to be scary or funny, and that's a huge problem for a horror film. Jokes were decent in most cases, but their timing was catastrophic. For example, when I was watching this film in the theatre, when I thought the scary scene was happening at the moment, someone was laughing at the fullest, and vice versa. That's a shame because the horror sequences were decently directed, and the jokes were mostly funny. But when those two elements intertwine too often and at the wrong moments, both of those elements lose their effect.
Except for tonal issues, the film had its problems with pacing. The film is 170 minutes long, and that's very unusual for horror standards today. The film is very scattered and its length could be felt. There's some redundancy in storytelling because very often the group gets together and splits apart, that happens way too many times. Act 3 was way too long and at that point, the film really started to drag.
The script was very weak, it wouldn't even be a stretch to call it bad. I guess the absence of Cary Joji Fukunaga as one of the screenwriters hurt this film very badly in the end. The first Chapter did not develop all of the kids, but at least some of them were somewhat developed. In Chapter two for the most characters, there's not any further development for any of them. Ben's motives are borrowed from Chapter one and nothing else has happened with him as a character, he's just there. Mike is only a walking exposition. Bill and Bev were way more concise and compelling characters in Chapter one. And Bowers, he was a terrible character in the first Chapter, and somehow he's gotten even worse in the second part. I also would love if the film gave any meaning to Pennywise and his actions, beyond: he's just an evil force who kills.
Speaking of characters, the chemistry between old Losers, compared to young Losers was nonexistent. Every time the film switched back to young actors, it became way more interesting.<br/><br/>In the end, compared to the first Chapter, the sequel declined in quality. It's not a great film, but it has some redeeming qualities in it, such as visual effects and Bill Hader's performance."
"prezjay-76791","10","10","18","9 September 2019"," This isn't a sequel.
","IT: Chapter Two is not a sequel, it is a conclusion. IT (1990) was three hours long and crammed in the whole 1,100 page novel. This 5 hour movie series (IT: Supercut) is telling the 1,100 page novel. As a reader of the book, it was an accurate description, with the Ritual of Chüd, and all that.

","It Chapter 2 is a good movie that manages to keep you entertained through it's nearly 3 hour run time. This really tries to be a sequel in every way with a bigger is better approach and at points some of its attempts to frighten you can be quite predictable at times, however the film to me is scarier then the first as there is more variation in Pennywises attempts to frighten. The cast for this movie is one of its strongest points James mcavoy, (Bill), Jessica Chastain, (Beverly), Bill Hader, (Richie) alongside Bill Skarsgard, (Pennywise), all giving some very excellent performances. I was very satisfied with the way this movie played out and was delighted by the performances, definitely a horror worth seeing."

","As someone who really enjoyed the mini series and thought the first chapter was a great revamp of a horror icon and didn't disappoint, I sadly cannot say the same about Chapter 2. Very long for no reason and way way way 2 much CGI.
Less was definitely more in the first chapter and although some of the scares were good the CGI made it somewhat comical and a let down. I honestly think the best part is Pennywise at the baseball game when he is being creepy. His appearance and demeanor before the jump scare was way more appealing than the CGI jump scare that followed."
"gallag-03774","10","9","16","9 September 2019"," 10/10
","Pennywise returns in this visceral conclusion... which I was surprised to find is a pretty faithful adaptation of the book. However, they could have focused on how controlling Beverly Marsh's husband was and how she had lost her power and fight. Then, with just that phone call from Mike to return to Derry- she fought her way out. Each character had an introduction but they were a little too abbreviated. Maybe when the director's cut comes out. At two hours and forty five minutes, I understand why that would be a lot.. but the character development is important. Steven King's cameo was fantastic as usual. My friend jumped out of his seat several times and scared everyone even worse, for Pennywise is twice as frightening this time around at least. This movie is award worthy for several reasons- but most importantly, it breaks a boundary."
"classicalgas-73286","10","9","16","9 September 2019"," IT has everything you want and more
","First off let me preface this with, in this era it's incredibly difficult for an actual horror fan to be ""scared"" by anything, especially a horror meant to appeal to the masses outside super fans.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal but Hader and McAvoy shine through, their performances are engaging, emotional, and will draw you in. Don't get me wrong the rest of the cast carries their performances very well also.<br/><br/>The length of the movie, to me, would only be a problem if you're not here for the story, if you want to know Pennywise's origins, and have a deeper dive into the mental state of each character than this movie is for you. If you just wanted to be scared and have a story that moves it might be a little slow at times but you may still enjoy it.<br/><br/>The gore is well done, I don't have a problem with the CGI scenes they were done really well, looking even better than the first film. There are many scenes that filled me with dread or anxiety, very little ""fear"" but I can't remember the last time a movie scared me. The disturbing factor is 10/10 in my opinion and if that's your cup of tea you'll absolutely love this film."

It was nice to see some scenes that didn't make it into the first film from the beginning of the novel such as the murder of 1984 that took place after the carnival. In addition, a few scenes did make me jump which is always fun. I also liked some of the liberties they took with the story such as the ending. Overall an awesome watch."

They kept it droning on and on for almost 3 hours. If you base your movie experience on how long you got for your money it's a 10. If you base it on entertainment value it's a 3."

Cinematography was also very impressive. Definitely wasn't TOO long, although the ending did drag on a little bit at times. A bit too much CGI for my taste as it can detract from the realism of the moment making it less intense (even though the quality of the CGI was pretty high). Not a massive fan of the ending ;) but that's probably more a problem with the novel than with the movie. Would definitely see it in cinemas again (if I wasn't a somewhat broke student)."
"ajbr-48095","8","6","10","7 September 2019"," I don't get why people are so disappointed in this film
","MINOR SPOILERS below.<br/><br/>Yes, this film does have plenty of flaws. I thought that the beginning scenes where Mike called the Losers back to Derry were WAY too short and rushed. The film definitely could have used another 20 minutes or so to flesh out the adult characters before the Jade of the Orient scene. I'm also still not a fan of the overblown CGI jump scares that they carried over from the first film. And there was a little bit too much misplaced humor, although most of it didn't bug me.<br/><br/>However, I think the good in this film definitely outweighs the bad. The casting is great, with Bill Hader as Richie and James Ransone as Eddie being the standouts for me (I especially loved what they did with Richie's character in this movie). At almost 3 hours long, I never got bored or lost interest. And honestly, while not perfect, I'm surprised that the pacing was as good as it was. And while overall the movie wasn't very scary, there were several genuinely intense, great scenes: the opening scene at the fair, the Hall of Mirrors scene, the scene with Victoria and Pennywise under the bleachers, and the scene in Beverly's apartment (minus the unnecessary jumpscare).<br/><br/>While objectively this film is a probably alittle worse than the first one, I enjoyed it just a little bit more for one reason: it felt a lot more Stephen King to me. This film felt almost EXACTLY the same tonally as the book, mainly because this film is darker and a bit more gruesome than the first film. And I loved that. Don't decide not to see this film just because of the mixed reviews. Give it a watch. I highly recommend it."

For example none of them has seen each other for twenty some years and yet the black guy who re-assembles them has all their cell phone numbers (and they have no idea who he is when he calls so how did he get the numbers? You can't look up cell numbers).<br/><br/>Further the clown is back for some time before the gang comes back and yet he seems to be eating people, not floating them like in the first movie. Why is that?<br/><br/>When they get to the lair from the first flick it's devoid of floaters even tho the black guy tells them the clown has been active for some time.<br/><br/>And then there's a really stoopid ending to the clown. It actually ruins the movie completely because it's laughable.<br/><br/>And then there's the gay agenda from frame one to the ending with Ritchie's little secret. Why do we need this? Does this crap really have to be shoved in our face in every freaking movie? Does it? I for one, am tired of it.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film moves quickly with little down time, except that it's about a half hour too long. It reminded me of LOTR Part Three when it kept ending and then there was more ending and then there was more until you just wanted to leave the movie theatre already."

There is absolutely nothing interesting, no story, no events, no delivery, also nothing scary, it's more like a comedy satire of a horror movie.
I liked the first one by the way, so it cannot be that this genre isn't for me.

"mattiasflgrtll6","2","5","8","9 October 2019"," This is what people find scary?
","27 years after the members of The Losers' Club defeated It, visions of the clown start popping up again. Mike Hanlon calls everyone up for a meeting to come up with a plan to defeat It once and for all.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, it starts off promising enough with the opening scene. Eddie and Adrian just want to have a nice day at the theme park, but are confronted by a couple of bullies who try to intimidate them. They get annoyed, but walk away from them. After they get cornered again however, Adrian starts mouthing off, going so far as to insult one of their haircuts. As you might expect, this doesn't end well. What makes this scene so much more impactful than any other in the whole movie is that it's the only one which feels real. The violence inflicted upon them just for their sexuality is very disturbing, and the tragedy is heightened when Adrian gets thrown off a bridge. It then finds him as well and eats him brutally, but the scariest part is the homophobic violence shown just before. Though it's still notable for being the *only* scene where any restraint is shown with the clown at all.<br/><br/>As you can tell, I'm already getting into my negatives. This movie was horrendous. As someone who wasn't even a fan of the first one, I would much rather watch that one again since it seemed to care about its characters at least. Which is something It: Chapter Two doesn't.
If you're looking for good character development and interactions, look elsewhere. Instead it seems more interested in wasting its time on extremely obnoxious and laughably unscary jumpscares. I was laughing out of embarrassment every time the movie tried to be scary. Who did they think they were fooling? Fortune cookies cracking open Gremlins-style, one of them having an insect with a baby's head? A Paul Bunyon statue showing off its big scary teeth? A naked old lady with hanging tits? A hobo making out with your mother? These attempts at trying to spook you were so phony I couldn't tell if they were trying to be funny or not. There's one part which clearly was supposed to be intense, but for some weird god-damn reason they added comedic music to it. It completely ruins any sense of danger they tried to establish, and comes off as a cringeworthy way to make the audience laugh, since at the test screening everybody already laughed anyway.<br/><br/>The CGI effects work is as fake-looking as it gets. Honestly, I'm surprised a lot of it even got past the pre-production stage.<br/><br/>The dialogue is horrible. Instead of incorporating humor into the script naturally when it *fits*, every serious moment is ruined by a stupid one-liner. Richie especially deflated the tension all the time by either pointing out they are in trouble (as if we're too dumb to get it) or saying something goofy at the most inappropriate time. If they were going for a horror comedy it's too tonally inconsistent, not to mention most of the jokes are so lame anyway they're not funny. And when they try to be heartwarming it's so overdone and cliché that you keep rolling your eyes at the self help-esque quotes they keep spitting at you. I swear, there are maybe FIVE MONOLOGUES throughout, and they all sound exactly the same.<br/><br/>Even Beverly's dad, one of the few creepy things about the first, comes off as a joke in the few scenes he appears in. The way he sprays his daughter furiously with perfume is so absurd I couldn't take it seriously, not to mention the moment where Beverly's inside a bathroom filled with blood and he keeps chanting ""COME TO DADDY"". Just like everything else it's too over-the-top.<br/><br/>And for a clown as powerful as It, the way he gets defeated is absolutely pathetic. Forget fighting him to death, trick him in any way, or even the ritual Mike keeps going on about (which conveniently he ""forgets"" way too late it doesn't work). No, let's just call him a few hurtful words and he'll shrink to the size of a baby. I sh'it you not. The most evil and otherwordly clown alive is weakened by being called a regular circus clown. The scriptwriter really must have backed himself into a corner with this one.<br/><br/>The acting is mixed. Bill Hader is good (even though I find his character a bit annoying). Jessica Chastain gave a very earnest performance, and was probably the best out of the main cast. Isaiah Mustafa and James Ransone were all right. James McAvoy was a little off however, which was disappointing. His stuttering doesn't feel like it comes out naturally. Jaeden Martell as the kid version of Bill did it much more convincingly.
Bill Skarsgård, and this might come as an unpopular opinion, was pretty hard to watch. To be fair the material he gets is ridiculous, but his line delivery was so exaggerated and goofy I wondered if he was trying to keep himself from cracking up or something.<br/><br/>Most of all however, I was bored to tears. With all the constant repetition of jumpscares and scenes dragging on and on, I kept asking my friend ""How much do we have left?"" since I could barely wait to leave the theater. No way in hell the merciless 2 hour and 48 minute run time is justified.<br/><br/>The biggest higlights are the cameos by Stephen King and Peter Bogdanovich. Skip this sorry excuse of a ""horror"" movie."

Must see. It's a Conclusion movie
The follow up to the 2017 version<br/><br/>So the first part laid out the story. A remake of a TV series from the 90's. This time though it had that North Hollywood magic which it made it one of my all-time favourite movies.
A lot of the same cast. Which was perfect the first time around. This version added seven more adult characters. Bill Hader who plays older Richie was perfect with his one liners and James McAvoy was on queue as Billy..
Once again though Pennywise steals the show with over the top performance.. there's a few concluding scenes throughout the movie that either explained or ended past storylines which I liked
Once again though I found myself laughing at many scenes. As I do not scare easily, lol. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. But I guess I was expecting a little bit more.

"joshbarton15","8","5","8","8 September 2019"," It ends.
","The Losers Club have been waiting twenty-seven years but it's only been two years for us to find out what It has in store for them on his return to Derry. It Chapter Two is the concluding chapter to this particular adaption of Stephen King's novel, following It in 2017, and it certainly maintains the epic scale of the first film, which is a rarity in the horror genre.<br/><br/>Twenty-seven years after defeating Pennywise (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd), the Losers Club reunite in their hometown of Derry to relive the nightmare of their childhoods and put an end to it once and for all.<br/><br/>It took a while for It Chapter Two to get going for me however, when it does, it is a vastly entertaining horror romp that may not be the scariest film ever made but, just like the first film, can be downright unsettling at times. It's the reuniting of the Losers Club that drags out the opening of the film however, it's a necessary evil that leads to quite a wild reunion scene inside a Chinese restaurant, certainly unsettling rather than scary.<br/><br/>Once they're all together the film moves along at a pace that makes the 169 minute runtime absolutely fly by, jump scares and creepiness galore as the Losers try to work out how to defeat the evil that has been lurking over Derry for many years. There were some really effective scenes but I found the overuse of jump scares a little irritating, especially as they were so predictable, while the quiet build-up and eeriness of other scenes were much more appealing to me.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, It Chapter Two features a grown up Losers Club while also using the fantastic younger actors from the first film in flashback sequences. The coming-of-age aspect from the first film and the actors performing in it make it a better film for me but the adult cast assembled for Chapter Two do a fine job in closing out the epic story. James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain are two actors you know can deliver knock-out performances but it's Bill Hader here that really surprised me, his turn as Richie Tozier being the most interesting of the Losers and showcasing some great acting along the way. Of course, you can't get through these adaptations of It without mentioning Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's brilliant performance as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, not as prominent here as he was in the first film but just as effective when on camera.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is a film I can see growing on me with repeat viewings, a little like the first did, as there's so much to take in from it. I'm a big fan of the disturbing nature the film offers rather than the jump scares, and the cast really make this quite the film. The scale of it all across two films gives it that event cinema feel, which is something I'd like to see more in the horror genre."

The movie does the name justice though & provides shocking horror, as well as quite a few gut wrenching laughs. The cast is obviously the best part about this movie. As much as I love James McAvoy, Bill Hader was the shining light of the film, right behind Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd that is. He plays the character perfectly, just the the first one, but my biggest, & really only, disappointment with the film is that it didn't have enough Pennywise. It had more creatures other than Pennywise than Pennywise himself & I think that was just a waste of talent when it comes to Bill. He was born for the role & will always be remembered for it.

But it certainly wasn't scary, for that matter."
"tyelder","9","5","8","7 September 2019"," Overall, the best ending for this story.
","Something seen few from far between. A genuine finale that does not hint or poke fun at a possible continuation due to success at the box office. Andy Muschietti has delivered what he promised: an ending to a pop culture phenomenon that was beautifully crafted and brilliantly terrifying.
It Chapter Two was my most anticipated film this year and actually has been since September 7th, 2017 right after It ended on the note of revealing that it was only the first chapter and there would be more. And more is exactly what we get here with the final chapter. More scares, more character development, more scarring scenes, more comedy from Richie, and yes, definitely more Pennywise.
Bill SkarsgÃ¤rd takes your breath away quite literally with his chilling performance of the disturbing dancing clown. Every moment that he is on screen, he draws you into the movie even more than you already were. It's as if you are being lured in like all the other kids-his victims-were. Mind-blowing. SkarsgÃ¤rd gave it his all, and he was backed-up by the superb actors that played the grown-up losers. I mean, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and freakin Bill Hader as Richie Tozier-what do you expect? Not a sub-par performance out them, that's for sure.
The brilliant dark tone and amazing cinematography that brought the horrifying story to life in 2017 carries on directly into the final chapter which made the connection between the two films seamless. 27 years is a huge jump forward but that didn't phase Muschietti. He was determined and clearly ready to deliver a finale that was so worthy to be an adaptation of the timeless novel that the author, the king of horror himself, made a Stan Lee-style cameo in it.
If all the performances, cinematography, clowns, and cameos didn't impress enough, the countless scenes of truly impressive and terrifying large-scale stunts (most of which involve Pennywise and his fear-provoking tactics) will leave you awe-struck. And don't worry, there are so many of these moments in this absolute behemoth of a motion picture.
With a runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes, you might be hesitant to go watch it and have to hold it during that last act after gulping down a large beverage. But, fear not, this is a cinematic event to witness in the theatre with hundreds of other movie-goers so you can laugh and scream together; just as it was meant to be:)
*cue ""We'll Meet Again"" song parody by Pennywise*
We'll float again. Don't know where, don't know when. But I know we'll float again some bloody dayyyy...ðŸ¤¡

","Ever since the first ""It"" movie, I have been eagerly waiting for chapter two. I saw the movie opening day and was not disappointed. The casting and chemistry between adults are phenomenal. The adult cast made me believe that they were the kids twenty-seven years later because of their uncanny similarities physically and personality-wise. The special effects and CGI also shaped the film to be exceptionally lifelike and believable, especially in horror scenes. Despite the length of the movie, I never felt bored because the movie was fast-paced and kept me interested. Of course, Bill Hader's comedic lines aided in that regard as well. Furthermore, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's performance was exceptional as per usual. I enjoyed every part of this film. The only downsides from my viewpoint were that the movie failed to give a proper recap of the first movie. Therefore for people, like myself, who have not watched the film in two years may feel lost in the beginning, especially during the introduction of the adult characters. Overall, the two ""It"" films complement each other very well yet are each fantastic in their unique way. Without a doubt, ""It Chapter Two"" is a horror movie classic."

"TheMovieDiorama","5","5","8","7 September 2019"," It: Chapter Two clowns around attempting to adapt a seemingly unadaptable second half.
","There's a cruel irony that haunts the now all grown-up Bill, a screenplay writer, that represents my opinion of King's infamous conclusive half. ""The ending kinda sucked"". Having read the novel, watched the original miniseries and survived my own nightmares, I came to the conclusion that the adult section of 'It' is terribly written and highlights the very worst of King's writing techniques. It's balls-to-the-walls insanity with a thematic presence that loses its ingenuity built lovingly from the first half, in this case 'Chapter One'. Unfortunately, as hard as Muschietti tried, not much of the near three-hour runtime made any impact and produced a seemingly forgettable ""horror"" riddled with more disappointment than Pennywise's ruthless attempt in capturing the Loser's Club. Twenty seven years after the events of the first film, the Losers Club reunite in Derry once more to try and destroy ""It"" permanently before it devours any more children.<br/><br/>Before I express my predictably overwhelming level of disappointment, it's important to note that I knew I was not going to be truly enamoured with the narrative. I've always loathed it. Thematically, there is a tepid amount of exploration into the manifestation of guilt and how it haunts us on an emotional level. The inner turmoil that is buried within us and the repercussions of suppressing them. Despite the overall absence of psychological complexities within each character, that is somewhat present in the novel, there's enough impact within each loser to illustrate guilt. Bill, for example, being the perfect thematic bridge as he comes to terms with Georgie's death.<br/><br/>The inherent issue, which is an immediate negatory result of the surprisingly fantastic first chapter, is the lack of characterisation. As kids, the Losers Club were inseparable, with each character fleshed out to maximum potential. Twenty seven years on, naturally the reunion is to be intermittently spiky, but to not reproduce the intrinsic flavour that made these losers so memorable and relatable was a huge misstep. Take Bev and Ben, or Eddie and Richie. Aside from the conclusive ten minutes, there's no tangible emotion between them. A true lack of friendship that, even if they are unable to remember, showed no humanity. Just quick lines of dialogue to keep the overstuffed plot moving, with an excessive amount of quips that rapidly transformed this horror into a comedy.<br/><br/>Mike had the misfortune of resorting to the mechanical character of ""exposition man"", where every spoken word explains the ritualistic storyline and the absurdity of King's mind. The Ritual of Chüd, the origins of ""It"" and the recovery of fragmented memories. Diabolically destroyed as a character. Which is a shame, as the casting of the adult losers was sublime. Hader stole the entire show with his ornate use of comedic timing and emotional distress. Chastain and McAvoy, despite their star status, wasn't given enough substance to give truly captivating performances. Especially the former who was grossly underused.<br/><br/>Of course, if you are wanting to watch 'It', then you're praying to be scared, right? Ehhh. Wrong. The horror traits that should've been at the forefront, were completely ineffective. Nearly every single jump scare, except for one furry canine that annoyingly infiltrated my impenetrable skin the moment I let my guard down, was pointless. A host of CGI creatures that, whilst creatively showcase the fearful capabilities of ""It"", smelt of so much fakery that they proved to be tame and forgettable. Heck, even visualised effects on some of the character's faces, like child Ben, were incredibly noticeable and off-putting.<br/><br/>Which nicely brings me to Pennywise himself. Skarsgard gives yet another tantalising performance. But just one teeny problem. He isn't scary anymore. Whether that be due to the uninspired use of said clown or the lack of freshness that made the first chapter massively frightening, remains to be seen. The audience were laughing instead of looking away! Either way though, Pennywise was ineffective. And the conclusive science-fiction blah-fest highlighted<br/><br/>This is a frustrating chapter. It really bloody is. Muschietti can create tension. He proved it in the first chapter and occasionally embedded scenes of suspense within this sequel. The old woman inviting Bev into her apartment? Yes please! CGI Bev's head spontaneously combusting? Nah, I'm out. It's overstuffed, overlong (seriously, three hours? Chop atleast forty minutes off!) and overly tame. And when the flashbacks to the child losers are the greatest aspects of the sequel, a sequel predominantly focused on the adults, well something's not quite right. It's not entirely Muschietti's fault, as the source material is just as terrible. It's just a case of ""the ending kinda sucked""."

","This is definitely one of the best Stephen King's adaptations ever, in terms both of style and faithfulness to the original source. Andy Muschietti did great work as a director, creating this long (probably longest horror film ever made), grim, intense and imaginative horror masterpiece.
The basic point is that second film is much complex and multi-layered than the first one, dealing with different albeit interconnected themes. On the outside this is a horror story about how adult members of the Losers Club join together once more to kill nameless monster they've encountered 27 years ago. This story has many spectacular merits on its own right: the images of It are very different, artful and scary. There's a lot of atmospheric moments, action sequences and monsters to remember. On the inside it's a story about anxiety and pain of letting the past go, which are inescapable parts of any adulthood as a process. But there's a bit of dialectic here, since the characters, intending to beat Pennywise, must keep their inner child to some degree, but within the framework of a grown-up experience. So, on the third level this is a story about the power of imagination, which can save human from evil, but in order to do so it has to be used with good hands and clear mind.
There's a slight amount of problems with this adaptation, however. Unlike the first film, the script (written exclusively by Gary Dauberman now) contains several plot lines which are unnecessary in the way they're introduced in the film; for instance, Henry Bowers' actions now add literally nothing to the main storyline. There's also a bit of jokes and one-liners overdose, which blurs creepy scenes sometimes.
But, luckily, that minor problems cannot overshadow the whole picture, which is still very enjoyable. Visit Derry, it's a great New England town. But beware of the red balloons. They're float."

However if you read and UNDERSTAND the book, then chapter 2 (along with ch 1) is a masterpiece. I can sit here and try and explain all day, but it's best if you just take the time and read the book, so much more is explained in there and you'll understand why 2 movies was not enough."

The adult cast did a fantastic job interpreting the actors that came before them and translating that into adult versions of the characters. It doesn't quite make up for the lazy story arch or overdone effects.<br/><br/>Plus, the end is dumb as all get out.

"TheAngryReviewer","5","3","4","11 October 2019"," Disappointing
","After I saw the first film I was left wondering what would come next, Would they beat the famously terrible ending of the mini-series and would bill skårsgard beat the legendary performance of tim curry. I have to say the answer was a flat no for both those questions. The writing of its character was heavily dependent on jump scares that just aren't as scary when you expect them to happen and they end up just being some cliche jump out and say boo sort of thing. There are only genuinely scary scenes in the film, the first was the riverbank scene it was edgy it was shocking and brutally violent, the second was the scene underneath the seats at the baseball game it was similar to the opening scene of the first it film and it used pennywise taking advantage of the innocence and cluelessness of a child to lure them away instead of some cheap scare where he would just jump out at them, the third and final was the hall of mirrors scene, this scene builds tension and creates fear within the viewer by showing the helplessness of bill the confusion and terror of the kid and the vicious intentions of pennywise. Apart from the 'horror' aspects of the film I surprisingly found it quite funny there were often scenes in which I would find myself laughing, often when the film wasn't trying to be funny, but sometimes the film would attempt to be funny and the jokes were out of place for the movie, the joke involving The puppy was a joke I felt was more in place in a kids movie not a horror movie and looking back at it I find the joke irritating. The final scene was a disaster, the portrayal of pennywise as the giant spider clown made the crappy rendering of the miniseries look like Jurassic park, The death of pennywise was cheesy and annoying and left the viewer with a craving for more, it was dissatisfactory of the death of this god like being who has reigned terror in Derry for centuries would be defeated by some playground insults and the power of Friendship. My final comments will be about the terrible pacing, this film had a lot of story to tell but it did it in such an awful way spending way to long on the eventually pointless hunt and made the 2 hour 43 minute film feel like being on a plane, where you feel trapped and bored for extensive amounts of time. All in all I wish I hadn't paid money to see this hot pile of garbage"

The movie is 3 hours long for really no reason. The structuring of this movie is very strange as well. For a good chunk of the movie it's like the same scene played
over and over again with different characters. And you'll notice throughout the movie that they weirdly make fun of the fact that the ending of the movie is bad, which kind of makes sense because the ending is really stupid."

"meanmrslinky","4","3","4","26 September 2019"," A Long, Underwhelming, Gory Mess
","It: Chapter Two disappoints in continuing the engrossing story of Pennywise the Clown terrorizing the town of Derry. Being just under a lengthy three hours, the film packs a fair amount of unnecessary and boring sequences. It relies too heavily on visuals, rather than building a real sense of foreboding and suspense. There are many scenes where it feels more like a dark comedy, rather than a film that is supposed to frighten viewers. There are some memorable moments, but unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good in the end.<br/><br/>The film offers an excellent cast, very much resembling the younger Losers. You can easily see who is who right from the beginning. These actors were able to deliver the liveliness and humor of their younger selves, which worked very well. This may be one of Bill Haders best performances. The young versions of the Losers also make an appearance in the film. They too deliver a solid performance, much like they did in the first chapter.<br/><br/>One of my biggest problems with this movie was the overuse of CGI, and the expected jump scare in every other scene. It was too predictable, and did not deliver one truly horrifying scene. You see Pennywise in many different forms, but not one of them is as frightening as the clown form. With that being said, Bill Skarsgård was underutilized. His natural ability to portray Pennywise was overshadowed by giant screaming CGI dummies with bobbling heads.<br/><br/>There's an ongoing joke throughout the film that foreshadows the insipid ending. This is likely referring to Stephen King himself, as he has been known to make monotonous endings to overall adequate stories. This happens to be one of those stories. Rather than altering the ending, they make fun of it, which just comes off as lazy. Perhaps they were trying to play it safe, but it failed nonetheless. What brings Pennywise to his knees in the end is utterly disappointing, and quite pathetic. Fans deserved a better ending. Sorry, Stephen.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a well written and scary sequel to follow the first chapter of It, you will be let down. Though there are some fun and enjoyable moments thanks to the talented cast, it does not make up for the inconsistencies and lazy story telling. The shockingly horrifying and successful triumph that was It: Chapter One should have had a better second half."
"djmichaelangelo-34810","1","3","4","23 September 2019"," bad decisions by the film-makers
","Okay so there were some good parts to this movie, but also some awfully ill-advised things the movie-makers chose to do, which were a deal-breaker for me.<br/><br/>The foul language especially near the beginning was a turn-off, and a lazy creative lack of good dialog. Needing to hear the F-word 800 times in 1/2 hour isn't really necessary. I thought I was watching a Quentin Tarrintino movie.<br/><br/>Seeing a vicious bloody gay-bashing was disturbing and unnecessarily, the over-the-top brutality of it did nothing for the plot. Seeing that in the first 5 minutes of the film made me, as a gay man, more disturbed and troubled than any of the jumpy scary points later on in the movie.<br/><br/>That said, it was a poor judgment call showing 2 gay guys openly kissing each other passionately for a lingering minute shortly after the movie starts. As much as it pains me to say it, some of Middle America is just not ready for that yet. I heard audible groans in the theatre behind me when that scene came on-screen, like bunches of people saying ew; and stuff.<br/><br/>Granted this was a backwoods small-town theatre, so lots of ignorance there, but that's one thing Hollywood will never understand in their liberal bubble: they assume 100% of the audience seeing the movie will be totally fine with 2 men kissing on the lips within the first 5 mintues of the flim. The flim-makers just can't comprehend how anyone could ever have a problem with that, but unfortunately even in this day and age, they do. So quit trying to shove that agenda in everyone's face; stick to the movie's plot and important points instead. And yes I realize Adrian and his BF were in the book, I've read it a half-dozen times over the years.<br/><br/>The ending was lame too, no surprise there....what, did they insult the spider to death? Kind of anti-climactic. The other thing that made me dislike this film was its length. So indulgent of these Hollywood film-makers, putting out a nearly 3-hour movie (which yes I did know it ahead of time) but it really seemed to drag in certain spots.

There is no atmosphere, no suspense, cheap jump scares that never offer more than a light ""ooh"" from the audience and the awful cgi that plagued the first film. Pennywise is relegated to a side character, and not a very scary one. Bill Skarsgard does the best he can with the role, but pennywise lacks any of his wit and personality so well written by King, here he's no more than a cliche horror movie villain, and serves no more purpose than that of any other average horror movie villain, the writers failed to capture one of the most terrifying horror novel antagonists of all time.<br/><br/>The casting is stellar, with Bill Hader standing out as the comic relief character of Richie Tozier, and his character from the novel is well translated, James Mcevoy and Jessica Chastain also do solid jobs with there characters, however I feel like they're doing just that, playing characters. They don't feel lived in, they don't feel like these were the kids we seen from the first movie. Unlike the book no backstory is given to these characters, what they were doing for the last 27 years. What is there motivation to return to Derry? In the book the characters mull this decision, here they return to Derry without batting an eye. And again why hasn't pennywise returned? This is never explained to the novel ignorant audience. It feels as if neither the losers or pennywises' motivations have any real depth, leaving the audience not caring about what happens to these characters.<br/><br/>In the end the movie really went down the sewer along with pennywise as it failed to capture the essence of the novel, it's an uneven, tonally inconsistent sequel that's not very scary or a very faithful adaptation. Read the novel instead, where you'll be scared and moved by the losers battle with pennywise. Beep beep Andy, you failed to make this one float."
"southdavid","6","3","4","13 September 2019"," .. but doctor, I am Pennywise.
","I said in my review of Chapter one, that though I really liked that film, one of my concerns was that this was the easy half of the story to tell. Though I didn't like Chapter 2 as much, I did feel it mostly avoided the potential pitfalls and was an OK conclusion.<br/><br/>27 years after the children of Derry forced Pennywise (Bill Skarsgaard) into an early hibernation, Mikey (Isaiah Mustafa) the only one of the gang to have stayed in town, recalls his friends to honour the oath they swore, should Pennywise remerge. With the town in their past, their memories of their horrific battle have magically dissipated, but as they return, the recollections and the horror come back.<br/><br/>I feel like this might be another review where I say that a film was alright, and then just list a series of my problems with it. So I'll try and be clearer.... The film is fine. Perfectly acceptable. Performances are solid, the story is decent enough and some of the pitfalls of the more outlandish (or perhaps offworld-ish) areas of the plot are dealt with as well as they could be. It is, again, reasonably funny - in fact there are more laughs than screams.<br/><br/>That, perhaps, is one of the principle problems though. Again, it's not particularly scary, especially when Pennywise is inhabiting something else and not present in his clown form. There's a lot of CGI creations some of whom are more successful than others. Whilst on the subject of CGI, in some of the flashback scenes, they used software to make some of the young actors more closely resemble themselves from a few years back, this occasionally looks awful and gives poor Jeremy Ray Taylor in particular a plastic face. I don't feel like the adults had the same chemistry that the children had as a group either, despite the big names amongst them.<br/><br/>These failings, along with the lengthy running time, mean I'm probably not going to revisit ""It"" very often, but I do feel this is as strong a version of the story as you are every likely to get on screen."

","What a great movie and combined with chapter 1 easily the best King supernatural horror adaptation. It was long movie and that is good thing. There is just so much to see. Scary part after scary part can become bit overwhelming at times, but viewer must understand that IT feeds more from fear than flesh.<br/><br/>IT is bittersweet movie that probably needs similar small town childhood memories to really work. If you cannot enjoy memories of those never ending summer days with your long lost childhood friends, this is maybe not for you.<br/><br/>Effects and CGI is just perfect, only minor hickups here and there, like too much face distortions and ""in your face"" pseudo 3D.<br/><br/>Only real problem was with humor. It was too funny at times and one scene particular was just so cringy attempt of being funny (the vomit scene). At times it really destroyed all the serious tones and i was left wondering if filmmakers just totally jumped to the comedy-horror genre (Scary Movie style).<br/><br/>But they made up for stupid audiovisual comedy mistakes at the end and i just really enjoyed this movie."

I left theater because the level of boredom was unimaginable"
"tabbylawton","9","3","4","12 September 2019"," Do not treat this as a regular horror film.
","I believe one major problem a lot of people are having with IT:C2 is that they came to view it with just a quick scare in mind, like every other film in this genre & that's where you will walk out of the cinema disappointed. Yes there was a lot of CGI, a lot of jump scares, but if you read the book that is the fastest and easiest way to deliver what King managed to create beautifully (and terrifyingly) in the books. The story that accompanies all this is a great one, it was never just about the horror. Overall this was a really interesting adaptation & people need to watch it for the story of the Losers club, not for the scares."

","I really enjoyed the second chapter, even more than first chapter. Is almost 3 hours, but I think the movie did a good job keeping the action going through the whole movie.<br/><br/>This chapter has more comedy tone than the previous chapter. I liked, but I acknowledged it can be weird to digest.<br/><br/>I think the actors did a good job on their roles. It took me a little to realize the adult characters are ""awkward"", like they have some issues, or are socially awkward.<br/><br/>There is some stuff that was left unexplained (I don't want to say what to avoid spoilers), and the last part of the last fight didn't convinced me entirely, but still I didn't kill my enjoyment.<br/><br/>As a scary movie, it gets tense, is visually strong, and a couple of scenes really made me nervous like no other movie, but I think is still good for casual horror viewers. The key here is you can see Pennywise a lot more on screen, so the movie is more ""honest"" about the horror, and there is just a couple of jump scares."

","Major disappointment for me...got a five for the special effects, but even that was over done...most of the ""funny"" lines, nobody laughed at... there were just SO MANY cheesy moments.. so many that they kind of but together at this point... one thing did stick out in my mind though... when Eddie through the iron piece of fence at Pennywise.... into his mouth... and wounded him..... they just got done showing how there was not backnof his head and he was sort of sucking the dead lights through his head to effect Richie..... so... wouldn't it have flown through his head?? That part didn't actually bother me a lot... just found it funny. But... acting wasn't bad... just the script they were going off of. Pennywise's lines weren't even really that great.<br/><br/>Oh, and there were definitely some scenes where the CGI on the creatures just looked cartoonish... ie: fortune cookie scene when they first hop out of the bowl.. and then I think it was the scene with Pennywise's ""daughter"" when she changes form.<br/><br/>Not sure how the first half of this set was so good, and the second half was rubbish.<br/><br/>Funny tidbit though.... that's sort of how the original miniseries was... the kids did awesome, and the adults really didn't... but back then it really felt like it was the acting, this time it felt like it was the script."

","This was a film that I had been highly anticipating ever since I saw the first one. I kind of that thought that this one would make or break the overall story so I caught this the first night that was I was available to. Then actually caught it a few days later just to make sure what I thought about it. I can already seen that this one is polarizing, which I expected with all of the hype surrounding it. The synopsis is twenty-seven years after their first encounter with the terrifying Pennywise (Bill Skarsg책rd), the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back.<br/><br/>We start this off at the local fair in Derry, Maine. There's a guy playing one of the carnival games and gives the reward to a little girl. We then see that he's gay and kisses his boyfriend. One of them grew up here and wants out where the other one wants to go wherever the other does. They are then attacked by a group of locals who are homophobic. They beat one of them nearly to death and throw him over the bridge. His boyfriend goes looking and sees Pennywise. It then shifts to Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), the only member of the Loser's Club to stay. He makes the call to each member of the Losers Club and to tell them its time to come home.<br/><br/>I won't break down all the aspects of everyone's lives, but Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a famous writer and married to an actress. Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) is married to abusive man and they have a clothing line. Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) is a successfully comedian, Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) is an architect, Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) is a risk analyst and Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is an accountant. They all deal with the news in their own ways, but it rocks them to their core and they start to remember.<br/><br/>They all return to Derry aside from Stanley, who does something that is shocking, but fitting for the character. They catch up with each other, but the mood turns somber when they ask why Mike called them all here. This freaks everyone out and they want all to leave. Mike pleads to Bill to try to change his mind. They have to stop Pennywise and what it does every 27 years. If they're going to defeat it though, they need to reach down and remember the memories they suppressed. Pennywise has a bit of help when we see that Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) survived.<br/><br/>Now I'm going to lead off my recap stating that I enjoyed this film. Much like with the original mini-series, I don't like it as well as the second half of that one. I think the aspects with the children are scarier so when they focus on them as adults, it doesn't get to me as much. I still thought this was good though, so I wanted to get that out of the way before getting into my deeper thoughts on the film.<br/><br/>The first thing I really wanted to get into first is that the acting is great here. Chastain is a solid Beverly, but the one thing that didn't get though is the hurt enough from the character. She does bring quite a bit of strength which I really liked. McAvoy is great in pretty much everything I've seen him in. Hader was absolutely amazing here. There is a sense of hurt here that I really like that he brings with a secret he's been harboring. When it clicked for me it makes so much sense for this why Richie makes the jokes that he does. Mustafa makes for a good Mike who is dealing with the effects of staying in Derry. I like that he's the least successful because of it. Ryan is good as well as Bean. I do have to say that Ransone was hilarious and I thought he was perfect as the adult Eddie. Something I was disappointed about was a lack of Skarsg책rd. We get a decent amount Pennywise, but I wanted a bit more of him messing with them in this form. The children are all back and I thought they were all solid for rounding out the film along with the rest of the cast as well.<br/><br/>The story here though was good for me. I like bringing in the aspect of the novel that they can't remember what happened to them before leaving Derry as that is solid mythology. They also brought up how Pennywise got to where he is and that he's really always kind of been there or at least the entity behind the character has been. There's also a bit of social commentary that was also in the book. The two gay men that are attacked is something that is socially relevant. It's said that in the novel it was set in the 80's, but still works today.<br/><br/>I've heard issues with the pacing of the film. The movie runs close to 3 hours, but to be honest, I didn't notice it. It really kept my interest and moved through everything without getting boring despite the length. It is interesting that with the original mini-series, the first half showed the adults having flashbacks and this one does that instead of the first film. I actually didn't mind it, because it made sense with what they need to do in order to defeat Pennywise. I wasn't the biggest fan how they the film plays out in the end, but I don't think it ruins the film. I personally just wanted it to be a bit bleaker. There was a bit too much comedy for my liking though. It made me laugh, but I also think that it relieves some of the tension for me if I'm honest.<br/><br/>Another issue with the previous movie was the effects of the film. I really didn't have any problems and I didn't here either. There are some interesting, creepy things that were done, but to be honest, I think this one is downplayed a bit more than I wanted. I don't know if it's that they're adults, so it is harder to scare them and that they're having issues remembering. I do like the final form of Pennywise better than what they did in the original while somewhat keeping with it. The deadlights are an interesting aspect. The film looks good and I think where they end up was a bit unbelievable, but I'll let that slide.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I personally think this film lived up to the hype. I tried to avoid the trailers as much as I could so that helps me as well. I thought the story was solid and flipping how it is edited from the original is fine. There's a bit of social commentary here which I can also get behind. I thought the acting was good across the board and despite its running time, it never got boring to me. I wanted it to be a bit bleaker, but I thought the final showdown was good. The movie also looked good and I would say that the effects are as well. Soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but I didn't have any issues there. It fit the scenes for what was needed. I would definitely recommend giving this a viewing. It didn't disappointment, but it also much like the original, this second half is weaker than the first. I would still call this good though."

","Peter Bogdanovich shows up on, what appears to be, a multi-million dollar Warner Brothers film set early on in the film and I thought to myself ""I didn't know this was a 70's period piece.""<br/><br/>That might be the most unrealistic aspect of a movie loaded with killer clowns and ridiculous CGI. I did enjoy most of it, though. The cast is excellent and they commit to some pretty silly scenes with admirable gusto, but the CGI shows up and ruins everything they've been building towards."

The adult actors are fantastic as well.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint would be some shoddy CGI at times, but it was not bad enough to take me out of the movie.<br/><br/>Though good on its own, chapter two is even better as a companion.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to see the 5+ hour supercut using all of the footage (and possibly new stuff) that Muschetti has teased."

I felt like there was so much in the movie to recap the audience on everything that happened in Chapter 1 that I wondered why the producers even decided to split the adaptation into two parts.<br/><br/>What also frustrates me is how much time we spent watching each Loser confront their respective demons. The jump scares lost their effect after a while since each character's personal journey followed the same path.<br/><br/>The friendship of the Loser Club is what makes the movie worth watching. It's most enjoyable when the characters are having fun with each other and expressing their love for one another and their history.

","As a kid in the 80s, this is what I remember movies being like-a fully immersive experience, not a CGI Spectacular or a bunch of self-indulgent performances. Much like the recent It movie, this new series is reminiscent of Goonies, Stand by Me, and other classics featuring a team of kids on a dangerous mission.
It 2 does not feel like a 3-hour film, but maybe that's because I was dreading the length and then was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot to cover and it really packs a lot of story in there, so it's not 3 hours of cinematic show-offery, it's real, faceted, story-moving, character-building meat.
Some of the random zombie stuff and over the top gross-out junk was almost a nod to Dead Alive (1992) or Poltergeist (1982), which was good for a laugh I suppose, but just seemed sloppy to me for some reason.
I had a really good time this afternoon watching this film in a theater-as a matter of fact I saw it at (no joke) the Capital theater in my New England town, which looks a lot like Derry and the theater sign, marquee, and location are eerily similar, as well as the name being identical! Ha. Cool."

","I enjoyed the first 'IT'. Pennywise was legitimately scary and the children's characters were genuinely believable. However, this time around the film just feels like any other mediocre horror. The characters as adults were mundane and have little depth despite the near three hour runtime (which drags a lot by the way). I felt more emotion towards the nameless victims killed in this film than I did for the main characters. Pennywise himself loses that scare factor completely for me. He is shown far too much. The filmmaker appears to favour cheap jump scares rather than building tension. Despite these flaws, I was still mildly entertained watching IT Chapter 2. Most of this is down to both the terrific acting and great comedic timing in the film. Although, as the film progresses jokes are often overused and very hit or miss. The ending is also quite the nail in the coffin. It feels anti climactic and altogether unrealistic. Disappointed to say the least, but still somewhat entertained. 6/10"

","The first It wasn't scary, but it was fun watching the kids interact with each other and having their friendship grow. Like the Goonies but with a killer clown.<br/><br/>The reason it wasn't scary however is that it relied too much on predictable jump scares and not enough on taking its time and genuinely creeping the audience out. 99% of horror elements consisted of look at something - dramatic pause - jump scare and loud noises. Rinse and repeat. A jump scare isn't something that genuinely scares someone, it's just a reflex. To really scare someone you genuinely have to creep them out and there were moments like that: the Georgie scene in the beginning, Bev's abusive father, etc. But they were few and far between.<br/><br/>This chapter doubles down on these weak elements of the first It movie, mixes in a gratuitous amount of CGI, and loses a lot of the charm of the Goonies since they're adults now. Although completely capably acted by all the adults and their chemistry still works well, it's not as endearing the second time around, with grown ups. To boot the best thing about the Loser Squad is always their interactions with each other but instead a large portion of the middle of the film is them all on their own for individual rinse and repeat jumpscare scenes. An entire block of scenes that to me, in a three hour film, should have been cut.<br/><br/>So with It Chapter Two you have a movie that still isn't particularly terrifying, and when compared to the first one, it's bad elements are even more plentiful, and it's good elements aren't as good.

","This one was a letdown compared to the first one. People loved the first one mainly for Pennywise and he was barely in this movie. The only time you'll have a good look at him is in the climax. The rest of the movie is pretty much flashbacks from the previous film.<br/><br/>Most of the scares in the film were because of random creatures and not Pennywise. This is not what I expected. They should have given Pennywise more screen time. Acting wise they were all fine in their roles but sadly the pacing and the direction weren't up to the mark.<br/><br/>Overall it's an average film which could have easily finished within two hours. It was unnecessarily dragged precisely the second half. It's a one-time watch."

","It Chapter 2 is an okay film, however if I'd known before I went to watch it then I'd have just waited till it came out on video/bluray and rented or borrowed it. It just wasn't worth the money.<br/><br/>I thought it was just the exact same as the first one but longer and more boring. The film felt like it was being dragged out. There was a few one liners from Bill Hader's character Richie, but most of them were out of place. James McAvoy's performance was also okay. The CGI in the film ruined it for me because it just wasn't scary or frightening and was quite comic at times.<br/><br/>The third act was just a big CGI mess and also went on for too long. I hope they don't make anymore prequels, sequels or whatever in the future because this film was a major let down."
"vincentmasonry","8","3","4","7 September 2019"," More scares than Chapter 1
","Unlike some of the bad review posted, I thought Chapter 2 had more creepy Pennywise moments that scared me. I got so into the story that it didn't feel S if I was watching an almost 3 hour movie. Unlike some recent films, I didn't have any head nodding off moments. At the end I wasn't leaving feeling unsatisfied and actually took to heart what was said as tears filled my eyes. This isn't meant to be a sequel but the rest of the It story. Unlike others I enjoy comic relief when I being frightened. Good scares and story that is worth the $!"
"huntersmithx","7","3","4","7 September 2019"," Flawed yet semi-satisfying
","I was originally hesitant to see director Andy Muschietti's rendition of Stephen King's beloved book ""It"" back in 2017, but after hearing splendid reviews from fans and critics; I took a chance and came out pleasantly surprised. Since then, I agree with why that is now considered by many to be a modern Horror classic.<br/><br/>Now our favorite Losers club are back to face Pennywise again in ""It: Chapter Two"". Adding up all of that and that this is my second most anticipated mainstream film of the year, does it live up to the hype? Well, somewhat. It's an imperfect but solid sequel.<br/><br/>In spite of a three hour runtime it kept my attention for the entire ride. Like ""Chapter One""; it's wonderfully shot (with effective use of sepia tone colors) and the editing and scene transitions are eye popping. Many of the dialogue and scares are cleverly written (a scene at a restaurant is a highlight).<br/><br/>In spite of an often unsettling plot, there is plenty of levity to be found here. It unfortunately suffers from inappropriate timing with many of the jokes, causing the film to play like a dark comedy. Half of the frightening and dramatic moments are finished by gags and one-liners. There is one scary sequence that really works until it's ruined by a joke straight out of a Deadpool film.<br/><br/>The pacing is troubling at times; since some of the opening introductions are rushed, while certain flashbacks to the younger versions of the Losers Club could've been shorter. This makes the narrative not feel as fresh or as fulfilled compared to the first film.<br/><br/>It's most accomplished at being an emotionally fulfilling journey for the Losers club. This is sharpened by the adult actors being dead ringers for the kids from the original; including the main highlight Bill Hader- an instant classic as Richie, as he combines the best of his talent from ""Saturday Night Live"" with intense urgency to best serve the idea of ""What would Richie from It be like if he grew up?""<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good cinematic start for this Halloween season, and something to bring you back all the feels from Chapter One from September 2017; Chapter Two is a somewhat messy but nicely done job.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

","Im just gonna come right out with it Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd Pennywise Creepy hell out of me, you know what I love it, this is the perfect adaption to a real Pennywise from the Stephen King book. Not to say this was, by all means, a bad sequel this was way above average, I do feel the first film was better on the scary jump points that gave you chills.<br/><br/>Not that this sequel has them, there are a few moments throughout this film that give you those moments of did that just happen and another moment when pennywise is just being seriously creepy to the point it almost like a child with sinister intentions that give you the chills, the film doesn't try to overplay it.<br/><br/>I swear this is the creep part of the film, the casting! When you are watching the character all grown up it really freaky how well cast this film is because each act in this film acted and play the older version of the kids. It like they were cast as themselves in the first film just younger and now playing the older version in the sequel, never before have I seen this in any film, so this is well done by the Cast and director.<br/><br/>The film itself just give some what of a background to it but doesn't really go into too much detail of why this demon ended up on the earth, though Stephen kings book actually does go into more detail which has a connection to another Stephen King book the dark tower.<br/><br/>But as ive said It chapter two is way above average and actually a pretty good sequel, probley by now people are wondering how does the ending happen, that I can't give away because of spoilers, all I can say is it better than what teh TV series of it did, though I do feel it could have been done slighty a bit better on IT true form reveal, but I understand what they were going for with the way it ended.<br/><br/>With talk of a possible third film, to be honest, the only direction I can see them taking is a prequel way before the loser club stumbles on the demonic clown, possible around the era of the circus or further back. It chapter two is worth watching but seriously dont take a red balloon from a strange clown you might just end up floating, as they all float down here.<br/><br/>Dislikes: There are a few slighty pacing issues where scene jump slighty drags the film down, the scary part of the film was a little dull in this sequel which is because we're used to watching Pennywise from the first film.<br/><br/>The big reveal of It true form was good, it was miles better than the original Tim curry It tv series, but I do feel as if it could have been designed a little more frightening, but I understand what they were going for it would have been the same if they had the look a different way."

","What is the point of changing the story when there is nothing original or even interesting in what's being changed? This adaptation, both parts, are barely above mediocre and that's only if you've read the book and can fill in the gaps for everything they left out. The director went in not knowing what he was going to do with the story and how he wanted to do it (in an interview, he actually said he's still not done and plans to shoot more footage to add to these) so it comes out feeling disorganized and sloppy; they don't quite fit. The movie relied too heavily on CGI (which, more often than not, just looked ridiculous) but still failed use the technology to do what the miniseries couldn't and include the best parts of the novel. Instead, we again get vague references that make no sense without having read the book, things that were totally ripped off from other movies and references to other Stephen King work. Casting was perfect and there were some interesting visuals but even they couldn't save this."

Also, the balance of humor and horror in the first film was really well done, but in this one the balance Is gone. Jokes are made in serious moments and they really feel out of place.
The cgi was horrible too, unnecesary and definitely not scary.

","Chapter 1 got almost everything right. Great cast chemistry, excellent character development, tense scenes, build up of suspense, and only a few jump scare moments.<br/><br/>In contrast Chapter 2 was well acted, but the chemistry was off, we got very little insight into who these characters are as adults, the scenes were less tense and more dull, the suspense was lacking and the movie as a whole relied too heavily of jump scares than actually building any real suspense. Quite frankly, it was poorly written and directed, and that includes the fearful monster of Pennywise - who spent more time as some deranged CGI character than Bill Skarsgard's excellent portrayal from Chapter 1.<br/><br/>IT - the book - has over 1000 pages, and yet I found myself questioning the direction that the production took. Sure, changes have to be made to made scenes work for the screen, but Chapter 1 did it masterfully, Chapter 2 left a lot to be desired. Leaving out whole, and important, sections of the book and adding new scenes whose only purpose seemed to be the unfortunate victims of the horror trope jump scares. It's been done to death, sure people jump, then the scene goes back to being some strange CGI concoction that's more gore and gross than scary, leaving the actors to carry the whole plot.<br/><br/>Hey! Hollywood! Well written suspense and thrill can be just as scary as jumps and gore.<br/><br/>It's such a disappointment when Chapter 1 was so good; and it set some very high expectations that Chapter 2 failed to meet.<br/><br/>The running time is almost three hours, and I think I was bored for all but 25 minutes of it."

","Before talking about IT Chapter 2. I must say that IT the prequel left me wondering about a lot of things. IT Chapter 2 puts a lot of those thoughts into place. If you haven't read the book like me then you may have felt the same.<br/><br/>First off, I did not like the homophobic tones of the movie. However the book was written many years ago and I think it does create a necessary conversation.<br/><br/>The transitions in this movie are so well thought out. From the beginning transition I got chills and could tell I was in for a ride.
The characters stay true to themselves through out both movies and it really helps to create different emotions beyond fear. Story wise it felt a lot less cluttered and forced than the first movie. Which helped to solidify the story in my mind and tie off any loose ends.
Overall the aesthetic of the movie is fantastic and creepy at the same time. Some of the CGI was average at best which became an immersion breaker sometimes but it didn't kill the whole movie. IT Chapter 2 was a solid movie and I loved almost every second of it. It left me feeling satisfied with a lot to talk about with friends."

The scenes with him in were more creepy than the ones with him screwing with their heads and exposing their fears. Yes they needed those scenes, but just a few more Pennywise scenes would have given it a solid 9/10 for me. You won't be disappointed none the less."

","This instalment has a marvelous cast, and everyone, including James McAvoy (because he is James McAvoy), was great. But Bill Skasgard is the true star and does not disappoint one bit. Though he is not creepy, he is a fullblown murderous entity out to eat kids. There are many jump scares, and the loud sounds make the movie particularly jarring; making the horror more enjoyable. It has less character exploration than the first one, and less creepy, but it is an all out monster fest in the end. The movie seems to drag, and could have been a standalone movie without having to feature the previous casts. Though the decision to do so was to connect the story with the furst instalment. But it dragged the story and felt repetitive. The only backstory that was effective was James McAvoy's character, provided good character motivation. In short, the movie was fun, the casting was great, though the story coukd have been leaner."

"nicetryjan","5","4","6","8 September 2019"," Pales in comparison to the first
","For one, IT (2) feels more like a comedy than a horror. I found myself actually laughing in some of the scenes that I think were intended to be frightful. A prime example is when Beverly visits her old apartment that is now occupied by Mrs. Kersh. Suddenly, this sweet old lady transforms into a tall zombie woman that chases her through the halls. Another is when they are sitting around the table at the restaurant and their fortune cookies start hatching with monstrous creatures. It was laughable and so was the CGI.<br/><br/>Also, where was Pennywise? One of my only complaints about the first one was the lack of screen time for Pennywise but in the sequel he has even LESS. He randomly appears a couple times during the three hour film and when he does, it's very brief. Except for the dragged out ending where he becomes a ginormous spider. Apart from the ending, a scene with Richie and one scene with Bill, the clown has pretty much no interaction with the adult members of the losers club.<br/><br/>Henry Bowers? His character was literally useless and irrelevant in the movie. I honestly don't even know why they brought him back since he was believed to have died in the first one. He was only there to try and kill the main characters who ultimately kill him. No relevance to the plot. How did he even know where everyone would be? Oh right, he was being drove around by his zombie friend in a car.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a decent sequel that fails to live up to the first. The opening scene with Adrian Mellon being murdered was by far the best scene in the film. That scene alone was very intense, brutal, and felt like a good opening to a horror film. Unfortunately, after that, it turns into more of a comedy."

"staticstation1","5","4","6","8 September 2019"," IT: CHAPTER TWO... IT's pointless
","When my friends and I saw that the prior film was the first portion of a two-part story we were captivated to continue the journey, just with a different cinema experience after an awful one. Most of my friends returned for the sequel and we had another annoying cinema experience.<br/><br/>*SMALL RANT*
If you want to text or have your phone out during your time at the cinema, don't come. Think about the people surrounding you for a change as we have come to the cinema to have a pleasurable experience and not worry about whose messaging you or not.<br/><br/>Anyway It: Chapter Two.
So, let's see how it is...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSITIVES!
There is no question that the adult casting for these characters was spot on! There is an array of talent assembled here for this project and everyone does their best job at establishing these characters as adults with their performances and, especially, looks. Most of the actors shared satisfactory chemistry with each other, with the dinner scene being the best example of that interaction. I'm a massive fan of Bill Hader so he was defiantly the standout for me. A lot of audiences were worried about his acting ability going in, and critics seem to be impressed with his performance. I had faith in Hader from the start since I'm a big fan of the HBO series Barry. The film itself has wonderful cinematography which continues that unnerving atmosphere that Muschietti establish in the prior film. And the sets and locations are all well designed with a lot of practical elements that were greatly appreciated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIXED!
While it's enjoyable to revisit this enticing narrative, the actual plot of the film has a more action/adventure movie flavour to it without a great deal of action taking place. This makes the film seem less like a genuine horror film and more like an event. And the design of Pennywise the Clown I'm still varied on, since I'm under the impression that Pennywise is a form IT takes to lure its victims. Doesn't change the fact that it's still an impressive and eerie design.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEGATIVES!
This script feels awfully vacant with a lot of filler and slow pacing. The film isn't scary. It has mostly jump scares and not enough of that uncanny sensation that the prior film included. The second act is so rinse and repeat, with the flashbacks and scares, that it becomes tremendously predictable. There are setups with no significant pay off, so much so that they could be erased from the film. And there are components of the script that could've been better explained and/or adapted. And the climax of the third act is so incredibly tacky that it feels like an ending from Goosebumps with a cheesy message of togetherness and overpowering a tormenter. Lastly, with the script, is character. While we have the prior film to understand what these characters WERE like, there's no strong depiction of how these characters are as adults. There are some things that are settled, but not enough. The film just jumps straight in without a significant or defined setup. Moments and components of the first film, that I didn't agree with, are here as well and that's in the editing. Segments from the trailers were so powerful that I couldn't wait to see them on the big screen, but they're ruined when the editors would distort the image or sound. With the child actors, they had to be digitally de-aged and had to sound younger with ADR. It was incredibly distracting if you were aware of these elements going in. The visual effects were a step up from the CGI of the first, but still weren't completely solid. And the overall enjoyment of the film was weird since I was laughing and enjoying other workings, but the horror elements just weren't around enough to enjoy that genre.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the end, It: Chapter Two wasn't on the same level as the prior film, which has gone down in my enjoyment and rewatchability. This film is going to go down a lot faster with the script that this sequel offered. So unbalanced and vacant with its narrative and character. Perhaps in a double-feature event, audiences would feel differently, but I'm unsure of that impression."

"bankofmarquis","8","4","6","7 September 2019"," Hader steals the film
","The ""secret sauce"" of the first chapter of IT (based on the horror novel by Stephen King) was NOT the gore or scares that were thrown at the audience, it was the characters and the performances that made that first film work. The young members of the ""Loser's Club"" - and especially the young actors populating these characters - created people that you wanted to root and cheer for throughout their ordeal with Pennywise the Clown and the bullies of Derry.<br/><br/>So...it should have been a ""no-brainer"" for Director Andy Muschietti and the filmmakers to repeat that pattern - it worked very, very well. But, somewhere along the way they forgot what made the first film good and Muschietti and new screenwriter Gary Dauberman decided to focus on the horror, gore and frights and let their talented group of adult actors inhabit the characters with little (maybe no) help from the screenplay.<br/><br/>And...the result is a ""fine"" film that wraps up the first film just ""fine"", but ultimately falls short of that first film and definitely falls short of what ""could have been"".<br/><br/>IT: CHAPTER TWO picks up 27 years later when Pennywise the Dancing Clown comes back (per his cycle) to terrorize the children of Derry once again. The Loser's Club from the first film band back together (per their pact at the end of the first film) to battle - and finally destroy - this dark threat.<br/><br/>The filmmakers pull a strong group of actors together to play the adult versions of the Loser's Club - headlined by Jessica Chastain (ZERO DARK THIRTY) as the adult Beverly Marsh and James McAvoy (Professor X in the recent run of X-MEN films) as the adult Bill Denborough. I find McAvoy to be (for the most part) a solid, if unspectacular, actor and he is true to from here. Solid, but unspectacular in a role that was written that way. Chastain, perhaps, is the biggest disappointment for me in this film as the young Beverly Marsh (as portrayed by Sophia Lillis) was the highlight of the first film but here this character is...bland and somewhat boring. I don't fault Chastain (an actress that I usually enjoy very, very much), I blame the screenplay which saddles these two characters with an underwritten ""love triangle"" with the adult Ben Hascombe (Jay Ryan - somewhat of a newcomer, who has smoldering good looks, but not much else going for him). It was rumored that Chris Pratt was circling this character (I would imagine he walked away when he saw the screenplay). That's too bad, for he might have brought some life to all 3 of these characters.<br/><br/>Faring better is the usually reliable Isiah Mustafa (TV's SHADOWHUNTERS) as the adult Mike Hanlon, the only one of the Loser's Club who stayed in Derry to keep a vigilant watch against Pennywise' return. He has a haunted air about him - certainly in keeping with the the past that only he remembers. And Andy Bean (SWAMP THING) has a nice couple of moments as the adult Stanley Uris.<br/><br/>The only truly interesting dynamic of the returning Loser's Club is the characters and love/hate relationship between the older Eddie Kaspbrak, the hypochondriac (played by James Ransome, TV's THE WIRE) and smart-mouth Richie Tolzier (inhabited by SNL vet Bill Hader). While Ransome's Eddie is quite a bit more interesting than he was as a youth (and that's no slight on Jack Dylan Grazer who played the younger Eddie, I just found Ransome's portrayal more nuanced and somewhat more interesting). But it is Hader who steals this film. His Richie is constantly using humor to cover his emotions building on the interesting characterization that Finn Wolfhard brought to the younger version and giving us more. Hader is a master comedian, so handles the comedy parts as deftly as you would think he would, but it is when the other emotions - fear, rage, love - come barreling out of him that Hader elevates this character (and the movie) to a higher level. I would be thrilled if Hader was nominated for an Oscar for this role - he is that good.<br/><br/>Also coming back are all of the ""kids"" from the first film to flesh out some scenes - and set up some other scenes/moments by the adults - they are a welcome addition and shine a spotlight at how weak - and underwritten - most of the adult characters are in this film.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgard is seen quite a bit more as Pennywise - and that makes him less menacing and threatening (but still scary) and there are 2 fun cameos along the way by 2 prominent individuals, so that was fun.<br/><br/>There is a running gag throughout the film about author Bill Denborough (the surrogate for Stephen King) not being able to write a decent ending - a critique that King receives constantly - and they changed the ending of this film from the book. I am a big fan of the book, but would agree that the ending of the book was not that good, so was open to this trying a different way to end things...and...this new ending lands about as well as the original ending (oh well...).<br/><br/>But that's just a quibble, for by that time you've ridden with these characters for over 5 hours and while the first chapter is stronger than the first, the journey is good (enough) for an enjoyable (enough) time at the Cineplex.<br/><br/>Come for the Loser's Club and the scares - stay for Hader's Oscar worthy performance.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B+<br/><br/>7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"pphaltane","8","4","6","7 September 2019"," It's Horror and Comedy and Drama
","Never have I ever seen more similarity in characters and their grown-up versions. The looks and their acting is uncanningly similar. Kudos to casting. Bill Skarsgård has delivered an amazing thrilling clown performance as before. The movie is about as frightening as last one with often jump scares and gross gore details. Comedy is a high element in this second part by portraying it in words and actions equal. However, use of zombie make-up or graphics feels a tad bit more than required and backfires couple of times removing horror from serious scenes. There is an unexpected special appearance which fits well. Also, there are a few easter eggs or trivial similarities that remind you of previous works of Stephen King. All together, the creators have delivered a movie with expansive range of imagination and storyline that is worth one time watch.
My rating 7.5"
"onekingprods-54469","5","4","6","7 September 2019"," A Messy Screenplay Makes for an Unfocused Film...
","What many folks are picking up on is that Chapter 2 lacks the focus and atmosphere of Chapter 1. It's very busy, yet it never seems to actually establish a connection with the characters as adults, nor expand the mythos of Pennywise and Derry much further than what was done in Chapter 1. Further, there were plenty of scenes in the film that didn't serve to move the story forward, and could easily have been excised, allowing the movie to feel a bit tighter.<br/><br/>People like to poke fun at the 1990 miniseries, but, for all its foibles, I have to say that it created a better sense of tense atmosphere in Chapter 2, told a more cohesive story, and used Pennywise to greater effect. Plus, the adults seemed more fleshed out and sympathetic and were all given moments to allow you to really connect with them and root for them. Finally, in the miniseries, I have to admit it was nice not hearing f-bombs every 2 seconds and having to deal with typical woke Hollywood virtue signaling.<br/><br/>So, while Chapter 1 gave us great characters, great story, and great atmosphere, Chapter 2 almost completely fails in all 3 categories. If you think you can wait a few months for Blu-ray and streaming, I would recommend it. If you're just too anxious to see this film (I totally get it), then just know that you'll probably have fun, but won't have that ""satisfying thriller"" experience you were hoping for."
"swostos","5","4","6","7 September 2019"," Not even Pennywise can save this circus
","I'll skip repeating what others here have already said about the plot being disjointed, characters cliched, dialogue awkward, tension weak, and scares predictable. Chapter One had similar issues (albeit in not so exaggerated a form that it dried up all patience and good will), but what it did have was Skarsgård and his Pennywise the Clown, who, as a debut movie monster, was surprisingly unique and mesmorizingly haunting.
Chapter Two does not have the benefit of being a debut; the audience already knows what Pennywise is about. In short, the magic is gone. IT in the first film was an out-of-this-world force of inconceivable breadth. IT in the sequel is a familiar monster up to the same old tricks (down to the very way he stalks and chomps his victims); and, in being so, loses much of his power.
""Pennywise has returned to Derry!"" is supposed to be the driving vehicle of tension for the film. But it feels like Pennywise never left. He's doing exactly what he's always done, like the uncle that asks you to pull his finger every Thanksgiving. Skarsgard is a talented actor. The filmmakers had no shortage of opportunities to rekindle the magic of the once-mysterious monster, who, having been humiliated by defeat, could have returned in Chapter Two with a vengeance, more cunning, more menacing, more malevolent. Every opportunity was squandered. And so the only bouy keeping the first film afloat, is no longer there to save the second from sinking."

"Benslie","8","4","6","7 September 2019"," A good followup to the first one
","First of all, the adult cast was outstanding playing the older versions of the kids. Yes, some of them may not look like them physically but they still knocked their parts out of the water. For me there wasn't a weak actor in this film but the two that stood out the most out to me was Bill Hader, who plays adult Richie, and James Ransone, who plays adult Eddie, because these two characters already were standouts in the first movie and they helped cement that status with what they did with their characters in this film. Bill Skarsgard once again was great as Pennywise and still doesn't help with mine or anybody's fear of clowns. Now, this film is two-hours and forty-nine-minutes long with credits and two-hours and forty-five-minutes without credits and I'm going, to be honest with you at certain points you start to feel that time. There were some scenes that went on far too long that I think they could have cut down and also certain scenes that could have just been left out entirely. Apparently, this film was originally four-hours long and you can kind of see where they had to cut certain things out. But I will say that there are points in this film where you feel like a fly on the wall in this film and the time just flies by. I think that in this film they used more CGI compared to the first one and honestly it doesn't look that great. This isn't a spoiler cause the kid actors have said this in interviews but they had to de-age the kids in this film so they matched what they looked like during the first film and you don't really notice it. Although I will say that in one scene a character doesn't sound the same and it's pretty obvious. But for the rest of the CGI, it just wasn't the greatest. In the end, this film is a good follow-up to the first film with stellar performances and a great story."
"jeterfans-67743","8","4","6","7 September 2019"," Losers stick together
","Personally, I liked the first chapter better. There's something about a group of kids with a coming of age story that really is magical. But I will say that I was satisfied with how the movie played out.
Pros: Great acting. Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård own this movie. The casting is amazing and they aren't shy about it. The story is relatively simple compared to IT: Chapter One, but it doesn't really lessen the movie. It's actually much more emotional then scary, at least that's what I think.
Cons: The beginning was great but it starts to slow down towards the middle, not boring but it feels drawn out. There are some high stakes moments where a joke is definitely not needed, but it's there. Also make sure not to eat and drink a lot while at the theatre. IT is a LONG movie.
There are some changes I was thrown off by but I didn't mind, since I'm so used to the original book's story. I know people are divided on this but I say IT Chapter Two had a beautiful, yet surprising ending. Definitely give it a watch if you liked IT: Chapter One"

","355. It Chapter Two. I loved Chapter One, I loved Chapter Two. Picks up 27 years after the events of the original, you know, when the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, had a child orgy and made a promise to come back if Pennywise returned. That's not what happened? And right on schedule Robert Gray appears back on the scene to eat some children. Mike Hanlon, the only member of the Losers Club to stay in Derry and witnesses what's going on, starts making some calls to the other members of the group and asks them all to come home, the issue with that is, people who leave Derry tend to forget Derry, so it takes some begging, and they all all make it home, well, almost. And as they each explore the town, Pennywise comes out to play to welcome them home, cause he's missed them, they're like the ones that got away. Leading up to a showdown to bring an end to Pennywise, once and for all. Pretty sweet creepy effects once again, good casting of the adult losers club!! End Pennywise once and for all.. LOL... Yes the million years old Pennywise was defeated by the Losers Club, which they did 27 years prior as well. How did the defeat him once and for all, by performing a ritual passed down to Mike by a group of Native Americans, who performed the ritual and then were promptly eaten by Pennywise. My guess is, Pennywise likes these games. At the end of the day, Pennywise finished his cycle of eating Derry's precious little bundles of joy, got a kick out of The Loser's Club actually coming back to get their asses kicked once again, losing a few losers along the way, put on a little show for them, and went to sleep, and will come back to suck the marrow from their grandchildren's bones in 27 years. :) All Hail The Crimson King!!

","I'll start by saying that I had every hope that this would be a fun and enjoyable horror movie, but unfortunately it is an excruciatingly bad movie. My biggest complaint is that it seems like Bill Skarsgard is only in this 3-hour movie for maybe 2 or 3 minutes at the absolute most, and what I mean is that 95% of the time you see Pennywise its always cheap-looking CGI. There are probably 20 or 30 times in this movie where a CGI Pennywise rushes towards the camera with his head violently shaking back and forth for some unknown reason. This same exact ""jump scare"" happens over and over and over until you could literally fall asleep right in the middle of one.<br/><br/>Another massive failure of this movie was the constant idiotic humor from the comic relief characters (mostly Bill Hader). I love Bill Hader, and comic relief is totally fine, but most of his humor was really badly written and ruined any chance of this movie being taken even remotely seriously. The humor seemed like a last minute attempt by the filmmakers to save this awful movie from total failure.<br/><br/>Im sure people will think Im just a hater but let me state for the record that I rated the previous It a solid 8/10, and that was actually a cool and well-made horror movie, whereas the sequel was a headache-inducing mess."

"ricardo_naud","2","29","75","5 September 2019"," Awful, not even close to the first movie
","I liked the first movie, it was entertaining, well done and had some good jump scares. This second movie, however, is awful. I had to come in here and write my review after the movie to bring some justice-- don't trust the rating! The first movie is far, far better than this. As for the movie, it begins nicely, but after the first monsters in CGI appear it just goes downhill-- I honestly couldn't believe how ridiculous and bad the CGI was, seriously. It didn't seem to match the movie so far and sure as hell didn't blend with the live action on screen. It was forgivable though, especially with the joke soon afterwards.
Unfortunately, the movie does not get better. The majority of it is spent in scenes that are ""individual to each character"", which I will not go into detail to avoid spoilers. But they are boring, not scary and do not add to the plot. Hey, I thought we were going to see a group effort to get rid of Pennywise, right? Like in the first movie! But no, I guess the writers fell short and had to make up a stupid excuse to make movie with these stupid individual scenes. After several of those, it seemed like it was finally moving forward, but it just went on and on and on... I did my best effort to stay as much as I could because I wanted to see the conclusion, but after 2 hours of this nonsense, geez... what a test of patience! It has been a long time since I've walked out of a theater during a movie, but I couldn't stay for the end of this one. It came to a point where my patience was stretched enough to the point of no return. I walked out of the theater with a little over 2 hours in the movie.

"art-steventon","9","6","11","7 September 2019"," Almost perfect sequel
","IT Chapter 2...
Picking up straight from the end of Chapter One, Ch.2 almost seamlessly continues the story - in one viewing, there won't be any noticeable difference in terms of the actor's ages for the child versions of the characters (which sometimes happens with sequels a few years apart). The casting of the adult version of the losers is flawless - Bill Hader's take on Richie Tozier and James Ransom's Eddie Kasparak being the stand out performances (in fact, the weakest is probably James McAvoy's Bill, but thats still a brilliant performance).
Where the film works best is in the mix of humour and horror - it retains an humanity that some modern horror loses in return for an almost sadistic voyerism of the gore rather than have us empathise with the victims / heroes (or even, turn the monster into an anti-hero). Here, the Losers are flawed, 'normal' people, driven to do and witness things no-one should.
If anything, the part of Henry Bowers feels almost unnecessary - a side story that's not given enough time to grow as such and to be honest, the movie wouldn't have suffered from him being left on the cutting room floor.
When the first movie came out, the comparison between the previous Pennywise - Tim Curry, and this version, Bill Skarsgaard was the topic of a lot of heated debate - with this concluding chapter, Bill has made the role 'his' forever - sad when it needs to be, horrific and monstrous otherwise, yet the viewer never feels sympathy for him, nor should they.
A solid 9/10 - a perfect sequel!"

That storyline was butchered and now Patrick is just driving him around? What?! I just said alrighty and tried not to overthink it. Audra never showed up to take that final bike ride and Pennywise's final form was meh. Give us the giant world eating spider we waited for. And no Maturin either. Total letdown. However Hader & Ransone were the cast standouts. More so Ransone as adult Eddie stole every scene he was in. Hollywood needs to take notice of this guy's talent. Eddie being my favorite character in the novel & Ransone did him justice. All in all it just fell a bit flat but as the running gag stated, ""the ending sucked."""

The monsters look terrible and look more hilarious than scary, the jokes fall flat. Bill Hader's jokes suck. Some decent acting, particular by Jessica Chataine and James McAvoy.

","Man I wanted to like this movie so bad. Definitely one of the most anticipated of the year for me. But it fell flat.
-Bad dialogue. Any one who thinks some of these jokes are funny must be a thirteen year old boy. Why did the adult characters still talk like when they were eleven? I laughed maybe once or twice.
-Absolutely horrible CGI. Me and my family were laughing at how terrible the effects were. The monsters ended up looking more silly and stupid than scary.
-Way too damn long. It became almost painful to sit through this almost three hour long film. Parts of it (especially the middle portion) were so boring and seemed pointless, making it feel longer. I understand the book has a lot of material.. but maybe do three movies, or it should have just been made into a miniseries or something.
-Too much minor characters, not enough Pennywise. We want to see Pennywise dammit, not all these lame monsters. And the mullet guy? Sooooo pointless. He should have been cut completely.
-Lame jump scares. Not scary at all. I didn't jump once. You'll only be scared of this movie if you're a little girl.
-Dumb ending. So Pennywise basically gets bullied to death and that's how they kill him? So dumb.. not exciting at all.
Just to add some positivity: the acting was pretty good, especially from Bill Skarsgaard, who is great as Pennywise. The film looks really nice as well. But that's about it. Also, the story was not compelling in the slightest. Wasn't interesting at all. My family and I nearly walked out, but I stopped them cause I thought we should at least finish it.

","IT Chapter 2 explorers the hidden fears of 7 childhood friends who in their preteen years had 'defeated' Pennywise the evil clown (but not killed). 27 years later, IT returns once again to terrorise the small town of Derry and one by one the children, now adults, reluctantly return to their hometown for one final showdown, this time to finish the job. The movie is filled with the usual sound and visual effects seen in every horror flick, but also gives each character individual time to explore their suppressed fears and anxieties which IT uses to it's own benefit when hunting children.
VFX are awesome quality alongwith the sound. Dialogues provide comic relief in few tense moments.
It's an apt treatment of the Stephen King classic by Andy Muschietti.<br/><br/>Only downside of the movie is its 2hr 49 min runtime, which leads to slow pacing after halftime.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic movie which combines elements of typical sound and effects, slashers, enough blood and gore, yet forces you to think and empathise with the character's childhood fears."

If that is the case why is he pandering on and on with the losers club? The biggest problem I had with it was the CGI it's everywhere, whatever happened to some make up or prosthetics I just find it so lazy in hollywood these days. It's not a bad film nor is it great it's a good sequel very rarely you find a sequel better than the first and I'm afraid this is another to add to the first of films that aren't as great as the first.

","OK, maybe this last chapter is not 100% PERFECT like the tv movie or 2017's frist movie, perhaps the central part is a little too repetitive, I would have deepened the lives of the adult losers, extending the initial part when Mike calls them and perhaps the central part shorter. Also a bit too much CGI, but overall this ""chapter 2"" remains a great horror, with moments of real terror and a wicked and ruthless pennywise, really cool.<br/><br/>My rating is 8/10, after that rubbish of Pet Sematary 2019, we can finally go for a great return of Stephen King."
"littleb-40961","1","6","12","9 September 2019"," A bland, boring assault on an iconic story.
","It: Chapter Two is bad.<br/><br/>As a fan of the book and first film, there were a few scenes I enjoyed and though there are one or two performances that hit right, they dropped the ball hard with this one.<br/><br/>Starting with where the bad of this film begins, the writing is awful. It tried and failed to capture the parts of the book and Chapter One that intrigued so many people.<br/><br/>Then, there's the acting. I expected so much more from such huge names, who I'm an active fan of because of their talent, and I think the biggest disappointment for me was Jessica Chastain's Beverly. Being the powerhouse of an actress she is, I expected her usual quality of performance but something was lacking. It could have to do with the writing, but I can't pinpoint it. Bill Hader and James Ransone have satisfactory performances. Isaiah didn't feel like Mike, though he is a good actor. Jay Ryan was alright, I guess? And while his performance as Bill was good, James McAvoy's American accent took me out of the story a lot and he, like everyone else, didn't feel like his character to me.<br/><br/>To flip to a positive take though, the two actors I do think had the best performances are Andy Bean and Jaeden Martell. Andy Bean was the only adult Loser who felt like their character and delivered in his portrayal (though James Ransone also came super close) of his younger counterpart despite only being in a few minutes of the movie. He perfectly captured Stan better than any of the other adults did with their characters. And, then, Jaeden Martell gave such a quality performance as young Bill with only so little time, even stealing the screen from James McAvoy for a few moments. You can tell they both understand their characters deeply and it shines through in the end, with their performances being so natural that they seamlessly slip into the roles of their characters without fault.<br/><br/>It was not a scary film, which is where it fails as a horror movie, and the only scary part was the hate crime that opened the film. (Or if you're like me, you'd agree that the changing of Eddie's last words was a horribly scary part). Every death was a for shock factor and it was a useless gore-fest that drones on. The wacky editing, shock-value deaths, and strange writing direction feels nothing like the tone of Chapter One. As a duo, this sequel fails to match the quality and tone of the first film. It lost its heart and scare-factor in the attempt to make a ""bigger and better"" blockbuster film.<br/><br/>Another aspect that particularly bothers me is the glorification of obsessive behavior on Ben's part toward his love interest Beverly. In Chapter One, one of the only parts I disliked was the blatant romanticization of him kissing her while she was unconscious and the objectification of Beverly in the love triangle. A man obsesses over a woman he barely remembers/knows for 27 years, whom he once kissed while unconscious, and we're supposed to be happy that he ""gets the girl"". We're supposed to be okay with the fact that his entire character arc depends on her loving him so he can cure himself of his insecurity, which boils down to bad and misogynistic writing. Woman are not a tool for you to use to feel better about yourself and they're certainly not there for you to push yourself upon when they aren't able to consent. Do better, write a story about a plus size man being worthy of love and overcoming his own issues without it being at the expense of a girl/woman's autonomy. Stop romanticizing men who take advantage of women, especially when the one in question is already a victim of sexual abuse, as he so clearly did in Chapter One.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, it's a rushed attempt to recreate the magic they had in the book and while making It: Chapter One and it did not deliver. Just reinforcing how wonderful the book and first film are, Chapter Two is not scary, lacks the charm and charisma of the first film, and lacked good writing at its core. Rushed, low quality, and corny can all be used to describe this, as sad as it is to say. With only a few good performances and scenes, It: Chapter Two gets 1/10 for me.<br/><br/>I'm incredibly disappointed in the movie that was put out and down to the core, it starts with how badly it was written and the ripple effects of that couldn't be outrun. A horrible movie, through and through. Forced jokes, bad writing, and overacting killed this film for me.<br/><br/>While entertaining at surface value, it lacked everything that made you love the original story and Chapter One. And, more importantly, it didn't feel like It."

","The movie wasn't incredible, but it wasn't bad. I genuinely enjoyed the movie and actually found myself laughing hysterically. Some people may view this as a weakness in the film, but I feel like it actually kills you into a sense of comfort and complacency that makes the scares land better. I didn't jump at all in the first movie, but I jumped two and a half times in this one. I generally don't go for jump scares, bu I feel like these actually had something to offer. They were more than SUDDEN LOUD NOISE MAKES YOU FEEL ABRUPT INCREASES IN ADRENALINE. I liked it.<br/><br/>The only real critique I have is that Pennywise didn't feel like as much of a threat this time around. He messed with them a little, but he was largely absent. When he did show up, their mother of finally doing him in was... odd. I won't say it was ineffective, but it was an odd approach. I will grant that the first movie was supposed to be fear while the second was self-exploration and coming to grips with yourself, but I still feel that a movie titled ""It"", and that is supposed to be a monster movie, should have more monster.<br/><br/>Also Henry. That was either a waste of a character or an unnecessary addition. Though, in fairness, he did cause one of the funniest scenes."

","Trauma. It sticks with you for all of your life. What are the things you remember? Do you remember more good things than bad? When bad things happen, do they haunt you forever? These are the questions that It: Chapter Two confronts. Pennywise isn't just some scary clown. As Stephen King's horror epic suggests, he's a metaphor for childhood trauma and how to overcome it. In reality, many people are incapable of overcoming trauma. But for fiction's sake, it makes for a better and more rewarding story to imagine our protagonists (The Losers) coming together to defeat it. If you can't escape the clown.. kick it's ass.<br/><br/>It: Chapter Two is not packing the same punch with audiences as the first one did. For starters, it's nearly three hours long. With a runtime like that, you'd better hope that you've made one of the greatest horror films of all time. But as I sat and watched, those hours raced by. Forgive me, but I had a ball. It's a night of dumb horror fun if nothing else. But the amount of character development is not too shabby either. Bill Hader kills it as adult Richie. Hilarious, and at times, heartfelt. Everyone else brings their all from McAvoy to Chastain. The scares are plentiful. Most of them land perfectly. Although, oddly enough, many are played for laughs. I found myself cackling at some of Pennywise's antics, whereas last time, he just creeped me out. That's a jarring difference for sure, but it almost harkens back to Tim Curry's classic performance, and that's something I can appreciate. If narratively speaking, this film follows the same beats as the first film, remember, that's because its the same book divided in two. It isn't supposed to break new ground. Are certain things about this film sloppy? Sure. Could it have used a trim? Maybe? But what we get in mistakes, we are overcompensated in thrills.<br/><br/>So in terms of the snark this film is facing, I just don't understand it. Count me out as a naysayer. My bottom line is fun. Scare me, thrill me, make me laugh and keep me invested the entire time. It: Chapter Two does that with little clown horns on it's feet. It kept me liking it for 169 minutes. How many films can do that?"

It's definitely slow and repetitive in the middle of the movie since all of the characters have the same stuff happen to them.

I didn't think the grown-up versions wouldn't even come close to the chemistry that their younger counterparts had, and I wasn't wrong. Despite having a brilliant cast as the older versions, they just didn't have that same spark. Now this can be because they haven't seen each other in 27 years, most of them are estranged, and are living very different lives. Of course they wouldn't be the same as they were as children, but I felt this dragged it down a little. But despite this, every actor played their role perfectly, with the highlights being Bill Hader as Richie Tozier and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak. These two were flawless as the older versions of their characters. The other actors, were also very good, but you would expect the likes of James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain to give great performances. And like the previous movie, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd nails it as Pennywise. You can tell he inherited his family's trend of playing psychotic characters, because he is so good here, he is almost too good. The character of Henry Bowers was pointless, and added nothing to the film, he could have just been cut out completely.<br/><br/>The movie has tons of pros and cons, with ""some"" of the direction, cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting being the main highlights of the film. It is a stunning looking movie, from the lighting to the camera angles. But there are also tons of bad things about the movie, that stopped it from becoming better.<br/><br/>One thing is that, it over uses CGI. While in some scenes, they clearly used practical effects, and make-up, because some of the creature designs are remarkable, its just a shame that some of the scenes that could have been terrifying, were filled with unnecessary CGI, especially at the end. Another problem I had with the movie, is its pacing. The movie seems to cut and dash between scenes, despite the movie being ridiculously long, like seriously, this movie is almost as long as Avengers: Endgame, that isn't normal for a horror film. The film drags in places, yet, I cant think of what scenes they could have cut out, because the scenes shown, were needed, but at the same time, while I was watching, I felt like they had cut tons of the film out. Some scenes were too quick, and felt rushed.<br/><br/>But my biggest complaint was that it tried to put TOO much comedy in there. The first chapter was funny at times, but the comedy was well done, here there are some terrifying and thrilling scenes, and they are bogged down with quick one-liners. It ruined those scenes. Why the director did this is a mystery.<br/><br/>IT Chapter 2 is a good film, it has some great moments, but also some bad ones. The scenes with the younger versions were the best scenes, and some of the creepy eerie moments, where Pennywise was tormenting children, were all perfect. But the film suffers from the typical shove CGI here, shove CGI there, and it really brings it down, as well as the pacing. But despite that, I still enjoyed it.<br/><br/>7.6/10"
"FlickChick82","8","4","7","7 September 2019"," It maybe ends
","I applaud direction, musical score throughout the film, while a screenplay could have been better. There is much inserted from a novel, but something regarding Pennywise is left unexplored, which perhaps is deliberately done, so that chapter three might happen. Actors who play grown-ups give amazing performances, especially James McAvoy and Bill Hader. They managed to show and make us believe in their connection starting from teen years onward. I loved cameo from Stephen King, who provided a very funny line with pun intended. I would recommend watching It 2 in theaters rather than at home."

I really enjoyed the first one 2 years ago but when you fall asleep watching this like i did a few times that's pretty bad. Definitely had some good moments but it was more funny than scary and the cgi was hilarious and not scary at all. I think going forward when making a movie like this they should stick to only showing the clown in certain situations and make it as scary as possible. I feel like they showed him to early and often and made it more hilarious then funny. We need more 80's type horror movies and less cgi. Overall it was just ok. I think younger people will like it but us older 80s babies deserve better."
"BA_Harrison","8","4","7","6 September 2019"," The killer clown from outer-space is back.
","The otherworldly creature that terrorises the Maine town of Derry every twenty-seven years is back, reuniting the now grown-up members of the Loser's Club, who swore to try and defeat the evil once and for all should it return.<br/><br/>Chapter two of IT is, unsurprisingly, very similar to part one: effectively creepy, occasionally gory, and slickly directed, with excellent performances from both the young actors from the first film (who appear in flashbacks) and their adult counterparts. Also putting in another superb turn is Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, who returns as the monster's quasi-human form, scary clown Pennywise: he's just the right mixture of unsettling and humorous. Hell, even Stephen King delivers a decent cameo as the owner of an antiques shop (the mega-wealthy author making a funny about writers being rich).<br/><br/>Despite numerous attempts by director Andy Muschietti, I can honestly say I didn't jump once (I've seen more than enough horror movies to not fall for the obvious scare tactics), but I was suitably impressed by the inventive designs of IT's many forms, from the creepy old naked lady to the disembodied spider-head (a nice homage to John Carpenter's The Thing) to the final massive monster. Besides, the lack of genuine frights is more than made up for by the comedy, which was great throughout, with Bill Hader as Richie being particularly amusing, the best scene involving three doors and a very cute dog.<br/><br/>At 169 minutes, I can imagine that the film will be a touch on the long side for many, but I found that it whipped by with nary a dull moment and kept me entertained throughout, which is more than I can say for some of the much shorter, more recent and more lauded horror movies of the past couple of years (Us and Halloween, to name but two)."

The movie deviates from the Borrow's thread. I also missed Barbs husband and Bill's wife as more prominent characters. The ending was different, and the writers poke fun at it too during the film.

I read many reviews before going to the theater, and most judged the movie too harshly. Yes there are a lot of ""jump out"" scenes, and some misplaced humor...but that's what you want in a horror film. It was a little long, but needed to be to tell the whole story. Definitely a good ending to a great adaptation."
"pazu7","7","4","7","6 September 2019"," I really liked it. I could have loved it.
","(SPOILERS) It chapter 2 is a sort of glorious mess of best intentions. But I think its weaknesses can be attributed to one simple thing: the success of Chapter 1. The kids in the first film had a natural, unforced charmed. We all knew them, they reminded us of ourselves, our friends, the brats next door. But the adults in this film are not really given time to establish themselves in our hearts, we only see them as adult versions of the kids. It's not that way in the novel. The adult/children version are separate but equally defined. This second film also seems to constantly be trying to replicate the tone and innocent vulgarity of the first film. But it's not the first film , and shouldn't have tried to be. Chapter 1 tells a very simple story, kids form friendship and fight shape-shifting demon from another dimension. We meet the kids, see their first encounters with IT, explore the insecurities they have to overcome, then on to the show down. Even at its foundation, Chapter 2 is a much more complicated tale. Old friends, who have forgotten shape-shifting demon, get called back to fight it, must renew old bonds, be reminded of what IT is, revisit encounters in several flashbacks, be introduced to ancient ritual etc etc... All that to say it could never have been a continuation of Chapter 1. It was essentially a different film. But in trying to match the pacing and tone of the first they cheated the adult cast, and imo, the audience, of a more adult film. ... A dead giveaway to the insecurity of this film is the non-stop score. Whenever filmmakers are unsure of a scenes ability to carry impact, they blast the score. From the moment the adult Losers enter the Niebolt house, the music keeps trying to force the atmosphere. This actually deadens the dynamics of those sections and ruins the scares because the best scares are born in silence. There are so many scenes when they could have just let silence carry the tension and let the play say the thing. Also, and I know people will disagree, there was too much Pennywise in the conclusion. I get why they did that, with the clown spider thing, but as a fan of the novel, I was just hoping to see something more surreal and incomprehensible. Something horrible. Overall it was OK. I enjoyed IT chapter 2. But I could have loved it if it had not been constantly begging to be loved. Knowing this was cut down from 4 hours, provides me hope that the expanded version be able to take it's time and let the adults Losers establish themselves."
"henry8-3","5","4","7","6 September 2019"," It Chapter Teo
","27 years later, the kids from 'It' have grown up. Mike, the only member of The Losers who stayed in Derry invokes their oath to return to Derry if Pennywise the Clown returns - which of course he does.<br/><br/>This is a film whose total does not equal the sum of its parts. The adult characters spend a vast chunk of running time coming back together, deciding whether they should stay and then revisiting what Pennywise did to them. This is well structured but is just too long, although to be fair so was the book.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty solid, particularly Hader, whilst Chastain rather disappoints as she fails to bring the Beverley from the first film to life. Lots of spectacular horror scenes and Scarsgard still menacing as the clown, doesn't compensate for a disappointing and overlong sequel."
"whatever1620","6","4","7","6 September 2019"," I prefer the Tim Curry version from the 90's
","It was solid with a strong first half, but the CGI at times took me out of it (wonky choices, unintentionally funny). Although, there were some stand-out stylistic choices with a real mark for creating its own world. Overall it's about what was expected by staying faithful to the tone of the first film. The horror stems more from the themes than any suspenseful tension. The chemistry of the cast was a bit off too, almost as though during production something went awry, or maybe it was simply weak points in the script. The ""romance"" between Ben and Beverly, totally flat. The dialogue among them was just rehash of the poem and a forced connection. Jessica Chastain I felt was one of the weakest characters. Her performance came off as kinda just being there and at no point did I truly buy she was her younger self from the first film. That's not to say she completely bombed, but it is what it is. Can't say there's much replay value but yea... 5 - 6.5/10 depending (there might be a director's cut though, first cut was 4 hours long reportedly)."

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","5","4","7","6 September 2019"," IT is a mess :(
","Boy is IT Chapter 2 messy. I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't thrilled with this movie. It's far too long. It's almost 3 hours, and it feels longer. The pacing is brutal in the first half, and by the time you get to the third act, you just feel too exhausted to feel completely invested. Where the first movie worked for me as it's own self contained movie, Chapter 2 is definitely a companion piece that expects you to watch it immediately after the last movie. Which makes sense as they made it clear that Chapter 1 was just taking the kids portion of the book, and then Chapter 2 would be about them grown up. I will say this movie delivered on good casting of the adult counterparts, because everyone genuinely does a good job. Bill Hader is easily the best part of the film, he had some of the funniest gags I've seen this year. However that leads me to my next issue, it's way too comedic. For being a horror film, its not scary. The humor overtakes any tension it wants me to feel when it's dropped right in the middle of a scare. The first one did this too, but I didn't feel it was as obnoxious as this. Especially when most of your scares are pop outs and loud noises. There were scenes I just tuned out because the tone was so all over the place that, I just didn't know what to feel. A guy in our theatre fell asleep and was snoring so loud, we all just laughed because... yeah, it was kinda boring at times! All my problems pretty much trace back to the book and why it's damn near impossible to adapt and make great. It's a mess of a book. While Bill Skarsgard is chilling to watch as Pennywise, and the coming of age story works well in places, it just all doesn't flow well together here as it did last time. I will commend both movies for trying to mainstream the material, and for REALLY trying. Both films have engaging performances, and some really nice cinematography, but I just don't feel as eager to watch Ch 2 as much on repeat viewings. The ending was the equivalent of Lord of the Rings where it takes that much time and investment out of you, to the point where the ending overstays it's welcome. It Ch 2 isn't the worst movie I've seen this year, but it was disappointing. 5/10"
"jakeandelwood","6","4","7","6 September 2019"," Not bad but... nobody mentions the horroble horrible ending?
","Actually the film is not bad at all. Some typical horror moments, good casting and acting. But the movie is a tat long. Still for most part it does justice to Stephen King's novel. And that's an accomplishment on its own.
I don't mind when movies are changing parts of a book. And sometimes it works better for a movie to adjust the storyline. Same goes with this movie. But what really really bothers me is the ending. Don't worry, no spoilers, but this is the dumbest ending I've seen in a decade. It's so simplistic and unconvincing, it's almost the ending of a child's movie. My wife called it 'Typical Hollywood dumbness' and it's a shame as It deserved better.
Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd actually did a better job as Pennywise than in the first movie and some scenes are certainly gruweling. But it never becomes scarrier, or more visual stunning than any of the other Hollywood horror movies of this century. Making it just an average movie. That said, with a better ending it would have received one more star in my personal rating.<br/><br/>In the end it's not a movie you MUST see, but I am sure you won't be (too much) disappointed when it's done."

","Hiya Georgie<br/><br/>It Chapter 2 is the thrilling conclusion to Stephen King's classic clown novel which finds the losers club needing to go back to Derry after 27 years cause they did not kill Pennywise like they thought they did.<br/><br/>And first off let's just say that Pennywise has been a terrific villain through all this. Yes, clowns remind us all of serial killers anyway, there's not much Krusty can do about that, but if you also get one who knows your fears there really is no stoppage to the torments one could inflict.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgard has really dug in here, he's having fun, and i'm loving how over the top he allows the voice and mannerisms to get.<br/><br/>The losers club comes back, this time as adults, in fine form.<br/><br/>Sure guys like James McAvoy, who carries Bill's guilt over the loss of his brother Georgie perfectly, and Bill Hader, whose the wise-ass Richie of the group, stand out but everyone here is allowed their moment.<br/><br/>And there are a lot of moments here. This is a lot of movie. Sometimes it's going for horror, sometimes it's comic, sometimes it's a coming of age drama, and in the case of the friend-zoned Ben and the only girl of the group, Beverly, there's a rootable romance here too.<br/><br/>One of the criticisms that has been labeled against this is that it's not a scare on top of scare style movie but I think that's cause this movie is smarter and way more ambitious than that.<br/><br/>This is a follow-up to the highest grossing horror flick of all time-why not going huge with it?<br/><br/>The losers club themselves are still a great bunch of guys and lady and it'a a huge laugh seeing them pick up right where they left off- ribbing each other, bringing up old memories, regretting the fact that as life often goes, we do lose contact with even close friends.<br/><br/>You also never see anyone of them with a cup of coffee- they're so high strung just by living in Derry that even tossing a red bull in the middle of them might result in explosion.<br/><br/>Director Andy Muschietti throws in even more creatures this time around- heads walking on spiders legs, decomposing bodies, statues, things just come alive with big booming voices.<br/><br/>Muscietti worked pretty well with these overgrown, gangly looking monsters in his first horror flick, Mama, but he has vastly improved the facial distortions, the creatures entrances, nearly every jump scare is part of a grander scene that just looks like nightmare fuel.<br/><br/>Like that scene with the old lady from the trailer is 10 times more creepy in this movie and is just a masterclass of suspense.<br/><br/>Yes at nearly 3 hours all of this can feel relentless but he moves these horrifying creatures around like a chessmaster and my heart pumped and my jaw dropped and that's no small feat.<br/><br/>I was also someaht worried about the ending here- mostly cause part 2 of the miniseries ends with kind of dud oh, they look like they're fighting something from Honey I Shrunk the Kids.<br/><br/>But Muscietti proves to completely understand psychological torment by movie's end and continuing to incorporate that in the final showdown is a smart move.<br/><br/>Story-wise this also does a hell of a lot- adding in a Native American subplot, telekinesis, tokens, and some really brutal acts of homophobia and spousal abuse that ties in later with a message about bullying.<br/><br/>I'm out of breath just trying to explain all this movie tries to do, so while it's not always scary and is definitely long winded,<br/><br/>It wants to be a lot of things, most surprising of all is it makes you want to call up a close friend you haven't spoken to in a while..if you have one. That shows this isn't just about the scares but about the characters too. On both counts I was more than satisfied.<br/><br/>If you liked this check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more"

Chapter 2 has far too much comedy thrown in, for what's meant to be a scary movie. The cinema audience were laughing out loud and unfortunately some of those laughs were at the parts that were meant to be scary.
I didn't jump once, like I did with the first one and I felt Pennywise as the clown could have been in it more than he was.<br/><br/>In my opinion Chapter 1 was better than the original and Chapter 2 is definitely not. The next time I want to watch It, l'll watch the original mini series."

Which is a shame, because a good comedy would've actually been watchable.<br/><br/>The characters are a combination of cheap stereotypes, half baked psychological ideas and downright weirdness. Every character that isn't a main character feels not even slightly fleshed out, more like a marrionette being lurched around by the writers for some uninspired plot device role.<br/><br/>I can see why some people like this film, it brings up a lot of psychological issues that always get attention in today's world. In the real world people who bring up these issues gain popularity, regardless of whether they present their ideas intelligently or even understand anything about the actual issues they're discussing, and obviously the film industry has learned.

","The two aspects of this movie that do the most damage to it is the writers strange and nonsensical choices and the over-use of cringey cgi.<br/><br/>The story was already written for them. Sure some things could be changed to the adaptation into a movie, but the changing of key events and motives really showed a lack of interest in the source material. In my opinion after seeing It 2, the writers had no reverence to what made the book so effective. This story tarnishes the evil created in the novel and, even as a seperate story, fails to create anything close to enjoyable for the audience.<br/><br/>While that alone made me want to walk out time and time again, nothing bothered me more consistently than the constant, bad cgi. The creators think a goofy monster running and shaking its head is horror, and man are they wrong. The movie is ugly and devoid of any real suspense because of their insistence on showing instead of telling<br/><br/>I gave this a 2 because of a few good jokes, a single decent scene with Pennywise underneath some bleachers (before he becomes a cgi mouth), and my own silly want for this movie to be better than the 1 that I think it really does deserve.<br/><br/>I have to be honest, this movie made me angry. It tore apart my favorite story and my favorite characters, turning them into something that was just too hard to look at. I hated It 2. I would tell the director that. I would tell Steven King that.

"ardnael","2","5","10","14 September 2019"," Probably the worst ""horror"" movie I've ever seen
","I really enjoyed the first one - not an avid Steven King reader but this is a classic. First off, Pennywise feeds odd fears. Apparently it was stuck in clown mode because everyone kept getting the same version of pennywise and it didn't adapt to each person's fears like they do in everything else It related. The adults look nothing like the kids. I mean seriously they weren't even trying. There's a music scene in there that gave me Deadpool flashbacks that actually was an editing accident but they were too rushed to fix it. There were so many stupid jokes that it outnumbered their very poorly executed jump scares 10-1. The movie was so predictable that I could say what was going to happen right before it did. Why and how did a child go missing in a fun house for that long - getting trapped inside a glass box in a mirror maze - and no one noticed he was gone?? How are these guys not in prison they literally left a trail of bodies, including one of them putting a pickaxes in someone's head, then puking, and then fled the scene. They left a guy buried in the bottom of a well?? And fled the scene were a kid was murdered?? And then went home. Yeaaahh no. And since when is pennywise a frikkin alien?? Why did the tub they burned everything in not burn up? I mean seriously leather or wood the thing is gonna go up. And did this girl just walk into someone's house, go into the bathroom and just start ripping baseboards out? Not even quietly. And then left it. Why did the kids have completely different personalities than they did in the first? And why did they start off talking about the part they don't remember AFTER pennywise but suddenly we are having flash backs before then and it has nothing to do with their conversation?
Okay so this guy slit his wrists because the memories hit him and he went mad. It's the reason they all stayed, because if not they would all end up dead the same way...but yet later they read some letter saying he did it because he wasn't strong enough to go back and knew they would fail if he was alive and didn't go. But wait doesn't everyone have amnesia about that summer? Which one is it?
Omg I could keep going. The only saving grace is pennywise had a fantastic performance, but it was incredibly overwhelmingly stupid. They tried to cover how stupid the movie is with generic one like comedy. Which completely suffocates the horror movie feel.
I can't believe they released this garbage. I can't believe they tried to pass those adult actors off as grown up versions of the kids. I can't believe they spent half that movie in conversation that contradicts itself consistently. ""We have to stick together or we fail"" ""everyone split up and find their artifact"" ""I can't wait there's no time"" (while everyone is right there in the house). Or how about at some point it turned into evil dead and a zombie was driving a psychopath around on a murder spree against the main characters with absolutely no explanation as to why.
Just horrible. If you're reading this and haven't seen it, don't waste your money. I'm sure it will be streaming soon enough it's just a pile of poop. Even my 11 year old hated it. He said the theater smelled because the movie was so much poop you could smell it. It was that bad.
Only reason it's not a 1 is for the inside joke about Steven King not being able to write a good ending. Even tho they beat that one into the ground too."

Possibly one of the best contemporary horror movies ever and as someone who almost exclusively watches only scary movies i've had a lot to compare against. There were some derivative scenes (think M Night Shyamalam-The Visit and John Carpenter-The Thing) but they were essential to the creepiness factor. In no way did it detract from the quality.

"msunando","6","5","10","6 September 2019"," Pennywise's terror overshadowed by blood and gore
","IT Chapter 2 - The seven survivors from Pennywise's 1989 mayhem have partly forgotten their ordeal and lead their own lives. Only Mike continues to live in Derry and remembers everything. 27 years thence, Mike calls up the other six to return to Derry as they promised in their childhood, as Pennywise has now made his appearance again and struck devastation.<br/><br/>He is terrifying to start with and every encounter of his appearance is startling. Bill Skarsgard continues his impressive and flawless delivery of the role of the tormentor posing greater danger and infusing uninhibited fear among his challengers this time. It's a fight to the finish as the protagonists deal with their individual fears, recounting the childhood events and promise to stick together to banish Pennywise for good.<br/><br/>This is the final installment of Stephen King's novel, thus holding out an unprecedented frenzy and expectation. Chapter 2 unfortunately turns into a repetitive storytelling by replaying scenes from the first part and showcasing Pennywise's encounters with each of his challengers in a quirky way. Its elicits some shrieks and squeals for sure, but enhances its dalliance with an unnecessary overdose of blood and gore. The climax is too long to endure actually, undermining the thrill and fear elements. With a running time of 170 minutes, IT Chapter 2 does get a bit monotonous, stretching our patience. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are impressive, but no match to play foil to Skarsgard's Pennywise menace. Watch it you must if you are a fan of the horror genre, or Stephen King or if you've experienced the first part."

But the IT movies are not just about cheap jumpscares and its actually about growing up and losing your memories. Some things i find a bit meh like Ritchie's secret i feel that might anger some people.

I don't think so. And if it was? I still regard it as unnecessary!<br/><br/>Then, there was the constant F-bombing. Is Hollywood employing more script-writers with Taurette's Syndrome? Or were the writers of this particular screenplay just trying to hide the fact that half this movie was so boring, a lot of movie-goers where I went to see this (myself included) were literally starting to fall asleep!<br/><br/>All I know for sure is, if I ran a restaurant where six customers were swearing that frequently and loudly, I would have told them to either shut up and get out, or I'd call the cops.

"TheLittleSongbird","7","3","5","5 December 2019"," Doesn't float quite as brilliantly
","Stephen King's novel is a masterpiece, didn't properly appreciate it on first read but with King's style being much more familiar to me (whereas it was a bit of a shock at first) it still stands as a genuinely scary, nostalgic, at times very funny and very powerful book and one of his best. The 1990 mini-series is an uneven one, with a great first half and disappointing second half with the ending and IT's true form having notoriously poor reputations for good reasons. Absolutely loved the first 'IT' film from 2017 and consider it better than the mini-series personally.<br/><br/>'IT Chapter 2?' Not so much. Actually did find a lot to like about it, with a lot of what was great about the first film still here, and for me it is better than has been said. The mixed reception is more than understandable but it is not as terrible as the more negative reviews say in my view. Chapter 1 is the better film, but the second film is better than the second half of the mini-series on the whole and again it is a more than admirable and brave attempt at adapting an extremely difficult and near-unfilmable book.<br/><br/>While there is a good deal to recommend, there are some glaring problems. There are problems with the pacing here. Especially in the middle act, where it meanders due to being too flashback heavy. Some flashbacks being more interesting than others, with Ben's and Richie's being quite unnerving, Eddie's (the too long adult encounter not much better) was neither scary or memorable. The special effects are more variable this time round and suffer too from overuse. IT's true form comes off worst and is as bad, am not kidding here, as that in the mini-series which is notoriously universally panned.<br/><br/>The defeat of IT is beyond dumb and really undermines a final act that actually started off quite powerfully despite also being a bit too drawn out. Henry Bowers is also extremely underwritten, and both has little presence when having barely any screen time and quite badly overacted. Lets not get started on his very rushed, too easy and quite stupid defeat.<br/><br/>However, as was said before there is a lot to like. The production values mostly are terrific, not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting, taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. Epileptics be warned though, there is a scene towards the end of the middle act that is heavy in strobe lighting effects. The music is haunting without being over-scored, ever since the first film it has been impossible to hear ""Oranges and Lemons"" in the same way again and that opinion has not changed. Andy Muschietti directs with suspense, potent realism, confidence and affection, while the writing (which is also remarkably true to King's style) has a great balance of hilarious comedy, touching drama and affectionate nostalgia. Richie getting the best lines.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the film being too long, am mixed on this consensus personally. The book is huge and both the child and adult time-lines need a quite long length to do it justice, having said that the middle act definitely could have done with a trim. The story is not just a horror story, but also blends humour (mostly from Ritchie), emotion and a 'Stand By Like' like nostalgia. There are memorable moments here, the Mrs Kersh encounter, the Fortune Cookie scene and the very freaky beginning (am amazed they managed to film this scene) being standouts. There is one improvement here over the previous film, Mike is much more interesting here which was necessary as this time as an adult he is something as the glue of the group.<br/><br/>Cannot fault the performances. All the adults are very well cast, with Bill Hader absolutely killing it as Richie, and the children are great again especially Finn Woolfhard and Sophia Lillis (the standouts in the first too). Bill Skarsgaard is again the stuff of nightmares as Pennywise, filling giant clown shoes with aplomb and putting his own spin on it. If asked who is better between Skarsgaard and the unforgettable Tim Curry, mainly because of more familiarity Curry gets the edge but they are both must sees in their own way.<br/><br/>Summarising, not brilliant and uneven but enjoyed it on the most part. 7/10"
"almanac-39178","2","3","5","23 November 2019"," I've seen episodes of Sesame Street that are scarier
","The start of this film is okay, but it descends into farce. It becomes such a CGI-ed, laughable mess I had to switch it off before the end.<br/><br/>The best thing about it is Stephen King playing the role of a shopkeeper opposite James McAvoy. It's more than a cameo; the role is quite lengthy for a non-actor. Sadly, it serves as a reminder of how King's novel is much more bearable than this turkey of a movie.<br/><br/>IT ends? Thank God for that."
"cjamesdueck","1","3","5","18 November 2019"," Complete Failure
","First of all, I've read the novel and liked it a lot- not one of my favorites (not even my favorite King novel) but I really enjoyed it. So when the first It (chapter 1, i guess) came out I was fairly pleased at how it was structured and executed. While I thought it could have been much better, and it relied a little heavily on the jump scares and had some cheesy effects, I liked this version of Pennywise and felt that, above all, the TONE was right. Well after seeing part 2 my low expectations have been confirmed and surpassed.<br/><br/>My guess is that Cary Joji Fukanaga's involvement was crucial to the success of the first film. Much like with True Detective's decline between seasons 1+2, Fukanaga proved to be the one who really gave the show it's brilliance. Here, with It Chapter 2, Fukanaga is gone and this loser Gary Dauberman (eye roll) has taken on the writing duties alone- as in no supervision! He sucks, just look at his credits. Muchietti is terrible too obviously, because how could he misfire this bad with such a big project! All he had to do was stick to the blueprint laid out by the first film. Instead, Dauberman and Muchietti make this a bad comedy based on some idiot adults we don't know or care about. Nothing against Hader and Ransome, but they were used horribly in this. There are so many failed attempts at humor, the pacing is ALL WRONG."

","After seeing It chapter one I was already dissapointed, but chapter two was really terrible. All the separate components are amazing, but as a whole? Not so much. Yes, the casting is amazing, costumes and make up departments did great, the direction an sich is great too. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise does a fantastic job, but the movie never gets scary, at all.
Some things I don't get at all. What does the old woman dancing naked in the background add? I think it was supposed to be a creepy scene, but this just made it funny. Same with Richies jokes. Yes, Bill Hader has incredible talent, but here it just ruined the movie for me.
When I go to a horror movie I want to be scared, to get this uncomfortable feeling, like you do get when watching the Shining for example, or the Haunting of Hill house, wich also mastered this. And let's not forget about Alfred Hitchcock.
It chapter two didn't just lach in horror elements it also took too long. At some point I was just trying to look at my watch in the theater to check how much longer I needed to endure this movie. A lot of scenes just dragged on and took way too long, Bill reaching for Georgie in the sewer e.g. That just took way too long, we all know what's going to happen, so just let it!<br/><br/>Overall, I had a good laugh during some of the movie, but it took too long and for a horror movie it just wasn't scary at all."

"sheik_aboudi","5","3","5","13 September 2019"," Meh is the best descriptor
","It failed to capture the most effective part of the first movie: the chemistry of the ensemble. A large portion of that may be due to the film spending a large amount of its time keeping the characters separated, for no real reason other than them choosing to not be together. I suppose it also wanted to show each individual character's torment, but it is certainly possible to do that while also having them interacting (and growing) with the others.<br/><br/>Another downside is that during these individual (drawn out) moments, there's a heavy focus on revisiting the character's past, which attempts to flesh out each one more, but is more of just rehashing what we learnt in the first film. Ultimately the effect is sacrificing the development of the characters, which never really happens except for a couple throw away moments in the epilogue section, in favor of giving a drop more depth to what has already been established about the character.<br/><br/>When the cast finally comes together as a full ensemble in the last third of the movie, it still feels more like individual performances happening simultaneously, rather than a group naturally interacting. However, the film is still too afraid to have them stick together for too long. This is mostly to tie up the loose ends of various character relationships, though is fails to really make the most of those moments and use them to their fullest advantage, both from a character arc perspective, but also from a build suspense/horror perspective. Instead, it is more interested in spectacle. I do have to admit that the CGI does look incredible."

","It Chapter Two: Derry, Maine is a nasty place even leaving aside IT, we're reminded of that by a vicious homophobic attack in which the victim is thrown in the river. IT then emerges, after 27 years, to claim the unfortunate as his own. The Losers return to Derry but have to overcome their amnesia. IT can be destroyed but it requires a Ritual, each must go through a trance/ordeal to recover artefacts for the Ritual to work. Horror ensues for each individual member.<br/><br/>Mike had stayed in Derry and went through ceremonies with an American Indian Tribe, using hallucinogens he had a vision of IT arriving on Earth from the stars. This is reinforced by the Giger like structures underground implying that IT is an alien entity, making this Scff-Horror rather than Fantasy-Horror. Great flashbacks, especially of Henry Bowers being literally vomited out of a pipe along with corpses. In present day Derry, Henry is sprung from a Psychiatric Prison Hospital by one of his (now) undead gang. Great to have a Zombie driver!

","63% on Rotten Tomatoes? What movie did those critics see? It: Chapter 2 is a genuine delight. Sounds like an oxymoron, yes: A delightful horror film? But honestly, I really had fun with this one. I think Chapter 2 has a lot more levity than the first film, both thematically and comically, thanks to its downright creepy and hilarious imagery and Bill Hader and Bill Skarsgård's righteous performances. Yes, it's a long sit, but it went by fast because it was so off-the-walls. I can sympathize with Stephen King fans and horror die-hards for wanting something legitimately scary, and I agree that it could've used more authentic terror, but...the villain is a CLOWN. Yes, I wanted to be scared, but I also wanted to be amused, and holy smokes, it's enough of a wild ride for me to recommend on a whole other level.

"alice-galtrey","4","3","5","11 September 2019"," Disappointing
","I had such high hopes and went in wanting to love this so much, however I found myself disappointed at almost every turn. It seems to me like small things that worked fantastically in chapter 1 got milked dry in chapter 2. For example, random swears & jokes coming from Eddie & Richie, these were absolutely fantastic in chapter 1 and, although many are still funny in 2, they pale in comparison to 1. Also, the use of what I'll call 'surprise big tall grey monster running at you' that was so fantastic with the evil painting woman in chapter 1 seems like it's the only use for jump scares in chapter 2, everything is a big tall grey thing that runs at the characters with exaggerated foley on footfall that stops being scary the second time it's used, and it's used a lot.
The chemistry between the adult losers is far from bad, but with constant flashbacks showing the same characters with the younger cast the chemistry feels so clunky and forced in comparison. I found myself really not caring about any of the characters or what happened to them despite loving the kids in chapter 1.
Overuse of CGI for the monsters let's the film down also (SPOILERS) that Bev with her head on fire what on earth was that????? (END OF SPOILERS).
I certainly wouldn't call it a bad film, it had a lot to live up to and it didn't surpass my albeit high expectations."
"loshidragon","3","3","5","10 September 2019"," Sloppy Execution
","I loved Chapter 1, so I went into Chapter 2 with high hope. The beginning sequence felt forced and incredibly exaggerated, with no relation to anything else that happens in the film. Henry Bowers had a brief cameo, honestly I don't know why he was even kept in the sequel for the little involvement he had. Pivotal scenes, like Stanley's death, were rushed or poorly handled. And for being a film at 2 hours and 40 mins, I felt that they did too much and not enough at the same time. I loved the adult actors in this film, they matched the younger actors quite well, they had modern technology at their disposal and an immense book to diligently pull material from and it just fell short of mediocre. They could've made Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 and really emphasized on the horrors they experienced as a kids, and then amp up the horror as adults. Aside from the Lumberjack scene and Stanley spider head... I did not get a horror vibe - AT ALL. The whimsical music also took so much from the film, as if they were in a world full of delight and wonder; it made no sense. As a Rated R film, they really held back. The studio really blew this... it could've easily been the first billion dollar horror film."

I will say I was pretty scared the whole time. It was like going through a marginally scary haunted house. Pennywise was perfect as always. He has more time on screen in this movie and gets to show more bite than he did in the first chapter. This movie is bloody as hell, hilarious at times, and super fun. I recommend for those who liked and loved the first chapter. I hope to see it again if only I can find 3 hours to spare."

","It Chapter Two is a satisfying but slightly underwhelming sequel. It concluded the story in a satisfying way and was faithful to the book. The performances were all fantastic across the board namely Bill Hader, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and Bill Skarsgard. Surprisingly this film was much more of a comedy than a horror film, and I loved that personally, and the humor was definitely intentional, I was not laughing at it as some have said they did. This is unironically the funniest film I've seen so far this year. The humor always worked for me and was always funny and clever. I liked the script and the writing a lot from a dialogue perspective, if not from a plotting perspective. And I did find some meaning behind this film not being scary, but at the same time that's a problem with the film. The opening scene deeply unsettled me, but I don't think the film ever got to that point again in terms of horror. Plus that scene didn't end up affecting the story at all. There's a character in this film who served no purpose and could've been cut out entirely. I realize this character was in the book but an adaptation needs to know what works for the film and what needs to be cut out, and this character definitely did because he/she didn't impact the narrative at all. There's a lot of retread and flashbacks in this film, and while some are meaningful, some are pointless. The execution of the second act was poorly written and meandering, one specific set piece in the second act could've been removed entirely, plus the narrative in the second act is a bit shallow. The scenes don't flow together very well and don't connect at all, and there could've been a better way to execute these individual set pieces. The editing, visual effects, and de-aging technology were all bad. Lastly, the film's length, it did not need to be 2 hours and 49 minutes long, they could've easily shaved off 20 - 30 minutes and the film would've been better. Overall, not as good as the first, but still a enjoyable sequel."

The only thing that spoils it is over use of CGI scares which makes some scenes quite laughable. Very well cast, you actually care about the characters which makes the ending an emotional one, if your a big softy like me!
Highly recommend!"

","It was good, fans most likely will not be disappointed. If you love the first you'll probably like this. But of course it's not perfect the film has some Pacing issues ( especially towards the beginning) the cgi was bad at times, the de-aging was for the most part not great and the film can drag at times.
But does that ruin it? No, it does its job and it does its job well. It provides a scary, funny film with an emotional conclusion to these characters stories. Fans should see it."
"movieman6-413-929510","5","3","5","6 September 2019"," It Chapter Two is more lengthy and unclear than real scary.
","It Chapter Two is the sequel to the first It movie of 2017. This sequel is again directed by Andy Muschietti, who also directed the first part.<br/><br/>The film is set 27 years later after the first part. The members of the Losers Club are now
have grown up and have all gone their own way. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa) is the only member of the Losers Club who still lives in the town of Derry. When he learns that children are missing again, he decides to investigate. He learns that the evil clown Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) is back in Derry. He informs the rest of the club and asks them to come back to Derry.
If the Loser Club again
meets, Mike must convince the club to destroy Pennywise once and for all. Because many of the club Pennywise and his dark actions from their past would rather forget, they think they better leave Derry. Mike and the members who want to take on Pennywise must now convince the rest of them to fight their childhood traumas and thus protect Derry's children from Pennywise.<br/><br/>The film adaptation of the first part was a film that lasted about two hours and fifteen minutes. The playing time of this second part is almost three hours and you can unfortunately feel this time as a viewer. This is due to the lengthy pace of the film, which makes the film appear rather boring and unclear instead of scary or exciting. The lack of clarity is due to missed explanations about certain things. These things are better explained in the book and the mini series. If you are not familiar with one of these versions, you will be left with unanswered questions. For people who are more familiar with horror films, the scary moments in the film can also seem a little predictable.
In the first part, director Andy Muschietti also tried to respond more to the fears of children, but in the second part he tries to respond more to the fears of adults. Both films, for example, play into how fear can change in life as you get older.<br/><br/>In this film, they also used more effects to bring out the scary creatures in the film. They have made more use of this compared to the first film. Unfortunately, it can often be seen that these creatures have been placed in the film with CGI, which means that they do not always come across as realistic and therefore do not always work well to scare you as a viewer. Bill Skarsgård is also less common in this film than Pennywise. In the first film and also in the mini series, Pennywise was more the form that the It took form. Because this was then an actor in a costume, it seemed credible and scary for viewers.
They also asked the young cast of the first part to make new scenes for this second part. The actors have become older since 2017 and are physically changing. With effects, they have been able to rejuvenate the young cast so that they look the same as they did in 2017. You can see this in light scenes, which due to these effects some of the cast have a distinct glow around them, which can sometimes come over as being separate or distracted.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is the casting, because the older and younger versions of the same characters from both films look the same with their looks and personality. Just like the young cast, the old cast has a good chemistry with each other as a group of friends. Every actor comes across well in this second part. Just like Finn Wolfhard, Bill Hader comes out best in the film with his comic moments and remarks."

Why big budgeted horror movies tend to follow this route of adding a stupid character that throw jokes all the time and ruin the total atmosphere of the movie?

"dylandoza","5","11","30","4 September 2019"," Disappointing follow up
","It Chapter Two was a disappointing follow up that left me frustrated and honestly a little tired. The film opens strong with a first act that'll make you feel like you never left Derry at all. Which is a credit to AndrÃ©s Muschietti and his great camera work. Unfortunately after the first act the film just slips through the cracks deciding to emphasize comedy and characters instead of focusing on what in my opinion was the most intriguing part of the follow up, Pennywise's revenge. A lot of time is given to the losers club in an attempt to make you feel every bit of their journey. The problem with this is that you lose some run time that could've gone to horror sequences and more shocking moments.
Chapter one was so great because they blended everything perfectly. The scares were spot on and it was funny when it had to be. Don't go into chapter 2 expecting a horror movie, they couldn't go more than 10 minutes without making a joke and as previously mentioned so much time was given to the main cast that Pennywise is hardly in this movie at all. In the end you have a movie that was advertised incorrectly, you go in expecting the emotion and frights of the first movie and instead you get drama and constant gags."

","As a huge fan of the book admittedly it is impossible to have this film meet complete expectations but there were fundamental flaws particularly in Chapter Two which are systemic of the cynical way hollywood approaches horror in the last 20 years.<br/><br/>We basically had 2h 50mins of vignettes each with around 2 to 3 jump scares. Rinse/Repeat. Each vignette was formulaic and whilst clever from a technical effects standpoint, really stagnated the overblown narrative and offered nothing to character development.<br/><br/>Without going into spoilers there was also a complete waste of the Bowers character which really wasnt necessary or of any impact.<br/><br/>If Cary Fukunaga was allowed to make these films I believe he would have shown less of this formula and more character psychology particularly with his proven use of flashbacks from TD Season 1.<br/><br/>Anyhoo if Chapter 1 ""floated"" your boat you will probably enjoy this installment as well."

And 2nd, I think 2hr 49mins was an okay length for this movie but at some points in the movie, I did daze off because it was a little slow and you did not have any idea what was happening.

"pkneer","6","4","8","7 September 2019"," Good and Bad and Could Have Been Great
","First, I had such high hopes for this movie, so expectations were at the top. The Good - the acting was above average with Hader being the biggest surprise. The casting was absolutely perfect - each adult actor looked like the child actor and made that aspect more believable. Also the CGI was very good. The Not So Good was the feeling you watched a scene and wondered about its purpose. The takeaway was the movie could have been trimmed and cleaned up and cut down from its 3 HOUR length. The Bad - the length, as I found myself checking my watch, which is a killer for any film. And there were characters that basically served no purpose in the plot or it's direction. Why were Henry and his burned up buddy even in the film? Take his scenes out and you have a 2 hour movie that was a lot tighter.<br/><br/>I had a bad feeling very early on when it became apparent that the film was relying more on jump scares rather than creepy and eeriness that the book, the TV miniseries, and part 1 created. Some of the jump scares were very well done, but that was not the type of film I was expecting or hoping for.<br/><br/>If you did not have high expectations or expect a film similar to part 1, this is an excellent jump scare horror film - but personally it was not the kind of film I wanted to see."

Add to that heavy rotation on HBO and great home media sales and this saga has become Stephen King's Star Wars/Marvel/James Bond. In It 2, the Loser's club is all grown up and seeking revenge for the evil Clown, who will come in all shapes and sizes, culminating in an all out finale that shows the heroes winning over evil and saving the day.

","For most of the people out there who will watch it for the scares, there are plenty of them abound. The talked-about homophobic scene is quite good a starter. But what I found the most satisfying in the scares territory were The Ritual of Chud, and The Walking Tours of each of the Losers. Both are the longest among the scares, and the filmmakers did an amazing job of presenting them from book to big screen, albeit somewhat different. I personally thought they were hard to adapt. Like the Paul Bunyan scene but most especially the Ritual of Chud.<br/><br/>Apart from the scares, the movie will make people laugh out loud as well. Bill Hader and James Ransone are quite the comic relief. And the appearance of Stephen King is spot-on and funny too.<br/><br/>There are those who complain that the movie is overlong and not as scary as they expected it to be, but I can say that most people who read It and those who did not but appreciate the first movie as the package it was will be satisfied.<br/><br/>Because it's not just the scares that make us follow the story. It is the characters themselves. The coming of age. The nostalgia. The old times. The friends who come along and stay. The friends who come along but leave. The unconditional love. The promises whether honored or not. The power of belief. The guilt. The personal fears we want to overcome. The strength and weakness of memory. How most of the times the bad things we want to forget stick with us longer than the good things we want to remember. It evokes something powerful in us that makes us the humane people we are. We identify ourselves in each of the Losers. And that is one very good side It shared with us. It makes us remember. It makes us hope.<br/><br/>And the score by Benjamin Wallfisch made It all the more powerful and the well-cast characters they were.<br/><br/>It is not a perfect movie. There are scenes that don't work as intended. But those that do more than make up.<br/><br/>So bring on the Director's Cut.<br/><br/>Be true. Be brave. Stand."

"TuesdayThe17th","8","2","3","10 December 2019"," Second half to a visually epic and poignant horror remake
","""IT2"" is a quite good second half to an overall monumental two part film. When I was young I watched the original IT miniseries and it deeply moved me. It wasn't so much that it was scary, but rather that the story of friendship was so rich and that's what was at the core of the film. The final scene of them on their bikes used to make me shed a tear or two. ""IT Chapter 2"" closely imitates the depth of friendship and too has a very moving final couple scenes. This movie is not a horror/thriller but instead a horror/drama. Perhaps even swap the two around. This is definitely a high quality horror film. I watched it in 4K and I have to say the effects are better than most if not all other horror films. The first one also had this offering. Even though ""IT2"" isn't really scary, it IS shocking and there are plenty of nightmarish monsters. One scene in particular where Beverly goes to her old house to find her ""artifact"" is in my opinion the scariest sequence in the movie and it was done very well. You can really see Muschietti's trademark horror elements and directing style here as it faintly echoes aspects of his first feature film, ""Mama"". The acting was up and down. For example, Bill Hader did a great job acting while James McAvoy did not... I personally feel McAvoy was the wrong choice for the role. Also, I feel Jake Gyllenhaal would have been much better as adult Eddie than James Ransone. Aside from a couple minor editing flaws and moments of bad acting, the two new IT films as a whole is a really good movie and is a horror landmark."
"olovsimonsson","2","2","3","6 December 2019"," Too much of the wrong things...
","What the first movie got right was a balanced focus on IT and the lives and friendship of the children in the losers club as well as their relationships to each other. No such thing exists in the second chapter. Instead it seems to think that the audience will feel for the adults just because we felt for the kids, and that we should be satisfied with the relationships we got to follow in the first movie. Such is not the case. I'm not given any reason to care about the adults, so I don't.<br/><br/>So what's left? Chapter II starts out quite faithfully to the book, although very abbreviated, until they're all back in Derry. After that, almost nothing is left of King's book. With no relationships nurtured or rediscovered, it is just a painfully long series of jump scares and scenes that seem to compete for the title of most disturbing. However, due to bad animation and a lack of build-up, eventually the myriad of attempted scares cross the border into tedious silliness.<br/><br/>Halfway in, I was begging for it to end, and in the end I was nearly crying because simply did not believe that it ever would..."

","Whatever everyone says, It Chapter Two is a great movie in my opinion. The 1990 mini-series' true form of IT was stupid and boring. That's why, Bill in the movie was continuously targetted for writing bad movie endings as Stephen King himself admitted that 1990's ending was poor.
The best thing is to see too many fear factors. The Paul Bunyan Statue attacking was awesome. While Mrs. Kersh scene from 1990 is improved a lot and is the best scene for me among all It movies.

"zkonedog","3","2","3","3 November 2019"," Doesn't Get The Adults Right (Or The Ending In General)
","The first part of this ""It"" mini-franchise had something. It may not have been a perfect film by any means, but it did utilize a great cast of child actors and achieve a sort of cultural-zeitgeist ""Stranger Things""-esque appeal. When it comes time to bring in the adults and execute the ending of Stephen King's iconic story, however, ""Chapter Two"" fails miserably in a number of key areas.<br/><br/>For a basic overview, ""It Chapter Two"" sees the Loser's Club reunited in Derry 27 years after It was presumed dead. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), now the town librarian, has called them all back because the evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) has sprung upon Derry once again. So, Bill (James McAvoy), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Ben (Jay Ryan), and Beverly (Jessica Chastain) return to their childhood abode to try and finish It off this time around.<br/><br/>There are three major problems with this second part that make it a pretty abject failure...<br/><br/>First and foremost, director Andy Muschietti (and presumably writer Gary Dauberman) do not grasp why, as audience members, we should care about the adult Losers. It's easy to root for a group of young kids chumming around together and then trying to stop a ferocious evil. The reason we care about the adults, however, is because 27 years later they are each dealing with relatable ""adult problems"" (abuse, addiction, job failure, etc.). King expertly captures this in the novel, whereas this film pays it lip service (and even paltry lip service at that). Here, the only reason we are given to care about the Losers is that ""they were once kids"". It is very telling that the best parts of ""Chapter 2"" is when it flashes back to the ""kid scenes"".<br/><br/>Secondly, the scenes involving the adult Losers having their own ""voyage of discovery"" just don't make any sense. It was almost more of an excuse to create hideous CGI monsters than it served the plot whatsoever. For example, Bev's meeting with an old woman living in her apartment was legitimately creepy...until it turns into a giant hulking monster straight out of a fantasy piece. In these moments, the filmmakers seemed to forget that ""It's"" horror is as much psychological as visceral.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending is severely disappointing for fans (like myself) of the King novel. Not focusing on spouses robs the movie of the books' incredible coda, while the final battle with Pennywise/It is almost laughable. To even call it an adaptation of the book's ending is a stretch. While I realize that some of the narrative ""punch"" would always be taken away by splitting the story into the ""kid half"" and ""adult half"", even then this ending doesn't elicit even the slightest emotion or any sense of gravitas.<br/><br/>It seems like what may have happened over the course of these two movies is that the filmmakers were so focused on the mechanics of adapting King's brilliant (yet rather unwieldy) story that they sort of lost track of the ideas behind what made it all work in the first place. This wasn't on display nearly as much in the first part, as that installment was just so much fun, but in this one that failure is as plain as day. Putting the kids in the 80s was a great narrative choice, but other than that almost all the other changes are for the worst.<br/><br/>Perhaps the worst thing I can say about this big-budget production? If forced, I'd still have to call the 1990 TV miniseries ""It"" adaptation my favorite. While that production certainly had warts of its own, it much more accurately captured both the physical and psychological horror of King's original intent. Besides some great child acting performances, this two-film duo doesn't accomplish either of those things."

","I can't say that I understand everything about this movie, nor have I read the book, nor do I understand the prior It movies well. And of course there is always the problem of converting a (long) book into a movie; but this is a movie, and one is not required to read the book prior to seeing the movie. I just got lost in this movie. There were lots of roaming plots that did not seem to go anywhere and did not seem to tie together. The acting and casting was good. The humor was OK; perhaps a bit over-done for a horror movie, but OK. It is loaded with jump-scares and just things designed to look creepy or gross. The protagonists often engage with some creepy monster as if they are in a life-threatening situation, and then they just miraculously leave and everything is OK. E.g. when the female character (Beverly) encounters that old lady in her dad's apartment; the creature chases her around and then at the end Beverly just leaves the front door. So was this creature actually trying to hurt Beverly, or was this just some mind-game with no real threat to her? (And neither answer is satisfying.) And somewhat similarly toward the end a creepy old woman (perhaps the same woman?) comes up out of the water and attacks Beverly, but this creature is easily defeated; what's the point? Was this just a weak monster, or was this just a scare-tactic? The whole plot with Mike tricking them with that old indian thing was weird; did he think that would work, just because it would give them confidence? (Apparently so. And note that in order to do all of this he also drugged his friend with that root that caused hallucinations.) (And so all of this stuff about getting an old item to sacrifice was crap; e.g. the inhaler, shower cap. Wasn't this the sole reason the went to that old (dangerous) underground fort?) And then in the end, once that placebo-plan failed, they had no plan, until they decided to have Pennywise chase them into a small space to make him smaller to kill him. Then suddenly this plan morphed into sort of insulting the clown which made him smaller, and then they just ripped out his heart and mashed it up. So that's all it took to defeat him? And they come up with that plan in the caverns in 10 seconds and yet they could not think of that in the preceding days (weeks, years)? Unfortunately I really just wanted this movie to end around 2 hours, in any fashion. The ""Losers"" can win, or Pennywise can win, as long as the credits roll. Perhaps it all works better in the book. Just my two pennies worth."

Where the first film firmly had its feet on the ground and did an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere and sense of nostalgia of the book, the second chapter fumbles, awkwardly .<br/><br/>Its chief shortcomings is it incessant need to use flash backs to make its point. As if its only by referring back to the first chapter that it can make sense of what follows. It lacks cohesion too and a well defined sense of direction, moving around listlessly and disjointedly.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, after a wonderful first chapter film this follow up is a real disappointment.<br/><br/>5/10 from me."
"naskelared","4","2","3","9 October 2019"," Disappointing.
","Besides the cinematography and visual horror there was nothing interesting about the movie. Half the movie is flashbacks with several of them being scenes from the first movie. Every character went to relive some unseen memories of Pennywise from their childhood before they cut into present day to deliver even more scare scenes for each character... It's the most predictable and unbalanced movie i think i ever witnessed. Also the jump scares were way to predictable, they fool you once and something will pop up from the dark when the camera switches angle. And by using that method repeatedly it took away what they tried to achieve with Pennywise and the horror they did fairly well on during the first movie.<br/><br/>The actors did a decent job although none really stood out besides Beverly, and i would say that is in large parts because of her character in the first movie. The rest is pretty tame and there is little to no development for any of the characters.<br/><br/>Overall i was left bored through all of it. Way to long for my liking, especially for a movie with so little depth to story-line, felt like the premise was to kill the clown and had to put an hour and a half with fillers to be able to call it a movie. Will go down as one of the most forgettable movies this year for me but got to give it a four out of ten because of Pennywise the character and the visuals."

"andrewgiblin-88736","5","2","3","8 October 2019"," It's Dull...
","I wasn't too impressed with this one, unfortunately. It felt stretched out and could easily lose at least half-an-hour of its run time. The adult characters were nowhere near as well written or - surprisingly - portrayed as their junior equivalents and the CGI was often a wee bit shaky. I understand that there was meant to be a sort of twisted 'circus' quality about some of the monsters but even so some of them were rather unconvincing.<br/><br/>The first film wasn't particularly scary but there was a pervading sense of menace - that seemed to dissipate this time and the first hour or so began to drag. The chap a few seats down from me was snoring from pretty early on and I cannot really blame him.<br/><br/>The second half of the original TV mini-series was weaker than the first (as was the book, to be fair) but this second chapter of the new film failed to avoid the same fate.<br/><br/>A very big missed opportunity, but that goes for quite a few adaptations of Stephen King's deceptively hard to film work. He creates character and scenarios then describes them at length, somehow without overdoing it. It's a trick that some of the directors/writers of the cinematic/TV versions need to learn."

","I have not wanted to walk out of a movie so badly in a long time. For the first half I was waiting for the movie to get good, or scary. It never did either. For the second half I pretty much figured that it won't improve much and I was just bored out of my mind waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>Half the movie is about how they evolved and their personal fears and whatnot, you barely see Pennywise throughout the movie. You mostly see him at the end and somehow, even though he's humongous he manages to be outrun, he never follows them for a very long time, just a very dumb villain, he was not scary at all. He had a couple of great moments but they were way too few and far between.<br/><br/>The cast was actually pretty good, they did some great casting decision, the older version of the characters actually look like they are those kids grown up for the most part. A few of them I think were amazing choices and the acting was solid. the special effects looked great to the point where the CGI was close to perfection in my opinion, except for a few moments, but overall it didn't feel obvious and forced (except for the old woman part).<br/><br/>So a massive fain in my opinion, very bland, unexciting and plain boring. Ok to watch on your computer 10-15 minutes at a time, in the background while eating breakfast or something. Definitely not worth the money to go see it in a cinema."
"LolaPearl","10","2","3","16 September 2019"," Perfect Casting and Kudos to Bill Hader & Finn Wolfhard!
","Simply put, IT Chapter Two was beautiful and I loved it. I laughed. I jumped. I screamed. I cried. (Six times to be exact, but who's counting? I mean how can you not cry during a movie when little kids are dying?)<br/><br/>The film was so well cast. I can see every single one of the kid losers in the adult losers, whether it's a certain feature or mannerism, what have you, and I can tell that the adult actors took great care to watch the first film and study their younger counterparts in order to make the performances as successful as possible.<br/><br/>Bill Hader's performance as Richie was brilliant, hilarious, and moving, and he stole the whole movie. (I felt the same way about Finn Wolfhard in the first film.) James Ransone's Eddie was spot on; his timing was impeccable and I loved how often he incorporated lines that kid Eddie used in the first film. (I wonder how much of that was scripted or improv.) James McAvoy's performance as Bill was also very moving, as was Andy Bean's very short lived performance as Stan. EVERYONE WAS FANTASTIC, but those guys were definitely my personal favorites.<br/><br/>As a huge Finn Wolfhard (Young Richie) fan and supporter, I was very proud of his performance. It was nice to see Richie dealing with an intricate emotional issue while still being right in the middle of the action and also maintaining his fun banter with Eddie. (This was true of both young and adult Richie.) I was also really impressed with Wyatt Oleff (Young Stanley) and Jaeden Martell's (Young Bill) performances. They were involved in two scenes that definitely gave me some good jumps and screams, especially Wyatt. If you haven't seen it yet, you'll know when you do. He was BRILLIANT!<br/><br/>Andy Muschietti was as true to the book as he could possibly be, while also writing in some creative liberties. Some of the liberties incorporated aspects from the book that couldn't be told in full detail, and some were completely created by him. Richie's story-line was hard for me to accept just due to the simple fact that it was not in either the book or the original miniseries from 1990, and I really didn't get that vibe from the 2017 film either. However, I felt it was very beautifully portrayed, and I'm not ignorant enough not to realize that this is ANDY's movie, BASED on Stephen King's novel.<br/><br/>People are always quick to say, ""I liked the movie, but the book was better."" Films based on movies are just that; based on them. They are never the same. And I am a person who loves the movie if I loved the book. Always! IT Chapter Two was no different. I loved it from start to finish. Well done to everyone involved!"

The few scares and cast save it from being a bad film overall but the shortcomings make this an average end to what could have been an epic story. 5/10"

James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, James Ransone did good job but it was Bill Hader and Skarsgard who stole the show. The making of the film is also good with some very good shots.

When it was just the adults confronting their figurative demons and interacting with each other, I was entertained. That may also have something to do with the fact that horror just isn't my favourite genre. With that being said, Richie's token scene may have been my favourite in the film, and the expansion of his character was done quite nicely. Hats off to Andy Muschietti (sp?).

","Coming off from seeing It Chapter 1 I was pretty siked about Chapter 2. Chapter 1 wasn't that great but it still was a good solid movie. Where Chapter 1 failed was with the cheap jumpscares rather than having more psychological horror. Well It Chapter 2 was an overall disappointing finale. Granted it still had it moments like pennywise killing the gay person and killing the little girl that made me want a movie about pennywise just going around killing kids it still failed to keep me fully interested in this endgame of a story. It Chapter 2 wastes alot of time with the Henry Bowers story that could've been taken out completely as it served no purpose at all in the movie. I also felt this in the first one as he was very under utilized and could've had a bigger purpose in both films instead of an obstacle that goes away quickly. I was also not a fan of the middle portion of the film as it felt very predictable and not that entertaining. I really didn't understand why ""Angel of The Morning"" played while Eddie was getting vomited on as it felt like I was watching a Deadpool movie and not a horror psychological thriller. I did like the relationship between Richie and Eddie. Having them be insecure about their feelings for each other made Eddie's death more tragic and allowed you reevaluate how they acted toward each other. Overall I felt as if they saw that people liked the comedy in the first one so they doubled down on it in this one which was ok I just wish we had more scenes like the girl under the bleachers getting baited by pennywise. Stuff like that is creepy and more scary then some CGI clown shaking towards you. I believe they should've waited another year or two to put this out as the CGI was not the best and the script could've used some more work as well. Also cast was amazing of course. Good finale to It but I guess we'll wait another 27 years for a better remake."

So to the losers -well i loved all the adult cast totally believable as the grownup versions of the kids from part 1, I am glad the film included lots of flashbacks to the children mirroring the entire book which constantly switches back and forth, indeed some of my favourite parts were the seamless transitions, like in particular when adult Ben fell into the clubhouse and as he was dusting himself off the sound of someone coming down the stairs was heard, the camera panned to the stairs just in time to see a pair of feet come into frame at the top of the shot = Beverley--young Beverley, and then as the camera followed her down it panned back across to Ben -- young Ben! Ok not technically difficult to pull off but the effect was brilliant. There were several like that while in some it was simply switching the child/adult actor out of shot, the seamless switch between time periods was very effecting. Ok that's all the good stuff now time for some things I didn't like, the house on Neibolt street was one of the best set pieces in the book and one of the most scary this was neither (if you know the book you will understand). The ending didn't work as well for me as it should have, the final battle with IT where the losers physically pulled IT apart as IT shrunk, just wasn't convincing. Having said that the death of Eddie I did find very moving. As a big fan of the book I did miss Tom and Audra not being in Derry, the latter meaning the final scene of the book was omitted. One of things about the end that isn't in the book but which worked for me even as a diehard (and very pedantic) fan of the book were the letters from Stan that arrived after his death for his friends they were very touching. So overall it was a very enjoyable experience, sorry for the length of this post...... can't wait for the six hour version version!"

","Think about how hard getting down the well was in the first film then realise that this time they had no rope.
Not only do they magically teleport down the well into the side passage but later on they're running away through a cave and next second bursting out of the collapsing house.
How did they get back up that well?<br/><br/>I guess that they did ""all float"" in the end!<br/><br/>

","Perfect casting, and follows nicely after the first movie. Same creepy atmosphere as the first and the characters are just as charming. The long runtime I think is needed to show each character's side plot that unites them together. The ""true form"" and final resolution may not satisfy all viewers, but worked well enough for me. There's some comedy mixed in with the tension which some don't like. And for those complaining the first scene was unnecessary, it's from the book and marks the return of It."
"pantelisandreou98","8","2","3","12 September 2019"," IT is a great time despite some problems
","So.. here we have IT CHAPTER 2. I don't see this as a sequel but as a second part to the story. I'm gonna break it down to positives and negatives.<br/><br/>First the positives:
+ The cast is simply magnificent. I mean insanely great casting choices with Bill Hader being the MVP!
(Ranking the losers later)
+ Pennywise is once again so enjoyable to watch, even though he is slightly reduced here, the scenes he is in are very very effective.
+ Most of the forms IT takes are very fun to watch.
+ This one is more darker from the first one.
+ There are also some really funny moments.
+ The introduction to adult losers is so well made.
+ Through the film and mostly in the end there are many heartfelt and emotional moments.<br/><br/>Now to the negatives:<br/><br/><ul><li>This part also defers very much tonally, where the first one was very fast paced this one takes the time to develop and unfold. This can make this film feel very long (which it is - i mean it's almost 3 hours for god's sake) with some scenes during the second act being repetitive. They could have done better with some of the scenes there ( or remove some of them) to make the film a little shorter.</li><li>All that being said about the second act i also think that the team was apart for too long! The losers are meant to be together, that's where the movie was at it's best, they even acknowledge that at some point.</li><li>Talking about unnecessary scenes, most of the flashbacks serve nothing extra to the story but just being extra to the runtime. There were some flashbacks that were extended deleted scenes from the first movie. I think what could have been interesting was to show flashbacks of the time after they defeated IT for the first time, after the oath they made. By doing that right that could have brought some levity and originality to the story.</li><li>I know i praised the forms of IT before but some of the special effects were noticeably bad and with a higher budget that this movie has i think they could have done better.</li><li>One final point. There is a character with a subplot and i think you know who.. that just doesn't do anything in particular here, it's just for the sake of having that character in the movie because it was something major in the book.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall the movie is a great time and i think it would make a great double feature (the way it's supposed to be seen for me) on halloween nights to come! Just like every adaptation though it has it's faults.<br/><br/>7,5/10<br/><br/>Ranking adult losers from great to simply good:
* Richie (Bill Hader)
* Eddie (James Ransone)
* Beverly (Jessica Chastain)
* Bill ( James McAvoy)
* Ben (Jay Ryan)
* Mike (Isaiah Mustafa)
* Stanley (Andy Bean)"
"lumieretrain","8","2","3","11 September 2019"," It Chapter Two by Andy Muschietti
","The unexpected huge success of It Chapter One has surprised the audience, as it became a blockbuster with more than $700 million Box Office worldwide. The movie became one of the most important horror movies, as well as one of the most important movies which the filmmaker Andy Muschietti has ever directed. Thanks to It Chapter One, the actors who played the main characters, became important to get a career for their future. There were expectations to work on the second chapter of the movie, as the filmmakers went immediately back to work. Especially for how in the original novel It, the first part focuses on the Losers Club as children, by arriving at the second part which focuses on the main characters as adults. To see how the story would end, once the nightmare gets defeated. In 2019 came out It Chapter Two by Andy Muschietti with Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, Andy Bean and Bill Skarsgård. The movie's plot: 27 years after the event of the Chapter One, the Losers Club who have turned into adults must come back to Derry. As they all have promised to defeat It as Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård), who comes back to bring the nightmare again. The movie gets interesting by seeing how the main characters, would get back all of their memories after they have been away from the hometown. As they all have lost their childhood memories, which have been very important for all of them. The story balances the atmospheres between the horror and the drama, to be workable in the narration's rhythm from the beginning to the end. Especially on the moments where the main characters get back the memories, when they were all together as well as when they were separated in each roads. In the same way the story uses the dark fantasy elements, by making the movie spectacular and visceral to be unforgettable for the audience's eyes. The story uses jump scares in the most unexpected ways, by making some of the scariest scenes unforgettable. One of the most important elements of the movie like in the novel, is the dark side of the humans by showing how they can be cruel without necessary be controlled by It. By even describing how evil are the sociopath Henry Bowers and his gang, who would have no mercy with anybody especially with the Losers Club. Jessica Chastain was extraordinary as Beverly Marsh adult, who becomes a successful fashion designer and is married with the abusive Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrick). Once she gets the call from Mike Hanlon, she would slowly get back the memories about her complicated relationship with her abusive father Alvin Marsh (Stephen Bogaert). James McAvoy was excellent as Bill Denbrough adult, who becomes a successful horror novelist and writes a screenplay for a movie based on his book. He is married with Audra Phillips (Jess Weixler), a successful actress who plays a role for the movie based on Bill's book. Once Bill gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about the burden he has on his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott). Bill Hader did a well done job as Richie Tozier adult, who becomes a successful stand-up comedian. Once Richie gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about a secret he never said to anybody. Isaiah Mustafa was excellent as Mike Hanlon adult, who is the only one to have remained in Derry and he owns a library of the Town. Once Mike realizes It is back to bring the nightmare again, he immediately searches to call all the members of Losers Club. Mike would also show some discoveries he made, about the origins of It and how they can defeat Pennywise. Jay Ryan was excellent as Ben Hanscom adult, who becomes a fit and successful architect. Once Ben gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about the love he has on Beverly Marsh. James Ransone was extraordinary as Eddie Kaspbrak adult, who becomes a successful risk assessor and is married with Myra (Molly Atkinson) who resembles his over protective mother. Once Eddie gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would slowly get back the memories about what happened to his mother's fate. Andy Bean did a well done performance as Stanley Uris adult, who becomes a firm accountant and is married with the teacher Patty Blum (Martha Girvin). Once Stanley gets the call from Mike Hanlon, he would be the only one to not maintain the promise with an inevitable fate. There would be an explanation in the specific moment, the reason of his decision to not maintain the promise. Finally Bill Skarsgård was extraordinary as Pennywise, who this time would be much ferocious and vengeful. Especially by trying to kill with no mercy the Losers Club, as he would appear in the scariest forms in front of the main characters' eyes. The editing helps by maintaining the narration's rhythm workable with dramatic atmospheres, especially at the flashbacks where the main characters see themselves as children. As well as at the scariest scenes, where unexpected moments happen to be unforgettable. The camera catches important moments in every single angle shots, without letting the audience get distracted by anything. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch was elaborated, by describing the emotions of the main characters and the specific atmospheres with compatible musical notes. It Chapter Two is one of the best horror movies, with a surprising epic conclusion."
"ExoticLikeRanchDressing","4","2","3","11 September 2019"," Horror turned Sloppy Comedy
","Chapter 1 was an astounding piece of new age horror. It brought new thrills and chills and kept that creepy feeling throughout and had just the right touch of comic relief in all the right places. They got it wrong in Chapter 2. This was NOT a horror movie. They focused much too heavily on the humor and fell totally flat when it came to bringing the terror there should have been to light. Even some of the more gory, or what should have been shocking, scenes where made much too light of.<br/><br/>Get stabbed in the face by a psychopathic middle school bully?! Let's laugh about it and make light of it as if it's nothing!<br/><br/>Dying on the floor after getting spiked through the chest?! Yeah, let's joke about that too!<br/><br/>Literally nothing in this movie could be taken seriously and it kills the entire flow of what could have and should have been an amazing end to a brilliant start!<br/><br/>Another huge disappointment is the utter lack of creativity that went into this one. There were a few nice nods to the book that never showed in the original 1990 TV adaptation staring Tim Curry, but everything else was just something reused from the first installment. Nothing unique, new, or special.<br/><br/>Needless to say I went into this film excited to see something as wonderful as I found its predecessor, and left feeling exasperated and severely disappointed."

","High hopes coming into it but far out this was really bad. The first 30 mins was good but after the. Chinese restaurant scene it's all downhill from there. Low budget cringy CGI, very slow plot development that tiptoes back and forth between mundane situations and environments; really doesn't go anywhere until the last 15 mins of the movie, a lot of comedic relief that was ok but made it seem like a parody. But seriously worst thing is the CGI. What were they thinking?!?!?!?!"

After defeating pennywise in the sewers and banishing him for a long 27 years when the losers club makes there blood oath and swear to come back if pennywise was to ever return. 27 years later pennywise comes back, he is back to his ways again (killing people again in other words). I believe it was a really good movie and it told a good theme that friendship is really important. I would rate this movie a 3.5/5 because the scary scenes were not as frighting as they were anticipated to be. Don't get me wrong I would recommend this movie for anyone 17 and up. It was a fantastic movie and it had really good humor to it. I thought the cast was brilliantly put together. One character that I liked in the book and the movies was Richie, because of his witty humor and he knew his morals when it came down to running or staying and helping, but it was hard for him because he was scared, scared that his ""secret"" would come out. But i thought Bill Hater did a fantastic job with the character. In this movie the characters looked almost identical to there past one. I thought the director's veiw of this movie was incredible and spot on because it followed the book amazingly and was executed the movie effectively and efficiently.

"nastiarus","1","2","3","10 September 2019"," Commercial generic adaption of a great book.
","Started great, 40 minutes later went downhill. Ridiculous, laughable and not scary at all CGI scenes started to flood the scenes. The movie had some funny moments in the beginning that were totally into place, BUT it took the wrong direction and went being semi-comedy through all the movie where it actually (supposed to be) serious scenes. Horror started to feel semi-comedy, the script was not okay. This adaptation could've been great if they respected the book ATMOSPHERE for the least! I'm not even referring to the book things (which they didn't respect the majority) I'm just talking about simple atmosphere and vibe.
This is just one more mediocre generic movie that wants to sell to the structure that is going to like this kind of trash.
Shame on directors and actors that don't realize or (maybe they do) but prefer way more money over an artistic quality work that maybe wouldn't sell as well because of the, you know, the world's society nowadays who are just controlled by the same thing.
I mean, I know there are movies that still are great, of course! That majority you don't find in commercial cinemas, but, this one is an adaptation of a great book and this is just unrespectful. Not to mention the ending, it was the most ridiculous horror movie thing I've ever seen."
"vinsond21","4","2","3","9 September 2019"," It Chapter Two needs more than just brilliant Bill Skarsgard
","Bill Skarsgard, who was brilliant as Pennywise the dancing clown in It, reprises the role in the sequel. Although the character is nonsensical, Skarsgard has fun with it and he is fun to watch. Other than Skarsgard, i can't think of any other reason why i would even bother to go see this movie. The story itself is rubbish and, at three hours long, is two and a half hours too long; the half hour worth watching are those scenes with Skarsgard's Pennywise. This is not to discredit the cast of veteran actors and their younger counterparts who all show their acting chops as well, but the material they had to work with was trying too hard to be compelling and engaging and ending up neither one nor the other. This movie may be better than the recent Scary Stories, but that's not saying much."
"mamajey","4","2","3","9 September 2019"," Hilarious!
","This was a super funny movie! But other than a few jumpy parts (that you knew were coming) it was very disappointing as a horror flick. Pennywise is sadly predictable this time around and most of the monsters are more cartoon-like funny than scary. Wish I had waited for DVD instead."
"watcher101","5","2","3","8 September 2019"," A little disappointing
","I'll admit that I set my expectations a little high after the first one, but even then, there were several things about this movie that were rather disappointing. The first one was great, a true horror movie. This one was more of a dark fantasy, kind of like the movie ""Pan's Labyrinth"". One of the biggest issues is that for some reason, it kept throwing in needless and pointless humor. Sometimes it was a character making a comedic remark, sometimes it was just a scene itself that came across as comedic. This unnecessary comedy really underplays a lot of stuff in the movie, making scary scenes less scary and making serious scenes less serious and impactful (such as the random 'Angel Of The Morning' moment). I really don't know why they did that. Sometimes those comedic scenes were unintentional, but many were.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed with some of the characters. Eddie, Ritchie, and Ben came across as bitter and angry a lot of the time. Ben especially, and he had this possessive, jealous air about him towards Beverly. Speaking of which, I didn't buy the romance between them, at least not on Bev's end. Ben was in love with her since childhood, which was fine, but Bev was completely in love with Bill since childhood, and even when they were adults. But then she suddenly and immediately falls for Ben because... she found out he wrote her a poem one time. All of a sudden, the feelings she had for Bill (even having known that he hadn't written the poem) suddenly disappear, and she's suddenly completely into Ben, whom she never once saw as a romantic interest, as a kid or as an adult. At least in the book it kept her feelings towards him ambiguous, but this came almost completely out of the blue on her end.<br/><br/>They also added a bunch of stuff, like the characters needing to find tokens, which wasn't in the book or mini-series. This addition not only went nowhere, and therefore was completely pointless, it took up so much time in a movie that was already nearly 3 hours. They also completely omitted certain character roles that could have and should have played much bigger parts. I understand that cuts were necessary since the movie was almost 3 hours, but then why add unnecessary plots elements to begin with, especially when they could have filled them in with the characters and events they cut? And then there's was the climax. While not bad, it felt rather over the top, you know, just a little too Hollywood, not quite right for this type of horror movie.<br/><br/>I know this may sound like I'm bashing the movie, but that's not necessarily the case. It was a passable movie that I enjoyed, but I felt like it could have and should have been so much more than what they did with it."
"kiran-parry","4","2","3","8 September 2019"," Some nice scenes but a slow storyline
","For me eventhough there were some good scenes I thought that some of the scenes horrorwise went over the top for my liking. In the first there were some good killing scenes that didn't last that long but they were edge of your seat sort of scenes and exciting. This film had a good link to the first IT however I thought it was slow and really dragged in parts which wasn't the case with the first IT. Lastly I thought there was too much humour in it for an horror and humour was unnessary and scenes which may of made a small audience jump were very predictable if you're an horror fan."

"ihasnochille","5","2","3","7 September 2019"," Second verse a little worse than the first
","I quite enjoyed the first film, while I didn't think it was overly amazing I found it fresh and a lot of fun, so naturally I was interested and excited to see the second installment.<br/><br/>I knew of the second half of the story, I knew what it entailed and what it was about, It's this 27 year cycle where events repeat themselves as pennywise returns, but instead of playing to the strengths of that Idea it feels as though it's more just going through the motions for me.<br/><br/>I just feel as though we've done all this before but in a more interesting way. In the first film, the kids were first learning of the monster and had to find time throughout their lives to deal with it. It was hard for the kdis as they were constantly restricted by the family/ school and social elements of their lives, but in this film they are all adults and don't have to deal with those issues. Not to say they have no issues or the ones they do have should be dismissed but it just feels way less engaging to me knowing that at any point they could just up and leave if they so desired.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning they have a goal in mind of reuniting and killing the monster again, but they have to spend the whole time meandering around to find each of their special mcguffins before they can do what they came here to do.<br/><br/>This is all just used as a way for each of the characters to have a bunch of individual scenes with pennywise, resulting in what feels like way more pennywise moments than the first.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of people will thoroughly enjoy these moments but for me, as a result of there being so many, they are in turn much shorter and left a much smaller impact on me than the first. I vividly remember the projector scene from the first, I struggle to think of any really memorable scene from this aside from the finale.<br/><br/>On that: without spoilers, they keep eluding to the idea that the ending might have been changed from the book as one character is infamously a writer who writes bad endings. I haven't read the book myself but regardless of if they changed the ending or not I still felt a little unsatisfied. It all just begs the question of 'why couldn't they have done that the first time?""<br/><br/>And I think that is ultimately my problem with this film, and I know people are not going to like me saying this but i really feel like it does not need to exist. I KNOW it's part of the book and for many a very vital part but It really does feel like the first film just did everything this film did, only better. I heard somewhere that one of the hardest parts of making this film was condensing this second part of the story into only one film, and it does make me wonder if they ultimately split it into 3 parts and gave everything more time it needed to grow it might have been better.<br/><br/>One of the things that instantly comes to mind is the ultimately pointless use of the return of Henry Bowers, he is set up early on but before we know it he's done and swept under the rug to be forgotten, If this film was split into 2 I suspect he would have been used better.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say, If I didn't know there was a second part to the story after watching the first film I would have been completely satisfied just believing the first film was it. I don't believe this film and part of the story really adds anything interesting or necessary that enhances the first film. I know this wasn't the case at all but it feels like one of those films where it feels like they have no idea for a sequel in mind and just ended up retreading the first, that is at least how I feel on the matter."
"tanya-padam711","9","1","1","4 July 2020"," Psychological horror and a masterpiece at that!
","If you are looking for scary jumps that any classic horror film can offer you, this is NOT your movie.<br/><br/>It's a pure *psychological* horror. By that I mean it amazingly depicts how our childhood experiences affect our life choices later on as we enter into adulthood. It focuses on the theme that we let our fears stop us from doing well in life.
The more we hold on to our fears, the stronger it gets along with added troubles. And it's all in our head. Some of us know how to conquer our fears, while the others who aren't able to cope up lose their paths and commit serious mistakes or take extremely wrong choices in life.<br/><br/>Going into the details(spoiler alert)
Why does IT prey on small children ? Not all children! but the ones who have had some troubled experiences. Like the girl who has a face mark and says that her friends make fun of her, a boy who is gay and gets bullied by other children, a boy who stammers and is made fun off by others, a girl whose father is extremely abusive, a boy who is made fun of for his big size, a boy who was bullied about his parents for his skin color... and so on.
The story shows That a group of small children were able to fight IT in their childhood but somehow it appears again after 27 years ! Why 27 years ?
Now this is just my opinion or what I gained from the movie, that we usually make big decisions about life when we are in our late 20s. It's usually during that period of time when we make big choices about career, marriage, and so on. It's during this time that we develop a personality which is hugely dependent on our childhood and other life altering experiences.
The girl who was abused by her father in her childhood is shown married to a guy who abuses her(a choice she made in her adulthood). The guy who was bullied as a child for being fat worked out and shaped his body, excelled well in his career, the guy bullied for being gay isn't married and doesn't have a life partner yet.. and so on. What you make out of life is dependent on how well you have let go off the childhood traumas.some of us just repress our memories, which is exactly what they all had done when they left Dery to go on to live in our cities.
Now Once again they all have to go back to *Dery* in order to face their fears and stop IT's terror. They feel the need to stop bad things happening to other children.
They relive their childhood memories and face IT again after 27 years. This is the main theme of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie leaves a mark and gives the audience something to think about.<br/><br/>Especially the ending! Just before when IT is about to die (or go away) He takes the form of all the different bullies and in the end turns into a scared and small version of itself. The characters weren't able to kill him with a sword/knife or some kind of a spell(which happens in most of the horror films). Instead they killed him by conquering their fear. They say ""you are just a clown, you are so small, a bully, you mean nothing, we aren't scared of you"". This is how they conquer their fears. Thats when IT says that you all have become adults, you all have grown up and dies.<br/><br/>All in all, what a wonderful way to spread a strong message across the audience.
This movie is Scary, funny, psychological and contains a meaningful message.<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece. Just my opinion."

There were no moments where I closed my eyes or get shocked which I generally do in a horror film. Both the chapters were not that horror if compared to the Conjuring franchise, but first part was actually enjoyable as a thriller than a horror. The basic thing that it lacked was the suspense and unpredictability which the Conjuring series had(except The Nun)."

","I am under the impression that there are enough scare scenes in this movie for like 20 horror movies, that is a good thing. What makes them work is that apart from like 1 or 2 of the characters, most of them don't seem absolutely fundamental to the story. As such most scare scenes are credible in the fact that if the character does not escape them, they can actually die.<br/><br/>It's fun to see the adults come back together again, it borders between the ridiculous and a kind of ""isn't it sad that adults never get back together again when older?"". Admittedly I didn't quite understand the ""believe"" thing in the end... it seemed like they had to all turn into bullies?<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the better horror movies to come out, the last few years but it's also an unusual one, it doesn't follow the traditional tropes."

The final boss fight was so long that they gave characters a break, yea they were safe for a few minutes and could talk freely, the Pennywise was supposedly to big to get in even through he could have easily shrink. Also the epilogue for this movie tried to give us a deeper meaning to whole thing, but why? It is a horror movie, not a drama, why is it being moralised at the end?

I thought they did a great job with the casting, especially the adult version of Eddie. The actor completely nailed the performance. He even looks like the younger actor all grown up.
If you read the 1,100+ page novel, you know that the movie is very different from the book - as it should be, as the book was a huge letdown. At least for me. Thankfully there are no giant space turtles here.

For the most part, he just channels one of his characters from Split and gets paid heavily for it. There is no suspense, no surprise, just clever CGI that fails to scare or horrify. The lazy writing heavily relies on that CGI to bail it out and comes up short. If you want to be disturbed, go watch Alien or Event Horizon for the 20th time. Even on the 29th watch of these films , they would outclass IT, even though you know what's coming. The clincher for me was a continuity issues with character being stabbed below the sternum and pulling it out above the sternum. I spotted this on first watch, so the studio surely noticed and just treated their audience as stupid. Unforgivable. I rented this and wish I could get my money back. Avoid."
"wolfordcheyenne","6","1","1","21 March 2020"," Too long
","It was WAY to long. It was half-an-hour longer then it should've been. I kept wishing it would end and got annoyed when it didn't. There was a lot of strange directorial choices and scenes that should've been cut. Some of the characters had fulling arcs and others didn't. The best part was the restaurant scene with the fortune cookies. Also Bill Hader was great as adult Richie."
"sagittaur79","2","1","1","17 March 2020"," Only watched it to know how it ended
","So, is this a psychological horror or a monster flick? It can't decide. The little bits of dramatic connection between the characters is marred by cheap slapstick humour or cheesy shocks. Too many incongruous elements: Pennywise seems to be able to appear in dreams and thoughts, but seemingly can't just kill people when they're just within reach; he can shape shift at all other times, but can't just get close enough to attack people. So much stupidity it's unbelievable how many good actors decided to do this film. Such a waste of a budget."
"Kaiwatchesmovies","6","1","1","16 March 2020"," The first one was better.
","I thought the movie was okay, but compared to the first one it kind of sucked.<br/><br/>The first movie was creepy, mostly because the clown moved in creepy ways and genuinely looked like he came from a child's nightmare. The clown in this movie was highly edited with CGI in most scenes. For me it just doesn't scare me.<br/><br/>One thing I liked was that it still had this messed up vibe to it just like in all of Stephen King's work. In the first one, every scene with the bullies and the girl's dad was messed up and creepy. In this movie, the opening scene where they nearly kill a guy for being gay was again, very messed up. This is why I like Stephen King's work and I'm glad it made it's way here."
"statuskuo","1","1","1","8 March 2020"," Proved My Suspicion
","Admit to yourselves, those who championed the first re-boot of this that you haven't seen it since. That being said, this is absolute proof your gauge was painfully off the first time. These kids have personalities built into a box and not one person that I cared about more than the 90's ""IT"" And it wasn't because of Tim Curry. He's great and will never be outdone (sorry kid who played him in this one, you aren't charming enough to be creepy as Curry was). The 90's was pure adult cinema. This is...some video game retro trash.
This movie (if you can call it that) drops us RIGHT at the end of the first chapter. Where they supposedly defeated the being that kills children yet goes into hibernation when the Losers Club thwart Pennywise's spree. 27 years later, their 40's version get called back into action. Here we learn they are all successful, yet do not remember their childhood past in Derry. All the better, since the traumatic events of the first one sent their memory into hiding as well. When called together by Mike Hanlon, they vow to end the terror once and for all.
I truncated the synopsis because...well, the more I think about this one, the more I really hate the people involved.
First, they steal the back and forth between past and present from the 90's version. Yet, somehow, that version was much more effective. This one has that gimmick where they run past their former self. Basically a memory that crisscrosses and such. This novelty wears down fast. And we get bits and pieces of their life as adults.
The 90's version really nailed the sense of their older selves. Again, they did the perfect casting by putting in...known television actors. This was a stroke of genius because the director most likely knew we bring our own baggage with them. Annette O'Toole, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Dennis Christopher, Harry Anderson, Richard Thomas, and Richard Masur. Absolutely brilliant because off the bat you really cared for them (with their history as good people in sitcoms and night dramas and cult films). Similar with their child counterparts.
In 2017 and 2019 ""It"" I really have no idea who any of these people are. James McAvoy is PAINFULLY mis-casted as Bill Denborough. As is Jessica Chastain as the grown up Beverly Marsh (though curiously, the teenage Bev in the original was bad casting). I never got the sense any of these adults lived a complete life. The abusive father tied to the abusive husband idea is tiresome. In the 90's version it hits you a little harder, since O'Toole played her more as a woman who was abused versus Chastain's baffling take as a woman who is affectionate to her abusive husband.
Any way, it gets REALLY tiresome when Pennywise becomes the spider and the resolution seems tacked on and...well, let's be clear, even Stephen King had no idea what ""IT"" was. So we get this overly computer generated VERY unscary thing.
There's too much to pick apart. It's just an awful money grab flick that totally lost that charm of fear. This became a dumb actioner, a woke it's okay to be gay thing, and well, it's a modern take. And when the dust settles I was surprised at a nearly 3 hour run time, it still felt like nothing happened.
I feel, these days, when they hand out assignments to make a movie, the statement is ""don't screw it up"" Life experience truly creates this, and somehow I feel the writer and director both need to live more life to know what makes nostalgia important. It isn't just rattling off pop culture references."

The original was frightening because most watched it when they were kids, but as an adult the original was pretty boring to.

I hope its the last movie but I doubt it will be given how easy these kind of films are to make.

Every jump scare (which is the only horror tool in this movie) is way to cute :D<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have a real story.

There is no subtlety in this film. It's all over-the-top, giant, loud, bad CGI monsters running at the characters while screaming. It's not scary. The actors did fine with what they were given and from a technical standpoint, other than some not-so-great CGI, it was well-made.

","I am in no means a fan of modern horror movies and not really a fan of horror in general, if ghosts or the paranormal are involved I check out or don't even check in. There are exceptions, an obvious one being The Shining.<br/><br/>I had seen and read a general dislike to this movie upon release but I have seen the original, and the recent remake of the first part so inevitably I was going to watch this. To my surprise I actually quite enjoyed it and I would normally be a prime contender to berate at the first opportunity. I thought it was good fun, though maybe that is not the soundbite you want from a 'scary' movie.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I've ever been affected by jump scares, I just don't react to them, for me there was only one in this movie and it was obviously on it's way (ballon, bed, asylum), but nonetheless it was some of the imagery I enjoyed, that skit being one. The old lady I thought was fantastic.<br/><br/>It's against the norm for me but I thought the humour was actually funny, I've definitely seen supposed comedies with much fewer laughs, I didn't feel this detracted from the 'horror' as 'horror' films don't really exist anymore. I was along for the ride and that's no small feat for me and this genre.<br/><br/>The most horrifying scene is probably the opening scene, beyond that I generally liked most of the cast so it was somewhat irreverent to me how their journey's progressed as mentioned, I was onboard for the ride.<br/><br/>It's a long movie but I felt it moved along at a decent pace, I can understand some of the criticisms, this could have had a much darker tone though I watched the original IT for the first time only a short time before the release of the first part of the remake, I can only really remember the second half of the original being ridiculous any way. I barely remember the first part of the remake ....but in this ....that old lady, that's going to stay with me for a while.<br/><br/>Overall I think if you go into this with an open mind it's generally quite enjoyable, a bit silly and a bit sick. I think I will leave it there reiterating my words above 'good fun'."
"juliaflattum","6","1","1","22 January 2020"," Unnecessary Closure
","As one of the massive fans of the first IT movie in the now IT series, hearing that viewers would have the opportunity to re enter the town of Derry, Maine in an IT Chapter 2 directed again by Andres Muschietti was very exciting. Watching The Losers take on Pennywise on the big screen yet again was a sight and a good continuation of the first film, however aspects of the plot regarding the character development, the overly lengthy run time of the film and predictability were what left me wondering if the continuation was really necessary at all.
When people start going missing yet again in Derry Maine, the Losers Club who have long been separated living own lives as now adults reunite 27 years later in their home town to fulfill their pact and finally put an end to Pennywise and the terrorism that comes with him. Obstacles encountered along the way bring the group closer together and throughout the film many flashbacks of moments from their childhood appear as each character regains their memory of the events that took place all those years ago.
As a viewer, getting to know the characters as adults, many resemblances of their childhood come forward in the way each one of them is leading their new life. While I do acknowledge that the casting in this movie was phenomenal, capturing each character accurately from child to adult, the way in which the script was written left me wondering what exactly happened to some of the characters and their behavior from their past to now present self. Characters such as Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain) and Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan) were the two in who I believed differed most from their childhood nature due to the constant amount of flashbacks. Seeing the way both these characters interacted side by side with their childhood personas were what made me realize just how different their behavior became. While there is room for many different interpretations as to why they have changed, after seeing the first IT movie many times it seemed odd how the writers had Ben characterized as being almost entirely different from his childhood self and Beverly losing the inner strength she seemed to have as a child in her adulthood, the flashbacks are what assisted with the doubt and contributed to a bit of confusion when it came to the characters development.
While the amount of flashbacks throughout the film gives the viewer a good sense of nostalgia and also proves necessary with some aspects of the plot, it was a few scenes such as those along with other scenes from the present that created an unnecessarily long length of the film in which I believe could have been cut down shorter and still have been equally if not more successful. What I believe director Andres Muschietti failed to realize when creating this film is that many scenes that made the cut shouldn't have as many had little contribution to the main plot of the film. Scenes that proved essential also left me having a larger sense of predictability than I was expecting and left me knowing too often when things such as jump scares or key events in the storyline would occur.
IT Chapter 2 representing the second half of the famous Stephen King novel IT, proved to be an interesting take on what happens next for the Losers Club. As an IT fan I do have to say that I enjoyed the film as a sense of closure it gave to the first however there were many more parts of the film where I was left a bit disappointed in which I was not expecting. To fans of the IT series who have not yet seen the second chapter of the film I would recommend to go watch it as it did have incredible cinematography and a great cast. Many laughs came from the film as well as some tugged heartstrings and while it did have its flaws it was also a good wrap up to its first film."

There are so many wonderful touches installed in this film, the humanity, the giddy humour and the persuasive melancholy of who we are and our place in the world. There isn't a false note. Of course all the horror and insane creepiness is all still intact, bigger and bolder than before, some of the set pieces are inspiring. Yet even so, all this seems to take a backseat to what else is being conveyed here at times, in which the assembled cast admirably manage to put across. It could almost be considered an entrant for the Cinema Of Personal Expression in a minor way and in modern terms.Yes the French kissing CGI ghoul was slightly stretching the boundaries but apart from that everything looked and felt right in so far as the cruel, fun-house effect that the film strove for. It didn't reach perfection but I believe it achieved everything one could have hoped for in terms of a companion piece to the 2017 film. It's almost a shame that it's all ended but a grand exit in my opinion."

Perhaps it is me who has desensitized through all the video games I have played since a kid that an image of monstrous creature no longer spooks me. Set aside a couple of jump scares (usually from loud sfx,) the movie wasn't scary at all.<br/><br/>Humor is alright in most movies that aren't designed for comedy as long as it's paced and utilized in a manner it isn't awkward. In this movie, however, there were a couple of scenes that humor just didn't belong. It wasn't only awkward but also embarrassing to watch. The movie unnecessarily overdid humor and I wonder why in a supposedly horror movie.<br/><br/>That said, the story may seem average, redundant, cliche, and even cheesy, but it was well told through cinematography and editing.

"satyastephenson","7","1","1","11 December 2019"," Some pros and some cons...
","There really is a lot of Spoilers for both the movie and the book here so be warned.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I have read the book and had some issues with the book as well (even though for the most part I love Stephen King books) so despite the fact that there were many changes from the story line of the book I knew going in to this movie that I was not opposed to having some elements be changed.<br/><br/>Pros: 1. The actor that plays Pennywise is amazing, as he was in the first movie. Really, he is mesmerizing when he is on screen. 2. Thank GOD they gave some build up to having Ben and Bev end up together (this alone brought my rating up a few starts, honestly). It made me nuts in the book where it was more of an afterthought after everyone had left Derry ""oh yeah I think she left with Ben"" after she had slept with Bill and showed no real inclination to poor Ben. 3. The casting was great and the actors did a marvelous job with their parts. 4. No weird child sex thing at the end (pretty obvious they were going to omit that but still)<br/><br/>Cons: The absolute biggest con (and really it is a big con) is the CGI monsters. They reminded me of an early 2000's line of Golum's cousins . Honestly, if we could replace all of these CGI monsters with...really anything else...scenes that started out as scary would have stayed scary instead of becoming laughable. The whole movie would have been much more successful in my opinion and I think they should do a reboot where they keep the rest of the movie but ditch the CGI monsters and re-release it. For instance, when they had the old woman running nude in the background when Bev is at her ""old house"", it would have been much more scary if they stayed with that idea (sort of like the old woman in the bathtub in the Shining) instead of having her run out of the dark as a giant monster. 2. I still didn't like the way they killed Pennywise but did find it funny they kept referring to Bills bad endings (even Stephen King made a jab at it!) as if making a commentary on the IT ending itself. 3. I wasn't a big fan of the direction they took with the ""chud"" ritual and Mikes role in it--it ended up making Mikes almost sole role in the film a walking spout of information about how to use the ritual to kill IT and then having him be wrong about it anyway.<br/><br/>There is more but this is from the top of my head after watching it a few moments ago."
"enderbcn","8","1","1","7 December 2019"," Not as bad as these review says. Worth watching
","I think there are too many negative reviews here and decided to write one. If you've read the book you know it's nearly impossible to make a good movie of the book. I think this one is good enough. It's stays loyal to the book to a certain extent, but indeed there are a couple of things that were changed to adapt it to the screen. I don't like that, but I honestly wouldn't know how to do it better to be honest.<br/><br/>If you are thinking this is a movie that will scary, probably not. It's more about the story than actual jumps and scares. And I think it's ok like this. The book created a big tension using long stories and when the scary part was coming, it was so deep in your brain that scared the crap out of you. No way they can do that in the screen I honestly prefer that they didn't try.<br/><br/>I do agree on the CGI stuff. When It is just by Itself with no CGI is so good... Today movies have too much CGI for no reason.<br/><br/>Worth watching in my opinion."

"iandavidrastall","8","1","1","24 November 2019"," It 2 Beautay? Yes, By Caesar's Ghost.
","I think of ""Annabelle"" and ""Stranger Things"" as the beginning of the cinematic encroachment on children. If there's any part of these two films defined as something that couldn't have been made even a few years ago, it's not the special effects. It's the graphic depiction of violence against kids. Or sexual violence. Or child sexualization. But this film also stars Jessica Chastain, who on her own would have steered this right, if ""It: Chapter Two"" were not clearly shaped by healthy input from all the marvelous actors. Their moral compass may have helped to keep this film's tone absolutely solid throughout a tangle of issues. (And if you know the book, you know it's not their fault.)<br/><br/>Now I always see horror films in terms of cruelty versus sincerity, both with the filmmakers and with the audience. Horror is mostly about cruelty, but the stand it takes on that issue defines a film (and filmmaker) (and audience) for me. This movie is trying to straddle both worlds. It mostly succeeds. These days tone is all-important to filmmakers, since any movie that sucks tonally is going to suck overall, regardless of how good it is. (Fellini was especially prone to this, I think. Try watching ""Juliet Of The Spirits"".) These days studios have all stepped up to the challenge, and here we see a great example of walking the tightrope and not losing balance. If a moment seems about to devolve into being unintentionally funny, the movie usually seizes that opportunity to do something *intentionally* funny. The cruel people will laugh, and the sincere people will take it as grotesque. Considering that a good third of either installment is just a rush of plot points, maintaining a trustworthy tone is quite a feat.<br/><br/>Is it scary? If you're daring it to scare you, no. (Movies don't scare you if you're daring them to.) But at a slow burn, it's there. (For adults. Do *not* let little kids watch this. If they take it at a slow burn it could be traumatizing.) Horror has developed since the wave of gore films in the 80s to things like torture and jump scares, and seems to now be landing on nightmare. I think that's the wisest thing horror could do. (More properly, it's landed on nightmare and cruelty. ""Hereditary"" is a good example of horror that I'm sure only plays properly to sadists.) ""It: Chapter Two"" doesn't just fend off unintentional comedy, or just fend off someone's expectations of a scary image, there's a feeling of recognition in these scary images. Mining nightmares yields up the most universal symbols of fear. Those are the horror scenes we've all actually been in before. And since nightmares are common scenes we all nonetheless write ourselves, if one of us writes that out to a script, we should be witnessing our own inner lives. That's part of why it could really hurt kids, if they see it. As constructed as it is, it's very real."
"CinemaSerf","5","1","1","24 November 2019"," CGI on steroids....
","I watched the two films in a double bill and I really did want to enjoy this as much as I did the first - but boy, could this have been much more of a let down? The original has a far better cast; snappier direction and a much tighter script. This just rumbles along with a staccato, portmanteau-style storyline that robs the narrative of much of the cohesion of it's earlier iteration. The ending is straight out of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" without the roller skates!. Sadly disappointing."
"sleons","1","1","1","24 November 2019"," Computer generated abomination
","This film is hard to watch. There isn't a single ""scary"" scene that isn't pulled of with CG. It's hard to be afraid of a creature that belongs to the digital realm. The creators should only be afraid of how poorly this technology ages. Film that rely on this end up aging terribly (within a few years). The actor who portrays pennywise is great, I don't know why they used him so little in order to use this powerpoint created abomination. The suits in Hollywood have taken the fun away from making films. Now they are done surrounded by green or blue screens and doing everything in post. This film isn't scary, and that's something a horror film can never be. It has the stupidest comedy to ""lower"" the horror. The comedy and the horror doesn't work. Don't support films like this, don't be those test audiences that are shaping Hollywood into the computer generated disaster it has become."
"kurschybee","2","1","1","20 November 2019"," Boring, poor story line, too long, CGI good
","This movie lost me about halfway through. I had high hopes for how they COULD have built the story line, but they dropped that and focused almost entirely on CGI. Stephan King knits unbelievable, profound stories together that usually makes you wish you could actually be a part of that story. I'm surprised he made a cameo appearance considering the lack of creative writing.<br/><br/>If you like a movie solely for its ability to make you jump (and put you a bit closer to deafness) then this is your movie.

The CGI creatures were awful, I don't know if they were meant to be scary or funny to be honest, they reminded me of the Evil Dead style of horror. The Pennywise clown sequence were he finally transforms into the spider was also mediocre, I expected something more, more inovation in his looks and behavior. Overall 6/10 is the best I can give."

","I think a lot of people walked out of the movies disappointed after seeing this movie, but I don't think it's cause they had just seen a bad movie. It's cause it isn't what you expect it to be. So lets get it over with right away: This isn't a scary movie. It's not scary, it's not going to give you nightmares, it doesn't even have the jump scares that makes you flinch in your seat.<br/><br/>However, it is a movie with unexpectedly strong character arcs. In flashbacks, which are nicely woven into the movie, we see how the characters that seems grown up and successful in their modern selfs are actually stuck in the past. Pennywise feels less like an actual threat, and more like a metaphor of how they're hunted by the destructive and abusive relationships they had with other people in the past. There's also scenes which are downright funny, which also play on the actors chemistry with each other.<br/><br/>James Ransone really does a stellar job to portray the slightly neurotic and foulmouthed Eddie, and he steal the show several times. Bill Hader surprised me with his performance and one of the most heartbreakingly bitter-sweet ending scenes I can remember.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, but not if you want to be scared."

","Very disappointed with it chapter 2. It seemed to me that it couldn't decide if it was a horror or a comedy, and it wasn't a horror/comedy as the comedy just ruined the horror, and most of the comedy just felt forced. The one exception to this was the scene with the old woman, that was creepy, good job on that. The film was very long with not enough horror, and like I stated before a lot of the horror was lost through misplaced comedy. The first scene felt like it was there just to be politicaly correct, it had no relevance to the rest of the film. The actual story was interesting but that credit goes to Stephen king not this film, personally I would recommend either reading the books or watching the original films."

","Enjoyed the first movie, thought the aesthetics of the scenes were great, child actors were superb and Pennywise was truly terrifying.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie which is a continuation of the story set 27 years later falls flat. I wasn't aware of the run time (I watched it at home) so presumed it was around about the 2 hour mark when I put it on - very shocked to see this genre of movie come in at the near 3 hour mark. You can tell that they've just tried to put filler scenes in to stretch it out for some reason as it does drag. I found myself no longer becoming interested in the scenes because they were just full of jump scares.<br/><br/>These jump scares were mostly complied of very very poor CGI. It took me out of the movie multiple times. I said to my wife it's more like a Resident Evil or even Scooby-doo type film at those points.<br/><br/>I felt Pennywise didn't feature much either. Granted the fact he operates in the shadows adds to his mystery but I find it more scary when they showed a dark corner and all you hear is his voice. Much better than something running at you that looks like it's from Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Adult actors were all good but overall it was about 45 mins too long and ended up becoming boring to watch."

Some moments worked really well with the scares, like Vicky's death under the bleachers (even though it was spoiled in the countless tv spots) and the dearth of Dean in the Hall of Mirrors.<br/><br/>But most of the time, primarily the entire second act, the scares just got more and more redundant. They all had pretty much the exact same setup and pay off. They all included CGI monsters that tried to attack the adult losers, sometimes in flashbacks as kids as well, and then they ran off and cut to the next loser.<br/><br/>The story could've been looked over just one more time before being sent off to the cast and crew for a table read. The first act felt a bit rushed to be honest, due to the fact that the losers' introductions are just rushed through to make time for the second act and reunion. The aforementioned second act was just super redundant, it had no purpose besides giving the kids more screen time, and it didn't really catch anyone in the audience for a scare. But rather the whole theater was roaring with laughter at most of the scares. And the third act was just all over the place. The way the ritual of chÃ¼d was done in the film was drastically different than the first one, and really served no purpose whatsoever. The way they defeat penny wise does make some sense, but it was not the smartest choice made by Andy Muschietti.<br/><br/>I'm the end, this movie does have its moments where they catch you by surprise. But those moments are pretty rare in this film. I would recommend maybe seeing it once or just waiting until it comes out on digital. Which I'm pretty sure is very soon."

","I am quite surprised to see a lot of average reviews on here. IT chapter 2 has everything you need from a horror film and more. You have to have seen the first movie to actually understand what's going on in Part 2. You can tell a lot of effort has gone into this film, they haven't taken the easy route like in movies like The NUN and countless other jump scare horror films with 0 scares. My only criticism is for a violent scene that happens 2 minutes into the film, I found that unnecessary/offensive in the grand scheme of things. Like others have pointed out it's a long film but trust me it keeps you entertained throughout. Definitely worth a watch..its a movie that'll stay in your head for a month atleast."

","Going to see it I was pretty excited, I enjoyed the first movie and was eager to see how the story ended. The movie itself was not bad, Pennywise was just as creepy as always, completely owning every scene he was in, the grown ups did a great job at portraying the adult versions of the kids, and I really enjoyed watching everything unfold. I just for some reason felt like the ending sort of fell on it's face. as the movie reached the climax, I felt sort of let down by how it was all playing out, the creepiness of the movie seemed to be replaced with a more humorous vibe. I would definitely recommend seeing it, it was really fun to see all the new things they came up with to scare us."

","For starters, as a gay man I felt very bothered and confused at the first scene. It didn't make sense to the rest of the story. If the gruesomely shot gay bashing was meant to spark some diabolical issue with the town, it might have made sense to add it. But essentially this group of homophobes murder a gay man then for some reason leave the boyfriend alive to I guess call the police on them? But when he finds Pennywise eating his boyfriend, I really scratched my head. Pennywise hunted children because of their fear. And did the boyfriend not report anything he saw to the police? Do these people not have phones or something?<br/><br/>It was just the first of many plot holes. Why did they all rush back if their memories had been erased? What was the point of grabbing all these artifacts and then burn them? Why did they even need to separate? So were all the flashbacks as kids before or after they stopped Pennywise? No time was spent on why they even left the town?"

"wkronz","8","1","1","19 September 2019"," A Beautiful Mess
","Following up a film as large as 2017's It, which became the highest grossing horror film of all time, can be very challenging. However, director Andy Muschietti and writer Gary Dauberman provide a more than worthy sequel, which may not have pleased everyone, but it certainly pleased me.
Andy Muschietti proves his sheer talent for directing horror, arguably more so than ever before, here. Every tilt, pan, dolly, and zoom serves a purpose and enhances the immersion for the audience.
The cast is another remarkable aspect. The Loser's Club is perfectly casted, with each actor looking just like their child counterparts. The performances are solid all around, but I found Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, and James McAvoy stood out most to me. On the opposing side, Bill Skarsgård once again turns in a menacing, physical performance as Pennywise, and utilizes his expanded screen time to invoke further terror. Teach Grant as well, gives a quite understated performance as Henry Bowers, and provides a delightful sense of mania that always entertains.
Furthermore, the characters are for the most part, well continued, and explored. Nearly every Loser is given an amazingly compelling, and satisfying arc, all the while continuing their character from the first with ease.
The film is also improved on a technical level from the first. The editing, most of all shines. Its pure creativity in its match-cuts and wipes make for excellent transitions between scenes. The cutting during scenes adds a great amount of intensity too. The visual effects are leagues ahead of the often laughable effects before it. All the creatures and terrors are wonderfully designed and rendered much better.
It: Chapter Two, unfortunately is not devoid of flaws. Especially in its structure.
While the story is intriguing, it's unfortunately muddled by flashbacks, that aside from Richie's and Bev's, come of as redundant, and incredibly repetitive. It really shows the films length, and while the runtime itself isn't a bother to me, it makes it apparent what could've been cut.
And, of course, there are the jump scares. Nearly every modern horror film is plagued by these. Beside some clever uses, the jump scares here are infuriating. They constantly ruin the suspense of scenes and become tiresome.
One more rather minute issue is the comedy. While very well written, I did find a couple of instances where it was poorly integrated into otherwise more serious moments.
It Chapter Two follows up its predecessor, and even surpassed it in quality. Muschietti crafts a brilliantly satisfying, if not muddled and sometimes repetitive story, that grounds its persistent terror in thoroughly developed characters, amazing performances, and technical marvels."

"rustonreviews","5","1","1","19 September 2019"," It doesn't float. It sinks.
","I've never read Stephen King's It, nor have I seen the 1990 two part miniseries starring Tim Curry as Pennywise. I was, however, very impressed with Muschietti's 2017 remake, which was revealed to be the first chapter of a duology during its closing credits. It's no wonder Muschietti has opted to follow the same route as the miniseries; King's epic novel is practically impossible to adapt into one feature length effort, given how much story is packed into its whopping 1,138 pages. Taking place twenty-seven years after Chapter One, the Loser's Club are called back to Derry once it becomes apparent that Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) has awakened to feast on the next generation of Derry's children. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), who never left Derry, calls his old friends back so they can fulfil the promise they all made twenty-seven years ago: to kill Pennywise once and for all should he ever return.
High expectations were set following Chapter One. With Muschietti back on board as well as Dauberman and Skarsgård, all was looking promising for Chapter Two to be a worthy companion to its predecessor. One of the highest praises sung about this film is its casting, and rightfully so. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader are excellent choices to play the older incarnations of their respective characters. Everybody looks the part and it strikes as wholly believable that these are the same characters we followed back in Chapter One. Unexpectedly, Bill Hader (primarily a comedy actor) steals the show as the adult Ritchie. Bill Skarsgård also delivers another fantastic performance as Pennywise, although his role isn't as prominent this time around, which is a real shame. There has also been much discussion about the films lengthy runtime; clocking in at just ten minutes shy of three hours, this is a long horror film which, unfortunately, results in some serious pacing issues.<br/><br/>Many of the film's problems are present during the painfully dull second act. It is here where Dauberman's script falls into repetitive territory, leading to unimaginative scares and boring, drawn out sequences that slam the film to a grinding halt. Most of the time, there's just too much going on with little by way of plot progression. In a novel, you of course have all the time in the world (as King clearly demonstrates), but in a film you don't get that luxury. Chapter One was paced very well, the plot moved swiftly, and it was an engaging experience overall. Chapter Two, on the other hand, doesn't share this quality.<br/><br/>Troubling the film also is an overabundance of CGI. Excessive CGI in a horror film never upholds well, and given how many of the most remarkable practical effects ever put to screen can be found in the realms of classic horror, it astounds me as to why filmmakers still endorse it to the lengths they do. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark suffered from this exact same problem. Much of the CGI on show here looks pretty distracting at times, and I couldn't help but wonder what some sequences would have looked like if brought to life via practical effects. Facing the struggles of repetition, just about every sequence during the second act ends with a lazy jump scare or the emergence of an average CGI creation. It's hardly effective, and it gets boring staggeringly quick.
There are a handful of noteworthy sequences to be found here, though. One of the most effective of the bunch happens early on, including the Losers Club reuniting in a Chinese restaurant where an admittingly haunting scene plays out including fortune cookies and a tragic reveal. But what's largely frustrating about the scenes that actually work is how the insertion of comedy often downgrades these moments of genuine terror. Dauberman (for some unknown reason) injects quite a few punchlines and gags throughout the film, and just like the excessive CGI, this is annoyingly distracting and pointless.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is a crushingly disappointing sequel that doesn't live up to its superior predecessor. Excellent casting, good cinematography and a pretty enjoyable final confrontation between Pennywise and the Loser's Club aside, this is a film that could have greatly benefited from a few more cuts. Entire scenes and characters could be removed from the final cut, and the absence of these unnecessary additions wouldn't at all affect the overall narrative whatsoever. Chapter Two is a clumsy, bloated experience with moments of greatness, but unfortunately, this is a film that sinks rather than floats."

"kikoydaba3","7","1","1","18 September 2019"," closes the story of the Losers Club satisfyingly, although the execution is often sloppy and messy
","Sometimes good, sometimes not, often engaging, often not, It Chapter Two closes the story of the Losers Club satisfyingly, although the execution is often sloppy and messy.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two follows the Losers Club, bound by blood pact, as they seek to destroy It once and for all. Returning to Derry, they are made to confront a vengeful evil while relieving past fears and traumas that did not go away in adulthood. As an ensemble, the cast have balanced roles without one dominating the presence, unlike the original where Bill's guilt is emphasized. However, because of different character arcs, the thematic message becomes muddied. The character arcs deal with the same fears, guilt and repressed feelings from the original, although additional perspectives were added.<br/><br/>Mike is underused and should have been the emotional center, notwithstanding the need to definitely close a chapter in the ensemble's life centered around Derry and It, and by also being the character that remained in Derry. The reveal he withheld information from the group that the American natives died fighting It felt shoehorned and his reasoning contrived. Bill's guilt is explored deeper when it is revealed his reluctance to join his younger brother Georgie was intentional and not because of sickness. Richie is revealed to be a closet gay who developed feelings for Eddie since. Homosexuality is a theme hammered violently in the opening scene when a gay couple was brutally attacked after which followed It's first reappearance, although the film doesn't overtly project a pro-LGBT stance. Stan's suicide does not help the Losers Club and the letters sent by him explaining his reason is unnecessary. Beverly continues to experience sexual and family abuse through her husband, but this is glossed over and her prominence as the lone female is not as strong from the original. Ben remains insecure with his feelings with Beverly. Their resolution is lovely, as Beverly realizes Ben wrote the poem she kept safe.<br/><br/>Overall the film is convoluted and has a repetitive story, although the latter can be forgiven because childhood trauma don't necessarily go away in adulthood. While the film has multitudes of messages, it gets bogged down because it does too many things at once. Despite its epic length, the conclusion is well earned because the characters have fully grown from their trauma. Although the pacing can be slow, especially during the first hour, the narrative hastens when the ensemble begins the quest to find totems of their pasts and It's appearance becomes more frequent.<br/><br/>Speaking of It, Bill Skarsgard is absolutely fantastic and the film's true highlight. The scene were he gave It emotional range during the baseball game is phenomenal. Skarsgard is terrifying, although the CGI feels overdone during the final battle. Part of his awesome performance is embodying the non-human personality which director Andy Muschietti characterized It to differentiate him from Tim Curry. The rest of the cast is good and no one in particular is bad. Bill Hader steals the show by balancing comedy with inner sadness. A lacking element here present from the original is Derry's creepiness. Almost every citizen in Derry from the original had sinister, hidden motives or bad intentions making the Losers Club stood out. Compared to the original Chapter Two looks more beautiful direction wise. The cinematography and production designed are improved, despite portraying the same setting. Many of the visual and practical effects are great. The horror is strong and score is more engaging.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two has many qualities riding for it but also weaknesses from the script, ultimately coming up short to the original.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

"GaryKurt101","6","1","1","16 September 2019"," Welcome Back To Derry
","It's strange to say that the dramatic parts of a horror film landed better than the horror parts, but that's It: Chapter Two's biggest issue - the horror just isn't scary. They sure think the horror scenes are scary. They come fast and furious with a ton of aggressive sound effects and CGI, desperately trying to prove to us that they're scary, but they're not.<br/><br/>This film opens with a hate crime against a gay couple that strikes the wrong note right off the bat. This scene actually is brutal and scary, because it's one of the few scenes that isn't loaded to the brim with computer effects and it feels like something that would really happen in a messed up town like Derry. Even when Pennywise the clown shows up towards the end of that scene, most of his effects at least appear practical.<br/><br/>Starting off like this gave me false hope that, maybe, this film would be stronger and scarier than the first. The next 30 minutes are equally strong with the audience catching up with the Loser's Club in present day. The transitions between each character's new life are beautifully handled and incredibly cinematic.<br/><br/>Once everyone gathers back in Derry, it becomes a slightly dull series of predictable funhouse horror scenes as each character must return to a place of trauma before meeting back up to fight Pennywise. Blessedly, the final showdown, while drenched with the CGI I've spent so much time complaining about, is stronger than the finales of either the novel or the original TV miniseries.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is the very definition of a mixed bag. There's a lot to love, a lot to shrug at, and a lot to hate, but it manages to be entertaining enough and frequently moving enough to look past a lot of the film's flaws."
"schroederagustavo","4","1","1","16 September 2019"," They tried to make It Epic...
","So before anything, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed the first movie, I gave it an 8/10 and I stand by that grade. There are a lot of things that I don't like about the first movie, but overall I think the good outweighs the bad. What I particularly did not enjoy about the first film as much was all the spooky clown stuff and the jump scares and what I really loved was the coming-of-age stuff and the characters and how well they blended together.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in It: Chapter 2 it's a lot less character stuff and way more spooky clown stuff that seems to be there to appeal to teenagers. I don't want to take anything away from Bill Skaarsgard, because I think he's great as Pennywise, it's not his performance, but the execution of most of the scares that I think is really poorly done and not at all creative. Every single scare in this movie follows the exact same structure, they are all predictable, you know exactly when it's gonna happen and how it's gonna happen. It's not scary, it's annoying.<br/><br/>Although I did not enjoy this movie, there were aspects of it that showed promise. Of course, the cast is great, a lot of awesome talent here and the performances are good, especially Bill Hader, who is really great and hilarious, as far as I'm concerned, he's the best part of the movie, by far. Even though the cast is great, I don't think they mesh together as well as the kids do in the first movie. There is this one I would say great scene in this film in a Chinese restaurant where all of these characters are meeting for the first time, they're joking around, talking, it's really cool character interactions. And even the crazy stuff that happens during the later part of that scene is really well executed. The problem begins with two things, I believe. 1. This movie is filled with flashbacks to when they were kids, who are very noticeably digitally altered and I'm pretty sure they did something to their voices too. It's very distracting and took me out of the experience. 2. When they go and find their tokens, essentially the exact same scene happens over and over again but with different characters, none of the scares work, they are predictable and stupid. However, the scene with Jessica Chastain and the old lady has some promising moments to it, namely the stuff that happens in the background, which is really cool, but it's a tiny moment in the film. Then there's the scene with Eddy and the leper in the basement, which then suddenly plays the song ""Angel of the Morning"" for some reason and it's very awkward, it only plays for like 3 seconds, with no fade in or out, it's bizarre, to say the least.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is essentially identical to the first movie, only BIGGER with a bunch of unnecessary CGI and it's just a mess of a movie, I don't even know what else to say. It feels incredibly long for what it needs to be, the scares don't work and even with this much talent all over the place, It: Chapter 2 hardly justifies its own existence. You could say that the story progresses because they kill It in the end, but in that case why not just do this final death in the first movie. I think that would have been much better and even if this movie has small moments, overall it is messy, loud and obnoxious."
"sweidman-28016","7","1","1","16 September 2019"," A Step Down From the First But Enjoyable to Watch
","IT Chapter 2 Review:<br/><br/>Defeated by members of the Losers' Club, Pennywise returns 27 years later to terrorize of Derry once again. Now adults, the childhood friends have long since gone their separate ways. But when people start disappearing, Mike Hanlon calls the others home for one final stand. Damaged by scars from the past, the united Losers must conquer their deepest fears to destroy the shape-shifting Pennywise. I thought the first installment of this movie series was pretty good. It captured a good tone, had a compelling story, and interesting character dynamics. I don't know many people who were fans of the first that wasn't excited for the sequel. Chapter 2 was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Unlike most people, I had a hard time figuring out my thoughts on the movie. The first time I didn't really like it all that much. I thought it was mediocre. Then I saw it again a week later and I think I liked it. Then the next day I debated again and made pros and cons. In the end I think this is an enjoyable movie. The kids story is more interesting but I think this story is interesting as well. However the almost 3 hour runtime is about an hour way too long. So much unnecessary scenes were added. One aspect being flashbacks with the kids. They were mostly unnecessary. When the adults explore Derry alone, they encounter different places where they have a specific memory. I think that was a good idea because those were kind of more key elements. The big problem with the flashbacks was the CGI and voice editing. Since the kids have grown up a little more, their faces look a little different and some of their voices have changed. The CGI was just horrible to look at. Their faces were just filled with what I can only describe as over emotion. Sophia Lillis had the least amount of work done so she was pretty good. Their voices were even more high pitch than in the first and sometimes the audio was just sped up and overwhelming to hear. There was basically no emotion in the voices. Not their fault but more the editors. The acting was fine. Bill Hader had to be my favorite. He provided many funny jokes and actually put emotion towards his character. There's a character arc for him that's supposed to be a big deal but it wasn't too much of a big deal, at least how it came off. When it's first introduced the way it's presented felt off to me. Anyway I liked him the most. Personally I wanted Amy Adams to play adult Beverly but I thought Jessica Chastain did a pretty good job. And if Adams did play her she may have not gotten the opportunity to play her role in Sharp Objects with the best acting from her I've ever seen. Chastain had probably the most interesting character and she just made the most sense throughout the movie logically. Bill Skarsgård was good as Pennywise, I don't think as good as the first, but again is a great antagonist. I thought he showed up a little too much in this since the first actually didn't have him appear much, but that's just me. The rest of the actors were just fine. Nothing too great. Onto my biggest issues for the movie. Along with the first, this had an over reliance on CGI throughout. This more than the first. Everything was CGI'd and it just looked so fake where it was funny to look at. The end was just horrible with that. At least with the first they tried using makeup for some things. This was just all CGI. Speaking of it looking funny, I honestly think this is a horror-comedy. Every five minutes there was at least something funny said that made everyone laugh, this happens mostly with Bill Hader and James Ransone. Maybe if they took about half the jokes away I wouldn't think that but honestly this is a pretty funny movie at times. Nothing felt scary to me. There were only three jump scares that got me the second time I watched it. There's a little too many jump scares but I think it somewhat makes up for the horror aspect, though I personally don't like those. There are two things that I wish they would've changed to the plot. One involves Henry Bowers. He returns but honestly his character had no purpose. It did bring tension at times. Also I just didn't like the end. I think it was dumb and just funny to me. Based on how it ends, I'm wondering if the first movie could've just ended the whole thing if they continued using their method just a little longer. In the movie Bill is a writer and they keep bringing up one of his stories with a terrible ending. I personally believe that's kind of foreshadowing the end of the movie. Because I don't like leaving things on a bunch of cons here are some aspects I enjoyed. Benjamin Wallfisch's score is pretty good for a horror movie. I liked the first score and I think this one is just as good. The very very end of the movie I think was a really good way to end it. It's about the characters and it's just a good way to end it all. Also when all of the Losers' Club was together either having fun or just not panicking a whole lot about their situations, those were the strongest scenes. IT Chapter 2 isn't a bad movie in my opinion. It's just a step down from the first. Many people are divided and I understand why. Even though I find flaws throughout I do find myself enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>My Grade: B-"
"staciarose20","4","1","1","16 September 2019"," Too long and lots of CGI
","I had hopes that they would take Stephen King's book and make it just as interesting on screen, but that's a lot to ask--and the book is a lot to fit into two movies. It's an ok movie, but it's not scary at all. Tim Curry is still the best clown in town, and while the mini series has it's flaws it's still better than the 2017 and 2019 version of the story because the acting was GOOD. It had a more real feeling to it. This was just a bunch of actors thrown together pretending to be friends. I didn't feel any chemistry (friendly or romantic) between the characters.

"nctracksquirrel","7","1","1","16 September 2019"," So IT: CHAPTER 2................is fine.
","IT Chapter 2 (Non-Spoiler Review)<br/><br/>So IT Chapter 2 is...........fine.<br/><br/>Now I'm going to be real with you. I knew from the moment they announced Chapter 2 that it was not going to be better than Chapter 1. Here's the thing, sequels can be hard to make and its always awesome to see them be better than the movie that came before them, but unfortunately 9 times out of 10 when it comes to horror movies, the sequels don't hold up to be better. The main reason on why I think this especially for IT (and this is just my opinion): too much background information on the entity of Pennywise/killers. When it comes to something like Pennywise in horror movies I personally find it better to leave the imagination behind the mystery of what ""IT"" is. That's honestly why I think ""The Shape"" in the Halloween franchise still holds up till this day, because even though yes Michael Myers the person has a background, he is still shown as an entity of evil to not know what he is thinking so it leaves room for imagination. I believe they did a good job with Pennywise by the end of the first chapter by leaving a mystery behind what he actually is, but enough to know what his goal is.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of most of the CGI parts, because it just felt too unreal to me personally and some of it looked pretty bad. Unfortunately this movie did not scare me in the slightest, but the saving grace of the movie that I really like is the way it was delivered for certain tension based scenes and the characters. I care for all the characters and I can appreciate this movie for being a character driven kind of movie for all them dealing with the trauma they have went through growing up leading towards going back to their hometown after 27 years.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Overall this movie is fine for what it is. I can tell it was made with a lot of heart for the franchise. Not better than IT Chapter 1. Go see it with your friends to have a good time if you like horror movies.<br/><br/>Score: 7.3 out of 10"

That's a lot of material to try to get through in two movies.<br/><br/>In the end, however, what we see on the screen is some not so good CGI material and a lot of stingers or jump scares.<br/><br/>One shining moment from the movie is when Stephen King himself makes an appearance.

","Following the first blockbuster movie, it seems a sequel was inevitable - which eventually did materialize to ""IT Chapter Two"".<br/><br/>It's a very reminiscent movie, quite poignant in many places - I was impressed by the cast, their scripting, and the range of personalities on offer. But this movie is but an echo of the first chapter, and like many sequels to cult classics, relies on retrospective references to please the fans - nonetheless, this was enjoyable.<br/><br/>That being said, a lot of the movie had a repetitive tone as each character explored their fears, one by one. This all dragged out longer than was necessary, as did the entire production. It might bore you if you like a more concise plotline.<br/><br/>This was mixed in with some backstory for each character, a generous dashing of nostalgia, creative flashbacks to Derry's past, and so forth - this kept the visuals and scenery constantly changing.<br/><br/>The child-eating Pennywise had, of course, returned - but without any really good reason for this happening - apart from some interesting lore that emerges explaining the origins of the clown. Sadly most of the scares were jump scares and usually predictable - although not always. Some encounters were framed very creatively in interesting locations.<br/><br/>Georgie was still gone, and at no point was able to be saved. There was a great cameo appearance by a recognizable face, though.<br/><br/>If you liked the first and grew attached to the original characters, you'll like this - but it doesn't offer too much new. Despite that, it has enough saving graces to be worth a watch. I'd call it a nice mix of humour and horror.<br/><br/>7/10"

director: Andy muschietti
starring: James Macavoy,Jessica Chastain,Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd,Bill Hader,Isaiah Mustafa,Jay Ryan,James Ransone,Andy Bean,Teach Grant etc<br/><br/>overall rating 62/100<br/><br/>for 27 years the losers club have found new lives outside of Derry. But when Pennywise returns the gang must stay true to there blood oath to each other and try to defeat pennywise once and for all. It chapter 2 was unfortunately a big disappointment for me it had its good moments for sure but i was left feeling underwhelmed lets talk about this.<br/><br/>But first lets start off with some positives. The film had a much more tense tone,was more scary and had better executed jumpscares. This film did a better job at keeping you at the edge of your seat and executing many more jumpscares. This was due to pennywise and more monsters being involved so therefore there was more time to fit jumpscares and more scenes to drag out so you cant expect when the scare is going to happen. And in general i think the film was much more scary then the first. They went pure horror for this film and this part worked there was a lot more scary situations and creatures and pennywise was 100% more ruthless and scary then the first IT.<br/><br/>Adding on from the previous point about pennywise ( Bill Skarsgard) the film was a lot more gory. I loved this as it left more of a impact with a lot more scenes. To see the more ruthless and aggressive side to pennywise was done well here as it made him more feared as a character as he was fairly tame in the first film compared to this so i am glad they went all out for this. As it genuinely shocked me with the amount of people he killed.<br/><br/>However i know have to say that the film had very slow pacing in places. Unlike previous 3 hour films like avengers endgame which had enough plot to justify its run time IT chapter 2 did not. The film felt like 3 hours and really dragged in places. There was at least 30-45 minutes that could of been cut from the film to make it more of a well put together film. I just feel like they deliberately dragged scenes out that didn't need to in order to make the film as long as possible.<br/><br/>Next i think the film had much darker themes and had good LGBT representation. Now the film tackled homophobia in the most brutal but most appropriate way. Seeing how horribly they were treated is the harsh reality of what still happens in todays society which is really sad so i am glad they raised awareness of this. And also having children being eaten was a lot more shocking to see due to there innocence and film tackled sexuality and abuse very well as well.<br/><br/>Next i have to say that some of the use of flashbacks were badly done. I think the use of flashbacks was overused slightly leading to the pacing and narrative being slightly clunky. And the de aging on some of the kids looked terrible. Obviously its been 2 years since the first film and the actors probably look a lot different, But you could really tell especially with younger Ritchie that there face had been heavily edited and for me it was very distracting.<br/><br/>Next i thought the film had really creative set pieces and mise en scene but also good character arcs for the older versions of the losers club. Due to the films budget being double what the first one was they really went more creative with there set pieces and designs and got really creative with baloons and incorporated clowns into things you wouldn't think they would so props for creativity for sure. And also i loved how they took the time to explain the characters older counterparts and where they ended up and giving them good character arcs. The film went into good enough detail about what all of the losers have been doing the 27 years apart and all of there characters got good amount of screentime to explain there story through some good uses of flashbacks.<br/><br/>Next the film had a good amount of emotional weight and the acting from Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd was just fantastic. The film tackled mental health really well and to see stanley take his own life was admittedly difficult to watch. And to see Beverly in the same kind of abusive household was also upsetting to see. But the best part of the film would definitely be when Eddie sacrificed himself for Richie. There had been a teased romance between them both for a large majority of the film especially from Richies side. So to see Eddie sacrifice himself when he had previously been to scared to save anyone was a truly powerful and emotional part of the film. And next Bill skarsgÃ¥rd as expected was absolutely fantastic throughout the whole film. The fact that someone can pull off and execute such a disturbing and unsettling performance like he does is truly remarkable and he really should be rewarded with this kind of demanding role.<br/><br/>However i have to say the film was very confusing when it came to explain pennywises origin and backstory and also Henry Bowers was a terrible character. The film never went into enough detail about how pennywise came to be which was a massive shame so when it came to the actual ritual to try and defeat pennywise first of all i didn't know what was going on and second it didn't even work so it was a completely pointless build up to the final act. Next Henry Bowers was a terrible character. He went to prison and clearly went insane but when he escaped he just tried to kill all the losers for no apparant reason apart from a past grudge i think they just wasted his character.<br/><br/>Now for my final two positives first the film was absolutely hilarious. All the actors had great comedic chemistry with each other but i would have to say that Bill hader was absolutely hilarious. His one liners were hilarious the jokes he pulled on the other characters were brilliant, and he always found a way to find a situation funny. And next the overall cast for the older characters was literally perfect. Every single actor had the same characteristics and mannerisms as the younger versions they all even looked like them. And the best part was they all had the same chemistry as the kids had so this definitely kept the film going for sure.<br/><br/>However now for my final two negatives. I thought the film got very repetitive. They used mostly the same fears for all of the adult versions and the film just repeated itself the characters all went to a place from when they were kids had a flashback and then found there token this happened so many times it just all was the same. The film was just to similar to the first one which was a big shame as they had the potential to do something different as we saw with the fairground which was great. And finally the ending was terrible. Everything just got to ridiculous at the end. Pennywise turned into a giant spider which was a stupid idea and the way they killed him was just underwhelming and made him seem easily beatable. This was a really big shame as it left me feeling worse about the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Overall It chapter 2 is just about held together by its cast,acting,humour and set locations. But largely is a big disappointment and is far worse then the 1st film. They went for style over substance which further proves bigger is sometimes not better."

","The source material provides a good foundation for the story and building the characters, these are the things the movie does well, particularly in the first two thirds of the movie.
Unfortunately the director is incapable of showing any sort of restraint and the rest of of it is a loud, drawn out mess, absolutely saturated with terrible CGI that ruins any sort of atmosphere by taking the viewer out of the movie.
It's a real shame because the cast is very good but even they can't save it from the effects laiden garbage.<br/><br/>They took the 'not scary at all' door."
"maxemandeh","7","1","1","13 September 2019"," Quick thoughts
","The movie was great maybe not as much as the first one, and it was not even close to being as deep and real as the first one.<br/><br/>The cgi was great, but at times a bit overused.
Some of the grown up characters didn't feel like the same characters as in the first (Ben and Beverly), and some felt too underdeveloped from the first one (Richie).<br/><br/>But somehow, between all the jumpscares, i enjoyed every second of It. While it could have been shorter and it could have been more story driven, the jumpscares were fun, and much scarier than the first one.<br/><br/>Will you like it? maybe. It depends on if you want to watch a movie thats entertaining from a technical view with great cgi and wacky jumpscares or if you want a deep heartfelt sequel that tells the story in the most optimal way.<br/><br/>Personally I'm just happy to have these great characters in a new story, especially Pennywise."

Although all the scary scenes were pretty tame, violent but tame, I was surprised watching how many others jumped out of the corner of my eye.
The real treat of the film is Bill Skarsgard (I'm sure I butchered that spelling) as Pennywise but that also is my gripe, not enough of him. If ""It"" wasn't a single story Bill would be well on his way to be a new Freddy, Jason, Micheal Myers in a franchise."

"ztigr","6","1","1","12 September 2019"," Key flaw to what could have been much better
","I didn't hate this movie, and even kind of liked it. Side Note: I had never read the book but I can tell you the opening scene was based on a true incident that happened in Bangor Maine where Stephen King lives and where I grew up. I remember it quite well when it happened.<br/><br/>The key flaw to this movie is it relies too heavily on the audience transferring their understanding of the bond built in the first movie to the people playing the adult version of the kids in this movie. In most sequels your okay that they spend less time bond building because those relationships were already established in the prior flick. But these are adult actors who look only mildly like their child counterparts, and you don't really feel the connection that the movie presumes you do. To even further illustrate my point, a lot of the background to the relationships in this story is told in flashbacks to the kids.<br/><br/>So the actors are together for a scene in the first of the movie, and the only time they are all back together again is during the final battle. It just dulls your investment in the characters and thus the overall movie entirely."

"JDreviews101","5","1","1","10 September 2019"," The real evil clown is screenwriter Gary Dauberman, not Pennywise.
","With the movie already having almost a thousand user reviews on IMDb I guess not many people are going to read this, but nonetheless here we go. After liking It (2017) very much I had high expectations for this movie, especially since the official cast was revealed.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two starts well for the most part, but as the movie unfolds you soon start to realize that some of the adult characters are pretty much the same as their younger selves, and it seems that they haven't matured at all in 27 years. I understand that the adult characters had to be 'recognizable' for the audience to re-establish the emotional link we had with the kids from the previous film, but you really CANNOT write a kids dialogue intended for adult characters that are supposed to be grown-up and mature human beings.<br/><br/>The screenplay of the first film, written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga & Gary Dauberman, worked very well because of these two main reasons: 1) the lines of dialogue were INTENDED for kids and 2) because Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman did the least amount of writing on it. I don't know what happened that Chase Palmer and Cary Fukunaga were not brought back together to work on the screenplay for It Chapter Two, and letting Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman take the wheel on his own is probably one of the worst decisions Warner Bros has ever made. Because of his sloppy, careless and lame writing It Chapter Two suffers tonal inconsistencies and misplaced humor throughout most of the film, and it is definitely not Andy Muschietti's fault as I'm sure as a director he did his best to keep the script's tonal mess at a minimum.<br/><br/>The actors did pretty well with the material they were given, but for me the standouts were definitely Jessica Chastain as Beverly, Jay Ryan as Ben and Andy Bean as Stanley (although his presence was fleeting). Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd was once again great as Pennywise although, because of the dumb dialogue by Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman, at times it sounded like a completely different character. In addition, Teach Grant was surprisingly good as an adult Henry Bowers. The kids were all fantastic once again. On the other hand, we all know that James McAvoy is a great actor, but he really needed to work on his North American English accent a bit more here, as in some instances you can hear his Scottish accent creeping in. Unfortunately, I have to say that Isaiah Mustafa, Bill Hader and James Ransone delivered the weakest performances of the movie. I can't understand how you can give dramatic crying scenes (exactly four of them) to a comedic actor that has stated before in interviews that cannot cry in front of a camera.<br/><br/>The overuse of CGI was annoying at times, and that was one of my main complaints with the previous film as well. Cinematography, editing, sound and music were all great. Benjamin Wallfisch crafted a truly beautiful score for both movies, and definitely elevated some of the scenes by making them more emotionally powerful, especially in the first film.<br/><br/>All in all I was disappointed with It Chapter Two, and it was mostly due to the sloppy and careless writing of Gary 'evil clown' Dauberman."
"Crookshanks394","5","1","1","10 September 2019"," ""Inspired"" by the book. The turtle couldn't help us anyway.
","Do not go into this film thinking it'll be like the book. The director took a whole lot of liberties with this film. About 20 minutes into it this movie jumped off the rails and began swinging wild. However the actors done an amazing job with the script. As the book fan I am highly dissatisfied with the movie. I will not post any spoilers but when *that* storyline showed up there was a collective groan in the theater. If you have not read the book I am thinking you will enjoy the movie. Be prepared though it's almost 3hrs long. There's a lot of scenes that could have been cut out and still leave plenty in the movie. There are a few Jump scares, not to bad though. There are also funny parts too. (Those little scenes were cute and funny. There were laughs in the theater) At the end of the day though go watch the movie and decide for yourself if you think it's good or bad or boring. I rated it a 5 simply because I couldn't get past the extreme differences the movie and book have. The actors were awesome and the film had a nice ""color"" so to speak to it."
"patphonic","5","1","1","10 September 2019"," Flawed, but entertaining
","It Chapter 2 as most fans already know isn't as good as Chapter 1, this is true for the book and the original TV movie. But that's not the issue with this iteration of Stephen Kings novel. Its that Studios should have learned by now that CGI effects in horror movies, don't work! When the monster or the gore scenes are digitally rendered effects that are interacting with a live human, it looks like space jam, in other words CGI is not a good alternative to practical effects in horror. Ch 2 uses them excessively as well, it completely took me out of the movie, very disappointing."

"locuroso","5","1","1","10 September 2019"," Way too long and drawn out
","This movie was way to long and drawn out. This could have been a 1.5 hour movie and it would have been fine. The ending was painfully drawn out so long that I lost interest 10 minutes in. The special effects weren't even that great. They added too much humor for a horror film. I was very disappointed in this film."
"seige-hound","7","1","1","10 September 2019"," Nowhere near as good as the first, but still has a lot of good stuff
","Probably the best and most horrific moment in this movie is the opening, where the gay couple gets brutally attacked, one of them being thrown over a bridge into the river only to be eaten by Pennywise. That scene is horrifying and great, and the closest we get in this film to the Georgie scene from the first film.<br/><br/>After that great opener, the film doesn't seem to know what to do.<br/><br/>I haven't read much of the book, but from what I've heard, the Adult scenes in the book are not the main focus of the story, and the child sequences are given a lot more development. Which makes sense, as the story is about overcoming childhood trauma and how trauma impacts you years after you grew up. However, when the films were originally pitched where the first film is about the kids, and the second film is about the adults coming back, I think the screenwriters weren't quite prepared for how much of an undertaking that would be.<br/><br/>The movie rushes through the intro scenes where we see where the adult Loser's Club ends up, seemingly in a rush to get them all back to Derry and have more Pennywise shenanigans, but when they all get there, the film turns into a fetch quest, where each of them has to retrieve an object from their past to sacrifice in a 'Ritual of Chud' in order to defeat IT once and for all. This fetch quest takes up most of the almost 3 hour movie, before a 1/2 hour climax in the sewers.<br/><br/>During each character's mini adventure, it cuts between a previously unseen scene from their childhood (ie, a newly filmed scene with the kid actors between their breakup and reunification to save Beverley) and a scene with the adult versions coming across a similar scare. These scenes range in quality, my personal favourite being Beverley's scene that was mostly shown in the teaser trailer a few months back. Save for the ending where the creepy grandma turns into a CGI monster that isn't scary at all. Bill's mini adventure is also decent, and the longest, as he meets a young boy who reminds him of Georgie, and attempts to save him from Pennywise. The other scenes are either okay or completely forgettable.<br/><br/>Speaking of forgettable, the bully Henry Bowers, who kills his dad and attempts to kill the Losers in the first film, comes back after breaking out of a mental asylum. I thought he would be a bigger secondary antagonist then he ended up being, because after stabbing a couple of people in non-fatal areas, he ends up dying rather quickly after being introduced. A wasted opportunity for sure, not to mention why Pennywise needed his help in the first place? Who knows.<br/><br/>Finally, the climax, where Pennywise reveals its true form. In the book, It's described as a giant spider, which the original 1990's miniseries attempted to do with mixed results. For some reason, though, the film instead made Pennywise's true form a Spider-centaur, where IT still looks like a clown on the top half, but has long spider legs on his body. I guess they wanted to keep Bill Skarsgard's great performance as IT and not overshadow him with a CGI spider, but again, it's a missed opportunity to just go crazy with a really fun design for ITs final form.<br/><br/>Overall, this film has several missed opportunities, but there are definitely things that are worth praising. The casting of the adult versions of the kid characters was incredible. All of them look great and act the roles well. The acting overall was incredible, and if casting directors could get Academy Awards, they would get all of them for this film. There were still quite a good few horror moments, and a few good laughs.<br/><br/>As good as the first? Not at all, but a good bit of fun in the cinema? absolutely."
"ngmb","3","1","1","10 September 2019"," This movie trash
","I've never taken the time to review a film on IMDb before but I needed somewhere to vent about the almost 3 hours of my life I'm not going to get back.<br/><br/>Let's start with that, the length. This movie is longer than all The Hobbit films, and just about the length of the first two lord of the rings films, and it had no right or reason to be. There were so many subplots, and characters who's inclusion was clearly for no reason other than ""it happened in the book"". Dude, it's a film ADAPTATION, cutting the little sideplots that have no real relevance to the main characters or story is part of your job in adapting the book. Perhaps if you were doing a longform tv show adaptation, you could get away with it, but not here. Furthermore, the film spends an unreasonable amount of time showing us flashbacks of stuff we've already seen, or reexplaining plot we already know from the first chapter. To add to this, there are several ""scary"" scenes that felt entirely secondary to the main story, but seem to have only been left in because there hasn't been a scare in a while or because the movie needed more Pennywise, and that leads me to my next point...<br/><br/>The movie isn't scary. It isn't creepy, it isn't tense, it's rarely even horrifying because of how predictable it ends up. The scares are all comprised of the consistently most formulaic jump scares I've ever scene, or big huge monsters crafted with poor CGI, that removes the rare shred of tension and believability the scenes had left.<br/><br/>Finally, let's get to the Loser's club. Yes, the casting was great, and yes the performances were decent. Good job CD and actors, you're probably the sole reason I'm giving this thing any stars. That being said, I still didn't really care about any of these characters. The movie's success is hinged on the relationships of these characters, as that's what takes up the majority of what's left of the runtime when you take out the subplots. Unfortunately, it fails to be compelling because aside from a brief reintroduction to the characters and where they ended up (the most enjoyable part of the film), the movie doesn't tell us anything about these people we don't already know. Perhaps this was the reasoning behind the added flashbacks (with terrible de-aging on Finn Wolfhard that rivals Superman's Justice League moustache), but yet again, these scenes did very little to advance the characters in any way from what we already knew of them.<br/><br/>I didn't have high expectations for this movie (I thought the first was a fun little movie, but nothing special) however it still managed to disappoint me in almost every regard. Do yourself a favour and go watch The Shining again instead."
"mightyblargh","5","1","1","10 September 2019"," A poor ending for the great Chapter 1
","First chapter was pretty good. There was good simple and efficient scares not too much CGI but with chapter two they put CGI all over the scary part which simply made them not scary at all... Also I must mentionned the overuse of humor in this chapter versus the first one especially in the more serious scene which totally kills the horror mood... This ain't a comedy... Unfortunately bad choices were made by Muschietti in the second chapter and now even the first movie will have a bitter taste knowing the sequel is that bad... Very disappointed"
"educallejero","5","1","1","10 September 2019"," Well done, visually pleasing mediocrity
","2 movies and more than 5 hours in, I still don't know Pennywise powers (what can and can't he do), the extent of them (limits), what he wants, what he needs, etc. That's a big problem, because while the actors were mostly incredible (with the exception of Jessica Chastain that was fine, but doesn't really look like the same Beverly Sophia Lillis was playing), and the story that was told between the scary sequences was sweet and kind of great, the truth is these ""IT"" remakes focus so much on the scary sequences that there is just not time to develop every character's arc. Because there is not time, the movie moves at an insane pace with a very repetitive mold. Literally every single character starts the ""development"" in the same way and we see them deal with it one after the other. All this with flashbacks of every character that didn't add anything new to what the first movie showed.<br/><br/>Like I say, after boring and repetitive stretches, we end up in the third act where insanity follows (that's a book problem, but the movie didn't solve it) and things just happens and the movie ends. The arcs are all resolved, but again, in such mechanical way that every emotion is dried up by the time it appears on screen. They forced the kids on this movie because we loved them, but they could've used all those minutes to explain better Pennywise (if that's even possible) and develop a more coherent story and a better flow through the plot."
"tdrish","6","1","1","9 September 2019"," Nails. And fails.
","I don't think the standards are any higher for It Chapter Two then the 2017 film. Acting was great. That's about the only good thing I can say about what I saw. Too much reliance on CGI, which is obviously never coming to an end, however, growing up with many films that used much more creative effects, its something I will never adapt to. Stop referencing to movies like The Shining or The Thing, when films like that are at a higher standard then your reliance on CGI, do I make myself clear, filmmakers? Come up with your own agenda, or get lost! It Chapter Two opens up with a hate crime. From there, we establish nothing except that ITS BACK! We unite the Losers Club from the previous film, fast forward 27 years. ( So its the year 2016, did I do the math right?) They're not kids anymore, but still just as afraid as yesterday. Mike knew, and is ready with a fountain of knowledge on how to destroy IT once and for all. They go separate ways, so that they can find artifacts from their childhood to use as a sacrifice to the Ritual Of Chud, which is the only way to destroy the killer clown. Problems arise when each one of them is re-terrorized in excruciating but non lethal ways. With the exception of Adrain Melon and a blink and you miss it shot of a child getting torn apart, IT Chapter Two remains completely bloodless for the first half of the film. (Sighs) We came to see horror, did we not? What's more horrifying then a killer clown from space? How about we discuss the book for a change, is everyone cool with that? If you've read the book, you know that Tom, Beverlys husband, gets his butt brutally and violently handed to him, but the director choose to go the cheap route...I almost preferred the way it was handled in the mini series, at least then, I didn't have any high expectations then the expectations I expected to see in an R rated movie. The film does have a few surprises, and I say a few, because, well, those surprises are gift wrapped and bow tied with the wonderful help of CGI, otherwise they would have been BIG surprises. Have little expectations from IT Chapter Two, and it probably won't disappoint you. My main problem with the film comes with the ending, I am NOT happy with who delivers the final blow to IT ( Hint: It's not the one from the book. Which sucks, because this was suppose to be a vendetta against IT, not just destroying it.) I didn't feel they were creative enough with IT Chapter Two, maybe they should have spent more then five months on the project. Bottom line, IT nails. And fails. Ties certain elements from the first film in here, but leaves other ties hanging. Pennywise The Clown? Not as energetic as the original, not near as entertaining, and less creative. Even the clown head with spider legs just looked plain silly then scary. I have many beefs with IT Chapter Two, but I will applaud them on their flying colors....whatever they may be. I'm giving this piece six out of ten stars."

Not that its totally garbage, there are still good scenes and moments...but the characters have forgotten whats happened and have to spend time re-learning things we already know, and because of that it felt a bit long. And the only really character who is really built upon is Richie. And Bill Hader really shines and mostly steals the show. The whole cast is good and James McAvoy has a particulary heartbreaking scene where he's begging Pennywise to take him instead, but I think you feel more for Richie in this movie. And so I really liked those aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Another negative, is that I didnt find it that particulary scary. The CGI was a bit overused and looked pretty fake at times. Again Bill, is really great in this role and I wished they just relied more on him and his talent because he can be genuinely creepy.<br/><br/>But I still didnt hate the film. I didnt find the first one that scary either but really enjoyed the kids and how it felt like a coming of age story, and again...I liked the cast and I loved the concepts of them standing up to their fears and letting go. Thats where all the interesting stuff is."
"dodds-j","7","1","1","9 September 2019"," Great cast and story, but could be scarier
","Let's start with the positive. The cast was great. Jessica Chastain of course was fantastic. The movie was probably a bit long, but overall the story telling was good. The only thing that was disappointing in this movie, was that it really wasn't that scary. I think maybe there was too much in the trailers and therefore I knew what was coming for lost parts. But yeah, I wasn't exactly covering my eyes in fear."
"aaronmoon-00086","6","1","1","9 September 2019"," Solid performances, a fitting end.
","I went into this movie very scared that I would be disappointed, but overall, thankfully, I wasn't. I would say that this films strongest aspect was the excellent choice in cast. Actors were outstanding, and did an excellent job in mirroring their child counterparts. The comedic exchange of dialogue between these characters had me laughing pretty hard throughout the entire film, which ironically also causes issues with this film.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that this film is particularly scary. For the most part, it relies on a repetitive use of very predictable jump-scares and disgust to try and scare its audience. There isn't a lot of suspense or build-up to these scares either, they just kinda throw it at you. I actually probably laughed at them more than I cowered from them, which brings me to another issue.<br/><br/>This film has some pretty heavy tone issues. There is a lot of comedy in this film, and there are times when said comedy definitely ruins what could have been a decent scare. Not to say that this is a bad thing, but it kept me in a state of comfort. When I watch a horror movie, I want to be horrified. However, this films use of comedy was much more effective than its use of horror.<br/><br/>The next thing is that the pacing could have been done much better. The film definitely did not need to be as long as it was, as many scenes just go on for way too long. There are several scenes that could have been much shorter. You could probably comfortably fit this version of the story into 2 hours.<br/><br/>In short, despite a few issues, I'm satisfied with this movie. Though they can't very well fit the entirety of Kings novel into one movie, I think that what we have here does the book justice. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, and despite that, I still enjoyed it."
"mukul1904","5","1","1","9 September 2019"," 170 minutes long movie, filled with bunch of supposed to be scary hallucinations
","IT Chapter 2 was in my top 5 most anticipated movies of 2019 list. I guess it's impossible for movies nowadays to live up to the expectations unless their thinking mind includes Kevin Feige.<br/><br/>I would have liked this movie a lot more, if it was 30-40 minutes shorter. I get it though, that team behind this movie wants to keep as much as possible from the book, but movie is just too long for audience keep the interest alive for already weakly built characters. I went into the movie without knowing the runtime, so after 2 hours I realised movie is still not close to ending, I opened my IMDB app and checked out the runtime for ""it"" (no pun intended), and it was 2 hours and 49 minutes. And it's not like a lot of different things happens in movie, most of the time, kids or adults are alone somewhere and then they start see some crazy monster which scares and then they run away.<br/><br/>The movie is clearly divided into 3 acts, even Mike spells it out for us during the last act, first where group re-unites, second where they split up and third where they reunite, again, to kill the Pennywise. And seriously I've no idea what that second act was. Like finding artefacts, which were random items from their childhood, seriously I mean how they even knew what was their artefact. I actually loved how the movie started, they give little bit of arc to each adult character and then when they meet supposedly for the first time in 27 years, chemistry was there. And credit goes to these amazing actors. They really were the MVPs of this movie. Sadly, movie just becomes weaker and weaker after that and during the last half an hour, I literally closed my eyes and waited for movie to end. And those last 10 minutes, where they were monologuing in slow motion felt like longest time of my life.<br/><br/>I know I'm being harsh, but that's how it felt. Though movie has its plus too. The cast is really fantastic. Special effects (and there are many of those) are really done well. One scary scene really got me where Beverly went to her old home (if you've seen the movie, you know which one I'm talking about). There are many jump scares too.<br/><br/>Overall this movie didn't live up to my expectations and that's mostly because of pacing and runtime."
"treebarfolbar","5","1","1","9 September 2019"," It has an identity crisis.
","I found a lot of the movie strange. It didn't seem like it took itself too seriously but at the same time is trying to be a serious film. It'll have something scary happen but then immediately have some funny line said afterwards. Though there's also parts where it's actually serious and I couldn't stop laughing. For instance when adult Billy is drowning the zombified Georgie and Georgie is still trying to say ""You lied and I died"" so it just comes out as a bunch of bubbles. Once again, like the 2017 It, the actor for Pennywise takes himself way too seriously. The final fight with him also dragged on, but most of the movie did. I don't regret watching it since I did have a fun time with it, but probably won't go back to it."
"sarahwood-64752","6","1","1","7 September 2019"," IT had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
","I set my expectations very low for this film. I was very disappointed in part one as I disliked the CGI heavy scenes which caused pennywise to lose any personality that Skarsgard attempted to bring to the character. However, the first half of part two is exceptional. The opening scene with Adrian Mellon is gruesome, horrifying and straight out of the book. I wish Andy would've allowed more time for us to be reintroduced to the ""Losers"" as adults but I was okay with the short clips we got of them. Stan's death was painful and I did look away from the screen. The Chinese restaurant scene is perfect- the cast played off of each other, I loved the humor in it and I loved what they chose to do with the fortune cookies. I appreciated that the Ritual of Chud being introduced to Bill by Mike. One of my favorite parts was Henry Bowers seeing the balloon outside of the psych hospital, great re-introduction to him. I did not enjoy the dead Patrick scene- a dead boy underneath a crazy mans bed is scary enough, it wasn't necessary to CGI him to hell.<br/><br/>The best pennywise moment in my opinion was with the little girl with the port-wine stain underneath the bleachers. It was creepy and the CGI was at a minimum, I loved seeing Bill show a little personality. The movie took a total turn for me during the Mrs. Kersh scene. It was a great lead up, her peaking around the corners at Bev was very unsettling- and then, the worst CGI'd saggy, gray old lady pops out. I busted out laughing in the middle of the theater. After that scene, the movie lost it for me. I was so beyond  because so many reviewers were saying ""The Bev and Mrs. Kersh scene is terrifying""... I guess we weren't watching the same movie. Granted, this is all subjective but that was probably one of the dumbest scenes I have seen in modern horror.<br/><br/>The ending was, okay. I did think that Mike was gonna raise baby pennywise as his own instead of ripping his heart out, but whatever. The biggest issue is the jump scares and the forces horror. Things can be scary without CGI, I wish Andy Mushietti would've realized that."
"mike-snare","5","1","1","6 September 2019"," A very mixed bag
","Oh, was I looking forward to that second part!
Now that I've seen it - it just fell short for me.
Here are my main issues:<br/><br/># PACING/NARRATIVE CHOICES
Yes, ""IT"" surely isn't a thin book - so in his screen adapdation, Muschietti was challenged to decide upon which scenes to show/exclude. But even with a running time of almost 3h, there are sections of the movie that feel rushed, while others drag along painfully.
The first part of the movie dealing with the Losers Club getting back to Derry is told in a lackluster, schematic way - the same narrative issue when everyone has to find
their artifact. This doesn't feel lively but constructed and predictable.
Having visited their old den in the woods, the movie ramps up its speed, feeling increasingly overpaced and underdeveloped....
Maybe that's only me, but I hate it when movies forget about basic human needs like sleeping, eating or the occassional visit to the bathroom.
Sadly, ""IT Chapter Two"" is one of them.<br/><br/># Visual choices & CGI:
The depiction of Pennywise in Chapter 2 was partly a disappointment. Why sacrifce the scaryiness of his shadowy clown by dragging him into broad daylight?
Moreover, ""IT Chapter Two"" relies too heavily on CGI - there's just too much of it - and unfortunately, it's the sort of CGI that strives to show us everything in bold detail. It's feels like visual fast food, leaving nothing to the viewer's imagination. However, this is why we loved the book - once it was all in our minds.<br/><br/>Despite good acting and some creepy scenes, I wasn't sold on ""IT Chapter Two""...."

I felt absolutely nothing for the group of kids and later adults, looks like the actors were picked out of a hat no connection whatsoever between them no chemistry no nothing. Just a bunch of random people reading lines from a book to each other. Any more stiffer than that and their back ends would need CGI too.<br/><br/>I thought Stephen King was super outdated. I thought Stephen King movies had great acting and terrible CGI. Not the other way around.<br/><br/>Maybe sell the rights to Disney and have Luke Skywalker do a lightsaber battle with Pennywise and a bunch of Jedi turtles in the movie to sell toys at Walmart.

","It Chapter Two is lacking. Many cliche here for an audience here: Gay couple which gets beat up by town toughs.

( there is always some ancient ritual. How and why it works is never explained) Well It Chapter Two becomes a formulated movie, which turns into story about childhood PTSD, and bad dreams. Every past memory must have the chasing dream sequence. Yet another cliche, which turns into another C G I fest. We never find out what, why of the clown, and or the history behind it. The remake is different from the book and other movies. The end is like a therapy session of shrinking down bad feelings and memories. Nothing about the clown, and more about the characters growing up and past. The first movie was what the second was not. Maybe the joke about not knowing how to finish a story is a joke about the movie. Maybe the break between part one and two made the story lacking. Well 3 stars there is something just lacking."

","Having just watched both films back to back I feel the grown ups were completely outshone by the kids.
The casting was pretty spot on with most of the adult actors having remarkable resemblances to the child actors but I couldn't say I felt any connection with them as adults as when they were children. Flashback scenes saw the youngsters had all shot up a good 2ft, a splash of cgi and some terrible dubbing to make the boys sound like their previously unbroken voices left me cringing.
I was hoping for a little more from Pennywise and for him to really go for it with the scares but various manifestations received more giggles than screams.
All this just seemed to take away the credibility from chapter one.
And the plan to defeat Pennywise was something cooked up in 100 other 80's horror flicks complete with ancient Indian burial ground.
Very much not worth the 2 year wait. Both films perhaps should have been made all in one swoop to keep the momentum going."

","Short Review: With a brutal opening scene that sets the tone for ghastly events to follow, It: Chapter Two delivers more of Pennywise minus the conventional scares. To summarize, the Losers Club reunites to deal with the Pennywise problem 27 years later. What made the first part of It so frequently entertaining was the chemistry shared between the wily, high-energy kids that the Losers Club comprised.<br/><br/>While their older counterparts boast more screen-famous names such as James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, and more, their camaraderie lacks the spontaneous spunk of their younger versions. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd makes a triumphant return as Pennywise the clown and leaves the most opaque mark in the two-part series. What stretches It Chapter Two is writer Gary Dauberman's and director Andy Muschietti's attempt to stay faithful to Stephen King's novel to a great extent. As such, it renders each (surviving) member of the Losers Club with an 'individual episode of horror', most of which work only in parts.
While the budget is a lot more lavish this time around (and that's reflected in the sets, costumes, and visual effects), director Muschietti replaces the more authentic, unexpected scares of the first with frequent, super-loud, in-your-face scares that you can see coming a mile away. This makes It Chapter Two more of a horror-actioner and less of an atmospheric horror-drama.
Also, the climax didn't do me any good. Compared to the elaborate episodes that each member of the Losers Club experiences, it fell extremely short of what one would imagine needs to be done to overthrow a morbid menace such as Pennywise.<br/><br/>It would have also made more sense to cut down on these fast-paced jumpscares to give viewers some extra context on The Ritual of ChÃ¼d and its true effects. With a run-time of close to 3 hours, you're bound to feel some butt-numbing effects instead. After a first chapter that turned out to be a pleasant surprise, I thought It Chapter Two (with raised stakes) barely managed to deliver. Yet, it just might be the true-blue summer blockbuster of 2019."

One of the biggest problems with this movie is the same as in the part one, and it's pennywise the clown. He is like a walking cgi, and a bad one i would say. Most of the time he would appear on screan, and the audience would just laugh. There is literally a scene where he looks like a snapchat dog filter, and thats the part where i gave up on him. Not to mention those stupid dance moves of him, where you guest it they used cgi again. If you want a real horror experience watch Tim Currys version of pennywise, they cant compare on any level. The other thing im disappointed in is the thing they went for the jumpscares and not the atmosphere, but thats the problem of all ""new era"" horror movies. For me the 1990 version is far better, and they had like a far lower budget which is saying something about this movie."
"vlevensonnd-87248","4","3","6","8 September 2019"," A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
","We were all geared up to see this movie, and we saw it this afternoon. We had seen the first part of the remake 2 years ago, and even though there were certain aspects that were far better than the original, the bulk of it was not as good. We still vowed that we were going to see part 2 when it came out. We both thought that the humor was way too forced, and the jokes we're really not funny. There's too much over acting with certain characters, and not enough emotion and/or fear expressed realistically with other characters. There were creatures that were added into the film was like watching a 60s or early 70s horror movie. It looks like something that Sam Raimi would do - if you see it, you'll know what I mean. The movie really dragged on a number of occasions that really didn't have much content, and that left us wondering why on Earth they were not edited or shortened, because the last thing you want to do is put your viewers to sleep. I could not believe it, but I nodded off 3 times!! In the first section of the movie the vulgarities we're so extensive and there was no point to it. It was vulgar for the sake of being vulgar. There is little innocence in these children which we both found disturbing in both part 1 and 2. I found the battle at the end to be better in this one then in the original, however, after the battle the movie dragged on again, and I was glad to get up and leave. It was a really good size audience but it was just some of the kids that laughed just a few times more than we did. Everyone was pretty silent in leaving the theater. It's such a pity when such an anticipated movie comes out and it turns out to be so disappointing. The actors were good but it was a waste of talent."

It had legitimate scares and the acting is pretty good for the most part, especially Bill Hader as Richie Tozier. But the film went on for too long, it relied too heavily on cliches, it took itself too seriously when it was discussing the lore, it makes half an effort to follow certain things from the book (as in it will show something from the book but not follow through with it entirely), and generally I viewed it as unfocused. Were there still things to enjoy? Yes. Just not enough to fully recommend it."

","The best thing about it was the casting, as if they wated 27 years for the kids to grow up. other than that it was disappointing, has some good comedy in it. was more of a comedy movie than a horror/ thriller."

Bill Hader was the absolute star of the show. i would watch Jessica Chastain read the phone book. the actor who played Ben was so bland i cannot remember his face.

"zorba-36271","7","3","6","7 September 2019"," Almost...
","Should have had more Pennywise. He's the ""E"" ticket of the movie. Somewhat disjointed flow. Too much relying on jump scares as opposed to building tension. This is a lazy film trick used as a crutch used in most every modern day horror movie. If they cut 30-40 minutes from the almost 3 hour running time and tightened the narrative it would have been a 10. It's longer than The Godfather. There is a tad bit of meandering in the second act of the movie. That could have been easily cut. The final act seemed very rushed. Like they realized the movie was going to be over 3 hours and they just pulled the plug. I may enjoy it more the more I see it but I have a few reservations."
"thegamerzoneofficial","6","3","6","6 September 2019"," Entertaining, Not What It Should Be
","First of all, this review is written by a 16 year old who went to this movie with friends for some scares and laughs. Now I did see chapter one and I've read the books, although I knew that this wouldn't be anything close to it. I don't have a problem with the movie differing from the book honestly...
I have never laughed as much as when I saw this movie. I went to the cinema on the day that it was released with some friends. Now the start is quite interesting and immediately sets the mood for the rest of the movie. It starts off with a cruel kill which was good.
The story itself was alright in my opinion. I've seen plenty of people who were convinced that the movie was way too long, it didn't bother me during the movie though. It did at the end of the movie.
The CGI was hilarious in this movie because it was terrible. The character Pennywise is always entertaining to see, also because of the amazing performances of Skargaard. He once again was amazing. However, when one of the losers would get into a 'chase/fight', the cgi looks ridiculous. It's unrealistic, ugly and most of all: funny.
That's where the movie goes wrong. It sets an atmosphere for a grim story but it instead takes a turn into comedy lane. The intended jokes were quite good in my opinion and really funny, but when a cgi creature would come on screen the entirety of the cinema would laugh. The cgi ruined the atmosphere of the movie.
The last thing I'd like to say is that I'm everything but satisfied with the ending. It was terrible in my opinion. That's all I can say without spoiling.<br/><br/>Overall I think the movie was a bit too 'Hollywood-ish' , but very funny and entertaining. Jump scares were great in my opinion, the casting was a 10/10, the story just was a bit too Hollywood and not nearly as good as the original.
It wasn't worth 3 hours of my time in the end, But the incredible performance of the actors made it okay."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","3","6","6 September 2019"," Very good sequel
","Not as good as the original but still a very good conclusion of the Stephan King story.
The ""Loser Club"" now all grown up returns to Derry to face once again the deadly clown.
What worked so well in the first one was the bonding of the teens, the coming of age factor and the throw back to the late 80s. Here there is not much left of that, you are rather faced with a lot of troubled adults without much of a perspective. There is still fine character development but in this sequel the gore factor was surely more in the focus.
Acting wise it was good and the adult versions of the kids were wisely chosen. Jessica Chastain was quite good, though I hoped her role would have been a bit more interesting. James McAvoy had the most complex character and worked him very well. Bill Hader was also good and worth to mention. Bill Skarsgard was once again frighteningly convincing as Pennywise. It was nice to have some flashback sequences with the kids to reveal some secrets that we did not have in the first part of the film.
There was some really great editing involved and generally an excellent atmosphere provided. The ending was great and touching in a way.
Generally both films are among the best King adaptations out there."
"stuartpbottomley","4","3","6","6 September 2019"," Plodding sequel that take too long to get no where
","Not a patch on chapter 1 but still better than the tv adaptation. It's main problem is it's about an hour too long. It also suffers from the familiarity of the scares from the first film, you know what's coming so it doesn't scare. It spends too long on certain characters journeys to the conclusion and not enough on others. It teases back stories that don't lead anywhere."
"rgkarim","8","3","6","6 September 2019"," Floating Through Nearly 3 Hours with Decent Story and Fantastic Acting
","Two years ago, the relaunch of yet another series started, taking modern day technology and using it to put a new face on it. Stephen King's legendary book titled IT came back in a new light that felt like a Stranger Things Episode with a little more demented/horror element added to it. When the ending came and the credits finished, the promise of part 2 lingered in red, setting the stage for the second act of the book. Two years later, the adventure arrives and the question is... will the movie live up to the potential or are we waiting for nothing. Robbie K coming in for another review of the latest film to hit the theater, hoping to give you some spoiler free insight on the film. So let's get set as we look into:<br/><br/>Movie: It: Chapter 2<br/><br/>Director:
Andy Muschietti
Writers:
Gary Dauberman (screenplay by), Stephen King (based on the novel by)
Stars:
Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader<br/><br/>LIKES:<br/><br/>The Story Components
The Terrifying Forms
Decent Pace
Creep Factor
References
Acting<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Not Scary For Me

The Length Of The Film
The Stepped-Up Game
The Over Use of Cursing at Times
The Assistant<br/><br/>SUMMARY:
The genius of the film is that although a sequel it's also a stand-alone film that manages to take the tale in a new light. Chapter 2, at least this version, manages to make a multilayered story that holds part horror and part soul searching as our characters developed. In a decently compact way, It 2 accomplishes the task of bridging the 27-year gap and keeping to the horror element all why pushing some heavy political issues and moral tasking topics in a classy way. Not just a drama, the horror element still stands true in this film and Pennywise's new tactics are a step up in the form of nightmare motivating images that will stay in minds for a long time. Not the most realistic at times, IT's new forms for the most part have enough skin tingling factor to them to make some squirm in their seats, especially given how they made Pennywise a much bigger threat than I anticipated. A small subtle component that I quite enjoy are the small references to the book or popular phrases about the book. It's nice balanced humor and a clever ploy to sort of justify the decisions made in this film in regards to changing the story, which gets a nod of respect from this reviewer. Hands down though, the best part is acting, which I can go on for hours about. All the adult forms mirror the kids in many qualms, take the baseline characteristics and maximize them, and play off of each other so well that I can't help but praise the casting direction. As for the clown himself, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd again redeems his role as Pennywise and takes the nightmare amalgam worthy as a legendary villain. He manages to add new levels of creepiness without trying too hard, achieving that skin crawling factor to new levels.<br/><br/>In regards of areas that are still working on improving for me, well the film did not quite scare me like I was hoping. Again, I'm used to much of the scare tactics, but It Chapter 2's use of computer effects and other designs did not quite scare me as much as disturb me at times (that scene at the Chinese restaurant). In addition the stepped-up game of Pennywise sometimes crossed levels that I wasn't a fan of, primarily in some of the more torturous aspects that this film took. Those that have a low tolerance for dragged out beatings or torture may want to avert their eyes at these points. In regards to the plot much of the overall arc is wonderful, but the presentation at times comes off a little more convoluted than I had hoped. During the middle of the film the constant intertwining of past and present did not quite make sense to me, until the end when the explanation came. Not that it was not entertaining at times, I felt this approach sort of added fluff to the movie, almost as this was a director's cut. This brings me to the length of the film, while certainly not the slowest movie (Midsommar anyone), the nearly three hour run time did not quite feel necessary given that the first part was nearly an hour shorter. Again it is entertaining for the most part, but it's a commitment I don't think was quite needed. A small nuance again for most, the cursing sometimes goes down the avenues of being lazy writing, primarily in the overuse of the F bomb when there were better lines that the first film capitalized on. My biggest beef is the assistant to the mad clown, to which I don't want to ruin. A concept that starts to hold potential, the assistant is a wasted character in my eyes that serves for only a little bit of plot development and a few comedy moments. So much could have been done with this character, but I think the squad found this character the one to cut out most of in favor of the other focus points of the film.<br/><br/>The VERDICT:
Wrapping this up, two years gave the movie enough time to make a horror movie that is familiar, yet has enough flair to be its own. Sticking to horror roots, the movie focuses on the story and does a nice job integrating most characters into the film. It may not be scary to me, but Pennywise is still creepy and has upped his danger level with new forms and references that should have fans smiling. Yet it's the acting that holds the key to success and brings the movie to levels that are super entertaining and deep compared to most horror genre casts. Still, the movie is a little long winded, with a convoluted presentation at times that adds a little length, and a character that felt like a waste. Otherwise, a semi-cheesy ending and some darker tactics are the only things that really didn't impress me. The summary though is that this film is definitely a worthy edition to the horror genre, and I believe it's worth checking out in theaters. My scores are:<br/><br/>Horror: 8.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"

","A terrifying, beautifully shot fantasy-horror - great pacing and acting all around, particularly from SkarsgÃ¥rd, McAvoy, Hader and Isaiah. Pennywise as an antagonist is fully realized in this film, murdering and devouring people and even children on-screen with just the same intensity as the first. The Loser's Club as adults were perfect, with each resembling their younger versions to a T and each expanding in terms of development and emotional resonance.

"Robosharp","4","3","7","8 September 2019"," Shhhh IT Chapter 2
","SIGH from me.<br/><br/>If Im gonna be honest, my hopes weren't high. I liked elements of the first film, but thought overall it was flawed. So did I go into this one with negative eyes, perhaps, but I really did give it a clean slate, hoping that it would better its predecessor. Was it? Nope. It was way worse.<br/><br/>This one doesn't even start well for me. Zero suspense for Pennywise's return. No story for the adult loser club members re the realisation that IT has returned. No pace or suspense at all, this one goes at comic book pace, which is particular disengaging given that the film is an unjustifiable 3 hours long!<br/><br/>It is literally 3 hours of OTT, CGI sequences, with wholly unscary IT ghosts and monsters, that just like the first film, stalk the loser club, and again, just like the first, Pennywise never kills them, even though he could easily.
Mr King, why is that? Why can Pennywise only kill the b characters? Why does he always wait for the loser club to find away to defeat him, when he like has million occasions to kill them? Bit silly that from the clown, then again BIT SILLY would kinda summed up the review in two words."

And I know this is repetitive but the cast was spot on, each one represented their character beautifully. The only reason I didn't rate this higher is some of the scenes were sorta bizarre and a little long witch added to the movies overall runtime."
"chrisw25-318-68611","2","3","7","8 September 2019"," If You Only Want To Be Entertained Then Go
","On the eve of seeing this, yet another sequel, I pondered as to the logic behind 169 minutes. No horror movie has ever required that amount of time to get its story across and this one shouldn't have either.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>Like the title says, if you only want to be entertained with scary scenes and the redundant CGI that carried the first one (I rate the first one higher, btw), then, by all means, have at it. But I can't get by the time invested only to be rewarded with a weak story, an almost carbon copy to the first and over-the-top CGI and scary scenes in an attempt to top the first movie.<br/><br/>The writers threw anything and everything at the viewer because they simply could. With a story so weak, clouded by fluff, one hour in, I began to realize that the first act wasn't even necessary. Penny-wise returns. Let's call everyone and draw out where every adult is now, after instructing them to return to Derry. After we complete that immensely painful intro, let's take them, once again through their childhood memory and ultimate fear, one at a time. THIS IS WHERE THE MOVIE SHOULD HAVE STARTED!! This is your first act! You could have started here and resulted with the same conclusion and saved us at least 45 minutes bringing the movie down to an appropriate two hours.<br/><br/>Now, getting to all the weaknesses. First off, the LGBTQ community should have nothing to complain about after the opening scene of two gay men being the catalyst that launches Pennywise's return. And why did the clown return? What happened in 27 years to have the clown return NOW. Not even a conjuring by reading evil script was used to create this, as cliche as that would have been. At least it would have been something.<br/><br/>No character arcs to speak of. Bev had an abusive marriage. Okay. That's terrible. End of story. Ritchie had the worst kept secret in the whole movie that he loved Eddie, but yet the movie did nothing to move that subplot. And WHY, why was the psychotic kid, who escaped from the asylum in the movie? He accomplished nothing, absolutely nothing. He came, he stabbed, he died. And Stan, who just couldn't cut it. We see him commit suicide, then the ending is a cop-out tell, don't show moral of the story in the form of ""not a suicide note"" that rambled on and on. Twice, I got up from my seat to leave, only to be forced back down with more monologue from the grave. Oh and the moral of story? Still? We're all losers. Great message, again!<br/><br/>And now the ending. Sigh. After everything that happened, two plus hours of waiting, what is the solution? Let's talk the clown down to baby size(""You're nothing but a clown! You clown you. Stupid clown"") , rip his heart out and collectively squeeze it to death. Are you kidding me? Did I just sit through this tale of redundancy to be rewarded with that?<br/><br/>I don't mind being entertained but entertain me with some originality with a decent story. In a perfect world, I want a unique script with great characters, taking a great story and driving it forward to a creative conclusion. But, like Billy's book from the movie, the ending was terrible... and so was the beginning... and middle.<br/><br/>Two stars out of ten, one for the ""I"" and one for the ""T""."
"emarson","8","3","7","7 September 2019"," Left Feeling A Little Uneasy
","I thoroughly enjoyed the film, but there were a few story arcs that made me feel a little unsure. Henry served very little purpose other than so Richie can give Eddie a pick me up and I'd have liked to see a little more of their adult lives so I can truly get invested. The one that bugged me the most was Richie's story arc, though.<br/><br/>You see justice for the racism with Mike, you see justice for the 'fat kid' thing with Ben, but you never really see any justice for the homophobia.<br/><br/>It is HEAVILY implied that Richie is a part of the LGBT+ community and that he is ashamed of it, hiding who he is. Because of that I've seen people question Richie's relationship to Eddie, more specifically whether him adding the 'E' on the bridge was because he felt something for him, or if he was just grieving.<br/><br/>And because his whole arc was about self-shame, the fact that he never came out made it seem as if he never got a resolve and an end, and as this is a duology and not a trilogy, he never will get a resolve.<br/><br/>The ambiguous and implied ending just doesn't cut it for me, and it would have been awesome to see him get an end, it just felt lazy to me."
"fassioalicia","6","3","7","7 September 2019"," I laughed most of the time. *spoilers*
","6 stars for the choice of actors, also they followed the book extremely well, and of course nothing beats seeing Steven King popping in for a scene.
That being said, this was a mostly jump scare movie, it almost felt like on of the sarcastic Scary Movies, I was expecting more tense moments. I think the comic con interviews and others, only made this movie worse
I love a good scare, something that keeps me up at night thinking about it, but all I could think was about Bill Hader and James Ransone being absolutely hilarious. Bill Hader is except when it comes to playing any roll, this movie allowed him free range to be himself.
An other thing I just hated was the ""de-aging"" Finn's massive buggy eyes from it, the blurry faces, the boys looked more out of place next to untouched Beverly. On the lines of effects, I was surprised by the almost Witcher like creature thru decided to go with.
Maybe I'm just totally desensitized, but this movie felt more like a comedy and a romance than it should have. I found myself laughing through most of it, not shielding my eyes, except for the scene with Bev and her husband. Or maybe it's just simply Adults don't give off the same fear reaction that kids do? The movie was great st making you feel like you're apart of the loser group, would you be afraid? Or would you snap out of it and fight?
Overall good movie, one that I could have waited to rent."

The rest of the characters did a great job as well..<br/><br/>Not a big fan of CGI's but we have to learn to accept it! Lmao<br/><br/>Wasn't scary.., just a good horror film."
"haydendeprill","8","3","7","6 September 2019"," The ending sealed the deal
","The Actors chosen did an outstanding job, Bill Hader really took to the screen and played his part so incredible I almost forgot he played nonsense on SNL. The director did an amazing job again with the scene changes, they flowed every so easily. This movie falls nothing short of scares from gory to jumpy, just like the first it has you sitting on the edge of your seat with suspense. The tie between past and future remained present throughout the film and really captured and even developed the characters more, just when you thought you couldn't love them any harder. The underlying theme and notion of the movie was just as powerful as the obvious; friendships last forever, the bond the kids (now adults) formed and continue to grow really give this movie the extra kick it needs to set it apart from any other horror movie out there. It's not just about the monster or killing it, it's about finding yourself and accepting who you are and how that makes you stronger. The ending was beautifully done so much so that there could be only one flaw, and while I'm biased I hated to see Eddie was killed off. As the joke goes in the movie ""just like one of bills books, the ending sucked"". Nonetheless the movie lived up to its expectations from beginning to end. Not just any horror film a film with a real story."

"alanc88","2","2","4","30 March 2020"," So So Long; Couldn't Wait For It To End.
","After 27 years, IT decides to come back to Derry to start killing again!
Only Mike out of the original seven has stayed in Derry, all of the others buggered off elsewhere and seem to be making it in the big wide world.
When IT returns Mike calls the other six up and tells them to 'come home' tomorrow because they had all promised 27 years ago to stick together. Where did MIke get their telephone numbers from - they've been gone for 27 years?
Luckily for Mike the rest of them have nothing better to do so they all turn up at the Chinese restaurant; except one who decides to cut his wrists in the bath - a bit extreme I think. Why didn't he just not go and say stuff them? They don't know where he lives or anything. They haven't been in touch with each for 27 years -highlighted by the fact that they were all introducing themselves to each when they met up!
At the restaurant, they all reminisce about the past which becomes really loud talking over one another with plenty of F-bombs being shouted - who comes over to ask them to keep it down? - Nobody!
When they start to see little insects coming out of the fortune cookies, they all lose it, screaming and shouting and then smashing the chairs and tables to bits - the chinese woman comes in and says is everything OK and they just ask for the bill. No police called or paying for the damage!
I should have stopped watching at this point but I enjoyed the first film and wanted to see how it all panned out.
There are numerous bits in the film where I've thought how did that happen, where did he come from, why did they did they do that etc, that other reviewers have written about so I won't repeat them except for the ones below:
1. What was the point of Bowers in the film? He killed someone in the Hospital and escaped, (driven by a zombie in a getaway car), and no police are called looking for him.
2. Bill buys his old bike back from an antiques shop for $300. Whenever he gets off his bike, he always just drops it in the middle of the road - are there any cars coming down the road unable to get past his bike - no, of course there aren't.
3. The group go there separate ways to figure out what is holding them to the first part of the adventure: ie: from 27 years ago. During the kill IT ritual, they must burn it in some sort of laether bag(?). Ben burns a signed year book entry which only one person has signed, (Beverly, who he has fancied since childhood). He has carried this in his wallet for 27 yearsand he decides to burn it - yeah right!
4. When they go to the derelict house to confront IT, they ALL have torches. Where did they come from, they didn't have them when you see them outside the house seconds earlier.
5. This ritual and running through the house lasts an eternity. I really wanted to switch off but I also wanted to see what happened at the end. The ritual failed, (sorry you burnt that treasured keepsake Ben), so they decide that to kill IT they had to call it names - yes, that's right, call It a clown and it will start to shrink and then you can rip its heart out and squash it.
Three hours this took. There are no scares to make you jump; no real comedy; not sure if was supposed to be a horror or comedy because it failed on both accounts.
Next time, I won't look at the higher reviews, I will look at the 1 and 2 score reviews because I think you will get far more honesty from them."

This film features a great cast, and the production level is very Hollywood,
But in general it was a stuffy, unoriginal, jump scare ridden pile of smelly Hollywood trash.
I felt like I wanted to grab my girlfriend and run from the theatre after an hour and a half.
The fact that all the characters absolutely love each other, despite the fact that they haven't seen each other in 27 years is so damn cheesy,
And the theme of 'friendship is so important' is fairly child-like in its stylings.
I mean these people are pushing 40 and they just didn't seem like beleiveable fleshed our characters.
Also IT's background story Is a confusing mess that will most likely give u brain freeze and was plastered in weird cgi and half assedly presented to the audience like a serving of cold takeaway
spoiler alert: there is a fkn gigantic 30 minute battle scene which is brain meltingly boring and unoriginal it was like Stephen king meets marvel
I honestly wanted quite a few of the characters to die because of their unbelievably cheesy acting throughout this weird Hollywood epic.
I mean the film looks pretty good throughout I guess.
But be warned It not a movie that necessarily flies along at a brisk exciting pace i found it a hard slog to get through it and felt sick with all the Corniness :-("

"jboothmillard","8","2","4","15 September 2019"," It Chapter Two
","The original 2017 It was a fantastic adaptation of the Stephen King novel, much slicker than the 1990 TV-made Tim Curry movie, and it became the highest-grossing horror movie of all time. The first film ended with the words ""It Chapter One"", so naturally a sequel would follow, which also served as the conclusion to the story, directed by Andy Muschietti (Mama). Basically, in 2016 Derry, Maine, Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan) and his boyfriend Don Hagarty (Taylor Frey) are attacked by a group of homophobic youths. Adrian is then thrown from a bridge, suddenly Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill Skarsgård, Stellan's son) appears at the side of the river, Don watches helplessly as the demon kills Adrian. A grown-up Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), now a librarian, overhears the incident on a police scanner and rushes to the scene. Mike realises that ""It"" was not defeated and has resurfaced, so he calls the other members of the Losers Club back to Derry. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy) is a successful mystery novelist in Los Angeles and is married to a English actress Audra (Jess Weixler), Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan), formerly overweight, is fit and a successful architect living in Nebraska, Beverly Marsh (Jessica Chastain), now Rogan, is a successful fashion designer in Chicago and endures an abusive marriage to husband Tom (Will Beinbrink), Richie Tozier (Bill Hader) a successful stand-up comic in Los Angeles, Eddie Kaspbrak (James Ransone) is a successful risk assessor living in New York City and is married to Myra (Molly Atkinson), and Stanley Uris (Andy Bean) is a firm accountant in Atlanta, Georgia and married to teacher Patty Blum (Martha Girvin). Most are amnesiac about their childhoods and disturbed by the calls but agree to return. Stanley, however, commits suicide after his call. The Losers reunite at a local restaurant and slowly begin to recover their memories, but are terrified by disturbing visions of fortune cookies coming to life or containing hideous creatures, created by It. The group is then informed of Stanley's suicide. Richie and Eddie decide to leave while Mike tells Bill about meeting a Native American tribe who showed him a vision of It arriving to Earth from the stars, and about the Ritual of Chüd, a way of destroying It once and for all. Bill and Mike convince Richie and Eddie to stay and finish what was started, reminding them of the blood oath they made as children. It is revealed that bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton) survived the fall down the well, he was arrested by police. Since then Henry Bowers (Teach Grant) has been confined to a mental hospital, but he escapes, with the help of It, and makes his way to Derry to find and kill the Losers. For the ritual to work, each Loser must have an artefact from their past. Beverly goes to her old home and finds the love letter Ben wrote for her, though she still believes Bill wrote it. Bill goes to the storm drain where his brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) was killed and recovers Georgie's paper boat before meeting a boy named Dean (Luke Roessler) who says he hears the voices of children and sees a clown. Ben goes to the town's high school and, he realises that his artefact is his old yearbook page, which Beverly was the only person to sign. Eddie goes to a pharmacy and recovers an inhaler. Richie goes to an abandoned arcade where he finds a game token. While finding these objects, it flashes back in time to see young Bill (Jaeden Martell), young Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), young Beverly (Sophia Lillis), young Richie (Finn Wolfhard), young Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), young Stanley (Wyatt Oleff) and young Mike (Chosen Jacobs). The flashbacks reveal other frightening encounters the Losers had with Pennywise and It's other guises, but also the happy memories they shared together. After escaping individual encounters with It, the Losers use a shower cap from their childhood clubhouse for Stanley and Mike finds the rock that started their fight against the Bowers gang ago. Bill realizes that It is going after Dean and rushes to a carnival to save him, but he helplessly watches Dean be devoured by It right in front of him in the hall of mirrors. Traumatised by his failure to save both Georgie and Dean, he returns to 29 Neibolt Street to murder It. Bowers attacks and wounds Eddie and Mike but is killed by Richie. The rest of the Losers head to the Neibolt house to help Bill. The group descends into a massive cavern beneath the sewers and complete the Ritual, throwing their artefacts into the fire inside an ancient ornament. This only summons It, unaffected by the ritual, It becomes a giant, spider-like form with Pennywise's head. Mike is pressured by It into revealing to the Losers that the Natives who attempted the Ritual in the past all perished. The Losers are then thrown into nightmarish scenarios while in the cavern, but they each escape. Richie is hypnotised and paralysed by It and is about to be killed, but Eddie saves him, being impaled by It in the process. The Losers regroup and realise It can be killed if they stand up to him and make him feel smaller, so they insult It over and over, making him physically shrink and weaken. When small enough, they are able to tear out It's heart and crush it, killing It once and for all. Eddie dies from his injuries despite Richie's attempts to save him. The remaining Losers are forced to escape, as the Neibolt House collapses to the ground. The remaining Losers return to the quarry where they once swam together. Beverly realises it was Ben who wrote the letter all along, they share a kiss and start a romantic relationship. Richie returns to the bridge where he had once carved his initials, alongside Eddie. Mike decides to move out of Derry to start a new life. The Losers all receive posthumous letters from Stanley, explaining that he believed he would have held them back, he believed his death would reunite them, and he knew they could defeat It if they were brave without him. Also starring Owen Teague as Patrick Hockstetter, Logan Thompson as Victor ""Vic"" Criss, Jake Sim as Reginald ""Belch"" Huggins, Peter Bogdanovich as Peter the film director and Stephen King as the Shopkeeper. Chastain, McAvoy, Hader and the others do well as the Losers Club grown up, the young actors make a welcome as their childhood counterparts, and of course Skarsgard steals the show as the disturbing nasty clown. It recreates a few of the moments from the 1990 version, the special effects are fantastic at bringing the sinister demonic images to life, I agree the ending is maybe not as dramatic as it could have been, and some complain it is too long, at almost three hours. But it uses its time well, like the first film you feel for the characters, and it draws you in, a most enjoyable supernatural horror. Very good!"

","I personally love this movie. I'm a huge fan of Stephen King and the first IT movie, so I may be a little bias, but I thought this sequel was amazing. Each scene was necessary and the scares were even bigger than the first. The adult actors clearly studied the mannerisms of the child actors, so they truly fit into their characters' shoes. Stephen King's cameo also gave the film that added spark.There were a lot of details from the book that were also in the movie, which I loved.

"utslitt","7","2","4","14 September 2019"," Skarsgård's Pennywise is a mastered artist of sadism.
","I want to start this off by giving praise where praise is due. Rich Delia, the casting director, earned his paycheck. The cast that was assembled for this lil ol' picture show here was superbly done. The chemistry amongst The Losers Club as adults was just as fantastic, as genuine, as it was when they were depicted as children. Each character reintroduced as an adult was easily identifiable and instantly familiar despite how much growth had happen within' the past 27 years. Speaking of chemistry, Bill Hader as grown Richie and James Ransone as grown Eddie can be simply described perfection. Everytime these two were on screen and interacting everyone in the theater, myself included, was having a blast.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise was just as wonderfully deranged and vile as one could hope for. It irks me to no bounds that after getting home, and even now I still see a bunch of ''he's no Tim Curry'' posts/rants. They're right. He's no Tim Curry, and Curry is no Skarsgård. Both performances were amazing and I see little merit in comparing them. Skarsgård, I feel, excelled in bringing to light just how ruthless Pennywise is. Skarsgård's representation of Pennywise shows us that he's mastered what seems to be an artform of sadism by vehemently using other's weaknesses against them. Regardless if you're a child, or a determined adult come back to 'play' again, anyone sound of mind would follow the steps of Stanley than try to face Pennywise.<br/><br/>Outside of the casting, the film was visually beautiful. Derry was bleak yet bright, dreadful yet seemingly peaceful (as long as you weren't a loser), and so on. You could imagine sitting in the second row of the theater, I got a whole lotta screen to look at. As I bent my neck in ways it never bent before trying to take the entire picture in, never once was it not worth it. Even afterwards, while rubbing the newfound kinks out I'd rightfully earned, I was still thinking of the cruddy looking theater with 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 5' displayed for presentation, or of the run down arcade where Richie visited to find his token. I wasn't physically at these places, but the way everything was displayed felt so memorable.... if that makes any sense at all.<br/><br/>I can go on and on about all the things I enjoyed about this film, but this post would get way too long and ruin the movie for who read this before watching it. Instead, let's get into what I disliked.<br/><br/>The overabundance of unneeded comedic relief. I'm all for comedic relief in horror films, but not when it's every other dang line, my dudes. For example: Richie gets barfed on at one point in the film. We're not talking ""need to change your shirt"" kind of barfed on, but barfed on so hardcore he has barf in places he didn't know he had places that requires a full body, deep tissue, down to the essence of his being sort of scrubbing. While that happened, Angel of the Morning begins playing. It felt excruciatingly out of place to me. It felt as though the humor of the song was supposed make this less disgusting by fault of humor? No thanks. This type of relief continuously happened to the point where things that were supposed to actually jilt the audience didn't do it at all; instead laughter ensued.<br/><br/>A complaint I'm a little on the back and forth with myself about is there wasn't any warning beforehand about long intervals of flashing. I mean, yeah, as an epileptic you kinda take that risk when going to the movies, but at the same time when it's as prolonged as it was in some parts of the film you'd imagine there being some decency on behalf of the theater or production company saying ""Heads up, epileptics. This one's gonna hurt.""<br/><br/>The rest of my disappointments are minor. We didn't get to see too much of Audra nor Bowers. While the ending was understandably not similar to the book, what the hell was that ""you're a clown!"" garbage? If you're going to do CGI, make it look GOOD. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Beyond all that (would be, could be) nitpicking, I did enjoy the film. Everything from the nod to The Thing to Stephen King's cameo was delightful. I'm patiently looking forward to the bluray release so I can watch part one and two back to back."

","It Chapter 2 is one of the most disappointing films of the year - a confused, amateur, meandering mess that drags it's thin plot out for an unnecessary 2 hours and 50 minutes, with pointless characters, beyond predictable twists, and not to mention, the most cliché, uninspired, and ineffective scares I've seen in a while. FYI, loud music, booming sound effects, and an over abundance of CGI aren't chilling, just loud and predictable.<br/><br/>Not one element of this film holds up to the original, with only 3 Pennywise moments standing out as entertaining parts of the movie, and Bill Hader doing a good job as an older version of Richie, even if his younger counterpart is still the funnier of the 2.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, their older counterparts are incredibly one note and shells of their original selves - Bill is the guilty hero, Mike is the one with the information, Eddie is the worrier, Richie is the comedian, and as for Ben and Beverly....they weren't given a shred of depth besides ""in a love triangle with Bill, who would be cheating on his wife if he were to show any interest in this rushed and bland side plot."" It appears the screenwriter has lost his flow with this instalment as even scenes with the younger Losers Club are no where near as charming of hilarious as they were last time, only acting as exposition in repetitive transition moments which are supposed to provide character moments, but instead do nothing but drag out this thin ""find your artefact"" plot with its tired technique.<br/><br/>The main issue however is just that the movie feels confused - what little horror is actually in this movie is severely overshadowed by forced comedic moments (even within these sequences themselves, seriously, when the Deadpool song began playing in what was meant to be a disturbing moment, it felt completely out of place) and fantasy elements, with an unbearable score that reeked or cliché adventure movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, It chapter 2 is an uninspired and uninteresting follow up to one of the greatest horror films of the decade with only a few memorable scenes to offer to the story."

","When you have a book that's longer than 12 rolls of toilet paper, and a mini-Series that couldn't handle the adult portion of the story, as well as a director who is known for stating ""the stuff with the kids is just more interesting."" ""It: Chapter 2"" was always bound to find itself in a deeper hole, that said it's still extremely entertaining! While not as scary or tight as it's predecessor, what the sequel does give us is great direction from Andy Muschietti and some well rounded actors up for the challenge, Bill Skarsgard continues to shine in his horrifying role, while Bill Hader and James Ransone stand out from the crowd with some hilarious, yet beautiful performances. MacAvoy, Chastain, Mustafa, and Ryan all do well in their respective roles, it however feels like the writing gave them very little to do, which is a shame because these are great performances. In the end ""It: Chapter 2"" would have benefited from a few script re-writes, some more scary scenes, a much shorter run time. But I think with a story as long as ""It"" is the filmmakers did their best job, and in turn delivered a campy but hilarious horror romp that should please some, but may leave others agitated."

I am honestly incredibly disappointed in this one. The acting was spot on, and the performances believable, but it just felt too disjointed, jumping from story to story, from present to the kids memories, and it also lost a lot of the things that made chapter 1 awesome. For example, a LOT more CGI in this one instead of practical effects which made for wonky looking monsters (especially the 'remembered' ones, like the Leper). Second, not enough Bill Skarsgaard doing what he did best, which are Pennywise' creepy movements and mannerisms; they changed it all to CGI-morphing into various sci-fi monsters :( And to be honest, none of the monsters even really scared me like last time. That's not to say it was ALLL bad though... I'd say it was somehow even funnier than the first, and as such, I'd classify it more as a decent sci-fi comedy than a 'horror'. There are some cool little Easter eggs to be found as well, like the Stephen King cameo, etc. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not what I was anxiously waiting for."

Sadly to say there just wasn't anything creepy or engaging by the clown that I expected from this sequel. They could have done a lot more.

That's why his novel keeps switching back and forth between timelines, so you don't get that bored feeling. Unfortunately, both the miniseries and the movie separates the stories into just 2 timelines. Chapter 1, the kids. Chapter 2, the adults.

","As a fan of the source material, the 1990 miniseries, and the 2017 film - ""It Chapter Two"" manages to deliver unexpectedly well considering its plot was based on the unanimously agreed 'weaker section' of King's novel.<br/><br/>Whilst CGI remains at the forefront, with it being used so frequently that it can prove distracting in many instances (along with some intense strobe lighting near the finale prompting my theatre to post an epilepsy warning on the door) - it's sort of what you're buying into when choosing to watch a film like this. You're never going to be particularly intellectually stimulated - but it provides a much higher level of enjoyment than many other recent horror films (although perhaps overstaying its welcome at almost 3 hours in runtime).<br/><br/>Interestingly, many of the ""scares"" in the film are almost instantaneously followed by humourous moments - which occasionally presents the scenarios as being quite jarring, the payoffs tending to be much more satisfying than the CGI-ridden creations that come before. This in my view saves the film from a trap it could have, and very infrequently does, fall into - taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Whilst by no means being a masterpiece, nor even the best ""clown"" film of 2019 - ""It Chapter Two"" is well worth a watch for fans of the novel and the first film; I doubt they'll be too disappointed."

","""It"" (in retrospect I guess we can call it ""Chapter One"") was a well-balanced Stephen King adaption filled with adventure spirit, humor, good scares, and coming-of-age emotions. When we move on to ""Chapter Two"", Beverly, Bill, Richie, Mike, Ben, Stanley, and Eddie are adults and several circumstances force them to return to their childhood hometown of Derry, Maine when Pennywise has returned. ""It Chapter Two"" is overall entertaining and most of the adult cast (Chastain, McAvoy, and Hader being the main stars) are fittingly chosen to portray the Loser Club in present day. However, the film has lost its very nicely executed balance from the first film. Many scenes, not to say the ending, turns very anticlimactic as they - especially Hader as adult Richie - throws out oneliners and funny comments, which takes of the edge of every situation they're in. Once again, Bill Skarsgård is perfect for the role of the child eating clown and there are some good jump scares, not as effective and common as in the first film however. With the final chapter, ""It"", one of the better King-adaptions recently, fails to go out with a bang. The adventurous, curious, and warm (it was there even though it was a horror movie) atmosphere is forgotten and the ""It Chapter Two"" leaves you indifferent for the two-part saga. For its entertainment value, that's the sole reason, I score this film 6 instead of 5."

","Set 27 years after their first encounter against the evil clown known as ""Pennywise"" the Losers Club are now adults and come together after they receive some devastating news. The characters also deal with their own horror and dark pasts once again.<br/><br/>As a sequel, IT Chapter Two has a significant runtime (almost 3 hours). This runtime is primary used for two things: horror scare attempts and to showcase a further developed plot.<br/><br/>The horror aspect of IT Chapter Two tries to go up a notch compared to the previous instalment. From the start of the film, horror fans will have plenty to enjoy, but personally I found this film weaker in the scare and horror department. It also feels that Pennywise is used less to scare the audiences and at multiple times the film relies on CGI characters and monsters to frighten. These just don't frighten nor scare like the previous film which focuses more on Pennywise.<br/><br/>As far as the performance go, the standouts from the grown up Losers Club were easily James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain & Bill Hader, who not only delivered a stunning performance, but were rather convincing at portraying the adult versions of their characters from the previous film. The casting choices were great and easily the highest point of the film and what shines the most. Bill Skarsgard was once again brilliant as the evil clown, Pennywise, with zero complaints.<br/><br/>As for plot, for me this film is not as solid as the previous film, in particularly the film's 2nd and 3rd act which does ultimately drag on from time to time. It also feels that the film struggles with its ending but ultimately it's the film's plot that hurts the film in my opinion with added side mission and flashbacks for all the key characters. Without giving you spoilers, this is all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>Overall, IT Chapter Two remains an entertaining horror film but it is a weaker sequel in regards to the film's story, plot and final act. Despite the lengthy runtime, there's still plenty for fans to enjoy. Leading performances are also positive. It's still a worthy sequel even if it is slightly weaker than the 1st instalment. 6.8/10 - Walkden Entertainment"

","It surely is an entertaining and involving movie, but mainly thanks to the brilliant story of Stephen King, you just want to watch untill the end to see how they will beat the monster. But for this you have to put up with on the one hand flimsy and very unsatisfying background-stories of the adult group of friends (while these are pivotal to the story and the original book spends hundreds of pages on it!) and on the other hand with truckloads of CGI and special effects: scene after scene after scene is chock-full of monsters, creatures, jump-scares, pours of blood, bodyparts, etc. It's really a total overkill, it quickly looses all intended scary effect and by the end you're dead tired of it. They followed the book reasonably well, although in the end the surprisingly simple way with which the monster was annihilated (more or less by convincing him that he wasn't scary at all!) is definitely not what I remember from Kings novel. Also the primaeval, pre-worldly origin of the monster and it's intentions here hardly got any attention, as a result of which in the end his presence stayed somehow a mystery."
"liderc","1","0","0","29 February 2020"," So bad it's funny...
","Already after the first scene, the only truly apalling scene in the movie, I wanted to switch It off. And I should have. The pointless but sadistically detailed depiction of a hate crime, which also looks and feels like directly lifted from the 80s or 90s (the root of the conflict, the hairstyles, the clothing, the queeny, weak gay men vs the tough, braindead hetero men stereotypes), doesn't make any sense at all. It might actually be the rebirth of It, as it feeds on the evil in the small backwater town, but the uninformed viewer never gets much of a chance to understand that. But as the script generally is full of holes, meaningless hints or pointless ""horror"", this is simply what you get. The only thing really made clear is that men are only allowed two things: die or mope around as depressed losers, dreaming of romantic relationships which will never happen.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is mostly unintentional comedy. It now looks and feels like a clownish freak or  who loves whacky costumes and fake gore. Large insects with clown faces or small town weirdos acting as his standins are not that scary either, they are either funny or pathetic (or somewhere inbetween). The scene where the female protagonist is locked in a restroom stall with her menstrual blood sloshing around everywhere and some silly creeps shouting obscenities through the door really had me chuckling, as it felt just stupid. The two stupid, self-hating gay guys, who in the end nearly died adoring a puppy (""So cute!"") before one of them actually dies with probably the most hilarious last words on his lips ever uttered ranged somewhere between homophobic comedy and sarcastic black humor. Actually, most of the overblown ""horror"" in the movie felt like a black comedy making fun of schlocky CGI horror fests.<br/><br/>But, after the unintenionally hilarious final death blow to It (remember: simply call evil beings from outer space who were even too much to handle for tough Native American sorcery ""clowns"" and they are gone for good - life can be so easy sometimes!) we get some very superficial hints that the adults are happy now (except the gay guy, of course), and that's it. The story, I mean. Why it took the lousy team of filmmakers so long to tell this trashy 80s comic book plot is another mystery never explained.<br/><br/>If you liked the first movie, or if you liked the original novel, or even if you simply value your time and sanity, stay far away from this dull mess.<br/><br/>But remember,. before you die, tell everybody who's hot that they are hot or carve their initials into wood while weeping - if you are gay. If you are straight, just enjoy the good things in life like saying ""I love you"" on the telephone (for no apparant reason) or sunbathing with your equally hot partner on your yacht. And if a monster shows up, just say ""Clown"". Perfect, another lesson learned!"

The originals were not scary, at least not to me. ANd I saw them on TV and vhs when I was not even 8 years old. Some people are just tougher I suppose. BUt I always loved the work of TIm Curry, and he should have at least had a cameo in one of the remake films.
This being a review of the remade sequel, I should be saying if it was great or terrible, but it was just okay to fairly goo. I give this film a 6 out of 10 because it brought back too much former imagery and scenes from the first remake film. IT also was waaaaay too light with the forced jokes by Bill Hader, and often ruined the mood more than the original IT back in the day did.
NOt fully answering questions about the whole darn thing was another let down, and even with almost 3 hours and pushed as close to the end with a short 5 minutes of credits, the film just lacked alot.
BUt kids these days are easily scarred or intimidated, maybe many people regardless of age are. At the least IT Chapter Two provides a good amount of distraction.

Chapter 1 also followed the novel's story pretty closely, with some adjustments in the interest of showtime and visual impact, which I thought worked well while still capturing the essence of the novel.<br/><br/>Sadly, I didn't see any of that in Chapter 2. While the actors were good and Bill Skarsgård once again shined as Pennywise, there were just too many broader flaws that could not be salvaged by performance. Too much time was wasted rehashing what we already understood about the characters. I felt like I was watching a ""discarded scenes"" compilation from Chapter 1, repeatedly shoved into the Chapter 2 storyline. And because of this the adult characters' arcs suffered as well. Surely in 27 years these people would have experienced new fears, passions, and growth. But they all seemed like echoes of the children trapped in adult bodies, with the exact same personalities and fears. I think the creators tried far too hard to copy the success of Chapter 1, without really understanding why it worked. Although the explosive visuals and cute humor worked with the young main characters in the first movie, these things undermined the sequel. I simply did not find it believable that these grown adults' deepest, darkest fears were things like fortune cookie monsters and old lepers and the like.<br/><br/>The ending was also extremely disappointing. I was looking forward to this because in the novel, the final battle was a dire, existential battle of determination. This one was a rather deflating and stale one. It turned Pennywise the ""eater of worlds"" into yet another uninspired CGI monster. Seemed like that's where all the extra budget went into, unfortunately."

","Initially I hated this movie. I have to admit my expectations were a bit high especially since the first chapter is truly one of the best horror films ever made. This time around we see the Losers club 28 years later after the evil returns. Together they must overcome their fears and find the courage to face it once and for all. The truth is the adult storyline is way less interesting than the kids but the way in which this film handles is overtly goofy and mistaken for most of it's run time. First up the casting is good but the roles are underwritten. Only Bill Hader and sexy James Ransome manage to make any kind of impact. The film also spends too much time in forced flashbacks that are neither engaging or effective. Plus the awful digital de aging is definitely a problem. Because of all that we never really get to know the grown up versions which consist of an underused Jessica Chastain. An underwhelming but handsome James McAvoy, Old Spices Isiah Mustafa (a.k.a. the hunky centaur) and an overly Jay Ryan as grown up Ben. Even though the original TV miniseries struggled especially in the second half it was more cohesive and effective. This sequel actually lessens the impact of its predecessor and actually takes away some of the quality. That being said watching it again and knowing what to expect I enjoyed it a little more and actually liked some of the scenes that are more atmospheric and not bogged down by bad cgi. In the end it's overly mediocre but does manage to be mildly entertaining. But with rumors of a third chapter on the way, I beg of them. Please stop."

","Although in itself an entertaining horror flick, it doesnt get anywhere close to the height of the first movie. The sequel feels forced, as if film was constructed just to fulfill the promise of the characters from the first film. What made the first It so good was not just the plot, but the setting, the mood and the teenage characters, as if we were transported back to our younger days and were forced to face our darkest fears, but now that the characters grew older, it just stopped feeling special. The sequel's plot is also way too straightforward and fails to tell any backstories of Pennywise. The bulk of the film still relies heavily on the goodwill from the first film which is really a shame considering It was one of my favorite films of that year. Really enjoy the Stephen King Easter eggs scattered throughout the film, at least that made it a little more special."

The only good thing I can say about the second movie is the casting. Eds and Stan were nearly perfect. This movie however had even more CGI than the first. They did not think this through as far as the children aging. Kids grow fast. They should have shot all of the kids scenes during the filming of the first movie. By the time they got to filming the second movie half of the kids were noticeably older and they had to use CGI on their faces. Just looked weird.

","Personally, I really liked the movie. I thought the cast was pretty well done in accordance for their child versions. I will say the movie didn't scare me so much as the special effects seemed to be a lot of CGI and in a way reminded me of the Goosebumps movies. But, there were a few creepy scenes such as the old lady smiling at Beverly and the way she shuffled out of the corridor. I found the most subtle scenes were the creepiest. I did enjoy the flashbacks to the kids because it gave the viewers a nostalgic feeling for a childhood that they never even had and really added the the reconnection of the Losers. Also the movie made me laugh quite a few times which was a reason I liked the first movie so much! Comedic relief is always important.
The first movie was definitely better than the second, but I enjoyed both and I'm sad to know the movie is officially over!"

","This was shocking. ""It: Part 1"" was the pinnacle of recent horror. ""Part 2""? A devastating fall from grace. It started with the best scene from the novel, done well! Every scene past that broke my heart. ""PART 2"" was bloated and couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or horror film. It bore no resemblance to the book. Chastain was phoning it in, Bill Hader & the actor playing Eddie were just loud & obnoxious-CONSTANT (blah) jokes & OVERacting. The best parts of the book were excised. Bills wife and Beverlys husband don't even make it to Derry! James Mcavoy and the actor playing Ben saved the production, but even they were saddled with cringey lines. ""It's Derry, I'm getting used to 'weird'."" And group chanting ""Turn Dark to Light!! Turn Dark to Light!! . . ."" repeatedly felt like lazy, over simplistic writing and I had second hand embarrassment for all actors involved for those five minutes. Condolences. Skarsgard as Pennywise was for the most part reduced to a CGI hybrid. More video game monster than the shadow clown we feared in part 1. Most of the time the actors were attacked by (poor) CGI creations that looked straight out of a Tim Burton movie. Plot holes a'plenty, and the ending is just straight up torture. ""It"" stomps around (LOUDLY) in circles for around 15 mins while the heckle and jeckle losers make jokes and poor Ben has to shout that Haiku like it's some kind of protective charm. After 3 hours ears & a$$ both are brutalized and the whole theatre moved like a flock of Whisperers (Or Golden Girls) when the lights came up. If you love the book don't see this. I counted only 3 cribbed scenes from the book. The rest is garbage from a screenwriter, not Stephen King. I felt like a fool for hyping it up and dragging 6 friends. All 6 were grumpy when the lights came up, but only 4 needed ibuprofen from my wife's purse, so there's THAT. The Final Cringe: who bullies a baby clown by yelling insults at it?

","It's widely agreed upon that no matter what version, the first half of It is better than the second. It's been 27 years since the Loser's Club defeated Pennywise, and everyone's favorite demon clown has returned for more. The kids, now adults in their 40s, get back together to defeat the monster one more time. However, they've all lost their memory, except for Mike, and most of the movie is spent on them going through Derry trying to regain them by collecting items from their pasts. It's not bad content, per se, it just feels like filler and takes way too long. The movie's runtime is 2 hours, 44 minutes. That's excessive for a movie like this.<br/><br/>However, it's balanced out by absolutely fantastic performances. Bill Skarsgard returns as Pennywise, and he's perfect. He doesn't talk as much this time around, but he nails all the gestures and mannerisms of being a creepy clown. He's just as good as last time. The other person who garnered a lot of attention is Bill Hader as Richie. Deservedly so, as he does exactly what he should, act like grown-up Richie. The rest of the adults, including Jessica Chastain as Beverly and James McAvoy as Bill, also do their part, and we do see the kids we knew all grown up. Since we get this microcosm of their lives, there's a lot of emotion put into it with how they cope with their memories and facing their fears through a completely different, more grown up lens.<br/><br/>There's still more to dislike, unfortunately. The scares were way too predictable. After the first few, you can easily do a ""3, 2, 1, jumpscare"" countdown in your head. Plus, there are way too many jumpscares. Henry didn't need to be in this at all. I know he's important in the book, but hey, Lord of the Rings worked without Tom Bombadil, so this could work without Henry. All he does it eat up runtime. All in all, It: Chapter 2 doesn't come near the heights of the first movie, but it wasn't expected to. It's a decent film, but it's not going to be one of the most remembered horror movies of all time like the first one.<br/><br/>By the way, there is reportedly interest in making a cut of It that intertwines scenes from both movies into one massive, 5-hour movie. That would be awesome."

","The novels of Stephen King have been transferred to film perhaps more than any other author of all time. The fact that he writes nonstop might have something to do with that. But even now a number of his books that were turned into films are being remade before new ones are even filmed. A remake of THE STAND is in the works. And last year we were presented with the first of two parts of IT, a remake of the TV film. Now IT CHAPTER 2 is out on disc, completing the story that began in the first film.<br/><br/>If you recall at the end of the first film the group of kids known as the Losers faced off against Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) the clown, defeating him at least for the moment. Pennywise is supposed to return every 27 years. At the end they all swore to return to combat Pennywise once again if he did come back. That time is now.<br/><br/>The only member of the group to remain in Derry, Maine, was Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) working in the library. When a group of teens beat up a gay man and toss him in the river, his boyfriend watches as Pennywise eats him. Mike overhears what's taken place over the police scanner and knows what to do. He begins calling the rest of the gang.<br/><br/>But for the rest of them life has moved on and the further from Derry they moved the more their memories of what took place have left them. Bill (James McAvoy) is married to an actress and now an author and screenwriter in the middle of a film being made out of one of his books. Richie (Bill Hader) is a professional stand-up comedian with anxiety issues. Ben (Jay Ryan) has lost weight, become a great looking guy and is a successful architect. Eddie (James Ransone) is an insurance salesman and married to a woman who is reminiscent of his mother. Beverly (Jessica Chastain) is in an abusive marriage and ready to leave for Derry. And Stanley (Andy Bean) remembers more than the rest, so much so that he kills himself rather than face Pennywise once more.<br/><br/>The group gathers together and meets in a Chinese restaurant in Derry where Mike reminds them of their past and what they faced long ago. All of them are ready to leave and abandon their promise when Pennywise makes his presence known frightening all of them. Then Beverly reveals that when she was exposed to It's deadlights, she saw that if they didn't fulfill their promise she has seen their brutal deaths, beginning with Stanley's.<br/><br/>The movie then moves back and forth from past to present as each one of the members must find an artifact that connects to themselves before they can face off against It. Mike has found a potential way to eliminate It, discovering where it came from and how it was defeated millions of years in the past. The artifacts each one finds shows them in their past and how they acquired the item and then how they find it once again in the present. This fills up quite a bit of the time of the film.<br/><br/>Of course a final battle is on the way and before they get to it It will once more let them know he's out there and preparing for them himself. He wants revenge for what they did to him 27 years ago and he'll use anything in his power to have it. He'll play on their insecurities and their fears, he'll manipulate situations involving innocents and he will find a way to stop them in their plan. The only hope they have is if they can summon the courage that they had all those years ago and face him once again.<br/><br/>Let me say from the start that the first problem this film has was the success of the first film. While that film was just over 2 hours the success gave the studio and director her enough confidence that they mad this one even longer, running just 11 minutes shy of 3 hours. It doesn't need to be that long. The proof of that is that the film feels 3 hours long. It's an overindulgence that doesn't destroy the story but does make it a movie you might not want to revisit any time soon.<br/><br/>All of the actors involved are at their best here, making the characters not just believable but mirror images of the child actors that played the roles in the first film. That's not an easy task to achieve and make the character their own at the same time. And the kids from the first film return here (or were more likely than not shot at the same time as the first film) and remain perfect in their roles.<br/><br/>There are a few good scares in this film like there were in the first but we're beginning to see a time in films when there is a strong dependence on CGI effects that result in their usage making the films not near as frightening. The last sequence of the film involves much of this and for me was one of the weakest moments when it should have been the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>All in all the film isn't bad and if you've seen the first film you will definitely want to make sure and see this follow up. Perhaps the biggest fear I have is that even though this concludes the story as told in the novel the studio will look only at numbers and decided to make yet another sequel with less money involved and no creative folks returning. Should that happen it would be sad to see."

There are quite a few scenes that are just amazing to see. The film starts well and maintained a decent pace for a while but eventually ran out of gas and started dragging.<br/><br/>The pacing was the single most negative thing for me because it never allowed me to get hooked with the film.

I am glad I got to see this film because there are few scenes that are just too good for any horror or monster film fans. The scenes in the restaurants in the beginning with the fortune cookies is super creepy. The scenes under the baseball stand is amazing as well. And the one with the old woman that was on the trailer is great as well. The whole 20min or so in the climax is also worth going through some of the boring scenes.<br/><br/>I loved Pennywise in this one. Bill Skarsgård has done an amazing job. His voice is superb.

"kaspergordon","7","0","0","22 January 2020"," It could have been so much more.
","It is my favorite book of all times - I've gone trough it around 4 times, plus most of Kings other work, at least once. I've all ways hoped for a proper adaption, since the TV miniseries adaption, just a had too little budget, too little time to tell the books all most 1200 pages, and had to be toned to much down for TV.<br/><br/>The way I all ways hoped for the adaption to happen, was like a modern TV series, like an HBO show or something. Perhaps just one season with around 10 to 12 episodes. Since even with both this movie and Chapter One combined, there's still much that they had to change or leave out, so much character development, so many great scenes, esential world building and exposition, they couldn't include in just two movies.<br/><br/>Hopefully it will happen one day.
And hopefully sooner than later.
Even though they clearly did their best on these two movies, and you could tell a lof of the involved people, actually cared abouth the book and how the film turned out, it is still far from the ultimate adaptation of It, that a lot King fans have been dreaming of for years.<br/><br/>Hopefully a new adapted series could then be set in the 50's and 80's like in the book, and be a scene for scene adaptation, that is more faithful and accurate to the book, instead of them mostly coming up with their own subplots, scenes, scares and incarnations of It, that more or less all were just downgrades and too different from how IT manifested itself in the book.<br/><br/>Though Andy Muschietti supposedly IS working on a supercut of the movie, where he will combine both the first and the second movie along with deleted scenes and allegedly even a few new ones, shot for this version.<br/><br/>If this really happen, then I really hope it will be intercut between the scenes with kids and the grownups, right from the beginning, like in the book.
Though a 6 to 7 hour combined cut of these two movies spliced together, still far from will be enough, to cover all of the book - a handful of extended and unseen/new scenes added to what we all ready have, still just isn't adequate, no matter how good this added material will end up being.<br/><br/>But until a 10 to 12 hour adaptation finally is made one day, this is probably our best hope until then.<br/><br/>Even though these two movies, have a lot of good things about them, like great editing, a great cast, especially for the kids, nice coloring, nice looking cinematography, okay music and good settings (Derry in particular is greatly captured), there's still a lot of issues the rumored super-cut may still have a chance to fix - though I guess a lot of it is hard to change by now, unless they decide, to do a rather extensive post production on this said supercut.<br/><br/>But hopefully, they can tone the humor down a lot, the humor, wasn't as cringe-worthy in the first chapter, it was mostly just smart remarks and banter between the kids, that seemed rather natural.
But in the second chapter, they turned the humor up way too much, and made it too forced and self aware. Which doesn't fit such a dark and epic tale, or an R-rated horror movie in general.<br/><br/>If they're going to shoot new scenes with Bill Skarnsgaard, I hope they're going to show a bit more of It's appearances as Penywise, when he's more aggressive, demonic, menacing and and mean-spirited in this jolly clownish comedian sort of way, like in the book. Even though Bill often did a great job with one hell of a screen presence, he was more than often too childlike, more like a weird creepy stalker in a clownsuit kind of way, that never really was described in the book - where it comes off more of this eternal interdimensional being, that thinks it's portraying a comedic human clown, and basically is overdoing it, with out it knowing it itself.<br/><br/>Hopefully this cut, will also cut away, with all these ""shaking-camera-distorted-screaming-monster-clown-jumping-at-the-camera""-takes. Or just use it once, at best. They felt so forced, and, just took you out of the creepy atmosphere they were trying to build, plus the clown never gets any of the kids in these shots anyway, they could just cut to the kids running, they should be scared enough anyway, with out this type of forced modern trope, just played for cheap jump scares - the true horror lies in the tone and atmosphere anyway.<br/><br/>Maybe they could even re-shoot some of the CGI shots - which is one of my biggest issues with the film. I mean, the scene with George in the beginning, is just so effective and well done, until Penywise gets turned into this fake looking videogame monster-clown, that looks more fun than scary and you out of the mood. A bit of ekstra creepy clown-makeup, some nasty prosthetic yellow sharp teeth, and a couple of yellow evil eye-lenses, on some guy that goes into beast-mode and bites into a child arm in a yellow raincoat, would make this so much more disturbing, effective and evil. They don't even have to use Skarnsgaard again for something like, since It is all ready changing it's appearance and looking different, and they could just cut back to when George is crawling away from the sewer again.<br/><br/>A lot of the fake CGI stuff, could get fixed up this way, especially scenes when they distort Penywises face to this CGI videogame face, were it looks more comical than scary - just replace the face on Penywise in these scenes (that's a cheap thing to do), with some creepy guy, with evil makeup and prosthetic instead, and even it it out with good editing of the existing material.<br/><br/>Though this won't cover up all the CGI in the movie, it will help make the overall experience of such a supercut way more effective and feel more real.<br/><br/>Never the less, I really hope to see this supercut soon. AT least to hold us over, until the greatest book ever written, gets the adaptation it deserves one day, in a 10 to 12 hour and more faithful to novel kind of way.
I mean, if they could do it with a book with a book like The Haunting of Hill House on Netflix, then IT definitely deserves this too - even if they've just made this flawed, semi unfaithful, but still somewhat okay and well meant attempt, that still could have been way worse."

IT chapter 2 however I'm struggling to hold my shock and dismay back!!!!
I feel that everyone that was directly or indirectly involved in the making of that film should be fined SHAME ON YOU!!!
I tried to follow what I can only call a copy of goosebumps and scooby doo for 2hr and 50 mins.
You have defecated over the book and aroused fury that I have not felt since humans tried to chop down the trees in ferngully!
I'm going to the TOP with this one.
And FYI imdb 6.7 and empire 5/5 you have obviously received a back hander from McAvoy to try and support the casts tragic acting so Shame on you to!!
You have all successfully disbanded and ruined the Losers club, I can only pray that in my lifetime I see this story line redeemed!"

","... but not much else. I may be tired of all the sequels and remakes and prequels and all this regurgitated crap. I mean, we all knew how the story was going to unfold, even if the ending is slightly different and now Maturin is an Native American drug root and Pennywise sprouting spider legs prompts a The Thing reenactment.<br/><br/>My point is that the first film was always the better one, even in other adaptations. The children's fear is huge because they are children and their courage is so much more important. Pennywise was barely articulate in the first film, now he is talking and having agents that do his bidding. The rules have changed dramatically. It's not a creature that devours every 27 years, it's one that is rebooted every 27 years. In the first film they were all friends, in this they are adults that have not seen each other in decades. How am I going to feel anything for them, regardless of the quality of the acting?<br/><br/>Bottom line: the experience has to be different for people who don't remember the Tim Curry version or that have not read the book. Perhaps waiting a few years and then watching both films back to back offers a different enjoyment level. For me, it was just a better version of something that had already been done and brought nothing new to the table. It was scarier, but somehow it felt less meaningful. And yeah, the ending was always going to suck."

","However, even though it didn't personally scare me, I still had a great time with It Chapter 2, and that's mostly because of the main cast. Seriously, these actors did a fantastic job as a group of adult Losers. Not to mention they also look the part. James Ransone is the spitting image of Jack Dylan Grazer. The only one that I think is a little off is Bill Hader as Richie. He definitely acts the part, just doesn't look exactly like Finn Wolfhard. But that's all. The story is also pretty good in my opinion. Admittedly, when Mike started talking about that Native American stuff, I was almost taken back, but ended up going with it because I felt like he really believed what he was talking about, and that's thanks to Isaiah Mustafa's acting. And while this movie isn't all that scary, it does not forget its comedic roots. I laughed quite a bit, really. There were a couple times when comedy wasn't appropriate because it's supposed to be serious or scary, but I forgave it in the end. So yeah, I enjoyed myself (obviously). It's definitely not as good as the first movie, but I think it's pretty close.<br/><br/>8.0/10 (Great)"

","Great story, great villain, great performances and very nostalgic. The film itself was too long tho and just got a bit repetitive. Scary clown, big sharp teeth, balloons. It just seemed like 3 hrs was too much.

","This was my favourite movie of the year. It's about friendship over anything and I just love that about both films. The casting of the older Losers is some of the most perfect casting choices I've ever seen and they all work so well together, bouncing humour of each other just like their younger selves. Outstanding performances from James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain, loved it!"

","Certainly not without its issues, It Chapter Two is a more fun feeling film than its predecessor. While the overall tone of the film is serious, the horror moments surprisingly blend creepy visuals with an almost tongue in cheek tone not unlike a carnival haunted house. Unfortunately, the story beats don't hit a similar blending of tones with some moments being genuinely emotional and others being drawn out a bit too long despite well done performances from all involved including a scene stealing Bill Hader."

I would like to give this movie grief, but I just keep coming back to the realization that they couldn't have done anything more with it really. That acting by bill hader was amazing.

There's a joke throughout the film about one of the characters (an author) writing a bad ending that everyone hates. It pretty much sums up the illogical ending to this film. In essence, it was a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>Was it scary? slightly.

It runs the whole mood of this movie and you can't help but laugh. The first movie was great, all the child actors were awesome and that first movie was scary. This one feels flat and the story is poorly written. The adult actors apart from Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy don't take anything seriously. The jokes are mistimed and the actors don't look scared at all. The characters feel like they are never in any real danger. The end was standard with good defeating evil and so on.

","The movie was way longer than it had to be and the cgi was a fail. In the first installment the story was changed so that mike wasn't the researcher and Ben was which makes zero sense and took away much needed screen time from Mike. Also, Mike has good parents who experienced racism in Derry in the novel and unfortunately they were the victims of it again in this film, because they were killed in a crack house fire Because all Black people were smoking crack in the 80's. Not just one parent. BOTH. I'll have to tell my parents they missed that one. In this movie the research role is given back to Mike and he's a librarian although thanks to the changes in the first movie, there's no reason to support why he would Choose that profession. Then there's Richie who comes out of the closet sort of. Apparently life-long friendship and dangerous battles with the supernatural doesn't make you open up to your friends about who you are.

"goodselln","7","0","0","16 December 2019"," Teeter-Totters on what is ""Good"" and ""Bad""
","So this title had many things going for it, some good and some bad, and I guess I'll just make a pro's and cons list to spell it out:<br/><br/>Pros:
1. Opening Scene. Truly well done, it was uncomfortable and sad to watch with the gay couple being beaten, but matches how the original book started incredibly well, and really got the ball rolling for the film. It excited me on what I may have started to watch.
2. Casting. I was most impressed with the casting of Jack Dylan Grazier and James Ransone who both played Eddie, it was uncanny how I thought they resembled each other well, and even at one point went on here to double check if they were father and son.
3. The Message. It leaves you feeling peaceful with themes and imagery about childhood: it's fears, its joys and sorrows, growing up, recovering from trauma, and how it still affects us to this day whether we can face it or not. But the important thing to remember was about not being alone when we feel like it.
4. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd is an amazing Pennywise.
5. More info behind Pennywise. Its been awhile since I've read the book, and can't find time to make the commitment of rereading it anytime soon, but one thing I was frustrated with was how it never felt like there was an explanation behind Pennywise: what was it exactly and where did it come from? There was no myth or lore behind him (at least from what I remember in the book), so this movie introducing more behind that was something that I appreciated.
6. The Final showdown. Honestly, I liked the movie version better. Pennywise's final form was a letdown in all honesty, but the ending in the book felt so out there and just plain weird, like wtf was Stephen smoking when he wrote that?)
7. Surprise Cameo. Can't say who, but it was an absolutely delightful surprise to see who it was, I'm so glad I wasn't spoiled on it!<br/><br/>Cons:
1. Way too much CGI was relied on. This is a continuing issue with a lot of big budget films (ironically), and I seriously wish we could go back to when studios spent more on special effects and relied on makeup, because except for Pennywise, a lot of the special effects felt so cheapened with the reliance of disturbing images and/or sequences that are in abundance in this film. Not to mention was mainly used for jump scares, which brings me to my next point...
2. Way too many jump scares. The middle part really slowed the whole film when the main cast does the one big no-no of horror: they split up. Sure, they had to go find their tokens throughout town and have Pennywise try and terrify them into submission, but at the base of those scenes, it was mainly disturbing images and jump scares that fueled them, and it got repetitive.
3. Bowers Character. His whole appearance felt cheapened and dramatically made less important than what he was in the book.
4. This movie tried to be too funny. Thanks Bill Hader...Some parts got a chuckle but some felt pretty forced and pretty mehh.
5. Another reviewer said this too, but Stan's letter's at the end tried to justify his death by making it seem like a noble sacrifice to try and bring them all together again, but that's not the case. He committed suicide because he was too afraid to go back and face his past trauma's. thats it. it represents how sometimes digging into our pasts and confronting our past traumas, fears, whatever happened that has affected us even years later is too hard for some people, and it's a sad but realistic factor of the human condition, so the letters felt like they'd backed off from the harsh reality.
6. The scene of them walking through the town with the blue filter to make it look like it was night/just before sunrise. It literally looked like it was filmed during the day and they placed a terrible blue filter over it. Could've had better editing there...<br/><br/>I did overall enjoy the film for the most part; out of a lot of horror films, I can appreciate the story behind it and the positive message it tries to tell people at the end. Does it deserve the award of best horror film ever? Hell no...But maybe in another 27 years, they'll absolutely nail it!"

Where it didn't work for me was with the CGI ""monsters"". Many of them looked silly and slightly-humorous, as opposed to scary. And for me, that took a lot of the tenseness out of those scenes. The clown all on its own is scary enough, the other stuff paled in comparison.
Again, I did enjoy this film, but I think that scary guys in costumes beat special effects creations almost every time. Still, I'm gonna stay the hell outta Derry, for sure!"

I literally stopped the movie and slept twice while watching it because it doesn't flow all that well and doesn't resolve a lot of questions. They took almost 5 hours of screen time between parts 1 & 2 and they never fully explained what Pennywise is or how it came to be or why it eats people or the 27 year cycle.

If you want to watch a film through your fingers in fright and in the next breath laugh out loud then this is a must see."
"CriticalRaccoon","7","0","0","28 November 2019"," A good film, though it's inferior to Chapter 1
","It's rare that a sequel almost completely abandons the tone of a blockbuster success, but It: Chapter 2 does so to varying degrees.<br/><br/>To be fair, the ""part 2"" of It was always going to be less scary, but It: Chapter 2 went in so many different directions it's almost unrecognizable at times that this was by the same director. It: Chapter 2 is clearly a product of Andy Muschietti, but it's almost like he directed it to be as different as he could.<br/><br/>Blending elements of horror, action, fantasy and comedy, It: Chapter 2 concludes the story of the Losers Club and Pennywise in a way that fans of the book can probably be happy with, but I think the general public will be in for a letdown.<br/><br/>Picking up 27 years after It was temporarily defeated by the Losers Club, It is back to feast on the town of Derry. The one remaining Loser in Derry, Mike Hanlon, calls out to his fellow Losers to fulfill the oath they took all those years ago: if It came back, they'd finish the job. So our band of merry folk return, only to realize that since they left Derry all those years ago that they have lost all memory of It, but they slowly come back once together again. In his obsessive years of research Mike has learned of a Native American ritual that can force It to reveal its true form and thus defeat it once and for all. Will the Losers finish this clown for good? Will it turn out to be a giant spider? Will fortune cookies end up killing them all?!<br/><br/>So first off It: Chapter 2 is barely a horror movie. There is no sense that the town itself is hostile anymore. The Losers are now adults so they aren't really the target of It, though It does like to taunt them. There are a couple of scenes where It picks off random people but there's no reason to care about the victim's safety. There is really only one segment of It: Chapter 2 that attempts to be a horror movie - about 45 minutes of flashbacks to It terrorizing the young Losers during that time between them breaking up and when Beverly is kidnapped (although honestly the creepy CGI de-aging was more terrifying). Oh, and the fun-house scene that was in all the trailers where Bill attempts to save a kid from It; I liked that one a lot.<br/><br/>It: Chapter 2 might not be scary, but it at least has some decent laughs and action. Bill Hader as the grown up Richie really does nail all the comedy bits as he's thankfully grown out of all the sex jokes. In fact some of the ""scary"" scenes elicit more laughs than screams which had to be intentional (giant lumberjack statues are not scary!). It: Chapter 2 is oddly fun when it chooses to be.<br/><br/>Even though the film constantly jokes about weak endings (remember, Stephen King is notoriously bad at them), I can say that the ending of It: Chapter 2 wasn't that weak. As a lot of people know the ending of the original It is, well, not good. It: Chapter 2's ending is far more action-orientated, blends in elements of It's reality-warping powers, and really emphasizes that the Losers' own bonds were what saved them all along. Also, It doesn't just transform into a giant spider animatronic ... thank god.<br/><br/>The most common criticism of It: Chapter 2 is that it is almost 3-hours long; that length for a ""horror"" film is almost unheard of. There's a rumored 4-hour long cut of the film too! It seems like the main reason for this extended length are the scenes of the younger Losers which honestly feels out of place. I'm sure the studio wanted the kids to come back in a meaningful way, but man does it feel unnecessary. The film really should have been at most the same length as the original, though I admit I'm interested in seeing the 4-hour cut to see exactly what the hell they they filmed but didn't include from Stephen King's notoriously long novel.<br/><br/>In a way It: Chapter 2 is oddly streamlined despite the length. It all but eliminates the subplots that took up a lot of It, as well as the ones that could have been in Chapter 2 regarding the new spouses of the Losers. Maybe the extended cut has more of Bill's wife being kidnapped by Beverly's abusive husband, but I'm glad they cut it here.<br/><br/>Even if you can criticize a lot about It: Chapter 2, its cast isn't one of them. Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise, and he yet again delivers a masterful performance as the nigh-omnipotent menace. The young cast from the first It is back (sometimes creepily CGI'd to death), as well as some great casting choices for Chapter 2 with James McAvoy as Bill and Jessica Chastain as Beverly (didn't they just try to kill each other in Dark Phoenix?!). These two get the most screen time due to their A-list pedigree, but the rest of the cast match up with their younger parts well. The obvious standout is Bill Hader as Richie who steals every scene he's in; there is no one else who could have played this part as well.<br/><br/>It: Chapter 2 is flawed, but I still enjoyed it. I wasn't going into the film expecting a horror movie as I was somewhat familiar with the source material, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well Muschietti executed a difficult adaptation. While it was way too long, It: Chapter 2 moved fast enough that I didn't find myself glancing at my watch. I am a gigantic fan of horror films but rarely if ever get scared by them, so the lack of scares wasn't a detractor for me. For those that wanted a copy of the first film, It: Chapter 2 may disappoint.<br/><br/>No one will ever say It: Chapter 2 is a better film than It, but that's not to say it's a bad movie. It: Chapter 2 is the slightly inferior little brother to a surprise hit that no one expected to be as good as it was. It: Chapter 2 is well made, has loads of laughs, great performances, an ending that doesn't suck, but just doesn't have It's magic. If you enjoyed It then Chapter 2 is a no-brainer, but for those on the fence I'd say just float on. (I apologize for that joke immediately)"

","*Spoilers
I haven't read the book but I felt they got the Henry Bowers character all wrong. He worked in the first film because he was a villain grounded in reality, he represented everything wrong with the town of Derry.
Take the opening scene, contextually it felt misplaced. If the hate crime was instigated by Henry Bowers, and he was tied into the story through the arc of Richie, it might've worked. But as it is the scene seems ill fitting. The tone jumps from very bleak to camp almost instantly.
It worked when they were kids, not as adults.
What does work in Chapter Two is the scenes in which Pennywise is human. Like for instance the make up scene, or the old lady. Henry Bowers should've remained the cold and callous character he was before. The embodiment of IT's tyrannical hold.
These characters had a whole movie to set their arc, they fear more than zombies and spiders and those fears are based in reality. Which is exactly what the opening scene was trying to set up, It falls flat. If they ran with the same tone and actually gave it weight to the story, It might've been a better film, who knows."

","The theme that ""Clowns Back to the Soul"" wants to express is not new today, but regarding friendship, I really want to have good friends like loser. But how to say it, ""The Clown Returning to the Soul 2"" 145 minutes of the director of the film is obviously wanting to dig more into the inner fear of the character, and the main creation adds a lot of eggs to the first part of the clown. But in fact, too many jump scares make it difficult to be scared after the mid-term, and even feel boring. The main creative desire to express more but limited to the horror film restrictions made the customer's original fear of the theme somewhat deviated, feeling the lack of the first time to see the surprise. Ps: The monsters made by modern special effects, although not scary, can really be disgusting to the audience. The emotional line of the clown's returning soul is very different from the theme! I hope the horror film can continue to be innovative, come on!"
"cristianapetrache","8","0","0","16 November 2019"," Bending film genres
","Director Andy Muschietti chooses not to play safe by mixing elements of gore and chaos with priceless bits of comedy, successfully breaking the barrier imposed by film genres. Instead of making a predictable type of horror, he crafted something much bigger than a film. From scares, drama and laughter to pain and tears, 'It: Chapter Two' had it all.<br/><br/>Growing up being surrounded by Stephen King's work has definitely made me appreciate these types of films and for me, the 'It' experience was even more entertaining because I got the chance to watch some of my favourite actors play some of my favourite characters. The cast was extraordinary; Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, James Ransone, Isaiah Mustafa and Jay Ryan played the adult versions of the Losers so elegantly, their performances being the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Bill Hader- former cast member of 'Saturday Night Live' and writer and director of the Emmy nominated series 'Barry'- starred in this year's It as Richie Tozier. At first, Seth Green (who played 12-year-old Richie in the 1990 miniseries) showed interest in reprising his role. After Hader was proposed by 'Stranger Things' actor Finn Wolfhard (who played the younger version of the character in the 2017 film), the comedian was ultimately cast. Being a huge fan of his, made me beyond excited and very curious about how he would act in such different circumstances than the ones he was used to. I believe I speak for everyone when I say that Hader was the heart and soul of the film. Not only did he do a mesmerizing job (bringing joy to the viewers), he also carried the gravity of the script on his shoulders. He helped Muschietti's adaptation achieve the desired impact, making the entire audience fall in love with Richie. His dynamic jokes, including his ""feud"" with Eddie (James Ransone), gave depth to the story.<br/><br/>A pleasant surprise<br/><br/>It felt like a family film which is definitely unexpected, coming from a horror movie. It was more funny than scary, but this is a good thing because when it comes to 'It' the terror consists of gory and psychological details. Was it better than the first chapter? I would pick the new one over 'It' not necessarily because it was more frightening, but because it made me experience more.<br/><br/>It had a few general issues, but then again it is pretty hard to adapt Stephen King books into movies, especially one that is so beloved. Some might not like all the aspects of the film, because of the way they imagined the whole situation depicted in the book. The script blended well in this lively fusion of drama and horror, everything fell into place eventually, building up a great, enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The original piano piece ""27 Years Later"", which featured material from the previous film's ""Every 27 Years"" indicated the story's development while hinting Pennywise's return with an eerie approach. In fact, Benjamin Wallfisch's entire soundtrack implied the suspense and the dread that was meant to merge you in the plot.<br/><br/>The viewing experience<br/><br/>Watching it in a cinema makes a huge difference because the viewing experience is highly improved that way. The obvious advantage of watching 'It' in a film theatre is the fact that it gives a whole new dimension to the story and to the way Andy Muschietti chose to represent it on the big screen. If you are waiting to watch it on DVD, I feel like the entire setting will seem slightly sloppier. It just wouldn't be the same, something would probably seem off, but I assure you that, if you are a big fan of Stephen King's creations, once you watch it in a cinema you will genuinely fall in love with the adult Losers' Club.<br/><br/>The 2019 instalment serves such a satisfying ending which concludes the story perfectly. The atmosphere was magical in the last few minutes thanks to the emotional dialogues delivered by the cast. For a moment, I felt like all I wanted to do was stop the clock and let the film go on for another couple of hours.<br/><br/>It never felt too long; it actually got better with every moment. The runtime was precisely what made the film so delightful. The narrative could have been seriously messed up if the editing crew had decided to cut it down to less than 2 hours and 50 minutes."

","""Swear... Swear if It isn't dead... if It ever comes back... we'll come back, too"" said Bill in the closing frames of Chapter 1 to his fellow Losers Club mates, in Sep'1989. The Urban Legend at Derry said It will be back once every 27 years and we always knew It is going to be back again to haunt us on screens and in our dreams. It is Sep'2016 and Pennywise is back!<br/><br/>Bill, Beverly, Ben, Richie, Eddy and Stan - the members of Losers Club back in 1989, all lead a life far away from Derry, in a hope to put back the horrible memories and move on for better. One fine day, they all receive a call from Mike, another member of the club who chose to stay back at Derry. The moment they hear him talk, they all could feel the chills already and they know It is back. Bound by the blood swear they made 27 years ago, they all have no choice but to get to Derry immediately to stop the Clown from taking more lives. Stan alone is not able to face It once again and commits suicide before even he could get there. Mystery unfolds at Derry when Mike convinces the rest on a ritual that needs to be performed by all of them to destroy It once for all. The only condition- each member needs to go alone and collect an artifact from their past that needs to be placed in the ancient pottery. In pursuit of the artifact, each one sets course separately just to experience more and more horror inflicted by Pennywise before they could collect it. Whether the Losers were able to succeed in their mission, is the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>IT stands unique in what it offers in comparison to other horror genres. While Conjuring, Insidious, Annabelle etc have their equally fair share of spine-chilling moments, IT also gets on to one psychologically. The very fact that It targets children and takes them in the most gruesome way possible makes us subconsciously detest what's about to come in the next to next frames. Also the graphic content that is shown on screens cannot be unseen for so many nights. While most of the Losers are shown to have moved on, Andy Muschietti (Director) has subtly driven the point that nothing gets away from the clutches of the curse, by showing that they are only going through the same at a different place. Bill, is still caught up in the mystery of what happened to Georgie and turns up as a mystery writer. Beverly escaped an abusive father only to get stuck with an abusive husband. Eddie moved away from his mom's control, just to get controlled by his wife all time. Stan as always is never courageous enough to confront. Mike never left Derry. Richie used his loud mouth and foul language for better. The only person who has actually become better and stronger is Ben, who has lost weight and is an architect now. The detailing given to every character and how they confront their fears makes the movie run longer and longer. Except for that, IT Chapter 2 delivers what it promised."
"ironhorse_iv","6","0","0","13 November 2019"," This movie did clown around a little too much in the gutter. Regardless, it was amusing enough to overlook most of the flaws even if the story didn't quite flow right.
","Considering the source material of the same name from author Stephen King is a muddled, excessive and highly gimmicky 1000+ page novel about a shadowy extraterrestrial being that exploited the fears and phobias of its childhood victims, by disguising itself with the form of Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsgard) to devour them. It makes sense for director Andy Muschietti to try to split the work into two films 2017s 'It' & 2019s 'It: Chapter Two' with the first one focusing on a group of kids known as the Loser Club standing up against Pennywise with the other with them as adults returning to finish the job of trying to kill it. For the most part, the first part kinda work, as it wisely cut off nearly all the outrageous dated or highly offensive stuff like the under aged gangbang, cosmic turtles and the Universal Monsters cameos. Instead they smarter use unique newer scares, swim in a quarry as symbolic baptism and working as a team as the main reason they achieve defeating the creature. However in the sequel, it brought back certain parts really didn't work & wrote new stuff that seem really jarring. One of them was the whole date clichÃ©s stereotypical homophobic attack with a plucky individual has nothing to do with the main plot. It felt unrelated. Also, what is with all the focus on sexuality orientation? That was never the main focus in the novel. It felt a little tack on especially with Richie Tozier (Bill Hader). To add on that, why is Pennywise targeting fearless adults in the first place!? The film could do better if it start with the naive girl gone missing. It would keep true to the lore. Nevertheless, that wasn't the only problem. Another was the Ritual of ChÃ¼d which like the novel doesn't really go anywhere. As an excuse for Losers to help gain their childhood memories back, it's pretty weak & lame. They seem pretty well knowledge for the most part of the gang's own history before trying to seek their tokens. To add on that, the awkward flashbacks to their younger selves was somewhat annoying & highly repetitive. The callbacks to the previous film just add to the sequel's bloat and erratic pacing. Muschietti has over 4 hours of footage because of that. He states that he plans to use the unused footage for a possible future film or a super cut. Either way, the child performances in this movie didn't stand out as much as the last flick. Also the young thespians grew tremendously in the 2 years following filming. Because of that, they had to be digitally de-aged in some scenes. The final effect came across as uncanny valley bizarre for some audiences. In short, it's probably best that all the kid's scenes should had been cut to focus more on the adults for a tighter film. After all, I miss the catatonia kidnapping subplot involving actress Audra Phillips (Jess Weixler) than the group clumsily running around. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy much of their undertakings across town even if some of the clichÃ©s loud jump scares involving the creatures were pretty hokey and fake-looking like the CGI Paul Bunyan statue coming to life or like the leper attack with the oddly place random Juice Newton's pop song 'Angel in the Morning' playing in the background. Some of them had potential of being really scary like the witch. That's only if the filmmakers went 1980 'the Shining' room 237 route of showing a more realistic dead old woman rather than a silly wacky troll doll. Nevertheless I did had the most fun with the fear doors and the Pomeranian in spite of it not being that scary. It was funny. Even the bloodbath and being buried alive sequences were somewhat well done. However, there was still a tone problem. The way, the film intermixed comedy with the disturbing imagery aspect was a bit odd. Despite that, one thing the film should had drop was Henry Bowers (Teach Grant)'s subplot. Unlike the book, his presence here doesn't really add anything to the film. Plus it's really hard to believe that the character survived his giant fall from the last movie. At least, the film made the right decision by not adding abusive husband Tom Rogan (Will Beinbrink) to the mix. The movie only needed one villain: Pennywise. Once again Bill does a great job. Nevertheless the climactic battle between him and the Losers felt a little bit recycled from the last movie with the individuals overcoming their fears again. I would rather have the flood scene from the book. To top it off, I hate the film for making suicide seem like a good thing like some sort of noble sacrifice. Suicide is an incredibly tragic act and to frame it here as a calculated, heroic move is not only irresponsible, but dangerous. In truth, it doesn't make the group durable, it only passes the pain onto them, making it harder. To romanticize suicide, is going against the previous film's core message that working together make them all strong. As for performers playing the Losers. All of them individually were great in their roles with Isaiah Mustafa's performance being the weakest as he is given all the exposition dumps lines when it should had been Jay Ryan's character. Regardless all were great with their on screen chemistry with each other especially Hader, James Ransome, Ryan and Jessica Chastain with James McAvoy being the weakest due to his character not interacting much with the others. As for the cameos. I love Stephen King the best, but in the end, there's a recurring joke in this movie about a writer who cannot write a satisfactory ending to any of his novels. This is what I felt about this movie. Overall: While, watchable & lightyears better than the 1990 miniseries of the same name. This sequel didn't can't quite find the It-factor. It was mediocre."

","Ok, I liked It Chapter 2 but not as much as part 1. Not that pt2 is bad, it's not. As a stand-alone movie It would've been great. However, seeing as it's part 2 I have some caveats. 1) the runtime was way too long, I liked the fact it kept going from modern to present but it felt bloated in the middle. 2) the cgi is overdone and not effective. 3) there are some scares but I felt I was watching a thriller/drama instead of horror. 4) the ending was meh, again overblown ending esp the narration at the end, I felt like this movie was never going to end.
5) if pt2 was released as a separate movie with same title it would've easily worked, if you haven't seen part 1, no need as pt2 summarizes it perfectly, the problem is it's part 2 and I expected more.
6) it's worth a watch and I enjoyed It but part 1 was far superior.

","Opening back in 1989, as the Losers' Club enter a blood pact to again fight the shape-shifting evil of 'It' should Derry's streets and storm drains ever run red again, the action then jumps forward 27 years to the brutal death of Adrian Mellon (Xavier Dolan). Beaten in a homophobic attack, Adrian is thrown off a bridge into the churning river, only for a clown to appear on the bank and offer an outstretched hand...
Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only Loser who has remained in Derry, puts out calls to Bill (James McAvoy), Beverly (Jessica Chastain), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Ben (Jay Ryan) and Stanley (Andy Bean). They are scattered, memories tattered, but Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) is ready to greet them all. And he - it - remembers everything. Clocking in at nearly three hours (insert 'ballooning running time' gag here), It Chapter Two sees returning director Andy Muschietti craft a hugely ambitious horror blockbuster the like of which we've not seen since Kubrick's The Shining. Too long? Nah, its flaws lie elsewhere: the book's WTF ending works better on page than screen; Pennywise loses some of his scarefactor as his mythology is laid bare; the mid-section is episodic - a series of horror shorts laid end-to-end - as Pennywise terrorises each of the adult Losers in turn; and too many reality-bleeding-into-fantasy scenes featuring too much CGI make It Chapter Two resemble a latter-day Freddy Krueger movie. (A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 even plays at the pictures in one of the 1989 flashbacks.)
Still, huge kudos goes to Muschietti for once again capturing the essence of King's magnum opus. There are many glorious scenes here and a real frisson comes from seeing the adult Losers (all good, with Hader the standout) return to the Barrens, Keenes Pharmacy and, of course, the house of Neibolt Street. Themes of memory, identity and trauma run deep, and viewers can expect shivers aplenty; dread is just a part of it. The biggest shudders are of delight as It Chapter Two flip-flops between timeframes to chase the poignancy and sweet melancholy that King writes so well."

There some death here and here and it's sad, but the way the clown looked at some point was cute and not very monster like. Trying not to spoil so yeah otherwise this movie is a nice action adventure / mystery resolving ride"
"songbirdmc","6","0","0","5 November 2019"," IT lost its way : (
","Crappy review of my thoughts on It Chapter Two:<br/><br/>Oh how I wanted to love this movie. I enjoyed the original from 1990 (and the cast) and I enjoyed the first chapter. Unfortunately, this movie felt like a really weird, really long dream. Casting did a great job of matching the adults to their younger selves, but a few of the actors were just not present enough for me. Jessica Chastain and the actor who played Ben to name a few. Bill Hader was actually great, but I kept thinking he looked like Dwight from the office and it was very distracting. lol Same with James McAvoy. I was a mess because I kept thinking Ewan McGregor and Jason Bateman!!! Why!!!!??? I rarely get actors confused like this. smh The actors that played the kids nailed it compared to the adult actors, but unfortunately in this installment we saw the adults more.<br/><br/>Anyway, there were definitely some enjoyable moments from It, but it was very difficult to get the original version from 1990 and those actors out of my head. I wouldn't say that It is very scary and that was disappointing. It seemed more geared towards shock, comedy, surprise, and heart. If anything it was tense. The cameo from Stephen King was cool. What I enjoyed above all else was these amazingly solid friendships. I did enjoy the weirdness, but it was a bit too much. I enjoy a little comedy in my horror, but again it was overkill. Probably the best scene in the film was the fun house and under the bleachers. Oh yeah, where the hell was everyone at the Inn?!?! Were they too cheap to hire staff or other guests for the inn? Oh! Another weird thing! Just call me angel in the morning baby playing as poor Eddie gets severely vomited on by a rotting corpse. Seriously, what were the writers on? This is definitely a Stephen King movie for sure!"

I haven't gotten the cliff notes version, which is good enough for me, because there are things that I could NOT stomach that's in the book.<br/><br/>The group, the Losers were portrayed by some really perfect actors. James Mcavoy and Bill Hader are the best in the movie. But as whole the cast was good. They did justice to their roles.<br/><br/>Bill was perfect for Richie and he held his own against the others. But I really thought the role of Eddie was beyond perfect! James Ransone did a far superior job than his predecessor. And I actually cried when he died.<br/><br/>I felt their adult connection but no where near as much as their child selves.<br/><br/>But as far as pacing and scenes, it felt slow and fast at the same time.

"therevanchist-14739","6","0","0","29 October 2019"," It was decent
","I feel like the makers of IT seen the success in the feedback for the little bits of humor they put into the first movie so they decided to go overboard with it in this second film. Which took away from the horror experience to me. Instead it's more like mostly humor with bits of horror in there when IT is supposed to be a horror film. Obviously great performances from the actors but the other aspects of the film took away from what I was looking for in this film."
"spkydst","2","0","0","28 October 2019"," When you're so bored that you start using the time to critique why you don't like the movie....
","Honestly, I was expecting a lot more from It Chapter 2 after seeing the first film. I normally take a day to let the movie sink in before I try to write a review, but i was so bored during the movie that I used the time to start critiquing it while watching.<br/><br/>To start with, I just don't know how well It really translates from book to film. Even with two very long movies it just doesn't capture the essence of the book and ends up being an extremely long way to make the point that you should face your fears. Perhaps a mini series would be a better way to go with it.<br/><br/>
That being said, I'll move on to the actual elements of the movie....<br/><br/>I thought the casting for the first film was excellent. They couldn't have found a better kid actor for each of the roles. In the second film however, I cant say the same. I did really enjoy Bill Hader as Richie and thought he brought a lot to the film besides just his comedy. The rest of the loser club cast I just couldn't get behind. All of the characters felt so unimportant that I basically forgot their roles the second the movie was over. Maybe thats the point to the ""Losers Club"" and if so, it was very effective.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgard was just amazing as Pennywise! I thought so in both the first and second films.
I would have liked to have seen more full body shots of Pennywise though. I think Skarsgard really embodied the role and had he received more screen time to do full body acting... I think he would set the standard for the role of Pennywise. Unfortunately, the films go so CGI crazy that most of Pennywise's scenes are just a clowns head on some random monster body.<br/><br/>Speaking of CGI... there was a lot. And none of it was very convincing.
Also, I get that Pennywise is very personal as to how he uses each characters fears against them, but the vast array of ways he presents himself and does each scare is so different that it almost takes away from the fluidity of the movie. I think they tried to use every single horror trope there was throughout the filming.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you've already seen the first film... you have to finish the journey and watch the second. I will say that much. However, if this would have been a stand alone movie, I would definitely say to skip it.<br/><br/>I give It: Chapter Two 4 out of 10."
"anthonyjlangford","4","0","0","28 October 2019"," Unreal and Overcooked
","The problems with It II are well observed by other reviewers. It's length and wasted cast are far from the only problems however. It appears that the director has come to believe in his own mythology since the success of the first film, which was a very good, if not great horror movie.<br/><br/>This time round, he's tried to throw in everything into the pot to perhaps set up a career path into a more dramatic film future. Hard to say, but he falls way short of doing what he's supposed to, which is to create a gripping horror film.<br/><br/>Within the first 30 minutes, there are three separate incidents of white males perpetrating violence against innocent parties, that feels like it belongs in 1977, not 2017 when this story apparently occurs. More anti-straight white male bias dressed up as edgy cinema. Is this a film on gay hate crimes, police brutality and domestic violence? These things are not as common today as they were in the past, despite what the over-saturated, click-bait media may have you believe.<br/><br/>In any regard, he's thrown all three down our throats within half an hour and they really have nothing to do with the central plot of Pennywise and the kids at all. The Beverly situation in particular, was false to the point of being laughable. One scenario was more than enough. Instead of gritty realism, its cliched farce. Just get on with the story.<br/><br/>The adult characters, who haven't seen each other in decades are riding each other, quite harshly in a couple of situations, yet there is no normal adult reaction. Same when Richie (Bill Hader) has an interaction with a child in a restaurant. It's totally false. The parents do nothing. It's just poorly written. It feels like a completely different team involved here than the first film. I like the actors. I just don't believe most of what's coming out of their mouths.<br/><br/>It's not worth going on, tearing the film to pieces. It's simply overcooked, (like its CGI) with everything thrown into the mix, and more than should be there, like it's farcical lead ups, except what it should have, which is decent characterization and plotting. The actors did deserve better. It's a massive disappointment. Watch the 1990 version instead, or read the book. It's one of King's best."

"NourMartinez","7","0","0","21 October 2019"," The film that grabs defeat from the jaws of victory
","This should have been an amazing movie...
It had a great cast with genuinely interesting characters, and although it was cheesy at parts, to me that's expected from IT.<br/><br/>But somehow this film messed up big time.
The film derails from it's plot so often and it's so unnecessary, more than an hour is just completely reliant on flashbacks, which is supposed to get a nostalgic reaction from us, but I mean this isn't a film released in the 80's with a huge cult following, meaning that nobody got nostalgia from it because we literally saw those kids 2 years ago in the film.
And you know what, i'm not even gonna go into the CGI for the kids, just know, yes it's distracting, and no it doesn't get better.
And every single friggin' flashback was so formulaic<br/><br/>adult goes to a place and remembers a certain event that took place there as a kid, this event seems harmless to begin with but then he encounters Pennywise, it then flashes back to his present self and encounters Pennywise again.
Now i'd be fine with this but this happens with every single main character apart from Mike and each of these sequences are like 15 minutes long and they're all exactly the same<br/><br/>The story doesn't progress further than:
It's back
go to Derry
Freak out and have a 15 minute dilemma on whether they should just leave
Decide to stay and retrieve tokens
Go kill IT<br/><br/>It's literally just that and it's ridiculous. I mean if they had just focused on the characters as adults they would have gotten more done, it would've been a better movie but for some reason making the kids CGI and showing 15 minute formulaic flashbacks that don't do anything for the film that a 2 minute conversation couldn't accomplish is just really damaging for this movie considering that the scenes with the adults were amazing and there was a real connection and comradery between them, which is why it's so disappointing that this film is just made up of flashbacks and very little elements of the adults despite the adults being the stand out part of the whole bloody movie.<br/><br/>it had the recipe for greatness, but instead of going through with the sequel we wanted, they were reliant on flashbacks. That sucks.<br/><br/>
(Also, i'm not going to spoil anything, but for those who have seen it, I felt that the ending for It chapter 2 would've been more fitting for It chapter 1 and vice versa, it seems like they messed up last second on their storyboards and got their endings muddled up)"

","It is not bad either, at all, but leaves much to be desired in comparison to its excellent first part; his balloon deflates a lot, not so much but he floats very softly. It has some very good moments of tension l, quite raw and gore scenes, but in general it is a soothing hitter. ""It"" is not a clown, it is an evil entity that takes many forms and here they do not show it as such, in the first one it was well introduced but here they were limited with the character, they are still determined to only show Pennywise and do not show their true potential. Although the performances and the actors are very good, the ""companionship"" is not felt, only when there are flashbacks and they show them guys is when you notice that ""brothers"" atmosphere. Many times it is not understood why an adult is going to be afraid of something that feeds on your dreams and you already know that if you are not afraid of it, nothing will happen to you (of the children if it is understood, obviously) .The problem is the script and deepened to that the long duration that does not know how to build and spin the plot well; It has some scenes of other people's shame and also forced comedy. I liked Stephen King's cameo and the turtle references for example. I also liked the reference to Nightmare on Elm Street."
"skrolikowski","7","0","0","7 October 2019"," Not as good as the first chapter.
","On its own it would have probably been a memorable movie, but as a sequel it fell short.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first movie so much I watched it twice (the second time before seeing this movie). I found chapter two to be a bit weak for several reasons:<br/><br/>1) The origin story of IT seemed a bit weak and left more questions than answers. However it's a key part of the story for its conclusion, so it is what it is.
2) It felt like more CG was used and obvious in this chapter. This is probably due to the transformations of IT were larger this time around for the adult characters.
3) The movie was nearly 3 hours and there were several times I wish it would just end.
4) Pennywise (the clown) felt like a backseat character. Instead we focus more on the kids/adults, which at points drags on.
5) Some scenes felt unnecessary including the bleachers and funhouse scenes (I know this contradicts the last point :p)
6) The slow burn ending seems a bit cheesy. Horror movies deserve an abrupt, and uncomfortable ending to keep you thinking after.
7) Predictable jump scares where the camera pans back and forth. The most terrifying scenes in the movie were when Pennywise would just give a blank, uncomfortable stare.<br/><br/>However! I still enjoyed it for what it was. Pennywise is a great villain/monster character. At points the movie reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, with I loved the small town feel and I thought the cast fit the younger characters."

When I saw this sequel to the first movie, it really ties everything together & we see more character development in the main cast. Both 'Richie' ( starring Bill Hader) & 'Eddie' (starring James Ransome) characters really stood up for me, as they were both really funny.<br/><br/>I especially like the ending part, where the Losers Club destroyed Penny Wise, by not giving in to his scary appearance & antic, eventually diminishing him to nothingness. This is such a poignant statement in the movie, where we can sometimes giving in to bullies & people who were mean to us, but once we realize that we don't always have to give in to them & fall for their traps, their control over us would no longer have any effect on us."

.
I actually have quite alot of issues with this one, so let's get stuck in. First and foremost, the film is drenched in CGI, atleast one out of every 3 scenes was full of it, and after a short amount of time, it began to get really noticeable. Then there was the constant use of weak jump-scares, and the worst thing about that was, I honestly don't recall jumping one single time throughout the film. Then the runtime, I mean wtf, there were so many times throughout the film I felt scenes didn't need to be there. And finally, the balance between comedy, horror and drama was so off, for example, there would be a brutal or heartbreaking scene and then seconds later someone's cracking a joke or trying to be funny and vice versa, and that not only took away a sense of realism from the losers, but it also made it very hard to feel any emotional connection to the adult losers because I was never sure when I should laugh or cry.
.
Don't get me wrong, there were definitely a few times I laughed and 97% of the time it was thanks to Barry, I mean Bill Hader, who's an absolute star. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd is terrifying and terrific, I wish they had more of him in his natural state because those scenes were the scariest of all. He generally is a brilliant Pennywise and I honestly don't think anyone could trump his performance as the killer clown. The rest of the cast all did a solid job with what they were given, so not really any complaints there, the cinematography is beautiful, thank god Muschietti managed to successfully replicate the eerie atmosphere from the first, and although there was too much of it, I did enjoy some of the CGI scenes of monsters, a handful were quite interesting to say the least. All in all, its definitely a film worth watching, but it's ultimately a film that will be quickly forgotten."

","Unlike most of the world's population, it seems, I found the original ""It"" from 2017 decidedly so-so. I gave it just 2/5. Would the next chapter be any better?<br/><br/>27 years have passed since the terrors of the first film, and life in Derry, Maine has returned to normal. Indeed, all the kids who have left Derry and got on with their lives have mystically forgotten all that happened to them. The only one to remember is Mike (Isaiah Mustafa, channeling young Denzel) - the only one to stay in town. When Pennywise returns, like a bad-penny(wise) with heart-munching zeal, Mike calls all of his former friends to ask them to follow through on their blood-pact and return to fight their foe. All but one are set to return.<br/><br/>Mike believes a native Indian ritual may finally defeat the shape-shifting clown, but for it to work each member of the team needs to find a personal 'artifact' around the town. And that brings each of them into personal danger.<br/><br/>The film has some superb moments. A little girl, sat on the bleachers and bored with a school baseball match, is dazzled by a firefly and follows it underneath the seats. It is suddenly captured by white-gloved hands. Pennywise the clown emerges from the darkness, scaring the girl but with honeyed words persuades her to stay. And then....<br/><br/>It's a brilliant bit of film-making, and really should have been the start of the film to replace a rather unpleasant homophobic sequence.<br/><br/>There are a half-dozen other stand-out horror moments to enjoy, but they are scattered across the running time and never gelled into a satisfactory whole for me.<br/><br/>There is also a nice running joke about the ending of a film (within the film) not being half as good as the book; a clear reference to the poor ending of the original film that could never match up to the sexually troubling, and rather un-filmable, ending of the book!<br/><br/>The film really loses its way in the middle reel, when everybody wanders off alone in search for their ""artifacts"". Some of these sections are fun and deliver. Some are a bit lacklustre. But the big issue is that the approach, together with the regular flashbacks to the youngsters, makes the whole middle of the film extremely episodic. The heart of the movie is the interaction between the team... and this section saps all the momentum out of the film.<br/><br/>It sure is an excellent cast, with James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain both acting their blood-stained socks off.<br/><br/>Sophia Lillis is again extremely watchable as the young Beverly, neatly matching - both physically and emotionally - to Chastain's older character. (Note: there is a moment of marital violence in the film that might upset some more than the pretend horror on show).<br/><br/>My favourite turn in the film was Bill Hader as the stand-up comedian Richie Tozier. Always ready with a quip, but underneath it all a selfish and troubled soul.<br/><br/>Look out as well for a nice cameo by Stephen King himself.<br/><br/>One of the things that really annoys me in movies, apart of course from mindless voiceovers, is a finale that goes on and on and on. This is a case in point. After a final battle (which is entertaining if a bit twee and illogical) there are multiple ""final scenes"" that go on and on and on and then rather end as a whimper rather than a shout.<br/><br/>Directed by the original ""It"" director Andy Muschietti, I enjoyed this sequel more than the original. The cast is excellent and the ""episodes"" although inherently disjointed are good enough to sufficiently entertain throughout. It's not a great horror film in my book - I actually enjoyed ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" far more - but worth a watch.<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the internet or Facebook.

Talking about the story, it's great all the mystery about Pennywise, and they solving together, I just missed more deaths, and more horror and sometimes the CGI wasn't good kinda weird and funny(?).

"Nathan_Needs_A_Username","6","0","0","30 September 2019"," Movie Review: It: Chapeter 2
","I've been putting of writing this review for a little while now. That's because no film this year has left me more conflicted after leaving a screening as this one. To be transparent this was high on my most anticipated films of the year after the first film proved to be a surprisingly, emotionally resent and enjoyable horror film. Given the source material I was prepared for the second installment to be more muddled than the first but I was not prepared for just how meandering, uneven and freaking long it turned out to be.<br/><br/>It is easiest to talk about this film in chucks, so to start with the introduction is sloppy and strangely rushed given the overall run-time. It is hear that it becomes clear that the new cast are what is going to carry this film with Bill Hader and James Ransone in particular filling the screen with their presence right out of the gate. This is a well cast film with all the actors working well together and managing to capture some of the personality of their younger counterparts.<br/><br/>Once the losers club is reunited the problems start to show themselves. Most of this film consists of heavy dialogue scenes in darkly lit rooms with over the top and often corny lines being delivered in surprisingly engaging ways followed by big CGI horror set pieces that feel rejected from one of the Insidious sequels. These scenes will then be followed by one or two of the main cast walking in an unrealistically empty street for way to long, rinse and repeat for the better part of two hours before we get to the big climactic ending (which for obvious reasons I wont get into here).<br/><br/>The film also features extensive flashback scenes with the cast of the first instalment. For the most part these get in the way of the main plot and could have done with being cut down a fair bit but it is still nice to see first hand the connection these characters had as kids (even if the de-aging and voice manipulation gets pretty distracting after a while).<br/><br/>Don't get the wrong idea from this review however, this is one of the films it is easier to talk about the bad stuff than the good stuff but there is some really good stuff in here. As I mentioned before Bill Hader and James Ransone are both brillant and the rest of the cast also does a great job in their respective roles. I also think that Andy Muschietti is a great director, the movement of the camera and overall visual flare of the ""scary"" scenes makes me wish I could see him direct something with a much better script.<br/><br/>Steven King's classic horror novel is a strange, meandering mess that will forever be divisive. There is something to said about how both mainstream adaptations have been exactly the same."

","I expected to be more like the first movie but I was a little disappointed. There's some things in this movie that was pretty predicable, little cringe here and there, jumpscares were mostly disturbing and gross but not horrifying, and Pennywise was mostly the disappointing one out of the film. Despite these problems, I still like the movie. It's like watching a rated R version of The Goonies as adults, like I'm watching a 80's film. The characters were great, especially Richie. I say it's a okay film to watch, but you won't get any scares out of it."
"Tanay_LKO","7","0","0","29 September 2019"," Fair Scare, short of a few 'pennies wiser'
","This review is delayed, yet it seems befitting to talk about the sequel, cinematic adaptation of one of the most revered horror stories in modern English literature.<br/><br/>Part two, or say the continuation of the prior story, is 'not' all about the terrifying clown. Set about 27 years after the horrifying clown-spirit Pennywise was sent to hiding by 7 lanky teenagers (a.k.a. ""Losers""), the haunting resurfaces to the town of Derry - recharged and more sinister. Bounded by their blood oath, those teenagers - now adults, reluctantly return to their hometown for the end game. Though, it shall take more than their presence for those losers to be united. As they became what they were running away from, together recollect an unsettling, fearful past to nab the 'fear' of the present.<br/><br/>Scary, graphic and jump-scare thrills make most of ""IT: Chapter 2"". Much like its first-part, Director Andy Muschietti (""IT"", ""Mama"") and horror screenwriter Gary Dauberman carefully excerpt and modernize the even darker novel by Stephen King (who makes a rare cameo subtly criticizing his own story-endings). The allegory of facing fears as children to fight until death is remarkably executed. Given the master casting choices (with prowess and literal lookalikes to teenage actors) which include - Jessica Chastain (the girl-with-issues Beverly), James McAvoy (the stuttering Bill), Jay Ryan (the fat-boy Ben), Isaiah Mustafa (the black orphan Mike), Bill Hader and James Ransome (the latter two being brilliant as foul-mouthed Richie and hypochondriac Eddie) along with Bill ""The Pennywise"" Skarsgard, make worth spending nearly 3 hours in a theatre.<br/><br/>However, good an effort, this film feels deliberate. The terror-tainted background score (Benjamin Wallfisch, ""Blade Runner 2049"") is well-crafted with conventional operatic overtures and unsettling string accompaniments, yet there's too much of it. Then, just like King puts it, the film falters in concluding its characterization properly, making it look like a rush job of ending on heartfelt introspection. Though, it doesn't nose dive from its own previous benchmark of horror and would get your heart-pounding and even, laughing-out-loud on more instants.<br/><br/>So, there's no reason to leave this follow-up act out of your watch list for it doesn't (again, thankfully) do a ""Hangover 3"". Yet, for a few ""pennies wiser"", it would have been exceptional to match ""IT"" itself."

Speaking frankly, I really wish they developed Eddie into a man who overcame his hypochondriac behavior as he got older. I mean that's a personal preference, as everyone else did have some development in terms of when they got older and each ones backstory for the 27 year hiatus( which i do wish had more depth but the movie was already 3 hours... so what can I ask for?). As per someone I spoke with, if this movie was split into 2 where we saw some character development and lead up then the last movie was the actual fight...

","Thematically it's still a horror film, with fear-inducing topics, gore, shadowy beings, distorted realities and distressing scenarios straight out of twisted nightmares but practically, it's an action adventure film with an overreliance on CGI monsters to provide the scares. It's still a good film with a good story and a good cast of characters who show development and the monsters do look truly grotesque, both in appearance and the way they move, but it's never scary. The finale also drags on a bit too long but otherwise, it's a solid film."

","The First ""It"" was how you remake a movie. It redid what worked in the 90's version and reinvented what didn't. Chapter 2 was always going to be harder to pull off and it simply doesn't succeed.<br/><br/>After a promising start the movie simply plays it safe by doing alot of the same stuff over again. Apart from a couple of moments the film just isn't that scary, there are way to many call backs, and so much filler you wonder how the 3 hour running time here was ever justified. There is a good attempt at adding humour but that's also waring thin in the last hour, and I'd completely lost interest by the nonsensical finale.<br/><br/>Really disappointing. But Most of the Pennywise scenes are still well done."
"wkallao","4","0","0","25 September 2019"," A Disappointing, Boring, Uninspired Sequel
","Where do I even begin? This movie is literally terrible. I kid you not.<br/><br/>First off, the storyline structure is so messed up. The film is riddled with flashbacks of you Losers from the first film. The issue with that, is because those events took place in the first film, yet we never saw them - we don't care about those flashbacks! You cannot introduce something NEW in this film that supposedly already happened and expect us to care. A huge issue with these flashbacks is that it becomes formulaic. We get a flashback of one of the Losers, then we jump back to present day where they are in that location of the flashback. It's so boring and predictable to watch.<br/><br/>Because of this, Pennywiise becomes so overexposed. He is not scary. We see him so much in this film, we are comfortable with him, thus he has no threat anymore. Because a bulk of this film is flashbacks, the main story is incredibly short. Because of the flashbacks and emphasis on that, the Losers don't feel united until the end of the film. We follow them individually, and it isn't interesting.<br/><br/>Another issue for this ""horror"" film, is that is isn't scary. It's filled with cheap jumpscares and loud music. That isn't scary! There is creepy imagery, but that is entirely different from being scary.<br/><br/>There's so much ill placed comedy, that makes this film appear as if it was meant to be a comedy. It's...embarrassing. This film is tonally EVERYWHERE, and there are really weird, and disorienting editing choices as well.<br/><br/>I will praise that this film is beautifully shot, and Jessica Chastain literally carries this film. The ending following the climax is also very sweet.<br/><br/>Over all, this is a muddled and disappointing follow up. I don't recommend."
"rachelgallit","7","0","0","25 September 2019"," What I Saw Was Great
","I technically only saw portions of this movie, as for the deeply terrifying scenes I had my eyes closed. Given that the purpose of this film was to terrify and thill its viewers, I would say it was a complete success. The monsters were as grotesque as they were symbolic, and the demonic design of Pennywise never fails to make me quake in my seat. Where the movie fell somewhat short, was in the ending, which was to be blunt, rather lame. The group defeats Pennywise by simply shouting random insults at him, which devolves into a chorus of ""dumb clown"" over and over again. This seems like lazy writing and a dishonor to Steven Kings creations. Given this unearned victory, the happy endings that the remaining members of the group have feels baseless and a bit cheap. However, the acting and visual effects were both phenomenal, and while the emotional pieces fell short, this movie is a horror film in the end, and does meet the standards for that genre."

The ending on paper might be good but when i watched it on the screen i felt it was a bit disney channel-ish. I personally enjoyed the acting very much.
I never read the book cover to cover, but i can say is that some ideas and concepts might be awesome while you are reading in a book but might be underwhelming on the screen.

","I had my hopes high for this one. The teaser with the old lady creeped the bejesus out of me and I thought it couldn't go wrong. Well it did.<br/><br/>First of all, the fact that they couldn't remember anything about what happened and blamed Mike for tricking them was annoying. Why did you all drop everything and ran to Derry after Mike's call if you don't remember your oath or what's at stake? Why could Stan remember everything enough to off himself? Should have kept it like the book and have them meet up for Stan's funeral who never left Derry. The dinner scene was too long, trying way too hard to be funny (something that'll happen throughout the movie) and too early for a public, shared hallucination. Didn't like the beginning at all.<br/><br/>Splitting the group up to find their horcruxes was an all right idea but there were no rules, no structure, no instructions and half the time I couldn't even tell if they indeed found the artifact. They went for jumpscares rather than creepiness, except the old lady. Now for the hallucinations, I have nothing against CGI, I love it, yet here I felt like those incredibly scary body proportions of the monsters were ruined by those bright CGI eyes. It made them look cute in the face. I was so ready to scream at the theatre but once I saw the faces it fell short. I really longed for good makeup and fangs. The artifact search ended up taking a whole lot of time therefore most of the movie felt like one episode after another, and no engaging pace, no team work, no adventures.<br/><br/>The origin story was completely butchered by showing a 30 second blurry animation that didn't look like anything. And if you're not going to explain who the circus guy was and how the actual IT took his identity, just don't bring him into the picture. One photo? Really? Spent wayyyy too much time on the item search IMHO, should have focused on the origin story more.<br/><br/>The bully was not used efficiently at all. Felt super forced and I still don't get how he survived a stab wound to the chest. Another character with forced screen time was the neighborhood kid. They literally put him in the movie for the sole purpose of getting Bill angry enough to attack IT alone. Just lame... Didn't feel anything for the kid tbh.<br/><br/>The ending was horrible. I would still like the movie if it weren't for the ending. The person who came up with this idea should never ever come up with another idea again. Bullying IT to death?? Really? So anticlimactic, so boring, so stupid, so lame... Destroyed It's scariness and power for me. And they even had the perfect idea right there! The characters literally mention it! You are as strong as the shape you choose. So they were going to trick him into the tunnel, and attack him while he was small. That was perfect! Why not use that?!<br/><br/>And why was IT soo incapable? Barely managed to kill one. I mean if you're gonna kill off only one character then don't kill anyone ok? It's weird.<br/><br/>The opening scene was AMAZING as usual. That was story telling and scaring the audience at the same time. That animalistic bite and swallow of the flesh was soo cool to watch. And like I said three times, the old lady was creeuuuhhhhpppy! Loved it.<br/><br/>That's about it. Could have been great."

","Wrote the headline saying it wasn't as good as chapter 1 and went scurrying off to check how I scored the 2 movies. Don't need to change the headline as scored them 6 and 4. The major difference between the movies is that I cared much more for the characters in the 2017 movie. Consequently it was much more scary to watch than the 2019 movie where I cared little for whether the characters survived or not.<br/><br/>The movie is set 27 years after the original and don't think I'm giving anything away by saying Pennywise is back. The movie switches between the two timeline and it is impressive how little the original (young) characters have changed. Finn Wolfhard seems to age in each episode of Stranger things and yet he appears unaltered from the original IT here. Presumably they shot the movies back to back.<br/><br/>It's a bit long at 3 hours and it does tend to go for the shocks rather than suspense.

","Although the original novel is one of King's most celebrated and iconic, it really isn't anywhere near his best work. Featuring some of the authors most cornball horror elements and a baggy, unfocused narrative that strays into juvenile sci-fi at times, for me It is one of King's weaker novels overall.<br/><br/>So it's a shame that, with this sequel, the director has failed to marshall the more interesting elements of the source into an effective film. It is overlong, tonally jarring and many of the repetitive scares are like something from a kids TV show - I'm really surprised more hasn't been written about that.<br/><br/>I can't deny the calibre of the cast - these are all good actors - but they never play to their strengths, with the exception of James Ransone and Bill Hader, and the adult ensemble fail to gel in the way their young counterparts did in the first film. Between some toe-curling overacting from James McAvoy and Jay Ryan's total charisma vacuum, there isn't much to write home about. There are also big problems with the script and it is ultimately way too long, unfocussed and grossly sentimental.<br/><br/>There are some nice elements here and there and I get that Muschietti harbours a great love for the material but this really is an unexceptional film.

","Much like almost everyone, I loved the first ""It"" (2017). I also recently saw the ORIGINAL ""It"" (1990). So I pretty much knew how ""It Chapter 2"" was going to play out.<br/><br/>But honestly, I didnt really like this movie. The actors were great and all (except I didnt really like the adult Eddie for some reason?) , but the story and movie just wasn't good to me. There were way too many cliches. I couldn't believe it considering how good the first move was. For example, when they were all starting to hold hands in a circle, I was like ""Ben and Bev are COINCIDENTALLY going to be standing next to each other and make eye contact before holding hands""- and it happened.<br/><br/>Also, I wasn't scared of Bowers in this movie. I wasnt scared he was going to hurt the main characters with his little knife. It would of been more intense had he stolen the axe from the library, then his character would be intimidating and be important.<br/><br/>Also, I understand the first (2017) movie was successful, but they didnt need to make this movie FULL of flashbacks. Maybe they took notes from the 1990 movie that used flashbacks? But even then, flashbacks were only used to tell the story as the movie didnt begin with them as children like the 2017 version.<br/><br/>There were also wayyyy too many jumpscares, and very little plot. There was basically no main storyline. Pretty much flashbacks of things It did to them separately and them making jokes.<br/><br/>ALSO LETS NOT FORGET THE DEFEAT OF PENNYWISE. All I can say is ""Really?"" All they had to do is insult him? I'm sorry, but is this a little kids' movie? They could of insulted him and said mean things to him as children, and for what I could remember, they did, didnt they?<br/><br/>I never read the book, so I'm not too sure how much they wanted to change, but I thought it would of been nice to get a better idea of what their life was like as adults. Bev could of spoke about her abusive husband more and their backstory and why she stayed in the marriage. That way we'd be more connected to the adult losers like we were to the kid losers. Also, (again going against the book) it should of been Billy or another loser that stayed in the town rather than the one that did. Considering his parents died there horrifically and his family were somewhat mentally abusive and he seemed as though he didnt really have anyone to rely on, HE should of been the first one to leave that town and have a high ranking job as a way to escape his childhood. He just seemed obsessed with It, instead of growing up and growing into a person who got over the past.<br/><br/>I honestly wouldnt recommend this movie.

Thriller, horror - all was good enough, but the genuine story and developing relationship between the kids was what bought me in then and now, and this books remains my favorite one till present. I remember being much surprised about how the kids thought the same way I did back then, I could connect to their problems, longings, fears and hopes.

If you have not read the books, you simply cannot understand why IT does not kill them once and for all, but plays with them till eventually they kill IT. All IT's actions was ridiculous and meaningless, in most cases. Not even starting on SGI, enough said in other reviews (terribly overkill).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No growing connection and relationship between the characters, neither as kids nor as adults. Ben built the clubhouse ALONE before getting along with the rest of the kids (what a club house is this, if it is not made in the club?), the dam scene is deleted entirely (and this was exactly the Losers bonded together as a club), the Smoke ritual was made only by Mike and as an adult, the meeting as adults was soulless and tasteless in many occasions. I do not think the Club ever did anything meaningful together in the movie (except for the rock fight, which feels rushed and illogical, in the absence of the rest). Even the last collisions with IT were done individually (except the ridiculous end, but for this a bit below).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Henry Bowers (and the rest) role to drive the Losers together is completely missed, which made his participation into the movie completely unnecessary. In addition, while the book made it clear that killing Henry (which was much a victim of IT, as the rest of the kids anyway) was almost equally bad and helping IT, and though Henry did die in the book, no one of the Losers was actually aiming to kill him. This does not work in the movie - they split Henry's skull, and immediately continue to run jokes between themselves. Come on, guys, it does not make sense.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the book Bill was the natural leader of the Losers, both as kid and adult. His motivation as a kid for avenging his brother's death grew into an wider understanding of the numerous deaths of kids throughout the years, which kept him going and leading the Losers ahead of the collision with IT. There is nothing like this in the movie, they even made Mike the leader of the group as adults (come on, Hollywood, how politically correct you need to be? One Afro-American in the group, and we need to make him the Leader to keep all satisfied?)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The letter from Stan Uris at the end was a lazy and stupid way to explain something, which should never need explanation. And beside this is completely not coherent with the book as far as Stan's motivation to kill himself. Pathetic.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Beverley visions of the future - useless, meaningless, stupid, at best.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The end collision with IT had some potential - and I would understand if they beat IT though love and some natural positive power, or whatever. But they did kill it through bullying IT - calling IT bad names, swearing at it... Come on, guys, I know it is very difficult to adapt the complicated ending in the book, but so same lame a try is too much.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Finally, one thing which really upset me off, was adding a home-sexual thing between Richie and Eddie. Where this came from, I will always wonder, and the only reason I did not go out of the theater at this stage was that this came as a fact at the very end of the movie. Again trying to be politically correct or what, I simply do not understand.</li></ul><br/><br/>I can probably continue like this with a long list, but there is no need. As a resume, I do not think that anyone that enjoys the book (as I did) will ever like this adaptation, as it has very little (if any) of the book spirit and message into it.<br/><br/>For the ones that have not read the books (thus, not being able to connect the abyss of missing dots), probably it will not make much sense, but if you are into a following set of jump scares and overkill-SGI monsters, it might be watchable.<br/><br/>Finally, the mini-series of IT had their flaws, but they had a much better grasp of the book message and feeling, they had a heart and soul, and made me connect to the Losers, which is why I enjoyed watching them. Which is not something I can say for IT and IT Chapter Two."

","Twenty-seven years after they first encountered the killer clown, the Losers have all grown up, gone their separate ways, and settled into the uneasy routines of their respective lives, but when the ravenous Pennywise reemerges, they're summoned by Mike Hanlon (the only member to stay behind in Derry) to return and fulfill their blood oath to put the monster down for good. Not so much a sequel as it is a continuation of the source material, this time around Muschietti-clearly working with a larger budget-holds nothing back piling on the visual flourishes and gross-out effects (a bit too much at times) but makes a good decision to give his efficiently chosen adult cast a broad platform on which to explore their characters, and cleverly interweaves the narrative with pivotal flashbacks that allow viewers to revisit the young counterparts who set it all in motion. Devotees of the novel may be discouraged by some of the significant changes, and while it is difficult to maintain a consistent level of fear and suspense with the lengthy running time, it's still gripping and colorful, with some truly eerie moments, great dialogue, and a wonderful sense of humor, thanks largely to the work of Ransone and especially Hader, whose witty banter is a definite highpoint. A lot of fun, though admittedly it doesn't leave as lasting an impression as its predecessor. **½"
"connymalmgren","8","0","0","21 September 2019"," Awesome sequel in my opinion
","This movie really surprised me with how well made it was. Bill Skarsgård is awesome as always and I´m proud to be Swedish after watching his acting in both the first and second movie. It was a bit much CGI effects and I also thought the way of taking IT down was kind of weird. The fact that they ""made him small"" by kind of calling him weak and ""just a clown"" is in my opinion not that strong. I haven´t read the book though which I for sure will after watching these two movies. Kudos to all the actors also which all did amazing performances. For me this movie was intense and the length of it only did it a favor in my opinion. It didn´t feel stretched out and everything was well made. The factors bringing it down is though, as I´ve already mentioned, some plot related stuff and also the overuse of CGI in some points, I wanted to see more of Pennywise and just witnessing Skarsgård doing his thing, but, overall, it was a well made movie and it affected me just as a scary movie should. Also, the scenes with Bev and her dad was very intense, just as in the first movie. The movie had a way of always keeping you on the edge of your chair, which is important for me while I´m watching a scary movie.<br/><br/>TL;DR: 8/10, great story and actors, as well as nice monsters and ways of fearing the viewer. A bit too much CGI effects and some questionable decisions regarding the plot."

","This is a pretty long awaited film as the original was ranked as one of the best Stephen King movies ever. I agree and thought this movie was pretty good. The plot's pretty basic, with the Losers being reunited as adults to fight Pennywise. They have to perform this ritual where they sacrifice tokens. I will admit that the movie probably is too long. It's the longest horror movie I've ever seen!<br/><br/>The characters are still pretty likeable. Richie's my favorite and I could have sworn that was Dana Gould playing him. I liked seeing their future careers as I could totally see them doing those kinds of things as adults. The problem is that I just like the kid actors a lot better. I guess it's good we got to see them again for a long time! It's a nice message about nostalgia. ***"

","IT Chapter 2 tells the story of the seven losers 27 years later.

Now they released the sequel, and I will say that if you didn't like the old take of this part of the story then you probably will be walking out of the cinema with a grin on your face, this movie is awesome! There are some effective scares here and there, in one scene I forced myself at the back of my seat so hard, it was like the scene aqtually was happening. All of the actors here does a great job, we really believe that they are the grown up-versions of the kids. I would say that the best actors were Bill Hader and Bill Skarsg책rd. Now what I did not like. I think they should've had more Pennywise in the movie, most of the times it is Pennywise as something else we see on-screen. Also I might see how it could get booring at times for some people. And I thought the de-aging of Ben and Eddie was a little bit to obvious. Other than that I think it's a worthy sequel with a rating of 8/10 from me! Also can't wait for the supercut!"

I was so impressed by the way the film was made, the concept of it, the characters and the idea of feeling so emotional for them, feeling their fear and the way they have to go through this curse together. It was all so personal to them, so haunting and so scary.<br/><br/>The thing that I felt was missing in the film which I think would have been a great idea even though they may not appear in the book, was getting the people of Derry involved in the Curse. Reason why every 27 years kids go missing without a trace and people dying without a reason. That would have added so much more excitement to the film.
Adding also to the film is seeing people getting punished for the crimes they have committed, you will understand this part once you see the film specifically the first scene.<br/><br/>Anyhow I love the movie, it is long and very detailed film about the characters. It is more scarier than the first film and more tense from start to finish. I recommend it to all and to Horror lovers.<br/><br/>I give IT Chapter 2 a deserving 8/10"

The scenes with pennywise hunting children were kind of played off as jokes instead of being very tense like in the first film. Pennywise was a borderline comic relief character in this one. Also the parts that are supposed to be scary come across as silly because they have so many huge CGI monsters. This movie also resorts to cheap jumpscares for horror and the atmosphere isn't as nuanced as the first.<br/><br/>However, the acting is fantastic and the casting is perfect. All the adults look and act exactly like their younger counterparts, to the point where I forgot they weren't the same people. The characters are definitely the main thing driving this movie. All the scenes with them together are just fantastic. The weakest parts of the movie were the ones where they split up.<br/><br/>This movie's also way more accurate to the book than the original tv movie and it selves into more of the lore a little bit.<br/><br/>Sometimes this movie reminded me of Evil Dead 2, which can be a good thing or a bad thing for different people"

","IT: CHAPTER 2 - MOVIE REVIEW<br/><br/>""With more liberal editing and a tighter script, IT: Chapter 2 could have been the masterpiece that it clearly strived to be... 6.5/10<br/><br/>IT: Chapter 2 is the sequel/second half of IT (2017), directed by Andy Muschietti. Adapted from the Stephen King novel, Chapter 2 reaches for an epic conclusion to the story, with mixed results. While it has a lot of laughs and occasionally packs an emotional punch, the film is bloated and overlong. It also commits a cardinal sin of horror films: it's not scary whatsoever.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>Taking place 27 years after the events of the first film, Pennywise has returned to Derry, Maine to terrorize the town and feed on the innocent once again. The Loser's Club, now as full grown adults, must team up one last time to stop Pennywise once and for all. The film follows the adults as they reunite in Derry and form a plan to defeat Pennywise, while also drawing connections to events from the first film, as well as some moments we haven't seen before. While this flashback/flash-forward structure mostly works, and helps the audience to follow certain narrative arcs, it begins to feel tedious after a while.<br/><br/>It's important to note that IT: Chapter 2 has some of the strongest casting of any film in recent memory. Not only do the adult counterparts of the Loser's Club bear an uncanny resemblance to the child actors, but they also fully embody the same individual personalities and quirks. The ensemble cast has great chemistry, and they do a fantastic job of selling the humor, the drama, and the heart of the film, even when the odds are against them. Bill Hader brings a majority of the comedic relief, and delivers a lot of levity and fun to many scenes. Bill Skarsg책rd also triumphs once again as Pennywise, with his creepy voice, quirky humor, and that iconic goofy-but-terrifying smile.<br/><br/>The film also has some lovely cinematography and creative use of editing. There are several scene transitions which carry an element from the previous shot into the next, creating surreal effects that give the film a dreamlike quality.<br/><br/>It's a shame that other components of this film don't hold together as well. While the script attempts to tackle some of the mythology and themes of trauma from the book, the results are mixed. Certain character arcs feel more resolved than others, and the film gets sidetracked at times. Henry Bowers is revealed to have become a patient in a mental hospital after the events of the first film. Pennywise helps him to escape, and while he does temporarily throw a wrench in our protagonists' story, this subplot doesn't really go anywhere, coming to an abrupt end when he's suddenly killed by Richie.<br/><br/>The structure of the second act repeats one of the biggest flaws of the first installment, trudging through one lengthy jump-scare sequence after another. These set-pieces generally follow the same structure: a character walks into a building where a past memory took place. They then begin to relive that memory until Pennywise twists it into a nightmare, resulting in some goofy CGI monster which chases the character until they retrieve their ""artifact"". Some of these sequences are fun, but they could easily be shown in any order since they lack an overarching narrative momentum. The scares are so blatantly telegraphed that they often fall flat. Loud noises are startling and all, but none of these creatures come anywhere close to nightmare fuel.<br/><br/>Once our leads finally have what they need to defeat Pennywise, they journey back into the sewers to perform a ritual to kill Pennywise for good. While the final battle is entertaining, it's also underwhelming considering the lengthy buildup. While it's satisfying to see our heroes defeat Pennywise for good this time, it simply takes too long to get there.<br/><br/>Despite being uneven and needlessly long, IT: Chapter 2 is still entertaining and there's a lot to admire about it. It looks amazing, it's packed with great performances, and it has one of the most intruiging villains in horror history. With more liberal editing and a tighter script, IT: Chapter 2 could have been the masterpiece that it clearly strived to be.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"abhijith-alpha","7","0","0","19 September 2019"," Bill Hader shines in this less-than-satisfying conclusion to the Stephen-King adaptation.
","IT: CHAPTER 2
A REVIEW<br/><br/>Ensemble movies are always difficult to pull off. There are concerns with the character arcs, who gets importance and who gets not, and they get muddied by studio concerns about which actors get more screen time. An example of this would be the X-Men franchise, which, with the glorious exception of X-2 and to an extent, Days of the Future Past, never could achieve a satisfying compromise with storytelling needs and studio-mandated decisions.<br/><br/>It: Chapter 1 was a perfect example of the heights it is possible to achieve when everything happens smoothly. Partly because they were working with a cast of teenagers who, with the exception of Finn Wolfhard, weren't global stars and partly because the script demands it, and also because the coming-of-age genre and horror genre allows for such compromises. The Chapter 2 was always going to have to underachieve, simply because of the scope of the material that was left to cover from Stephen King's mammoth book, but also because of the lofty standard set by the first movie.<br/><br/>That being said, Chapter 2 doesn't disappoint too much. There are patented horror movie scares, although in lesser number than the first, which maybe affected the horror quality of the movie. Since It movies were designed as conventional horror movies, they needed to have more of them, unless they were leaning more into to the psychological aspects of horror, like the director Muschetti's previous work, Mama (2013), which borrowed techniques from Darren Aronofsky. The reliance of psychological and atmospheric tactics, when pulled off successfully, can bring great dividends, like Jennifer Kent's The Babadook (2014), which in my opinion is the best horror movie in the last few years. But this formula is difficult to pull off. Chapter 2 didn't pull it off, and the movie comes across as too much of a conventional horror film but without too many conventional jump scares.<br/><br/>Bill Hader shines among the ensemble cast as the elder version of the hilarious Richie Tozier. They found the perfect casting for both young and old Richie. The cynically funny, motor mouthed kid which hints at a complex character underneath is perfectly portrayed as an adult by Bill Hader, who might have been mistaken to be born for this role. His funny bone is kept at a balance here, without going overboard like the Marvel movie-style but doing just enough to provide a slight breather while keeping the tension intact. James McAvoy, as the older Bill, does his studio-mandated leading man, which I was mildly disappointed by, since he is, and remains, an actor who still brings something different to a Hollywood blockbuster, however conventional the role might be written. Jessica Chastain conveys the emotional weight of all the abuse that Beverly Marsh suffered. Even with the limited time given to her story, the abusive relationships that she keeps continuing to live on, and the toll the Deadlights had taken on her, is given a glimpse of in the movie, and is extracted by Chastain to the optimum effect as the capable actor she is. James Ransone is yet another flawless casting, as he embodies Jack Dylan Grazer's weird tics, twitches and mannerisms so well that within a minute of his being onscreen, even before another character uses his name, I knew this was Eddie. Jay Ransom, who played the Beast in the atrocious Beauty and the Beast TV series, plays the older Ben. Now all successful and hunk-handsome, he still has the young Ben's infectious warmth and serene innocence. Mike Hanlon, the kid with the least screen time in the first movie, gets the most in the second, is portrayed by Old Spice hunk Isaiah Mustafa. He alone has stayed back in Derry among the Losers, and therefore retains all of his memories regarding the clown, and has researched all these years, never believing It to be truly gone, and ready for the moment It returns. The haunting fear and old battle scars still remain with him, and it is yet again the difficulty of the medium which doesn't allow for a more detailed examination of Mike's personality and growth, severely affected by PTSD and secrets only he will remember and keep. Bill Skarsgard does his thing with Pennywise, making me think whether he should've been cast as the DCEU Joker.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is well paced, and I didn't know how long the runtime was until I came out of the theatre.<br/><br/>VERDICT: 6.5/10<br/><br/>A one-time watch"

","So from the beginning it's obvious its more comedy written than the original(with tim curry) and the remade 1st chapter. However, its needed to keep it afloat(get it?). I give a 7/10. 6 outta 10 for the casting and acting. Ive never seen a more grown up version of a character be more accurate, both eddies and richies adults are spot on perfect! The 7th star for being better than the 80s version.
The horror is not there. Every jump scare isnt scary. And the fears IT thrives off of are lackluster compared to 2017. But over all lots of fun. As with all movies, theres some bad parts and just, ""wait what?"" Like when ben comes down the stairs asking if bill left even though he never saw him even enter. Also richies told to be gay for one scene and then its never mentioned again. Also the bully friend who died in the 2017 film chapter 1 is back, but only seen as an ex machina to get the main bully out of jail and then drives the car and then hes gone for the film entirely. Whats that about? But if you like great acting in a goofy horror film, id say see it. Its a lil longer than need be but really a fun film."

","It's overlong and not as good as the first 'IT', but Chapter 2 still manages to be well worth watching.<br/><br/>There are some truly disgusting horror special effects, and a few jump scenes that of course most genre fans love.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie though HAS to be Bill Hader's performance as Richie... his constant humorous quips bring a levity to the movie that would otherwise be in danger of becoming too dark.<br/><br/>Compared to the original, there's less emotional pull to the characters because the plot is basically just an excuse for one elaborate scare after another.<br/><br/>Think of it as an uncomplicated rollercoaster of frights... which can be thrilling, and sometimes jarring for those who'd like a bit more substance with their screams.<br/><br/>If you are planning to see the film, watch it on a big screen.

"Appearance","8","0","0","18 September 2019"," It Chapter I & II vs. memories of the book and the tv mini-series
","When I was 12 years old, I saw a trailer on TV for the TV miniseries. They mentioned it was forbidden for the ""under 12"", so, of course I had to see it. What followed was one of the most scary but invegorating tv experiences of my young life. I could'nt sleep very well the following nights. Strange thing, though. I hadn't had enough. When I found a pocketbook display in the local supermarket with ""it"" part 1 I asked my mother to buy it .Well, I asked to buy directly the three volumes but my track record with books wasn't really great to say the least. Until then.
True enough, ""It"" made me start to read for pleasure. And I never really stopped afterwards....<br/><br/>I watched the TV miniseries only again once when it came out on DVD...more than 27 years ago...So, what follows is a review of both movies tainted by my 27 year old experiences...<br/><br/>I watched the two chapters in a double screening. The book was kind of being cut in two. It was the only way I could experience this new adaptation.<br/><br/>So I think the movie was great. I was not disappointed at all. This adaptation is one that the book deserved. Chapter II lasts almost 3 hours and it didn't seem that long at all!<br/><br/>The casting is great. Special mention for the adorable Sophia Mellis who portrays an amazing young Beverly.
The effects, the general creepy atmosphere. ""It"" is a great horror drama....<br/><br/>BUT...
(I feel a little bit like a daddy who's kid has great grades but is hammering on the flaws...so be it)
Three things bothered me.<br/><br/>First, one of the great things in the book is the sense of togetherness of the group. Stronger together... I missed that a little bit in this modern version. An exemple I can give is the way the ""cleaning Beverly's bathroom together"" scene lost all it sense the way it was directed and edited. I was like "" what the hell?"" And I think, in general, the main characters were more alone than I remember in the book.<br/><br/>Secondly, the appearances of IT felt a little bit too much. It felt like the director was showing off ...""See what I can do!!"" .A little voice in my head was saying ""why doesn't he kill them already?""(I know why....)<br/><br/>Thirdly, ""It"" is a being that feeds on fear. (that's why!)...That being said.. in this version we see IT eat/bite a lot....why?<br/><br/>Lastly, the whole origin story of IT with the Amerindian sacrifice ritual felt bogus and forced. Was that in the book?<br/><br/>Anyway I think they did a great job. I just needed those little grievances out of my system. The special collector director's cut box is probably going to find it's way on my shelf<br/><br/>Enjoy IT !;-)"
"Jurgonator","6","0","0","18 September 2019"," A big letdown. Boring, generic, riddled with jump scares.
","The first movie was okay, good even, thanks to the excellent cast.<br/><br/>The second one not so much. Again, the cast is excellent and they do their absolute best to make the viewing experience somewhat bearable.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me was the pacing. While I loved the first part of the movie, where the old gang gets together again. The dynamic is very good and I felt real chemistry between the members. After that, it just gets stupid and downright boring and at times, painful to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is silly. Which is a funny thing to say since this is a Stephen King fantasy. But still, some of the plot lines make zero sense. Obviously I'm not going to talk about them, since this is a spoiler free review. Lets just say that the middle part of the movie consists of a lot of rinse and repeat scenes with tons of unnecessary and boring jump scare scenes.<br/><br/>Jump scares. I don't know what happened with the creators. The first movie was scarce with jump scares, which is fine. I think the best jump scare movies are the ones with no jump scares. Get it? Jump scaring audience is an extremely cheap way to get a reaction. The problem is, after a successful jump scare, you're adrenaline leaves your body and you become indifferent about what happens next. Granted, I could see every jump scare from mile away and wasn't surprised even once. It's just a cheap cheap way nowadays. I would even label it as lazy film making.<br/><br/>The pacing. We're either going full throttle or standing still. There's rarely any build up. And the rare build ups usually end in a jump scare. The movie feels like it's almost 3 hours long and that's never a good thing. When your main characters are constantly in trouble but saved due to plot armor, you lose interest and never really feel the characters are in any real danger. That's a no no, especially with such an excellent cast.<br/><br/>The plot is silly. Well it's obviously silly by default when you have a human eating clown in the mix. But none of the plot lines in this one made any sense. I'd love to talk about them in detail but that would mean spoilers and even longer rants when I'm attacking individual scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, a big disappointment. I don't quite frankly know what this movie even is. Is it a horror? Not really. Is it a comedy? Not really. Is an action movie? Not really. It's just a hot mess."

","As a horror movie, it fails. Utterly. The CGI is cartoonish, over the top, and ends up looking like a anime version of Salvador Dali's paintings. It makes some scenes feel like a modern version of Roger Rabbits using cartoons and live action. It looks ridiculous.<br/><br/>BUT. I cried like a baby. I really did. The friendship between the protagonists totally pulled on my heart strings. I don't care how cheesy or predictable it was. I love the characters so much, I laughed at every single one of their jokes. Eddy is my favorite character ever and his adult counterpart lived up to my expectations. The casting is just... perfection.<br/><br/>So.<br/><br/>As a horror movie: 3/10
As a coming of age movie: 8.5/10"

","While not quite as good as the first one, and having a disappointing final form for Pennywise, these aspects do not serve to detract from the overall quality and enjoyment I had while watching the film. The cast was outstanding, the direction superb, and, for the most part, the writing tight. With a few missteps towards the end keeping it from being as good as it could be, I still feel that this film does justice to Stephen King's book, and even improves the ending of said book in some cases. Overall, I recommend seeing it
as, even though it doesn't quite reach the bar the first film set, it does manage to be an emotional and deep character study that engages to the end."
"helenbassett","8","0","0","17 September 2019"," IT: Chapter Two Film Review - Time To Come Home As Director Andy Muschietti Takes Us On A Really Long Stephen King Fun Fair Ride
","Andy Muschietti again directs the Stephen King clown horror as we open with the Losers Club swearing their oaths to return to Derry if IT resurfaces. And when the all grown up Isaiah Mustafa's Mike hears on the police radio one night that there has been a killing, he visits the site of the murder and finds a message for them written in blood. COME HOME. And for an almost three hour long movie it rattled along, to the point when it ended I felt there was more to come.<br/><br/>After the trauma of IT the members of The Losers Club have drifted apart and eventually lost touch. Living their adult lives with, in some cases, the same demons of the past. But now the horror they have since forgotten as adults has resurfaced 27 years later. And they need to return and renew the blood vows they took as teenagers. And reface the horror.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgard returns as Pennywise, taking a big bite out of Derry, and Isaiah Mustafa, Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, (great in Trainwreck), Jay Ryan, James Ransone and Andy Bean play the grown-up Losers. Although not too shabbily as they all have made successes of their lives. Except Mike who remained in Maine remembering their past.<br/><br/>And when Mike calls his old friends, none remember him or that past. Not even why they have a scar. When they do the intensity of the fear is rekindled. Dare they go back?<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain's Beverley has the foresight to see their deaths, of all the Losers Club members she was the only one exposed to Pennywise's deadlights. But she runs to Derry when she gets the phone call. Escaping her life. James McAvoy as a horror writer badly in need of an ending, is Bill, whose brother Georgie was Pennywise's victim in the original IT. And who Beverley believes to be her old secret admirer. Bill Hader is Richie. Stand-up comedy hiding a secret that Derry seems particularly bad at dealing with. Jay Ryan's Ben is the former fat kid, now a buff wealthy architect hiding away in his stunning masterpiece, and keeping his human contact to zero. James Ransome's risk averse Eddie is married to a plus-size lady, and she makes him just as neurotic as his Mom did. Lastly Andy Bean is Stanley who decides not to make the journey. To be honest I needed the recap as to who each character was, and the matching of the original kids to their adult actors was very inspired.<br/><br/>Those that have come to Derry meet Mike at a Chinese restaurant, in a lovely scene the years slip away and they're back as old friends. But the fortune cookies do way more than give good luck. With comic book gore that as a 15 certificate I knew wasn't going to be scary, but the fun fair effects were frankly disappointing. But enough to frighten off our Club members.<br/><br/>But Mike needs them to stay and perform a ritual on IT that he learned from a Native American tribe who had settled in the area years before. Explaining to James McAvoy who has assumed a childhood lisp brought on by his fears. Impressive and not unlike his Split characters. And they all need to be part of it. Even Stanley.<br/><br/>IT feeds on their fear and they have plenty. And each has to bring an artefact from the past to the ritual. The young actors from IT reprise their roles as we explore the source of the adults fear. I think Beverley's worked best with the creepy old lady now living in her childhood home. I don't know if Eddie's was even real. But how could Jessica Chastain scream like a girl, after her life and what she has seen.<br/><br/>Overall there weren't the jump scares that would make a horror scary. The horror was right at the beginning of the film, hidden in plain sight. And no town needs a Pennywise for that. But beware the bleachers and Fun House I would say, as danger lurks for any child who wanders off alone. And from my original review of IT in 2017, Derry loses a lot of children.<br/><br/>Although the film horror was a disappointment and I have looked forward to it for so long, the actors were fantastic. Bill Hader's comedy was laugh out loud funny and the interaction between the two casts very cleverly directed by Andy Muschietti. All the wonderful young actors are named in my IT film review.<br/><br/>And what of the ending in the rain sewers below the haunted house? Each of our Losers had their artefact from when their fear began, but they finally have to face the fear to find themselves. And in some cases each other. Again with the fun fair CGI effects, but it all seemed like there was a better story to tell. Like I said at the beginning something more to come. Pennywise was demonic wasn't he?, then make him demonic. As I haven't read the book I don't know how true the ending is, but I needed a big red balloon of a bang instead of a Harry Potter style rollerskating spider.<br/><br/>As a drama it worked very well, as a horror not so much, but the comedy was inspired. Watching Bill Hader and James Ransome trying to decide which door is really the less scary for them to run through was hilarious. Fingers crossed there's a cute puppy behind one of them. A great double act.<br/><br/>And Stephen King's input was noted, 'Here's Johnny' was unexpected but played in with the trailer for Doctor Sleep before the film. The follow up to The Shining.<br/><br/>And as a horror fan I'm already looking forward to that one so don't let me down."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","17 September 2019"," A decent follow-up and closure
","I'll start with an extract from my IMDb review of the previous ""It"":<br/><br/>""The movie is a commendably successful effort in adapting the novel to a standalone movie. But I cannot help feeling disappointed, as one who has re-read the novel several times over the last three decades since its publication. Some of the best parts have been left out in the movie, for perfectly good reasons (to customize a standalone movie), I do agree. Unfortunately, that does not change the fact that they are left out."" <br/><br/>I like the 1990 two-part TV version better. That one, incidentally, has John Ritter from the household-name series ""Three's company"" of the 1970's. There is also A-list actor Tim Curry portraying Pennywise the hideous Clown.<br/><br/>""Chapter 2"" in fact starts with the very beginning of the book when the protagonists are adults (who may not have even been casted yet, when the first part of ""It"" was released). On the whole, the movie stays reasonably close to the book the six earth-shattering phone calls.<br/><br/>The running time approaching three hours is too long. Considering that it is a 1090-pages (my paperback copy) book, the length of the movie, even if only it is half a movie, seems justifiable. But then, when I said it stays reasonably close to the book, I am referring only to the key plotline. The movie cuts out a lot, I mean really a lot, of details. For whatever is retained in the movie, the running time is too long.<br/><br/>Roughly, the movie is in three parts. The first, starting with the six phone calls, moves briskly to the reunion of the seven (minus one) ""losers"" in a Chinese restaurant in Derry, then how Mike finally succeeds in convincing everyone to stay, as promised, to finish what they started 27 year ago. The mid-section depicts how each one of them heads off for a private half-day experience that will hopefully help to bring back the lost memories, from joy to terror, and everything in between. The final third is the climactic battle, needless to say.<br/><br/>To get the bad stuff out of the way first, the scares in this movie are mundane at best, noise and loud. Grossly overused is this technique of a moment of silence followed by an eruption of loud and ""scary"" noises. When the eruption becomes a constant bombardment, you would wish to fall asleep but obviously cannot.<br/><br/>Not all is lost. The two stars in the cast, Jessica Chastain (Bev) and James McAvoy (Bill) are a pleasure to watch. The rest of the cast do a respectable job, particularly Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, as he did in the previous movie (as the only ""adult"" main character there). What I really enjoy seeing are scenes (alas, too few) of flashbacks to the pre-adolescent days of the protagonists. It's such a joy to see this talented young cast again,
particularly Sophie Lillis who plays, and inhibits, Bev Marsh with charm and defiance in equal measure."
"masonfisk","6","0","0","17 September 2019"," IT ENDS BUT I WISH IT WAS BETTER...!
","The sequel to the 2017 megahit now focuses on the characters from the first film, 27 years later, as they, as adults, must overcome their fears to defeat Pennywise once & for all. Focusing on the easier aspects of most modern horror films (the ubiquitous jump scare), this film works in fits & starts, strong when its uses its shock tactics & spot on casting to its good graces but then wasting them away by its rinse & repeat story construction which balloons the running time to nearly three hours. Some side characters are also given short shrift, namely a bully from their past & some of the spouses in the present, which are mentioned for the sake of the novel (& utilized better in the 1990 TV miniseries adaptation) but never truly integrated into the through line cohesively. A rumored longer cut may solve these issues ultimately when viewed w/chapter 1 but it's a shame the studio which released over nearly 20 hours of Tolkien material (The Lord of the Rings & The Hobbit trilogies) went the chintzy route for this masterstroke of modern horror fiction."

"selkjo","4","0","0","16 September 2019"," Had higher expectations
","The first movie was all right, but this was a let down even for the already pretty low expectations I had. In essence, the sequel (and to a lesser extent the first movie) was carried mostly by the acting and some few interesting scenes. However, the ending was really bad and had some really blatant and somewhat obnoxious symbolism and moral. Also, the ""scary"" parts of the movie weren't actually that scary, which is the thing a horror movie is supposed to do best. I believe the CGI was supposed to look scary and give a creepy vibe, but in a significant number of scenes it just looked goofy instead, and I found myself laughing when I should have been scared or at least felt tension.<br/><br/>Now, for one of the major aspects of film making: sound (mixing, track, sounding, etc.), editing and cinematography. I know too little about these aspects of film making to form a valuable or well justified opinion, sorry 'bout that. One thing I will note is that the sound mixing was pretty sub par with the audio being too loud or low in certain areas.<br/><br/>My largest issue with this movie is the cheap scaring tactics. The over-usage of cheap jump-scares and stupid tension building methods is especially frustrating when the movie shows small glimpses of brilliance when it comes to tone and atmosphere. Some of the aspects are very well done, but they get overshadowed by the same garbage everyone's seen a million times before."
"thesimplecritic","5","0","0","16 September 2019"," Long, Drawn out and Underwhelming
","It was always going to be difficult to successfully follow up the 2017 film, but this sequel falls well short of the original. With a massive 2hr 50min runtime this film is 45 minuets longer than the original and it feels every bit longer, this is due to the poor pacing of the film as it insists on visiting each characters fear once again for what feels like 20 minutes each, which gets very repetitive, very quickly, it's because of this pacing I found myself disconnected and often checking my watch. Without trying to spoil anything, the story is incredibly familiar to the first film and gave the feeling of watching a poorly re-hashed version of the 2017 film, but just with adults instead of children. I also failed to find this film particularly scary, its starts out well with some good jump scares, but the movies scares quickly become predictable and lose their effect, and the role of It or Pennywise felt much larger than in the other film and this greater screen time of the titular character led to his presence on screen lose meaning and fail to invoke the same sort of fear.<br/><br/>However, it's not all negative with this film, the casting of this film is outstanding with the adult's likeness to some of the children being almost scary, with Eddie played by James Ransome being the almost the spitting image of his younger counterpart. The acting is also great in this film with all the main cast performing very well, Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise the clown is outstanding again, unfortunately the good acting cannot make up for the poor writing and poor pacing, leading this film to fall very flat.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Gary Dauberman, as Screenwriter, has done a tremendous job of reworking and revitalising Mr. King's novella of a very naughty clown that comes out to play once in every twenty-seven years. This, being the second instalment of a double-bill, with the first chapter being released in 2017, but, both here is an amalgamation of the exceedingly atmospheric television movie (1990) of the same name.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two starts off twenty-seven years hence when our miniature heroes are fully grown-up and each having spread their collective wings and fled the roost that is small-town Derry, Maine, USA. Except one. The one, that is, recalling, reclaiming the flock to honour the oath that was once committed to each other twenty-seven years previously.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two has the best of both worlds, a schism if you will, in this, we see, more than simply a telling of the horror genre. We see horror in many aspects here, as expected, but what is interesting is that we see, also, melodrama, nostalgia, responsibility, reflection, guilt and deeper, more concerning adult themes of forbidden love, bigotry, sexual phobia, sexual repression and suicide and all within a strong context of friendship, honour, loyalty that builds into a framework of parallel worlds of the horrifying Pennywise and the bonds that were the young children of twenty-seven years back to concatenating old memories and events from the middle-aged adults.<br/><br/>What, too, exemplifies the charged atmosphere is the wonderful work from Checco Varese (cinematography) and all involved with Direction from Andy Muschietti to the many that gives here a more than spellbinding array of visual delight and astonishment. This is simply a gripping visual display of imagination and fortitude bringing together good & evil within one single conceptual chef-d'oeuvre.<br/><br/>With the illustrious Mr. Hader, the charismatic Mr. McAvoy to the distinguished Ms. Chastain at the forefront there is a significantly strong cast that bounces off each other projecting charisma that gives the film a wider sense of personality that examines the element of both youthful and older cast together. While we see the charm of Mr. Skarsgård and his goading of the main players, it is all here, and their respective parts that are more than the foundations holding this piece together.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is no circus.

","I don't know that I've ever anticipated a horror film more than It Chapter Two. The first film transcended the genre and created a thrilling and captivating small universe inside of Derry. So inevitably it was going to be difficult for Andy Muschietti and company to capture the same magic they did in 2017. The sequel doesn't necessarily live up to the high expectations of the first film, but it very well may be scarier. The Losers Club 27 years later contained just as much charisma and chemistry as the young kids, including a standout performance from Bill Hader (who continues to prove why he's one of the best talents Hollywood has), and I can never get enough of Bill Skarsgård as the titular It/Pennywise. However, the film is probably about 20 minutes too long and the ending doesn't necessarily stick the landing.

You have some typical horror scares but you also have some that are out of the blue. Some that are rather creepy and that helps give it its own feel.

And though Skarsgaard made a lot of efforts he never really reached Tim Curry's performance.<br/><br/>In It:Chapter two though, Pennywise was better ""written"" and Skarsgaard was more convincing...sadly, Skarsgaard's performance is mainly cut by too much CGI.<br/><br/>It seems that this Chapter Two wanted to be ""more"" than the first part. Scarier, Gorier, more violent, more disgusting.
Sometimes, it gives credit to the movie...but mostly, it fails to reach the objectives and makes the movie finally boring.<br/><br/>This fact is also due to unnecessary lengths like the ""artefact's quests"" of each character.
Some says that it deepens the character's profile, their story arcs;
the problem is that these arcs are unequal.
Bill Denbrough's arc's probably the most interesting where the ones of Richie tozier, Ben Hanscom or Mike Hanlon are barely told.
And most of all, these quests lead to nothing...Think of it, you could remove all these ""artefact's quests"" part and the ""failed"" ritual part using them and you won't lose a thing, the movie could still tell his story...
As for the long long long ending. All these lengths to finish by ""le'ts imagine him weakier than us and we'll beat him"".
Ok, The ritual of Chud is a battle of will but the way it is shown is really caricatural...Like the ""mocking"" of Apollon in Star Trek original series ""Who mourns for Adonais"" episode<br/><br/>As for the jump scares : use it too much and you lose the effect...After one or two jump scares, when the next one you're there, nearly saying to the director ""Ok guy! Come on, do another one quick so we can go through the story"".<br/><br/>So what remains : the actor's play...
Well, Skarsgaard was much better in this one, Mac Avoy is convincing though sometimes exaggerating his stutt...stut...stuttering!.
But not really enjoyed by the other's actor's play..well at least for the adult ones.
Isaiah Mustafah and James Ransone are OK; Jessica Chastain is inexistant compared to Sophia Lillis ""light"" and nearly each apparition of Bill Hader are boring.<br/><br/>So I would be unfait to tell the movie was bad but cut one hour of It:Chapter Two and you have something better"

James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader and others (sorry, don't remember the names of the actors) - they played just great and, most importantly, when you look at them, I see those same kids from the first film. Well, Bill Skarsgard was quite good, although I still think that Tim Curry coped with the role of clown (namely clown) much better. Separately, I want to praise the director of the film Andres Muschetti. He has a lot of talent and I hope he has a great Hollywood future ahead of him.

"benwallwork","7","0","0","14 September 2019"," A fun sequel that isn't as good as the first
","It Chapter Two is a fun sequel is by no means a great film. The film suffers from pacing issues, plot lines that don't really go anywhere, an over reliance on cgi creatures at times and many scares that are more silly than scary.
However, there is still a lot of fun to have with this fun, for example: the opening scene, while gruelling and disturbing, is extremely effective and creepy, the characters and casting, for the most part, are on point, many scenes can be creepy and it was interesting to see the writers include some lore from the books.
It Chapter Two is a strange balance of scenes that aren't scary or effective and scenes that are, however the scenes that aren't are still very enjoyable and make for a good laugh. Although it has its short comings, I'd still recommend IT chapter two, as it's a fun and enjoyable horror film and is genuinely filled with passion from the filmmakers."

"bbaki-15022","9","0","0","13 September 2019"," Worth the time and the money!
","I was really looking forward to this one, especially after the fantastic 1st part, which totally nailed the story on so many levels - the faithfulness of the story, the scares and the actors.
And then the first reviews came out for this one, I got scared: almost everywhere it was only called as average at best. Still, today I went to see it, and l was happy to do so.
I think, many people just view this story as a simple horror story. However, in my opinion, that's a big misunderstanding as the story of IT - as a whole - is not a horror. Not at all. It is a drama with horror elements. The book itself is one of the most important one of my library. Though, only having read the book twice in my life, it played both time a crucial part of that period; the first time as 18-19 years old - before heading to College and the 2nd one being around 26-27 years old. Because what this story is about? We all remember how we told each other in primary/secondary schools, that with those friends how we would stay always in contact, how our friendship would stand the test of time. Then you move on, and realize that how quickly you forgot those friends. As 18-19 year old, having read this part of the book and seeing how such strong connect can break up easily, it upset me, made me question a lot of things. As 26-27-year-old, I understood better, I saw other parts of the story relevant. Started to understand that its the part of the normal life, that people - who you call friends, and cannot imagine your everyday's life without them - just vanish, but still can be brought back when needed or called upon - you don't need serial killers to do that, it's completely fine, when other reasons lie behind them.
I agree with those, who say this film should be seen as a whole (part 1 + 2) and not a typical ""longer, better, scarier"" type of movie. For me this was a really, really good movie, where I have seen some brilliant acting, and seeing people learning to face their fears of their childhood - which they thought they burried, but was always a part of their life.
As negatives, I do agree, that the movie tends to drag at times, and some parts I found unneccesary or - due to the lack of time (when the film was also long enough) didn't get enough explaining, therefore their appearances being meaningless. Here I talk about Henry Bowers and the Silver; both got their screen time, but would have nothing happened had they had been cut from the movie. They just arrived and the movie quickly wraped up their part.
Some reviews critised the humour of the film. I didn't find it distracting, as I have seen the movie more as a drama than a horror, I didn't feel that out-of-place. I mean, okay, they weren't highly sophisticated jokes, but, easily could have been much worse.<br/><br/>All in all, I really do not regret seeing this movie."

","It was good, but not as nearly good as its predecessor. It mostly suffered from pacing issues and characterization. Sometimes, there were scenes that were supposed to be scary but they turned out to be really ridiculous and outlandish. Unlike its predecessor, they didn't really know how to utilize the CGI in the movie, and as a result, it looked a bit fake at certain scenes. In addition to that, the movie was a bit too long.<br/><br/>Of course, there were some good things in it as well, such as Pennywise himself. Most of the adult cast gave solid performances. Bill Hader as old Richie Toizer was good. Sometimes there were unsettling scenes, though they weren't that scary.<br/><br/>Verdict: despite its mixed reviews, and some issues here and there.

","Compared to all other Horror movies of this era, IT Chapter 2 provides some very impressive acting performances (notably Bill Hader & James Ransone). The story however, not so much.

The rest is mildly entertaining and provides a very forgettable plot. So it is a 7/10 as strong casting made a huge difference in the final presentation.

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","7","0","0","11 September 2019"," What happened?
","About a year and a half ago (I believe) we were served with a truly remarkable yet slightly flawed adaptation of IT, one of Stephen King's best novels. Splitting the narrative into two movies was a good idea, as a 1100+ pages novel would be quite troublesome to adapt into a single (watchable) movie. However, these two movies should function as a whole yet they do not. This movie, by definition, cannot be defined as a horror (because there is none) but more of an adventure/mystery movie with certain fright segments. But first thing's first:<br/><br/>1) The acting. The casting was top notch! Chastain and Mcavoy were brilliant casting choices but Hader was the one who stole the show alongside Ranson. Ryan and Mustafa were not bad choices either. However, only Hader and Ranson gave their characters some flair or character. Hader stole almost every scene he was in and the chemistry he had with Ranson was extraordinary. Ryan was nowhere to be seen. He simply lost himself in the midst of the other characters and was left completely unexplained. Mustafa was, specifically due to bad writing, simply a character that was poorly written and deviated from the source material almost entirely, leaving the audience with a completely wrong impression about him. As for Mcavoy and Chastain, this is a prime example of - I simply do not care - way to portray a character. They were unimaginative and uninspiring, she was emotionally blank and distant, especially in scenes with Ryan (he only segment where she should not have been) and Mcavoy simply had a busy year and I guess this movie was the last in line. There is no other explanation for his lethargic portrayal of Bill. Regarding SkarsgÃ¥rd, he did, again, a great job, but suffered due to a tragic lack of screen time and overuse of CGI.<br/><br/>2) The story. All they had to do was follow a simple and linear path King had in the book. Remove certain side stories and the main story-line is here. Why they decided to intertwine the adult stories with (again) their child counterparts is completely beyond me. Those segments destroyed a coherent and cohesive narrative, leaving the viewer with a sense that they are watching dozen small scare segments tied up into one. The smart idea would be that the grown-ups revisit all places the kids in the last movie got spooked and continue from there (why that was not the case is, again, beyond me). Not to mention that the part with the kids were not scary at all, and those segments were, at points, extremely CGI-ish so they take the viewer from the experience. Also, certain segments that should have provided decent scares were nullified by comedic elements (e.g. the ""Just call me Angel of the morning"" segment). Also, Pennywise was almost absent from the movie which is a shame as this part of the story should be considered his revenge, and it was everything but that.<br/><br/>Another great misfire was the direction and editing of the second half of the movie. Once the Losers split up in the movie, the direction and storytelling is all over the place with no sense of where the director or screenwriters were going or what was the overall importance of certain scenes. Most segments from this part were not in the original novel and that is really noticeable (even for someone who has not read the book). Ironically, for an almost three hours long movie there are story parts that are left unexplained (e.g. why is Beverly's key her totem) and characters left undeveloped (e.g. Bowers). On the other hand there were scenes that should have been completely left out of the final cut (e.g. It's second kill in the movie). Taking all that into account, it is no wonder that the movie is almost three hours long but the disappointing thing is that it would have functioned much better as a two hour standalone sequel focusing solely on the adults and only here and there referencing the kids.<br/><br/>3) The general lack of scares. This one I find most interesting. The movie is not really a horror flick (unlike the first one). However there might be a logical explanation to that. My girlfriend noted that as adults we do not scare that easily any more but are much more prone to anxiety and stress. She also stated that this movie should, taking that into consideration, be viewed through the eyes of adults, whereas the first one should be viewed through the eyes of a child. Henceforth, the first one is scary and frightful and the second one is not, but makes you feel tense and anxious at points. Considering that, maybe the lack of scares can be contributed to the prism of the eyes of the beholder - child/adult. Albeit, Pennywise did say - You've all grown up.<br/><br/>Finally, the battle with Pennywise is overly prolonged, lacks a definitive climax and is unceremonious. The latter being the fault of (again) hacking the character into several groups and (again) putting them into yet another stream of small segment scare scenarios. The end of Pennywise is, unfortunately, just the same as the rest of the ending - bland.<br/><br/>4) The direction. It could be a trait, but I still find it much more of a lack of experience. Movies should not feel as if they are interconnected small segments. The movie lacks a flow and is at points a bit lost in itself. This can, but doesn't have to be, the directors fault. However, as the first part has the same feel to it, I will be contributing it to a directorial trait that has to change in the upcoming future (especially taking into account that he is directing the upcoming FLASH movie).<br/><br/>5) It's actually entertaining. Despite all the negative aspects of the movie: the duration, the messy editing, the generally uninspired cast, the badly timed jokes and humor etc. It Chapter Two is a highly entertaining movie. It has a high re-watch value, it is light, it is funny and easy to comprehend. I am not sure if that was the goal of the movie, but if it was, it surely succeeded in it in every aspect. If it wasn't, well, it just accidentally achieved a high entertainment value. And that is not something many movies can say about themselves these days.<br/><br/>All in all, if you saw the first IT, see the second one. You will not regret it and you will have a good time. A shame that time was not a bit more scary."

"TheVictoriousV","6","0","0","11 September 2019"," Skarsgård steals an often underwhelming show
","My biggest problem with It: Chapter Two is that it isn't ""Chapter Two"". Rather than following up on the original film, only now with the heroes as adults instead of children, it instead emulates the original miniseries by cutting back and forth between the adult plotline and scenes with the kids, that could have been deleted from this film, lest the previous one seem like unnecessary viewing and this one too long. It is effectively a whole new adaptation of the Stephen King book (without the underage orgy, luckily).<br/><br/>We join the Loser's Club from the first It as they've moved on with their lives and, by some dark magic, forgotten about their encounter with ""It"" in Derry, Maine the summer of '89. It is only when the group is reassembled by Mike (Isiah Mustafa as an adult; Chosen Jacobs as a boy), the only member who stayed in Derry and thus somehow kept his memories, that the others also begin to recall. The supernatural in-Universe explanation is a front for clear themes of nostalgia, ""moving on"" and returning home, and they would be clear enough without lines about childhood memories.<br/><br/>James McAvoy plays now Jaeden Martell's character, Sophia Lillis grew up into Jessica Chastain, the foul-mouthed Finn Wolfhard became an edgy stand-up played by Bill Hader, Jeremy Taylor's ""fat kid"" evolved into a ripped Jay Ryan, and Jack Dylan Grazer became James Ransone. There is one more character who doesn't quite make it in, but I won't give away too much.<br/><br/>Even without my bias as a fellow Swede, Bill Skarsgård is spectacular as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, It's primary form, and the character does all the unnerving stuff you expect. He stalks, he lurks, he transforms based on his victim's innermost fears and anxieties, he mauls, and he terrifies. He also attacks a homosexual character, which was reportedly the final straw for the Internet journalists, totally not proving that these people are officially the dumbest f-cks.<br/><br/>Also involved are Javier Botet as the Leper, either one of It's forms or an image he creates within a given victim's mind. Teach Grant portrays an aged and insane version of the bully from the previous It, and Xavier Dolan has a decidedly unexpected cameo. Stephen King as a store clerk is a little less shocking.<br/><br/>Speaking of King, I don't know how well this movie fares in terms of faithfulness. It recaptures some of the iconic Stephen King silliness - willingly or not - but it is in many ways more moving and scary than, say, the original miniseries or any given adaptation that Steve wholeheartedly approves of. I'm told there's also supposed to be a giant space turtle, even though I could have sworn readers of King take him very seriously.<br/><br/>The movie is indeed rather silly when it doesn't mean to be, and often falls flat when it does. Nonetheless, it delivers in terms of excitement, performances (mainly Skarsgård), and a sense of nostalgia that even those not born in the '80s can relate to. It also has jump scares and a clown so the average horror viewer will get what they're looking for, no questions asked.<br/><br/>All the same, a more apt ""Chapter Two"" would have been a film that focuses on the first movie's heroes all grown up. I thought the whole point of following the children on their own in 2017 film, instead of playing both plotlines back-to-back like the original It, was to give the adults their own movie. Whether you want to make one King adaptation with flashbacks throughout, or a double feature with one film per time period, either option is fine. But I'd advise you pick one and stick to it."

I still can't help but think he lacked the sarcasm and snark that Tim Curry brought to the role; but he was good nonetheless. I thought the cameo with Steven King was cute.

Oh, and then they kill that clown.<br/><br/>The entire movie was a wasted opportunity. Instead of giving us a new story, they give us a few jump-scares combined with revelling in memories. And the big problem is: There are WAY too many characters to do that. The film gives us atleast 5 minute segments of ""I-need-to-find-this-metaphorical-artifact-and-regain-my-future"" for each and every character (except Mike), which are all basically the same. The character remembers something, then a jumpscare, more remembering and another jumpscare. But as a viewer, after the first one, you know that absolutely nothing is gonna happen, because to them.<br/><br/>And then there is this whole ""We-need-to-do-this-magical-ritual-to-capture-Pennywise-in-this-box"" thing. When I saw this I thought: ""Oh know, that's so stupid and doesn't go along witg the tone of the movies at all."" And then near the end we find out, that its been a lie, and I was relieved... only to realize that this stupid ritual thing nearly ruined half the movie for me because they kept talking about it and I kept thinking that its absolutely stupid.
There's one thing I didn't really get: Was the ritual thing real magic, but it just didn't work? (Cause Billie had the visions and all)... whatever, who cares? After all, it had nothing to do with how they eventually defeat him.<br/><br/>Whiiiich brings me to the greatest negatives of all: The ending/the defeat of the clown.
They defeat him by calling him weak and scared and small and a clown? Really? That's some outburst of creativity right there. It's one of the most stupid, half predictable (because we saw glimpses of this in the first movie), and anticlimactic ways to end a movie like this. Horrible.<br/><br/>It's funny how they keep making jokes about how Billy's books endings are so bad, when the really bad ending is the one of the movie itsself.<br/><br/>Now, there are positive things to say about this movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>the production value is great</li><li>the movie is (for the most part) quite engertaining</li><li>the dialogue is really funny at times (which is good, cause it has to compensate for the fact that the movie isn't scary AT ALL)</li><li>the acting is quite fabulous</li><li>vfx, music and cinematography are top notch</li></ul><br/><br/>That's it, had to say this :D If you came this far, thanks for reading.<br/><br/>PS: the movie was worth the 4euroes I paid for the ticket!"

"diegovivasscire","6","0","0","10 September 2019"," IT really hurts to put that score...
","The first chapter was awesome, a fun horror/fantasty/adventure story that had a great vibe to it, with likeable characters and nice performances. IT was the perfect commercial horror film. The lack of some depth to some characters was the problem. However this next chapter was so disappointing. I entered having in mind that this part was going to be different, and it was they just didn't do it good. We can agree that one thing that we all wanted was to be scared again and the lack of surprise and ""class"" completely that part of the movie, I mean at some point it felt like a Marvel flick. They are fun and good but the bad ones is because of how they mix the humor with the important stuff of the movie. Don't get me wrong I love that IT has humor but i don't want to see those ruining scary scenes. Also it's unnecessarily long, it has to many flashbacks and things that we already know and some that are not necessary. For instance, the first scene in 2016 was okay but the scary part ruin it... it would have been so much better to put in the beginning the girl in the baseball field at first and just extend that scene. Now, good things, the actors and their characters are great without a doubt but the lack of Stanley in the first one, made his suicide less impactful. Bill Hader/Richie was the stand out with James Ransone/Eddie, butthe crush between them wasn't very developed. The decision wasn't bad I wish it had more meaning...
Pennywise, agggghhhh, is hard for me to say it, ir really hurts, but left me with wanting something better of him, especially because they killed him by ROASTING (insulting, etc) him that was a shame. To many ineffective CGI that didn't help the horror like it did with the first.
The IT franchise is fine with his first chapter..."
"danielmanson","6","0","0","10 September 2019"," Disappointed on the whole.
","To save hassle I'll jump right in:
Negatives: it's too long, I felt there was certain scenes which served no relevance and were there purely the lengthen the film. Could easily shave 30 mins off it.
The plot was flimsy, we got no explanation into Pennywise, why he did what he did and so on. Certain scenes also happened then were never linked back to. Bill and Bev kiss midway (no spoiler) and it's never once mentioned or anything. What was the point in that whole scene. This happened multiple times.
The likability and relatability of these characters wasn't the same as the first film with the kids. Ultimately wasn't that arsed if any of them died. And if it wasn't for Eddie and Richie this would have been very very stale.<br/><br/>Positives: Eddie and Richie. Brilliant acting from both, especially Bill Hader. I quite enjoyed the small injection of comedy into this film, worked quite well.
The jump scares aren't too constant, something some horror films love to do.
Several emotions are done well. Funny, Scary, Intense, sadness and so on.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the plot let's it down. I could get on board with the length of the film it it all served some sort of relevance, but it didn't. I noticed a few in the cinema got a bit bored midway.
The first film is much better, but it's not all bad don't get me wrong. If you've seen the first you may as well watch this. Just don't have huge expectations.
6/10. It's not awful, but has plenty of issues."

","IT was never rushed and had a perfect flow. Though in some scenes the introduction to characters and their past seemed to be stretched but the transition from Losers memories to present day was flawless. With IT being a 3 hour movie, seemed to loose focus on the plot but those who have seen Chapter One, cannot afford to miss the 2nd part.
Full marks to Screenplay, Production design, Editing, Background Score and spellbinding VFX. Special mention to Bill Skarsgard as he has lived up to his character as IT. The only miss was the X factor of the concept. There are parts where you don't feel scared and IT failed to raise curiosity like it's first chapter. Overall a one time watch."

","Synopsis free*<br/><br/>We are in another golden age for horror, depite the multiplexes being dominated by superhero movies the horror genre is still filling seats and gaining critical praise.
IT chapter two is a special movie it sits at the top of the table crowned the horror king. This is because it is neither the traumatic horror of Ari Asters Heredity or Robert Eggers the Witch nor is it the popular James Wan conjuring series instead ""IT"" is the horror film the non horror fans come out to see. It plays out like a ghost train at a fun fair with laughter and screams in equal measure.
If i was thirteen years old and sneaking into the cinema to see this movie I would leave believing it was the greatest movie ever made. Just as I had when I watched a VHS of a Nightmare on elm street dream child. (The loser club walk past a cinema showing a nightmare on elm street 5)
This a throw back to the horror movies of the past full of monsters, snot, sick and blood.
However unfortunately being now thirty years of ages it didn't scare me at all and at three hours long it felt it.
Bill Hader and James Ransone steal the show with hilarious banter and one liners with Bill Skarsgard performance of pennywise the dancing clown reaching Heath ledgers ""Joker"" levels of perfection that will live forever in cinema history.
Altogether a fun ride but drags in places.
Outstanding performances by all

","This movie was good but the writing seemed labored, the jokes didn't work and there really wasn't a sense of 'togetherness' to The Losers. And for belaboring of 'endings not being good' it doesn't deliver one that is better than the novel. I checked to see if 'It 2' had different writers from the first and it did... and one of them was Stephen King. The running joke in the movie about endings was, no doubt, aimed at him.<br/><br/>It's scares really weren't as good as the first movie, either. Like I said, it was still good but if you're expecting a big crescendo this movie falls short. And not to give anything away but if the big ending rewrite 'solution' was the real solution why didn't The Losers just do it from the beginning? I really preferred the novel and mini-series version where The Losers just have at it."
"bcaffoe","7","0","0","10 September 2019"," Enjoyable
","I was excited when the trailer for this movie dropped. The first trailer for this movie had me thoroughly creeped out. The second trailer looked intense.<br/><br/>The week of release reviews were split, some enjoyed it while others left disappointed. This made me nervous going in, wondering if it would fall short.<br/><br/>I left the theater pleased in the end. I enjoyed the film and time with friends. We all left laughing and chattered about our favorite moments in the following days. Honestly, I would like to see it again.<br/><br/>That being said, was Chapter Two Academy Award worthy? No. Is it Razzie worthy? Absolutely not. Enjoyable is the word that comes to mind. One review I read mentioned said if there were a category in the Academy Awards for the casting director, they would deserve it, and yes, I wholeheartedly agree with that statement.<br/><br/>The casting in this movie is excellent. The adult actors nailed their parts, and it was complimented well by supporting performances from the child actors. Humor is tastefully placed throughout the film, offering levity at the right moments.<br/><br/>Of all the adult actors, Bill Hader deserves recognition. Seeing an SNL alum handle a more serious role so well is great to see. Some SNL actors just can't shake the shackles of being a comedy actor, but Hader successful blends humor with seriousness.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I went in believing Chapter Two would turn it up notch when it comes to the creep factor, but it didn't. IT (2017) is certainly the scarier of the two, which disappointed me.<br/><br/>At times, the film can feel a little crammed, maybe. The film couldn't focus on each character for proper development, even though it was about 3 hours long. However, the film colors in the background with added footage filling out the child side of the story, and for once IT's origins are touched on, even briefly.<br/><br/>The finale was better than the miniseries, but let's be honest, those of us who have seen it know there was nowhere to go but up.<br/><br/>In the end, Chapter Two is an enjoyable film with excellent casting and charismatic actors/actresses. Had this element been gone, it may have turned out much different."
"Solnichka","6","0","0","10 September 2019"," Mediocre at best ... why??
","First question to ask is, ""Why did they have to change the book THAT much?"" Ugh. Just silly, really, and hardly scary at all. The first film was better, and the ending to this one was completely unsatisfying. Were they suggesting that Richie was in love with Eddie his whole life? Don't hint at it, especially after that hate crime at the beginning of the film. Second, the movie totally steals from both THE THING (spidery head) and Ridley Scott's LEGEND (Meg Mucklebones? Really??) to create ""monsters"" that were more laughable than anything else. Third, the whole attempt at mysticism via Native American ritual was just token and flimsy. Were the writers trying to make a statement? If so, they failed horribly. Finally, it was WAY too long, and sadly, most of the best scenes were the flashback scenes with the kids. Was Steve Carell unavailable for adult Eddie? Seemed like they were trying to replicate him. Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, and Bill Hader were solid, but the rest of the cast ... bleh. If you read the book as a teenager yourself when it came out in the 1980s, you have to see this for closure, but it's a really disappointing film. Prepare yourself."

"davideo-2","7","0","0","9 September 2019"," Imperfect but still admirable concluding part to the story
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>When a series of child killings start again in the small town of Derry, Maine, Mike Hanlon, the one member of the 'Losers Club' who stayed behind, is forced to summon the other six back to defeat the monster they swore a blood oath to defeat. They have all gone and carved highly successful lives for themselves, but all make good on their promise to return, with the exception of Mike Hanlon, who commits suicide. Fuelled with a burning desire to honour his memory, they band together to defeat Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the evil clown, once and for all.<br/><br/>When the remake of the original TV adaptation of Stephen King's epic novella was released two years ago, it was easy at first to anticipate it being another throwaway, cookie cutter remake of the sort getting churned out on a pretty regular basis these days, but lo and behold it went and became the most successful horror movie of all time. This was especially appreciated by viewers like me, to whom the original novel and TV film had a special impact on their early years. And so, this essential second part, from the same director Andy Muschetti, has rolled around, wrapping up his interpretation of Stephen King's original source material. At just under three hours, no one could accuse him of being anything less than thorough, and while it's quite flawed, it's still a fairly satisfying endeavour.<br/><br/>Once again, Muschetti has gone all out and strove to include parts from the book that were absent from the TV series, including Adrian Mellon's brutal homophobic murder and the Ritual of Chud (although strangely the Bradley Gang slaughter is missing, odd since I'm sure I saw it featured in the trailer...editing floor), making it a more in depth and accurate account. But the best thing about it is....Pennywise. Or, more specifically, Bill Skarsgard's performance. He really comes into his own in the role here, bringing it alive and electrifying the screen with his presence. If his version of the role, and Tim Curry's from the TV film had been around at the same time, I would have struggled to differentiate which was more terrifying on the basis of this.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is not enough to detract from the hammy, over the top delivery of the grown up Losers (a problem with the child stars in the 2017 film too!), an equally roughshod description of some of the important side characters (most notably Henry Bowers, whose pact with Pennywise to bring down the Losers is never properly hinted at!), an uneven balance between horror and humour and an overly excessive use of loud, harsh jump scares that get too much after a while.<br/><br/>It scores more hits than misses, though, and is a more than satisfying closing chapter in this phenomenally successful 21st century reimagining (with even Stephen King himself making a self referential cameo.) ***"
"gigitville","6","0","0","9 September 2019"," It could have been better
","I wish this movie was better. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. There are pros and cons to every movie, and in the case of It: Chapter two, the cons are more prevalent, yet they don't necessarily outweigh the pros. It's a strange phenomenon that results in an okay, messy movie.<br/><br/>So, the cons. Something that unfortunately continues from the first one are the clanging jump scares. There are way too many of them, and they would be scarier without the super loud ramping music and the clanging sound effect. There were way too many Dutch angles and it got distracting after a while. You definitely felt the length of it, but it didn't exactly overstay its welcome. It certainly felt like a 2 hour 50 minute movie, but it was entertaining enough to hold attention. The movie felt pretty messy, and honestly, didn't have much actual plot. This was especially true in the middle where it was 90% scare sequences while the Losers found their tokens. The middle should have been where they each found motivation to face Pennywise again, and the things they remember when finding their tokens were supposed to convey that, but it just felt like they jumped on board defeating Pennywise.<br/><br/>More on the actual story elements, the whole element where they have to remember everything wasn't executed that well. About halfway through the film, it didn't really matter anymore but it also didn't come across that they remembered all they needed to. Plus, 90% of what they needed to remember, we've already seen in the first one. The love triangle between Bill, Bev, and Ben really wasn't earned and it didn't feel any more developed than in the first one. They had the same realization and emotional beats as the first movie. Plus, it was all Ben really had to do in the movie. He could have been the one to kill Henry Bowers so his arc was more about him finally overcoming his childhood trauma by defeating his bully. Honestly, all their arcs should have been about overcoming their specific childhood trauma. The only ones who really had complete arcs were Bill and Eddie. It would've been interesting to see a contrast between them as kids dealing with Pennywise and them dealing with it as adults, with maybe some fake out scare sequences where it's not actually Pennywise scaring them but it's their own paranoia and inability to know what's real making them feel like maybe it's not real. That would be an interesting obstacle.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the pros. The transitions between the scenes were absolutely creative and had some great cinematography and special effects. There were some pretty interesting and new horror sequences and imagery, like the drowning sequence at the beginning seeing Pennywise while bobbing in the water, or Pennywise looking like a carnie Bill Skarsgard in Bev's old apartment. In the middle third, there were a bit too many long horror sequences in a row and gave a messy feel. I really enjoyed Bill's arc with him realizing it wasn't actually his fault that Georgie died, though his whole arc with the other kid in Derry dying at the fair felt removed from the rest of the plot. Eddie's arc becoming less scared and believing he could be strong and defeat Pennywise was also really great. It's unfortunate everyone else didn't really have an arc. Despite the CG on some of the kids and the pitching up of their voices (which is pretty weird for them to do), the flashbacks with the younger kids were all enjoyable and added a nice nostalgic feeling. The casting for the adult versions of the characters was great and everyone really felt like the characters from the first one all grown up.<br/><br/>I didn't hate this movie. I just wish it was better. It could have been more streamline and better executed, with more thought put into the actual plot and character arcs than just the scares, but most of the horror was done well, and everyone's performances were great."
"trevmasterX","5","0","0","9 September 2019"," It: Chapter 2 full of humor to be scary...
","So maybe I'm in the minority when it comes to this line of thinking, but I'm starting to find comedy in the vast majority of movies to be tiring. Is it to sell tickets? Weak script so if you make 'em laugh, they'll like it more kind of attitude? Frankly I find it pretty bizarre and distasteful to focus more on comedy than horror when it comes to this particular story. The stakes are too high to be telling jokes. People literally die with one liners being their last lines of dialogue...wtf.
Not to say that it's ALL negatives here. There are some great moments hidden amongst the wreckage. The acting for the most part was pretty solid, within the more realistic and emotional moments. But we don't need one liners during situations of legitimate freakish danger...it doesn't work. If our protagonists don't seem to be scared, why should we be?
All in all, it's worth a watch, but sadly left me wanting more from a franchise that I personally felt fell into the same formula working for studios these days (Marvel I'm talking to you, etc). Let's make jokes. Lots of jokes. My family and friends are dying all around me...at least I saved money on my car insurance by switching to Geico kind of formula. I say let the genre remain the genre, and only insert bits and pieces of the others, in a much MUCH more subtle way..."

","It: Chapter 2 is one of if not the most entertaining film I have seen this year. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this film and that's both good and bad. Compared to the 2017 film, Chapter 2 is not great on a technical level but it's far superior on an entertainment level. Here are the negatives. The film does overstay its welcome. The runtime is 2 hours and 45 minutes long and you definitely start to feel that.There are certain elements that could have been removed from the film and it would have been better. The ending of the film is not that good either. It does a rapid tone shift after the climax which just feels off putting to what we just encountered. The visual effects are pretty bad. There are many different forms of It shown through the film and they all look pretty fake. It gets distracting when the form of It in the climax looks fake which causes that scene to lose any tension that was built up. My final issue is that the film once again decides to rely much more heavily on jump scares than actual concepts. The 2017 film had scary moments that were built up and didn't come off as jumpscares but every attempt at being scary in this film was a jumpscare. Here are the positives. I feel that this film is an example of perfect casting. Each adult actor mirrors their child counterpart almost perfectly. Their acting is really good also. Bill Skarsgard, James McAvoy, and especially Bill Hader are standouts from the film. Bill Hader steals every scene he is in. He's incredibly funny and is the best part of this film. The film is incredibly funny. There are many jokes or sequences in the film that are just drop dead hilarious. I feel that some of the funny scenes were intentional while others were not but I will give director Andy Muschietti props for making this film semi self aware. There a bunch of really cool and unique transition shots and the cinematography was pretty good. Overall, It: Chapter 2 may not be as scary as the 2017 film but it's vastly more entertaining thanks to a likeable cast and hilarious sequences. I give It: Chapter 2 a 7/10."

I could keep going but you get the idea.<br/><br/>So, I thought it was entertaining, fun, and extremely cheesy. Which is okay and of course expected from Hollywood. But I must say that the casting was truly great, minus Bill not being bald, ha. But over all it was alright. But If you have the intellect and discipline I highly suggest the book, cause man it's great! It's a novel about everything (kind of like Moby Dick, and yes like it was said in Stuck In Love), and not just a horror book. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"

","I left the theater having mixed feelings. I really wanted to like the movie, but it's just not on the same level as the first It (2017).<br/><br/>Chapter one was perfect in every way. I loved how genuine the young casts' acting was, and surprisingly enough, this is completely lost in the 2019 sequel. Jessica Chastain was the only cast member to capture Bev's likeness.
Likewise, I felt that the first it was much scarier, maybe because of how much Pennywise was teased before finally being revealed in all his glory.<br/><br/>This time around, we saw much more of the clown, maybe too much, with heavy CGI use. Some people might like this, but personally I felt the movie was very one tone and being almost 3 hours long, I was always aware of time passing.<br/><br/>Unlike the first movie, It chapter 2 wasn't as immersive or heartfelt even though the actors really tried. This is maybe due to the movie being set in present time as opposed to the nostalgic 1980s, but being based off of a novel, not much can be done in this regard.<br/><br/>Finally, I felt that the movie had too much emphasis on LGBT. Although the novel did hint to the sexuality of certain characters, I think the screen adaptation went above and beyond to be ""woke"", inclusive and relevant to a 2019 audience. The director could have spent more time creating a natural connecting between ALL characters instead of just two.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading"

","The director who must own stock in a CG company, who puts himself in the background of the pharmacy scene doing or saying nothing (M Night is not proud)
Who btw, only got It Part 1 on the strength of the first half of 'Mama' (before CG ruined that films ending)
Does the frustrating act of NEVER making us the Audience feel that any of the protagonists are in REAL danger!
Pennywise just likes to scare and scare and get an inch away from destroying any of the adult ""losers"" which will save him ultimately but relents EVERY time?
Now, It does kill Eddie towards the end of the movie to save face with King (who's got a fun cameo non-related) but that ""kill"" was there for It's taking anytime in a MULTITUDE of scenes which makes it less potent and really a peg for some much needed infusion of emotion.
Ultimately the Film is chalked with CG which makes the ""suspension of disbelief"" nearly impossible!
Horror films aren't cartoons Hollywood.
Please watch 'the thing' (1985) to see what real dread and practical effects can do!
Nonetheless,
With good source material from King and a ridiculously high budget from Warner, the director still couldn't out do the made for TV version.
Great actors weren't enough to save this ""what could have been film"" but there still is a few scenes of real tension like maybe best demonstrated with the girl under the bleachers.
WHY does that scene work?
Bc that poor little girl is in actual immediate danger!
Unlike the losers club for 95% their IT encounters!"
"MovieAnalysis","7","0","0","7 September 2019"," Are you ready to float again?
","IT Chapter 2 is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Stephen King and a sequel to the movie IT(2017). The film is directed by Andy Muschietti and stars Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, and Andy Bean as grown-up members of the Losers Club. Bill Skarsgård also returns as Pennywise.
The film takes place 27 years after the actions of the first part in the year 2016 when ""IT"" comes again to haunt the children of the town ""Derry"". All the members of Losers club are adult now and have left Derry except Mike. When Mike finds the traces of return of Pennywise, he calls all the members of Losers Club for a reunion and recalls them the promise they made to each other at the end of the first film. Will they defeat Pennywise again or it's his turn this time?
The film reveals the unknown secrets of the Losers. Around half of the film deals with revealing these secrets via flashbacks. Although it was fun to watch our beloved young characters from the previous film again. Pennywise is more horrifying and dangerous this time.
The main drawback of the movie is its length. The movie is approximately 3 hours long and we feel it while watching. The movie could have been 20 minutes shorter. The movie switches between emotions and comedy several times and hence we don't get connected to the main protagonists of the film. It's their childhood only which makes us care about them.
If we talk about acting, Bill Hader as Richie and James Ransone as Eddie were outstanding. Hader makes you laugh almost with every dialogue. I personally wanted more from Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy may because of their previous performances. Bill Skarsgård once again is fantastic and revives the character of Pennywise with his Deadly Smile.
There are too many jump scares and some of them really do work but at the same time, there are some silly scenes too which makes you laugh. I enjoyed the way Muschietti presented the movie. He differentiates between the true horror and imagination of fear.
If you loved Chapter One, you can definitely watch this Chapter too but just don't go with too many expectations and you will enjoy it."

","Was left disappointed with how this film went.. first of all casting choices were brilliant but I felt the adult didn't produce their potential. The children cast were fantastic. The movie felt more like a comedy than a horror. I was ready to my pants but watching it everybody just laughed. I did jump probably twice and that's about it. The movie felt too long. I dont mind a long film aslong theres enough to keep it going. Some scenes just felt unnecessary. The ending I expected due to the old version movie which is fine but IT seemed more of a clown with entertainment rather than a scary psychotic killer clown. I enjoyed the movie but did feel let down from what I didnt get from this movie. When someone gets a knife put in their cheek you scream with pain not calmly talk about the fact theres a knife in your cheek. Ah.. I do feel gutted with this! Such a shame!"

"andrealeonti","4","3","8","13 September 2019"," 'IT' is a really bad movie.
","Among the most anticipated films by the ""mass"" public in the world of cinema there was certainly IT - Chapter II, the final segment of the reinterpretation of the homonymous masterpiece by Stephen King by the Argentine director Andrés ""Andy"" Muschietti.<br/><br/>Let's start from the assumption that those who have read (like me) and loved King's novel live seraphic with the knowledge that we will never see on screen anything that can even get near the famous novel: it's true, this often happens for every film transposition originated from bestsellers, but for IT it's an even more affirmed discourse, given the complexity and the bulk of the work, but (above all) given the presence of much more devastating scenes than any sequence proposed in the derivative cinematographic works.<br/><br/>Starting, instead, from the end, if a horror movie (or presumed one) gets to make you laugh and get you out of the room indifferent and not ""disturbed"" there is something wrong with it.<br/><br/>And in fact, to say it all, in IT 2 there are many things that are not good at all.<br/><br/>Muschietti sins of excessive complacency towards himself and makes a film on the edge of ridicule: I cannot decide where to start from, and trust me it's difficult because in this film there are too many things that are wrong, so much banal and unlikely to arouse laughter among the public. The technical and directorial execution is not disputable (and God forbid, with all that budget) but Muschietti's direction has no soul. Blanda, insipid and austere: in almost three hours of film (THREE HOURS) there is not a single sequence, a single machine pass, a single roundup or shot that makes you awaken, now from torpor, now from laughter, and arouse in you attention or particular appreciation for the cinematographic ""eye"" by which the director has decided to tell his story.<br/><br/>Here, another problem, the story: Muschiett's IT does not convey the minimum of malice or ruthlessness that transpires, instead, from the novel, it's rather a psychopathic self-centered clown with personality disorders who enjoys becoming now an horny mummy who tries to make out with Eddie Kaspbrak, now a Pomeranian dog (yes!), and that enjoys, repeatedly and always according to the same reiterated scheme, to blow up helpless young children and turn them into blood-hydrants for pure personal quirk.<br/><br/>Third problem: SPECIAL EFFECTS. Here I really do not know where to start, a shameless and almost criminally liable use of CGI (which is however badly done). Thanks to the magical art of computer graphics, IT has lot of fun switching from one embarrassing creature (and to the limit of the comic) to another: first a mummy with a two meter tongue that begins to vomit on Eddie Kaspbrak on an improbable Dirty-Dancing-style music , then a nice old lady who after a few seconds of total paralysis (which would have made me run away as fast as I can) decides to bake some cookies for the poor Beverly Marsh completely naked (of course, right?). Stuff worthy of the best (or worst) comedies.<br/><br/>(Few) Strength points: good actorial play and a always hilarious Richie Tozier whose caustic humor always tears a smile (but will never make you laugh like IT becoming a pomeranian dog).<br/><br/>Big Love for the short but fantastic (especially for the ""aficionados"") cameo of the Master Stephen King, even if, if I had been in him, rather than making the appearance I would have sued Muschietti and the artistic crew, requesting the sentence to forced labor and the radiation from the world of cinema.<br/><br/>In conclusion: an embarrassing film, in the full sense of the word, a film that does not scare and that makes you laugh very much. Well, actually, the only thing this movie makes you want to do is to look for Muschietti and ask him to refund you your ticket."

Of course Bill Skarsgård did another awesome job as Pennywise, though I thought he was under utilized throughout the film.<br/><br/>The climax was rather anti-climatic, and really not suspenseful or exciting.

","Pennywise (played in another Oscar-worthy performance by Bill Skarsgård) returns to Derry, Maine after 27 years to feast on more kids (and adults?) in IT: CHAPTER 2. The Grown Up versions of the teen characters from IT reunite to battle him again. They are expertly cast and the best that we've seen of a set of child to adult Actors next to THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT.<br/><br/>We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of screen time that the teens got. It may even be up to a third of what the adults get. They look exactly like the same age as they were from the original, even after 2 years of maturation. That's because they were digitally de-aged and you cannot tell at all.<br/><br/>This is one of the better Sequels in a while that lives up to its predecessor. The story is a bit more complex and the adults all do a marvelous job of echoing their younger selves. We get to see more of what Pennywise can do as he pulls off more creepy illusions. The best part of these Movies is the dazzling visuals that the Director conveys. There's plenty of symbolism and this time around, we were very impressed with the sheer amount of incredible transitions. He uses these as effortless ways to show past events or put us in the shoes of the characters.<br/><br/>One of the cons here is its near 3 hour run time. Most of the scares and plot points work, but there definitely could have been some edits to bring it closer to the original remake at 2 hours 15 minutes. Scenes in the 1st and 3rd Act drag some and that does damper down some of the enjoyment.<br/><br/>This is still one of the best Horror Movies of 2019, in a year with many many disappointment genre pieces.

"thebricks","1","8","35","11 September 2019"," Could not believe how obnoxiously racist the script was
","I wanted to walk out but I took my mother who loved the first one and my dad tagged along. I could not believe how racist this movie was! In the first film, most of the kids were pretty much solidly middle or lower class. They were grounded. In this movie, all of the white members of the Losers do not just have good jobs, they are wealthy!!! Like, they are all white collar professionals who are likely millionaires, if not billionaires like Ben! Mike, the African-American, is the only one that is unemployed, driving a clunker from the eighties and possibly squatting in a building. What is up with that???!!! I've never seen a more ridiculous display of a microaggression by the writers in a movie in my life. In 2019, no less! I do believe the maliciousness was intentional, especially the contrast between all the vehicles the characters drive at different points in the story. How can you feel any sympathy for the characters when the writer constantly puts their white supremacist beliefs on display, using Mike as their punching bag? I mean, it's not even like some of them have normal, everyday jobs and like a couple are really successful. Mike is the odd one out. His present occupation is never discussed, he was like an outcast at the Chinese restaurant. The contrast between them is stark, glaring and not even acknowledged or explained somehow. The way such a likable character from the first movie was treated is so malicious, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth, almost like they are treating the character like a voodoo doll. Something about Mike's depiction just rubbed me the wrong way; so much so that I knew it wasn't just a part of the story, it was an angry, racist writer taking out their issues against minorities. Speaking of contrasts, at the end, Mike is shown driving away from Derry to Florida in his eighties beater, shortly contrasted with a scene of Beverly and Ben living the life on a gigantic, expensive yacht. None of Mike's so-called friends would even chip in to help the guy buy a $5,000 Toyota for his drive and new life in Florida.<br/><br/>Whoever wrote this movie really wanted us to know they didn't like Mike for some reason. The message has been received loud and clear dude!<br/><br/>As for the actual movie, it was garbage. There was too much Pennywise and I felt at times that I was watching a videogame. Some people claim that there was a need for Part Two. It is what I thought it was all along, an unnecessary sequel. The first movie was fine on its own. This was trash in every way. I really wish someone would call it out but no one is brave enough to, apparently. Lke someone mentioned, it's absolutely redundant, the same film with adults and a less coherent plot. I will not recommend. Worst movie I've seen in a long, long time."

Rarely do you see an actor give everything he has to his performance in every scene -- and do so with almost perfection. In my opinion, Bill Hader gives one of the greatest performances in horror history. I know that's a bold claim, but it sincerely reflects my position. The depth of his heart and humor held me captive every time he was on screen.

When I first started reading the book, I wasn't really captured by it. I put it away and didn't read it for some time. The next time I picked it up, I finished the whole 1200-page nightmare in little over a week. While not exactly following the events of the book, the first movie still managed to capture me and was a rather great horror film. Like the book, it relied on great storytelling and long-lasting scares. This one however, feels more like a interminable rollercoaster.<br/><br/>A great horror story is one that not only scares you while it is unfolding, but leaves you with permanent scars. It, the book, is one such example. Other films that does this are, Hereditary, The Shining, or Psycho. It's hard to see how It Chapter Two would fit into that category. It's an endless ride with predictable jump-scares and incomprehensible intercuts that leads to an unsatisfying climax. The ""horror magic"" from the first film is all lost through somewhat cheesy comedy and poorer script writing (perhaps suffering from the loss of one Cary Joji Fukunaga).<br/><br/>That said though, not all is bad. One thing they really nailed was how accurate the depiction of the adults were in regard to their younger counterparts. A few scenes, or parts of otherwise displeasing moments had me holding onto my chair. In particular the one where Pennywise lures away a little girl from her mother at a baseball game. Also while talking about the dancing clown, one cannot ignore the brilliant performance of Bill Skarsgård, who is scary good as the child-eating clown. Although this time around he had worse material to work with.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, probably the main reason why this film fails to scare, is because it's not gruesome enough. Which might sound weird, but in comparison to the book it is not even on the same level. The book is bizarre, grotesque, mind-boggling, weird, crazy, down right abnormal. If the movie feels like Stephen King was on pot while writing it, the book feels like he was on acid. Once in a blue moon I would say this: Skip the movie, read the book."

The last actually good scene was when the girl visited her old home and met Pennywise's daughter. It was funny, yet eerie and creepy - the true IT experience. They built up the tension really well - the woman smiling in the background, obscurred by the focus blur worked to a great effect, but then this naked giant cgi-grandma appears and the rest of the movie never recovered. The actors never seemed actually afraid either, unlike the original. Too busy cracking jokes I guess...

","And not in a good way. This movie was terrible. Way too long, way too goofy, it relies too much on comedy for some reason than anything else, the CGI monsters were so goofy looking they weren't even scary, the acting was over the top and just everything about it was just so unsatisfying. how useless and unnecessary they made Henry Bowers. In the book he plays a key role, here he's just a crazy dude that just happens to be there. God this is the most disappointing sequel I've seen in a long time. The ending was horrendous too, in the miniseries and book it's not as bad as everyone say it is (though the miniseries was kind of lame) but the ending to this one was so silly and I just hated it. I also don't get how critics were saying Richie's secret romantic love for Eddie was also in the book, I didn't think that at all. It wasn't even ambiguous. Such a disappointment for a sequel to a horror movie I loved (It the 2017 one) and it sucks because I worship the book and I had high hopes for this one. Wait till it comes out on DVD or something, the only way to properly adapt the book is an HBO or Netflix 4-5 part miniseries"
"mertafor","6","2","5","8 September 2019"," Was that a missing sequel of Harry Potter?
","I guess the writers were making fun of themself through Bill's writing skills: ""your book is really good but ending is terrible"". This explains a lot about this movie.<br/><br/>After I read several divided reviews here, I realized that terrible cgi and cheap scares are waiting me. I totally agree with those views. But honestly it didn't bother me much because I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of the movie. It was nothing to do with horror yet it was great entertainment. I didn't even care much about inconsistencies like some characters from previous movie came back from dead (IT is all about sort of hallucinations after all, but dead guy was driving a car!?). Going into these details might make this movie unwatchable because Pennywise only goes after children. So why our older losers club crew is still in danger?<br/><br/>Anyway, then the last 1/3 came. Oh boy, what a mess. I totally forgot what I was watching before. Losers club against some cheap spell from out of this world. I felt like I was watching a harry potter sequel. Apparenly writers saw the potential of first movie and wanted build a deep philosophy around Pennywise for sequels. However it doesn't add up. Some moment you show old pictures of Pennywise from a century ago and a woman claims that she's his daughter. It definitely looks instresting and creepy, gives hope for a potential back story. Right after that they come up with a place, Pennywise's ""den"", which existed for millions of years according to Mike. And Pennywise's possible back story is being swapped with an ancient power idea.<br/><br/>Story was basically all over the place. The main reason is movie has identity issues. Tries to be comedy, horror, adventure, fantasy and something epic. Being as a huge 80s horror / comedy fan, I must say this one is far away from the genre.<br/><br/>In the end although several issues, it's a watchable movie and deserves a 6.5/10. Could have been even a 7.5 by avoiding terrible ending. By the way almost 3 hours runtime?? It was completely unnecessary. 2 hours more than enough!"

","I thought very little of the first movie. It deviated from the book after the very first scene. This review isn't about that movie though. I gave this 4 stars as I thought first half of the movie worked really well and kind of stayed true to the book. All the cast members were excellent except whoever the actor is that plays Eddie. He has the emotional range of brick. Bill Hader did an excellent job! Awesome cameo as well by a certain person.<br/><br/>The movie starts going south when it's Ben's turn for his solo journey. From there the book is pretty much ignored and it starts falling to pieces. I don't want to even get into the ending of the movie. The ending is so poorly adapted that I thought I might walk out of the theatre.<br/><br/>Still. It got a whole 3 stars more from me than the first solely based on the first half of the movie. Some good shots, dialogue etc. Still wouldn't recommend it to anyone though. Read the book if you want a good story. Hopefully one day someone will make TV series out of this and give the material the attention it needs."

","I've been seeing tons of negative reviews for this movie on a number of different sites. By no means was this movie amazing/ a perfect 10/10 but I still found it pretty enjoyable. Don't go into this movie expecting to be terrified, as it was mostly jump scares and felt like a comedy during a lot of the scenes of the movie. Most of these comical moments coming from Bill Hader's character, who I feel like stood out the most from the others as I enjoyed all of his scenes. The casting of the adult losers club was phenomenal as they all had a striking resemblance to their younger counterparts. Bill Skarsgard did a great job playing Pennywise once again although a lot of the things Pennywise was doing was extremely weird.(Like when he sung and danced in front of Richie near the giant statue.) The scene under the bleachers, and in the fun house creeped me out the most, probably because it involved the death of children, and Skarsgard's performance. I will say, I found the ending to the final battle a little underwhelming considering all the losers club had to do was trash talk him to weaken and defeat him. My man Pennywise wouldn't have survived an old school call of duty lobby. Overall, a fun, and at some points trippy movie that I recommend seeing if you enjoyed the first film."

Skarsgard is once again amazing and is a reason to watch it alone. The story differs so much to the original mini series. Quite a few references to other king films which was cool and the ultimate Easter egg as well as King appears as the shopkeeper selling bill his old bike.

"jadediamond","7","2","5","6 September 2019"," Disappointed
","The only reason I'm giving this movie a C for effort is because I can tell the cast, the crew, the producers, director and everyone else attached to this movie put a lot of their hearts and souls into this movie. Yet, it didn't live up to the hype of the original. I began to lose interest in the opening scene where we see a gay, white couple at a fair and get not one gay kiss but two gays kisses and of course a group of homophobic white males beat them up. They also change the sexuality of one of the losers to homosexuality. Because heaven forbids if two guys have a close friendship where they occasionally make fun of one another, then it must mean they're gay. So IT has become a LBGT agenda movie. The movie had a good ending, but it wasn't any better thassn the original. While the scares of the original depended on Tim Curry and practical effect. This one depended on Bill Skarsgard and CGI. There were two scenes where I jumped. But for the rest, the monsters weren't scary, you can anticipate the scare, or the audience was tricked into thinking they were about to get a jump scare. The writers were creative and did their best to make this movie different from the original. They relied heavy on showing a lot of flashbacks with the younger cast to get those nostalgia moments and attempt to capture the magic of the first movie. But like the original, the adult cast were great, but they couldn't capture the childhood innocence of their younger counterparts even when they made juvenile jokes to one another as the adults. I did like that they gave Mike a little bit more to do. He got to narrate the scene after the opening scene, have a private talk with Bill, and help out with the final battle. I did love the storyline between Ben and Beth. It was different from the original, but it was a good mix of romance, horror, and angst. It wasn't a bad movie, but go in also knowing it's going to be an agenda movement. And this will be the new norm for all movies. Even if it has no place in the movie and feels added on, Hollywood is going to insert their agenda and if this is how every movie is going to be, then I'll be seeing fewer movies in in the future. Overall, it was an okay movie. It was more funny than scary. However, I won't be adding it to my It collection. I'm cool with the 1990s It and 2017 IT Chapter One."
"SinisterTwist","5","2","5","6 September 2019"," Both good and bad
","For anyone who is curious, this film does diverge quite a bit from the book and when it doesn't diverge, it liberally reinterprets. There are a lot of homages and plot points that will make some sense to people who are familiar with the book and/or miniseries, but may be confusing to those who aren't. (On a side note, ignore any reviews that state that you should have read the book before going into the film - the movie should be self-sufficient and shouldn't rely on the viewer having read the book, which would be poor storytelling.)<br/><br/>This second chapter to the IT story is a decent addition, however I will admit that it does fall a little flat when compared to Chapter 1. There are some great scenes and jokes here, however part of the film's major issue is that it takes a while for things to really resolve, to the point where this really feels like someone had planned for the second chapter to be two films instead of one because of how much they try to cram into this movie. There are plot elements that are fine, but just feel a bit superfluous, like they could've been removed and the timeline tightened a bit just so it is a little less of a slog, such as the focus on the little boy seen in trailers. To be honest, most of the child deaths in this film could be mentioned rather than actually shown in order to make the film run a little less long and the story a little tighter.<br/><br/>The story also feels like it shot itself in the foot a little with how much they changed in the first film. In the first movie Henry Bowers is pushed down a well, making it look unlikely that he would have survived - this in turn makes his appearance in chapter 2 a little harder to swallow, as it seems far more likely that he would have died or been crippled by the fall. (In the novel and miniseries he merely got lost.) There's no explanation for him emerging unscathed and while we could probably justify it via Pennywise, that just seems a little farfetched and it would've been a lot easier if the first film had just had him get lost as well.<br/><br/>That said, there are definitely things to like in this movie. The acting is fantastic and the cast is exceedingly well chosen. While sure, the movie feels overly long and the Bowers stuff could've been handled a bit better, it's still an enjoyable watch. The opening scene was also very well done, as it was really effective in unsettling the viewing audience with its human on human violence as much as it was with its Pennywise on human violence. I also liked the resolution at the end with the Losers and certain revelations that come to light, as that was a nice, yet unexpected touch. I have to admit that I did kind of like how they defeated IT - it's a huge change from the book and miniseries, but there was just something about it that was kind of fun even as it was kind of ridiculous.<br/><br/>Ultimately I think that this will likely be a movie more for the die-hards as its length and Stephen King references and nods will likely turn some of the casuals off from the film."
"mbald-93738","6","2","5","6 September 2019"," ""IT"" happens...
","Just got out of the theatre after seeing IT Chapter 2. This movie unfortunately felt a lot like the book, which if anyone's heard anything about the book, they know some things work and some things don't.<br/><br/>There are numerous scenes that would have elevated the film if there was no jump scares or have scary scenes be immediately followed by a zinger by adult Richie.<br/><br/>The tone in the first one felt a little disjointed at times but it over all had one tone: spooky. I can't really say the same for this film.<br/><br/>That's not to say this movie is a huge disappointment, the cast is excellent across the board, especially Bill Skarsgaurd, who was great as usual. There's one scene in paticular that I personally think was more intense than the Georgie scene in the first one (really well done). However, this scene can't carry the amount of okayness in this film.<br/><br/>There's a running gag in the film that involves adult Bill and how he's a writer, one of his books was apparently great until the end.

","Okay so I loved the first film, i gave it a 10/10. I'm not normally into horror films because of the generic jump scares and so on but IT is exception.<br/><br/>So to bascially sum up chapter 2, well it plays a lot on the first film, i would say a good 1 hour & 30 mins are just flashbacks to the first film, yes they are revelent scenes to get their items that they need to sacrifice to do the ritual. BUT that does not make a good movie imo, because in between the almost 3 hour run time, you get Pennywise kinda scaring the cast here & there, the scary things that appear this time are more funny than scary according to everyone in the cinema I was in at the time.<br/><br/>Then towards the end we are greeted with Pennywise's ""real"" form, some spider looking thing which wasn't really gripping imo, but the way they defeated Pennywise was interesting, ill leave that spoiler out :)<br/><br/>Yes there is still a great sense of humour in the film which I think we all love, the banter is still there from all the cast. BUT I do prefer them as a young cast personally, I think it just worked better BUT I understand that the films followed the books so I can't really moan about that.<br/><br/>All in all i understand some of my points might seem silly because they have to follow the books but hey, it's my view on this film<br/><br/>Overall though i would not watch this one again but have happily watched IT 1 numerous times now & still love it.<br/><br/>Age: 25 - Cinema Saw: Cineworld Stevenage iMAX 2D - Cost: Unlimited Card"

","The first one is better, but this beats the OG 90s version.<br/><br/>The good: Great acting, some real good scares, and an overall terrifying vibe. The casting could not be more spot on. There were parts that I found myself looking away for and parts my jaw dropped out of fear and horror. I can't wait to rewatch the original and compare them.<br/><br/>The bad: it is 3 hours, and it feels like it. The pacing sometimes feels off and the plot got a bit muddied because of it. There's also so much strobe effect, my head started to hurt which brought me out of the film.<br/><br/>It had some tone issues. Its a bad sign when you're in a full theater and 1 out of 5 jokes get a chuckle when the rest are met with silence. There were also too many unnecessary jump scares and unnecessary gore, which compared to chapter 1, made the horror fall flat.<br/><br/>After the success of chapter 1, it was hard for chapter 2 to not let some people down. I would love to watch the 90s one, then chapters 1 and 2, and compare them both to the book. I have the feeling out of them all, I'll still feel that chapter 2 is the weekest.<br/><br/>Either way, the series is strong and will forever be a classic and loved by many, including me."

"SGuiliano1064972","8","2","6","14 September 2019"," Don't let the Movie Critics prevent you from seeing this. A very frightening conclusion to the Stephen King Macabre Tale.
","All that I can say is, judge the Film for yourself.
It seems that when people went to see this film so far They negatively bash it. But you must forget IT CHAPTER TWO is the continuing story of The Losers Club returning to Derry, Maine and they reunite and their purpose is to destroy IT ""Pennywise The Clown"" once and for all.
Also, I must remind you that this is a horror Film and it's loaded with scares and lots of Blood. To me, I don't mind the CGI in it but it's better than the 1990 miniseries. Director Andy Muschietti has delivered a horror Film that can affect you in one way or another. Yes, there are Flashbacks but it's essential to the Story of the Losers Club when they are mature adults.
Another reminder, This film takes place in 2016. A more Hip version. But as I was watching this movie, I must say I was really into it.
The casting was great. James Mc Avoy is always good in everything he does. Jessica Chastain does a good job as the adult Beverly. Regardless if Amy Adams didn't portrayed her it didn't matter to me. They're both great actresses. Bill Hader and James Ransone work very well together and you can see the chemistry between the two when you look at them as Richie and Eddie as adults well. You can see they had to study the actors humor and how they mingle together as kids. Isaiah Mustafa knocks it out of the park as Mike who stayed in Derry and waited for 27 years until Pennywise returned. Jay Ryan and Andy Bean were good also as Ben and Stan. And finally, Bill Skarsgard is more evil and vengeful as Pennywise.
Most people don't realize is that the Losers had to confront their fears returning to Derry, Maine because they can't let Pennywise to continue murdering innocent children. So they plan and sacrifice so that IT will never return.
From my point of view, The Losers were still Kids again, though they were adults but as each member help each other they overcome their fears.
My own moral is this. We were all Kids and we all have childhood fears and at some point in your life you have to confront them. I can say that as well because I was a child with fears. And I think that's the point of this second chapter to Stephen King's classic novel. So, I really enjoyed it and it lived up to it's hype. The CGI, again, didn't matter to me. To conclude this, everyone is entitled to their opinion. But I can't wait until it's released on Blu-Ray.
My overall rating: 8.2"

"RforFilm","7","2","6","6 September 2019"," It Chapter 2 makes for a good second half, even if its too long
","You know why something like the Boogey-Man and Dracula are scary for children and not so much for children? It's about perspective. When your younger, because you don't have that understanding of the world, something like monsters seems plausible and hiding in the dark. The older we get, the more we realize that there's nothing dangerous in the dark except for our imagination. By the time we hit our twenties, it seems that the monsters have disappeared in favor of real life fears like criminals, work, and even of ourselves. The Boogey-Man isn't going to have the same effect on a thirty-year old.<br/><br/>In a way, the monster of It, Pennywise the Clown, is a representation of the childhood Boogey-Man; it makes itself into whatever children find scary, it hides in the dark and it only follows children (but it is willing to eat adults). Plus, taking the form of a clown is the best way for it to lure children into it's trap. I think this is why a lot of adults do have genuine fears of clowns. As a follow-up to the It movie of 2017, It: Chapter 2 brings the Losers club back to Derry to face Pennywise again.<br/><br/>Instead of the late 1980s, the story moves forward to the present day where a gay man missing (no thanks to Pennywise) and the only Losers Club member Mike (played by Isaiah Mustafa) who remained in Derry, discovers that they didn't kill the clown. So he makes the call to the rest of the losers to come back and finish the job. This consists of writer Bill (Played by James McAvoy), fashion designer Beverly (played by Jessica Chastain), now skinny architect Ben (played by Jay Ryan), risk analyst Eddie (played by James Ransone) and standup comedian Richie (played by Bill Hader. The only holdout is Stanley (played by Andy Bean) who commits suicide after getting the phone call.<br/><br/>Everyone meets up in a restaurant where Mike reveals that as the town Liberian, he's done the research to figure out how to kill Pennywise. Part of it involves them collecting items from their past, thus splitting them up to explore Derry once more. As they each go to their old stomping grounds, each has an encounter with Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgård). It's here their confronted with new fears, along with the possibility that Pennywise just may be too powerful.<br/><br/>The original It was a fantastic horror movie that I still highly recommend. Does It: Chapter 2 serve as a good companion piece? It does, though it's not as good as the original. A lot of the first movie was the fact that the main characters will children (all of them acted very well) and that we feared for them a lot more. It's not that I don't fear for them as adults, it's just not as interesting. I'll say it still works as all the actors playing the adult counterparts are really good. Of course the knockout is still Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise who remains just as scary.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it's also good. I've read the book It, and I was okay with it being split into two movies. It does allow the characters to explore their old hometown without it seeming like a rehash. They make it clear from the beginning that the losers forgot about Pennywise and their childhoods (likely a supernatural cause by the clown). It leads into a good encounter with the clown in his true form...that I wished would have been designed better. Without spoiling the look, though it's different, it's heavily reminiscent of the final creature from the miniseries. I think they could have gone further.<br/><br/>If the film has any major faults, it's with the running time. At nearly three hours, it definitely feels a lot longer then it needs to be. A lot of scenes will drag on really for no reason then to extend it. Along with that, the pacing can feel off (the first film had this problem too) when trying to combine the comedy and the humor. It's not bad, but it can also feel repetitive in spots where they encounter monsters they've seen before.<br/><br/>I'll give this seven Georgie boats out of ten. Despite its long running time, I was still satisfied with the end result and how this connects with the first movie. I'll be curious if they make a super edit of both movies together. It goes without saying that you need to watch the original before watching this. Otherwise, it's safe to float to the theaters."

This time, they're: Bev (Chastain), Bill (McAvoy), Richie (Hader), Ben (Ryan), Mike (Mustafa), Eddie (Ransone) & Stanley (Bean). Don't worry - there's plenty of flashbacks so you can recall who's who.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there's some humour, thanks to Hader and Ransone, but the others seem to kind of coast through - no one's bad in this, but no one stands out either. Unfortunately, for a film based around his psycho-killer-clown, Pennywise has very little screen time until the final 30min and you kind of forget what his motivation is. Being released so close to the first one, not sure we need so many prompts/reminders. That's the main problem with the film - it's almost an hour too long at 2 hours 50 minutes.<br/><br/>The second act where they have to each get a totem could've been done in a 10min montage, not a 45min drawn-out mini-mission for each character. There's a few good CGI bits, some jumps, some gross moments, but nothing truly terrifying. Still, wouldn't want to be watching this is I was under 12. Considering how tongue-in-cheek the film is with it's references to Stephen King and crappy endings, I'm not sure if the ridiculous ending is supposed to be meta, or is just poor."

","There's no substitute for the slow burn of suspense. Why do people equate being scared with gore? Roadkill isn't scary. Car accidents, whilst tragic, aren't scary. And CGI isn't scary.
Hollywood can't do humour or horror anymore and for the same reason. No subtlety."
"areatw","5","1","2","14 June 2020"," Despite a few positives this sequel is mostly hot air
","I wasn't much of a fan of the first 'It' film from 2017 and found this sequel to be generally much the same, only longer and with fewer original ideas. The CGI is impressive and the acting is good, but there's not much else I can say I appreciated about 'Chapter Two'.<br/><br/>The big problem I have with this film, and to a lesser extend its predecessor, is its running length. There's just no need for it to be anywhere near 3 hours long and there were ample opportunities for scenes to be cut or trimmed. There isn't enough depth in the plot and it really does drag.<br/><br/>The storyline is okay but rather predictable and quite clearly lacking ideas. It resorts to jump scares too often, most of which you can also see coming. Overall, while not a bad horror film, I won't be spending another 3 hours watching again."
"zoe-anthony","9","1","2","9 June 2020"," Great acting and awesome scares
","Wow wow wow! I mean this is part 2 of the newer version of IT! I loved the Tim Curry one, it is a fav. I have the book by Stephen King, but I don't actually remember ever reading it, so I do fall foul of watching the film before reading the book.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this second outing with the Loser club, took me a few mins to remember who was who etc but it was quick to remember and I am over the moon that Jessica Chastain starred in this, in my head she was always Beverley!<br/><br/>Ok so yes they have changed some of the famous scenes we all know, and kinda love but some of them were awful. But I mean in awful as in yes they were over the top but my god they actaully creeped me out!<br/><br/>Take the scene when the Loser club meet up as adults and they are eating their Chinese reminiscing and wondering where Stanley is, we know where he is!, and when the get their hidden messages in the Fortune Cookies, I was proper squeamish. I wanted to look away but I couldn't, it was so over the top but it was fasincating at the same time!<br/><br/>Same when Beverley goes to her old home, we have the creepy old woman running around in the background, the kinda glimspe and you miss it, doing the twitchy thing I hate in films, but when she bursts back through into the room.....well one part of me wanted to laugh at the thing coming out the other part of me was thinking WTHolyF is going on!! I was like that throughout and it was riverting stuff.<br/><br/>Watching all the Loser club, relive their childhood, trying to find their tokens to do the ritual brought back the memories they have lost and wanted to keep it lost. I know I would.<br/><br/>I loved the cast, mixture of the unknown with the known. I love the actor who played Eddie, and it was nice to see little Henry from Dead to Me.<br/><br/>This newer version actually worked for me, but I am open to discussion on different things. Yes again, things are different, and I can imagine that a lot has changed from the book (I will be re/reading it soon) but if you take it for what it is, a horror film then it works. A coming of age story, where the adults are still haunted, their life choices are dictated by the actions as children, still trying to make a path for themselves, yet held back by the actions from 27 years earlier, it works. Because of this, you feel their fear, you sense the apprehension of returning to Derry and facing Pennywise when all you want to do is hide under a cover and never speak of it again. It would have been nice to have the Club, together in more than a few scenes and really develop on what had started from the first film, but I still found myself rooting for them to defeat Pennywise, I mean they have to right!<br/><br/>It has made me want to pick the book up right away and re-watch Tim Curry Lorde it up as Pennywise. Where Curry is more comical and easier to watch, SkarsgÃ¥rd is bloody scary to boot!<br/><br/>Just make sure you have a spare 3 hours for this film as it's a long one! However, you need every minute of it and if you don't like a scare, maybe keep a light on."
"dazjohnson","7","1","2","8 June 2020"," Pleasantly surprised.
","The first chapter was good for the first ten minutes !! After half an hour it dropped away very quickly in my opinion to be a very boring film,so to be honest I did not expect much from chapter two either.
So I was pleasantly surprised to love the first hour build up to chapter two.
Don't get me wrong as an horror genre fan this is not scary at all, but it certainly is a much more entertaining watch than the first helping.
It reminded me of a darker version of The goonies and that is by no means a bad thing. The humour was good as this was much needed at the long running time.
As in the original IT films I think at nearly three hours long it was far to long in length.
But overall not a bad movie and would recommend it even if you did not like the first one. The acting was fine from the cast as you would expect from A lister Jessica Chastin and the ever reliable James McAvoy."

","Who is Pennywise, or rather what is Pennywise? Is he an exotic animal/predator? A wraith? An old ghost from the netherworld who can control who sees him and who doesn't? Why is the police/FBI sleeping despite a large number of kids disappearing? This premise is utter nonsense. Jeeper Creepers franchise had a similar one and honestly did a better job of making it consumptible than this duology has even though the visual/aural elements of ""It"" are far superior to the former. I haven't read King's book in which perhaps everything makes sense, but this review is of the movie, not the book, so let's not go there.<br/><br/>Whoever Pennywise may be, I'm convinced that he most certainly is the creative director of this movie, and a very selfish one at that, because it's only in the scenes involving ""it"" that this movie comes alive. The rest of the footage is just an appalling and boring mass of blubber containing never-ending, illogical character introductions and conflict set-ups. This movie is like Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's performances separated by long filler material. It was perhaps lost on the director that good makeup and state-of-the-art visual effects can't carry the burden of narrative for 169 minutes. McAvoy stands tall among the cast but his hands haven't the tools he can work his magic with. SkarsgÃ¥rd is awesome once again. I blame squarely the editor Jason Ballantine for this movie's failings, since it was his duty to ensure that the narrative be smooth, interesting, and agile, none of which happened.<br/><br/>I constantly asked myself, ""When will the director be done with setting up characters and make them proceed toward an enthralling and unpredictable resolution of the conflict,"" and I got my answer as my mother woke me up after my second slumber during the first 90 minutes, NEVER. I gave up after that, reached for my TV's remote control and shifted to another title on Amazon Prime. I give 4 points, one each for production design, makeup, visual effects, and Â½ each for acting and sound."

But the part about the town wondering what's happened to missing people isn't even touched upon. Then the last 45 minutes is the crew battling a spider like clown and back in that creepy house and it is just dull and not clever.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Skip this"

Completely pointless character that did not need to be in the movie at all.<br/><br/>They split up the characters for 90 minutes in the middle for each of them to get their token and experience a nightmare. They already experienced the ""it's not real"" nightmare before at the restaurant, so I don't know why they acted so scared and surprised when Pennywise scared them with illusions again.<br/><br/>The little kid at the Chinese restaurant was pointless. Phil follows him around for a while, only to have him be killed off anyways like the girl in the beginning. Not really necessary.<br/><br/>They also included a bunch of homophobic characters, because everyone that's not a main character in a Stephen King movie is a dick. A man gets beaten to death at the beginning for being gay and Pennywise eats him in the river, but neither of them reappear, making them also pointless.<br/><br/>It's also got your standard Stephen King cliches like the writer, the drinker, the scaredy cat, the commit, the unexplain psychic power that a character has, and so forth.<br/><br/>TLDR: This is the first movie done wrong."

The youth group of people raised outside Derry and re-untites by a call of Mike Hanlon, the black librarian, who never left Derry like the others. In a time the group is united and now strikes against Pennywise, the clown of their childhood, which stands as a metaphor of the pure evil.

Everything of importance is there. With a little bit missed out, and a little bit added here and there. So what?
Of course the book is better.
Come on! - The book is always better!
But, as adaptations go, this movie does a good job.
So much complaint about the use of CGI. Why? For God's sake have you seen the CGI in movies recently - it's everywhere! And there's so much thats worse than this, (Marvel movies - yawn). I found it to be of high quality with just the right amount of Stephen King type surrealism in the visuals.
Don't forget that much of the horror is in the minds of the victims, using their childhood fears against them. Hence the sometimes comic visuals. Surrealism.
Conquer your fears - you conquer your IT.
Can you not get that?
Were you ever a child?
As for scares. The movie has plenty, but it seems to have become fashionable to NOT be scared these days. Its either lame bravado, or no imagination at all, or sad victims of a need for gross realism in horror movies.
And as for being too long - because so many people now have such a limited attention span, anything over 90 minutes is definitely gonna lose their interest. You sad poor people. Watch YouTube.
Or, wait for Netflix to put this film on with a speed-up option!
This movie is well told, exciting, mostly true to the book and well characterised by the actors. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. There's too many reviewers only writing for the sake of getting out a complaint these days.
And pay no attention to the 'woke' generation who think the end is lame.

","The first IT came out of nowhere in 2017 and shocked me. It was scary, whilst also being funny, and the adventure the kids had to go on was riveting. Do I think that Chapter Two is as good as the first one? No, I don't. But I also think it's fairly underrated.<br/><br/>Most critics have labelled IT: Chapter Two as one of the most disappointing films of the year, and it's just not that for me. I actually think that this film is scarier than the first, and that's the most important aspect for a horror film to be successful.<br/><br/>The acting is also incredible, and I have to praise whoever chose these particular talents to portray the grown-up versions of the kids we had come to know and love. The standouts for me are Bill Hader as Richie and Jessica Chastain as Beverly, but everyone does an excellent job and they are the main reason that this film is as good as it ends up being.<br/><br/>The second act is clearly the worst out of the three. It's dragged out and very repetitive, but still has some good scares. If they had trimmed out 10 - 15 minutes from this portion of the film, it might have ended up on the same level as the first for me.<br/><br/>Alas, IT: Chapter Two is still a great film with some horrifying imagery and a heart-pounding score, and contains one of the best third acts I saw in 2019.<br/><br/>SCORE: 83%"
"ebookxtra","1","1","2","1 January 2020"," What the hell did i just watch? 3 hours of my life I'll never get back
","I can't believe this movie had the same director as IT Chaper 1. This movie was absolutely dreadful. Bad acting, extremely far fetched, baseless story, 3 hours of utter nonsense. I know you really can't make comparisons to the original tv IT movie but there's no comparison on how good it was to this. The beginning jumps right in and if you haven't seen the first IT recently you may forget the characters a bit. It seems like they tried to shove in all of Mike's phone calls to the other 6 in a way too short period of time. In the original when Mike called them they all had flashbacks and you really saw what they were up to and how they remembered Derry. The way this movie did it felt rushed and half hazard. The whole thing with Mike's ridiculous ritual was really way out there and so unbelievable. Here Bill I just made you trip on this drug root I put in your drink to see how the ritual will be performed. Did they really have to add a hate crime to the beginning of this movie because I certainly don't remember that in the book? Also the part with the little girl under the bleachers made no sense either. If IT feeds off of fear and is powerless without fear how did he eat a little girl that was standing there smiling and happy to come closer if she seemingly had no fear of him? Plus all of the ridiculous far fetched characters like the old lady at bev's old apartment. Her fear was her father not some monster like old lady. The original when she goes back to the apartment was perfect with her drinking the blood in the tea and such. The part with Richie in the park and the paul bunyan like character chasing him in the park was so ridiculous. The fears just didn't match up properly. The end blew as well. I don't know I can go on and on but this but it was just poorly executed. Ben's character had no heart, the guy playing mike was dreadful, the guy playing Bowers was awful and that whole thing was also very poorly executed. I honestly can say I'm severely disappointed and am thrilled I only paid $6 to watch this on demand instead of in the movies."
"andreifasola-927-3025","Null","1","2","30 December 2019"," Outstanding Hero's Journey
","I worked on this movie both on the acting side and the crew side - something most people can't say with any movies. I belong to several unions.<br/><br/>I saw the bad reviews and I believed them so I had to see the movie to see the way it came out. I had a chance to experience the sets and the props just like the actors as well as tearing the sets down. People complain about CGI and how the actors had to deal a lot with green screens - these comments are pure fantasy. There were a ton of practicals done for this movie. The props were there, the sets were built, they were massive, and the actors had something to fight back and interact with. I know because I was there. What you see is very real a lot of times. As you gonna see below - I do agree that what was CGIed could have been more effective if it wasn't so gimmicky, with so much movement, twists and flash incorporated to keep up with the modern trend of film making; they would have improved the movie if they would have taken the practical aspect further (people mention Tim Curry in a suit - less money, more practicals). I'm not sure if this was some big wig decision or straight from the Dir. - but if you complain about that, as if it's a deal breaker, I think you're missing the point of this movie entirely.<br/><br/>A 6.9 rating??? Really? Do you see any cheap writing, cliche movie making, tacky acting? This movie is ABVOE AVERAGE. Its acting is good to very good and outstanding at times, the writing as well; superb camera action, framing, lighting. Great sets and costumes. I agree that maybe the fear inducing moments were not as strong as could have been but they worked ok, and good at least 50% of the time. Above all: They contribute to the story telling well. And I think that being scared as a viewer is not the main point - you only have to understand that the characters are going through hell, not to be in hell yourself.<br/><br/>The fallback on trendy CGI indeed somewhat distracted from the storytelling (to a minor extent - I'm being critical here). If this would have been refined further with well thought out practicals it could have made this movie more of a classic (and less money spent for sure - maybe they should give Andy less money next time to force him to create better, not to be mean to him). I think, like I said, that it distracted from our understanding of how these characters are going through hell. The repetitive nature of it makes us anticipate; it dulls the moment. The dynamics, the whirlwind rotation of transformations, fairy tale like magic disorient and wear out the focus of the viewer. I think the writing team would have spent better time on creating meaningful actions of the monster's tactics, something that would have been deeply visceral to the audience as well as meaningful anchored more in the practical. The choices in the movie do that - ok/good as stated - but they are not as effective, they are not brilliant and everlasting, they are not classic moments. They are probably borderline gimmicky and borderline easy way out but still, in my opinion, they don't cross yet into the cheap slasher genre, they keep their effectiveness for carrying the story. Given how complex is the story - this criticism is asking a lot - and it takes some Kubrick level genius for that kind of ideal execution. To cross into that type of heightened visceral meaning it would take more time (something the studios rarely have patience with), more stamina from an already (most likely) worn out director and above all creative uber-genius, an obsessive mind wanting to give something wonderful back to the audience.<br/><br/>Most directors want to be outstanding. But being genius like Kubrick (or the likes) takes more than that: it takes wanting to suffer, to take upon madness, to go to the edge of sanity to find the unthinkable result. It's a superhuman level of endurance that normally goes further than normal good film making. To ask that of any human is mean, selfish and unrealistic. You are mean to ask this of Dir. A. M. .You can't demand of someone to suffer that excruciatingly for your entertainment - only geniuses suffer that much willingly because they revel into the creative process to that extent unlike most people that aren't able of doing that. Film making is very hard; Dir A M has pulled a lot with this one - give him that much credit.<br/><br/>I don't think this was a scary movie nor that it should have been. Not in the mindless slasher way, the cheap, summer release anyway. This is more: it is about fear, faith and belief. It effectively talked about that aspect of life that most adults try to fight back: the fear seeded into imagination that holds us down since our youth, the fear that cripples us and chases us into the hell of grownup reality all the way until our deaths. The fear that we have to fight and we have to conquer to live in peace.<br/><br/>This movie tackles life. It's not a shallow haunted house experience. It's a movie with substance that makes you care.<br/><br/>This is a True Hero's Journey that takes the role of teaching. It makes the viewer CARE about the protagonists - something most movies fail to pull off these days in Hollywood productions. It's a movie that teaches through experience, that gives back, it rewards the viewer in a positive way - it makes the viewer grow wiser by having went through this experience.<br/><br/>It is very well directed - above average I think; however. Along with the moderately effective fear inducing clown and CGI minions, I found there were micro cliche bits that could have been refined - but they didn't take much away from the story. The characters behaved irrational by any standards at times, completely ignoring the realistic situation given at hand (acting as defined by Sanford Meisner). They could have been more down to Earth, listening to each other, to the situation and being more connected to it. Going big is not about how much you can scream or how tense you can be but how connected you are with the reality of the scene, how much you live it. The shocking life, when it happens, it's unlike what we think of it - it is what it is: and most often it is is intense but very quiet. I wish the writing would have refined out more the behavioral aspect of these critical moments.<br/><br/>I would give it an 8/10. At 7.5 you have an enjoyable summer blockbuster; like I said, this is more: it has substance so it steps into the realm of art. It's not Shawshank but it's halfway between blockbuster and that. I rated it 10/10 to counter all these negative comments - not sure if they expected a heart pumping mindless slasher or were so disappointed by the CGI that they lowered the grades to such a low point. I think Dir. A. M. delivered a heart warming experience that is rewarding on a lot of levels. Both Chapters keep the same tone and they touch the viewer in a profound manner - something very rare these days.<br/><br/>I felt rejuvenated by having watched both chapters. I felt as if life has become more bearable, worth living, as if I have grown wings of love to get over problems. It gave more meaning to the relationships with my friends and their roles in my life. It is fine cinema, it is effective, this is good film making.<br/><br/>This movie feels like a movie - not like a cheap money grabbing excuse of a product. And I have worked on plenty of those and I am the first to harshly criticize the stinking scripts that get green lit for production."

It was essentially a movie about friendship and growing up and, to use a well-worn clichÃ©, coming of age. It was essentially another 'Stand by Me' but with lots of CGI. This movie has none of that heart, but it tries to. It tries to evoke sentimentality and nostalgia for the first movie and the band of kids at its heart - the Losers. But it also wants to be a horror movie. It never succeeds in marrying these two themes and subsequently fails at achieving either one individually. There is too much CGI to be truly scary. It just does not seem real. And the CGI is at the expense of building atmosphere and tension. The movie also tries to be somewhat of a psychological thriller, as each of protagonists face their past fears and failures. Finally, the movie goes out of its way to include as many throwbacks to the characters introduced in the first movie as it can, even when they really have nothing to do with the current plot. Trying to be so many things at once means this movie is almost three hours long. You notice the running time too. I was looking at my watch well before it got to he end.<br/><br/>To be honest, I didn't hate It Chapter 2, but I didn't like it either. At the end all I thought was 'meh'. Maybe you will like it better.<br/><br/>Just in passing, I can't end without commenting on one of the opening scenes of the movie and I apologise for any spoilers. In the very first scene of the movie we are taken to the Derry carnival where a couple of young men are enjoying the sideshows. One of these men, it is revealed, is a former Derry resident and the other is his boyfriend. These two attract the ire of some local louts who proceed to do a bit of very brutal gay bashing. All through this scene I was wondering if one of these men was one of our protagonists from the previous movie and how this act of violence fitted in with the rest of the plot. Turns out this incident had nothing to do with the rest of the plot and the characters involved - the two young men and the louts - played no further part in the remainder of the movie. So my question is, why have this scene at all?? In hindsight, its existence for no reason seems sort of homophobic and more than a tad offensive. You may disagree, but that's the way it seemed to me."

And though it didn't quite measure up to the first one, it was pretty dang close. All-in-all, both movies together were very well made and executed. ""It"" delivers what's promised. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised at all the low ratings. What else did they expect?<br/><br/>In this installment, it is 27 years later, and Pennywise has resurfaced. Having taken an oath that if he ever came back, the 7 friends would come back to Derry and put him away - forever. All 7 have gone on to very different lives with their own set of new problems and challenges. And except for Mike, everyone has nearly forgotten the events of their childhood. Mike remembers because he stayed in Derry while the others have moved on. Once again, this time as adults, they have to face their own demons while finding a way to kill Pennywise. Oh yes, Henry Bowers has also come back and more dangerous than ever.<br/><br/>As was the case in the first film, the make-up and special effects were simply awesome. Skarsgard delivers again as Pennywise, and all the adult actors played their roles well. I think what makes the first film work better were the kids. In some respects, they were braver than the adult versions of themselves. Having said that though, this picks right up where the first one left off and finishes the story to satisfaction.<br/><br/>I loved both movies. I highly recommend them both. If you can, and want the full experience, watch them back-to-back like I did. It is time well spent and something I will be sure to do again. Awesome adaptation of the Stephen King classic (who also makes a nice little cameo in this film). 8 stars out of 10."
"tresm87","6","1","2","23 November 2019"," What should've been an excellent follow up to a tremendous first installment, devolves into a dragging mess of tones and miserable cgi with few redeeming factors.
","6.4/10 I absolutely adored the first film adaptation in 2017 and I'll be honest in saying the original tv movie adaptation was average at best imo. I was extremely excited for this chapter 2 film since the first came out with high hopes especially when the cast was revealed for the adult losers club. Now that I finally saw this new addition, i have to say I thought this was pretty ridiculous and an utter let down. While it has its decent moments revolving around some charming characters of the adult losers club, and a few interesting Pennywise scares, i found this to be bizarrely scattered, and at times dull. Story wise it's straightforward and very cliche with unbelievably stupid jump scares sprinkled into every 10 min with seriously some of the most laughable cgi you can imagine. Some of the concepts they thought up had to be attempts at comedy. There were some comedic elements in the first film but not during the scares as much. The tone is constantly clashing between extravagant scares and dumb jokes to where it is not coherent as a film. The cast saves this film and gives you a reason to care especially Bill Hader and James McAvoy. I felt Bill Skarsgard was underutilized massively in this and replaced with these mostly terrible cgi jumpscares. While the conclusion does have the same emotional connection as the first and the same high stakes, i couldn't help but feel like it was a missed opportunity overall. Maybe if we finally get that supercut there will be added scenes to rectify some of chapter 2's disappointment. Until then I'll stick with the first film."

"tophwhite","1","1","2","19 November 2019"," Went rather quickly waiting for something to happen (but it didn't)
","I did not enjoy It: Chapter 2 like I did the first film. A couple of brutal scenes towards the beginning of the film were off-putting, with little or no resolution later in the film. It repeatedly switches between the present (characters as adults) and past (the same characters when they were children from the first film) and overuses coarse language. There are few scares and the CGI is perfunctory at times. Most of the adult characters are rather dull. The film needlessly revisits experiences for each character from the first film. Considering the film is nearly three hours long, parts of the plot should not have been as incoherent as they were."
"sugar_n_spice_makes_ever","10","1","2","11 November 2019"," The 'Losers' adults were a huge h-IT!
","Chapter 2, oh, I honestly can't fault it in anyway! Although, be ready to be in it for the long haul as this movie nearly hits a 3 hour running time. I can't get over how accurate the casting was for the adult 'Losers' they were all SO alike to their younger selves, and the chemistry between them all was truly believable. I loved the whole childhood friendship nostalgia through this, there were plenty of flashbacks given. Bill Hader, who played an older 'Richie' was a pure delight to watch, he thoroughly absorbed his character; The cinema was rocking with laughter at his snide remarks & comebacks. James McAvoy (the magnificent role playing actor that he is) who portrayed 'Bill' was also very believable; he nailed the personality traits so perfectly to his younger self. I feel that chapter two gave us a lot more information & insight into IT'S origins, aswell as the grown up losers did. I personally saw a darker depth to the story telling in this one. IT was certainly a rollercoaster experience, many moments of laughter, fear & tears (believe it or not, I welled up a few times!) The CGI & visual effects were impressive, even when IT shape-shifted, though I was fully aware it was computerised at times, it still scared the hell out of me, and I'm not really a jumpy person. Although I've read a few reviews stating that IT himself didn't get much screen time, I personally don't agree on this, I genuinely believe he had just the right amount. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd as IT honestly made my skin crawl, the casting team have seriously won the jack pot when it comes to him."

","It's 27 years later. Mike still lives in Derry, Maine. He's tracking suspicious deaths and calls up the rest of the Losers' Club. Pennywise is back.<br/><br/>I understand what the movie is trying to do. It is definitely far superior to the 1990 mini-series. It's very apparent from that 90 movie that the kids' side is the far superior part. The adult side is a real problem that this movie is trying to solve. The solution seems to be to inject as much of the teen actors as possible with the constant flashbacks. First, the Chinese restaurant is better than ever. With more artistic cuts and great creatures, that section is lots of fun. The structure is still everybody gets their own scare section which can be repetitive and not that scary. The entire movie is not scary but it is fun to revisit this world. There is a reason why the movie goes back to kids on bikes. The new adult cast is great. The kids are a little older although it is supposed to only be that later summer. It's all fine but a step down from the first movie.<br/><br/>For the third act, there are some good, some bad, and some I'm not sure. The spider-Pennywise looks good. It couldn't get worst than the 90 spider. I really question the sacrifice of the tokens mostly due to the battery acid line being lost. There is so much potential in using the tokens as weapons against Pennywise. Beverly's postcard could be used as a shield and Pennywise would break her shield by pointing out that she doesn't even know its true origins. It's crazy that Mike didn't bring his sheep-killing gun. I don't know about Mike. He did that to the artifact and I don't know why. I don't get his problem. I do like Richie's token story. As far as big final battle, it's mostly fine and I really like the bathroom. All in all, I wonder if a whole new rewriting of the franchise wouldn't be more compelling. I would have been interesting with a whole new cast of kids doing their Scooby gang while they research the old gang. This franchise works much better with kids."

","The best thing about It: Chapter One wasn't Pennywise but The Losers Club. It was their natural chemistry, strong dynamic, bonding & rapport that made us invest in the story. And then, the finely executed horror bits & wicked act from Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd uplifted the film further. It was funny, fresh & frightening, and paved a solid platform for It: Chapter Two which unfortunately is unable to deliver the smart, sophisticated & satisfying experience its predecessor offered in spades.<br/><br/>Directed by Andy Muschietti, the sequel follows Stephen King's novel more closely yet features an overlong & bloated premise whose runtime is strongly felt. The first act is interesting, plus The Loser Club reunion has the same vibe that their younger selves did. But once the board is set, things only head downhill as Muschietti loses his grasp on our attention, is unable to utilise the resources properly this time, and ends up delivering a rather inferior & underwhelming product.<br/><br/>Clocking at 169 mins, what makes the ride difficult is its inconsistent pace. Also, the horror aspects are dumbed down, for most of the scares fall flat or seem childish & silly in comparison to last entry. Add to that, the final showdown does not live up to the hype either. The only aspect that retains its sharpness is its humour, mainly coz of Bill Hader who, like his younger counterpart, impresses the most. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd does all he can to portray the demented & fiendish side of Pennywise but it isn't enough this time.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, It: Chapter Two fails to make the most of the strong foundation of the first film, and is an occasionally thrilling & intermittently entertaining follow-up that never unlocks its full potential. Falling short in many things that its predecessor excelled at, it is a disappointing mess that lacks imagination in its scares, creativity in its approach & sincerity in its craftsmanship. Where Chapter One was brought to life with heart, passion & honesty which in turn made it soar, Chapter Two is simply dull, meandering & barely manages to float. What a shame!"

"nnrbrtsn","4","1","2","21 September 2019"," Overproduced and painfully scare-less
","IT (2017) was in my opinion an okay movie. It did the book justice (for the most part) and was somewhat scary. What went wrong with IT is that it wasn't the jump scares so painfully obviously set up that was scary, it was the tension building up and the mystery unfolding.<br/><br/>IT Chapter 2 does basically the same thing wrong - but to a higher degree. Every other scene was a build up to a jump scare that just wasn't scary especially since you could predict it from a mile away. It seems to reuse the one aspect of the horror genre over and over again and every time it happens it becomes less scary and more comical. By the end of the film the girl next to me who at the start was hiding into her boyfriend was nonchalantly checking her phone and didn't even flinch for the most part.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me in this film was the sound. Goddamnit. Wallfisch's music is usually beautiful and don't get me wrong there was nothing wrong with the score but it really really was soiled by the sound mixing. The music was just too loud in the fight scenes apart from one scene in particular which was actually really good sound mixing (confusing, right?) using the absence of sound as building up tension. I wish they had used that technique more than a jump scare.<br/><br/>Some good aspects of the film was that the acting wasn't terrible. Chastain and McAvoy were great at taking their characters younger actors and channelling them through their performance. The rest of the loser club were okay. Bill Hader started off rough and it really felt overacted and it wasn't till the last few scenes where he really showed off some decent acting chops. As for the rest of them, they were forgettable but I think that's more the movies fault than the actors.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the CGI and Pennywise himself was terrifying. SkarsgÃ¥rd is a great actor and I'm not really that scared of clowns but god damn did he bring out a new phobia in me.<br/><br/>The book goes very deeply into psychology and the meaning of life etc and I'm glad the film didn't dive too deep into that as it was interesting in the book but translated to film it would have been waaay too much. I feel like the film wasn't serious enough to pose a huge psychological question and went for its feel-good ending instead.<br/><br/>Overall, if you watched the first film it's interesting to watch the second film maybe once but it just didn't really do much for me as a standalone film. I know that it's a sequel but it really just copied the first film but oh look! They're older! It didn't try incorporate original ideas or more adult themes at all."
"Aly200","7","1","2","20 September 2019"," A decent conclusion, but lacking the magic of the first half
","After two years of waiting we finally got the concluding chapter of Andy Muschietti's remake of the Stephen King novel 'IT'. While mostly executed well like its first half, the magic wasn't quite captured for the ending of our beloved Loser's Club and their defeat of the titular entity. I shall try to avoid major spoilers for those who wish to read the novel or watch the movie.<br/><br/>Brief summary of the plot (easy to get from the trailers): 27 years after defeating the entity known as IT, the adult Losers must return to Derry when IT comes back seeking new victims and revenge on the adults Losers.<br/><br/>For our adult cast, Muschietti assembled a top-notch cast including James McAvoy as Bill Denborough, Jessica Chastain as Beverly Marsh, Bill Hader as Richie Tozer, Jay Ryan as Ben Hanscom, Isaiah Mustafa as Mike Hanlon, and James Ransone as Eddie Kaspbrak. Bill Hader is easily the standout as Richie, the foul-mouthed comedian of the batch which is perfect for the Saturday Night Live alumni. Hader is able to balance the dark humor with his dramatic chops that he acquired from ""The Skeleton Twins"" and his Emmy winning role on HBO's ""Barry"" and his facial gymnastics are silly, but purposeful. His comedic chemistry with James Ransone is touching and funny at the same time especially when the climax arrives and you feel for Richie.<br/><br/>Returning as our scary clown is the ever creepy Bill Skarsgard in a much more toned-down (for the most part) Pennywise. While more cartoonishly creepy like his predecessor, Tim Curry, in the first chapter (which annoyed me a bit), Skarsgard is able to be in his element in the second part. The actor goes much more manipulative in this movie to get his victims (particularly in one sequence under some bleachers) which is a welcome change to spouting some of Tim Curry's original dialogue. The only downside is the climax for the Swedish actor, but it's more the fault of the visual effects team and writing. However it doesn't quite diminish the step-up for the performance.<br/><br/>While the first chapter employed practical effects with some CGI, the team unfortunately went overboard with the CGI here. Thankfully Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise and the excellent Javier Botet get the majority of the practical work (considering Botet is the alternate Doug Jones for creepy monsters like Mama). I was laughing at the CGI particularly for one of Pennywise's young victims as the CGI jaw is so in your face and blatant which isn't the only ridiculous moment as you will see in the climactic showdown.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Gary Dauberman returns to pen the script after his first directorial debut earlier in the summer with the third ""Annabelle"" movie. However you can tell that his writing isn't as strong as the first film specifically with the so-so chemistry between the adult Losers. As pointed out earlier, the strongest bond of the group is Richie and Eddie while the triangle between Beverly, Bill and Ben is ignored a little more than the novel and rushed through. Having a longer runtime (almost 3 hours long) also packed in too much material that could've been trimmed out of the script (not really blaming Dauberman for that as that is more on Muschietti and the editor). Don't let this detract you though and try to enjoy the remaining time with our characters.<br/><br/>Do give this film a chance particularly if you enjoyed the first movie and the novel, but lower your expectations to a reasonable level. It's always a challenge to follow a successful first half, but it's not a terrible film just not great."
"cappiethadog","7","1","2","20 September 2019"," Limbo it
","Pennywise the Clown calls himself ""The Eater of Worlds"". The same can be said about writer/director whose ""The Big Chill"" is a near-remake of ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"", the debut feature film by John Sayles, made four years earlier. The filmmaker, to this day, sticks by his claim that he had no prior knowledge of Sayles' micro-budgeted indie, despite both films having carbon copy premises. Seven thirty-something adults who formed a clique during their hippie years at college, reunite at a summer house and gripe about the agony of being yuppie sellouts. The only difference is that in ""The Big Chill"", the ex-countercultural warriors return under somber circumstances, a memorial service for their friend Alex Marshall(Kevin Costner), the diehard who accepted too late that the dream was over. Since Costner didn't survive the final cut, the body in the coffin can be anyone or anything you want it to be; the body, for cineastes, is a filmic body, ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"", a celluloidal twin that few people knew about. After Harold Cooper(Kevin Kline) delivers the eulogy, Karen Bowen(JoBeth Williams) takes her place at the organ and plays Alex's favorite song, The Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"". For the dead, it's happiness. For the writer/director John Sayles, it's credit. At the gravesite, Nick(William Hurt) has to wrangle Meg(Mary Kay Place), who walks in the opposite direction of the ceremonial plot, but she gets there, and says goodbye to the deceased before they lower the coffin. On an extra-diegetical level, it looks as if Alex's friends are hiding the body; a secret pact made by these Secaucus Seven dopplegangers. The camera pulls back from the burial site. ""The Big Chill"" is fleeing from the scene of the crime. It's a pet cemetery of sorts. ""IT: Volume Two"" brings ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" back to life. Call it creative license; call it whatever you like, but something went down in 1983 and ""The Big Chill"" is the only suspect.<br/><br/>Echoes of ""The Big Chill abound in ""IT"", Stephen King's magnum opus, released three years after ******'s requiem for the baby boomer generation. There are fortune cookies in ""The Big Chill"". The fortune cookies inform ""IT: Chapter Two"". Over brunch, Karen regales her college pals with her recent Hawaiian adventure. At a local Chinese restaurant, girlfriends in tow, she encountered this very disturbing fortune: ""You'll never amount to anything."" Sarah Cooper(Glenn Close), Harold's wife, responds: ""I don't believe it."" The operative word is ""it"". The menace followed Karen back to South Carolina. ""The Big Chill"" works as a human horror film; it's the idealism of their activist-oriented youth coming back to haunt them. Michael(Jeff Goldblum) reads his fortune: ""Friendship is the bread of life, but money is the honey."" Again, it's Sarah who replies. ""Even fortune cookies are getting cynical,"" she says. Cynical like them, their older selves; capitalists all, with mortgages, fancy cars, and stock options. The fortune cookie is the elephant in the room. Alex's foolish idealism is what killed him. Neither Michael, who wrote an article in their college newspaper about the physics whiz turning down the Rutledge fellowship, nor Sarah, who knew him in the biblical sense, comment on Alex's epiphany, a belated dawning attributable to his suicide, that the fortune cookie message accurately prophesized. The fortune cookies in Andy Muschietti's ""IT: Chapter Two"" are blunter. The Derry kids, all grown up, catch up on old times at Jade of the Orient, a Chinese restaurant, after Mike Hanlon(Isiah Mustafa) calls them back home when the cyclical nature of their haunted town's child murders rejuvenates itself, right on schedule. Instead of a fortune, The Loser Club members receive single words that they recombine in vain to form a coherent sentence. The missing link, a proper noun, that Beverly Marsh(Jessica Chastain) grips between her fingers, is added to the group fray over meaning. Beverly organizes the jumble of words: ""Guess Stanley could not cut it."" Pennywise(Bill Skarsgard) ensures that the elephant in the room is accounted for. Stanley Uris(Andy Bean), just like Alex, slit his wrists in a bathtub. The fortune cookies act as a conduit between both films. One cookie contains a bat wing. Are there bats in ""The Big Chill""? Yes. The group hears Chloe scream and rush up the stairs to her room. One cookie contains an eyeball attached to octopi-like tentacles. Does the human organ and mollusk in concert also make an appearance in ""The Big Chill""? Yes. Nick watches, on television, a black and white movie in which men ward off a giant octopus from boarding their destroyer with blowtorches. The scene comes from Robert Gordon's ""IT Came from Beneath the Sea"". Muschietti riffs, with or without the source material as a guide. Every generation, Pennywise returns to Derry. In the 1983 film, Harold, the shoe company impresario, and Sam Weber(Tom Berenger), a Tom Selleck-like television actor, make the bed, and as they straighten out the sheets, we learn that Sarah's husband plans to open up his ""twenty-seventh or twenty-eighth"" store. Twenty-seven is the magic number; twenty-seven years is how long it takes for the clown to awaken from his hibernation.<br/><br/>As the popular wisdom went, ""IT"" was unadaptable for the big screen, due to the graphic violence that Pennywise committed against minors. With the rare exception, such as John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13(1976), in which a little girl gets shot in the chest near an ice cream truck, the onscreen annihilation of a child was rare. The body count in the Stephen King novel proved to be a major stumbling block. Original programming on HBO and other cable outlets, not to mention, online streaming services, were options unavailable to the group who bought from King the film rights, so ""IT"" was brought to network television and condensed into an abridged two-part miniseries, directed by Tommy Lee Wallace. The iconic scene, in which a yellow slickered boy negotiates and loses not just the paper boat, but his life, looks downright Disneyesque when measured against the no-holds barred standards of violence in contemporary moviemaking. It's a bloodless scene. Pennywise(Tim Curry) grabs Georgie's arm and bares his sharp teeth, and then a dissolve to an eagle-eye shot of the boy's flower-laden casket. The blood is dislocated to a black and white picture of Georgie in Bill's photo album, drenched with oozing red body fluid. Georgie's blood, in ""IT"", remains pooled on a rain-soaked street. This time, when Pennywise grabs the boy, there is no dissolve. The audience is confronted with, albeit fantasy, the intimacy of a frenzied child in jeopardy, rendered in a graphic honesty that was once deemed unthinkable. The clown has Georgie's arm firmly clamped in its jaws. There is a cut. We're spared the cleaving of his arm. But the surgery is implied, when we see the boy crawling away from the storm drain with a missing limb, before being dragged back by an alien-like elongated arm. Pennywise, in ""IT: Chapter Two"", bites the face of a sad friendless little girl under the bleachers, and then, at a carnival, he breaks through a fun house mirror and eviscerates a boy in front of Bill Denbrough(James McAvoy), who is shielded from the carnage by arterial spray that coats the glass in red entire. Is this necessary? Isn't suggestive violence enough? Ugliness is in the eye of the beholder.<br/><br/>Pennywise is anything and anyone; he can shapeshift into both monsters and people. Georgie Denbrough(Jackson Robert Scott) is the clown's favorite bit of mimicry, because it tortures Bill, who is coerced into a guilt-ridden admission of health on that fateful rainy day. As Beverly Marsh(Sophia Lillis), in a flashback, Pennywise adopts the girl's feminine wiles and fools Ben Hanscom(Jeremy Ray Taylor) into leaning in for a kiss. The clown can also transcend time and space; it has the ability to subsume the two-dimensional body of Bill's mother in a film slide, and when the projector's rapid-fire motion turn the slides into a home movie, the clown goes 3D and vacates the filmic world. It goes after Beverly. It can be anywhere and do anything, such as take celluloidal form. Beverly lives close to a glen. The clown, hypothetically, could be Glenn Close, whose Sarah Cooper can be, at times, mercurical. This is when. The old woman(Joan Gregson) who lives in the Marsh's old apartment, stops moving, freezes, as if her batteries suddenly ran out, while having a cup of tea with Beverly, before resuming her rote niceties. In ""The Big Chill"", Sarah stands motionless in front of an open refrigerator; she chooses nothing, as if she forgot what it takes to be human. During Alex's wake, at the buffet table, she tells Michael: ""We give first preference to people who kill themselves in one of our bathrooms."" That's a mean thing to say; that's Pennywise.<br/><br/>In the made-for-television version of ""IT"", Ben(John Ritter) says: ""Limbo, how low can you go?"" as he ducks under an aluminum rolling door. ""Limbo"" was a 1999 film directed by John Sayles. Georgie could have caught up with his boat if he did the limbo instead of hitting his forehead on a road closure sign.<br/><br/>""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" fought its way out of the pinebox and dirt.<br/><br/>And returned as a construction batter."
"SashaDabinski","5","1","2","18 September 2019"," True Disappointment
","Thoroughly enjoyed the TV movie and Chapter 1, but left the theater after Ch. 2 shaking my head. It started out really slow, but did get going later and the story got interesting. Then the excess CGI monsters came out adding un-needed minutes, taking away from the story. Then I couldn't wait for IT to end. Very disappointing sequel to a great story."
"thmmarler","5","1","2","18 September 2019"," Evil space clowns
","The first half of the movie or so is a great set up. There's a few jumps and it feels like it's leading you to great things. But then the monsters get more and more exaggerated and unbelievable. And once the story is told where the evil comes from the movie lost all credibility. What a shame."
"pamelathornton-56373","8","1","2","18 September 2019"," A Different Take...Not Necessarily Better But Pretty Good Nonetheless.
","No, this is not proofread, I wrote this right after walking out of the theatre what did you expect.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know whether to love or hate this movie. To start off with the negative - the background story of what Pennywise really, actually, is, is convoluted, cliche and, by the end of the film, doesn't make much sense. It's as if the screenwriters were so sure they were going to make money off of the sequel that they had no problem with adding a lazy plot device, ie, ask the Indian, and that they put no extra work into layering out the details of said lazy plot device.
They turn my main man Mike into a liar, a literal parody of the ""crazy guy in the attic,"" tried to convince me that Bill's big problem with ""bad endings"" is more important than exploring the Richie/Eddie thing that, let's be honest, we were all pretty sure something was happening in the original TV movie, or even the short climax of Bev and Tom (that one guy you see for like three seconds, you know, enough to realize he's a bad guy, but not necessarily a great actor) and their abusive marriage.
The actors were great, don't get me wrong. Even when they shredded Mike's character or made Stanley seem like more than just a man who was terrified, they represent the character's they're supposed. It's just not the character's you might remember from the classic novel. Wasn't the fact that Mike was the literal lighthouse in the sea, and the fact that Stanley was just a terrified man, not make the books, not only more realistic, but more enjoyable. (I mean we all like to think we would be Mike or Bill, defending the Universe, but in reality we're definitely Eddie, who was scared , or Stan who was content with death over facing the ""Eater of Worlds.""
On to the positive, the actors are THE highlight of this movie.
Jessica Chastain is a Bev Annette O'Toole can be proud of. She's terrified of It, yet does her best to be more than just the ""damsel in distress,"" it definitely helps that she's gorgeous, plays a layered character and delivers in her performance. James McAvoy can just find one part he doesn't shine in to give the rest of us hope and Bill Hader is witty, sarcastic and everything Will Tozier should be. Jay Ryan is gorgeous, and a great actor, and yet, somehow, seems to have a fat, scaredy-cat kid, hiding under all of that layered perfection. James Ransone, I had no idea who this guy was, but I'm amazed he's not doing more movies and being an A-Lister. He plays his part well and I actually felt emotion, real emotion, when he died, people reading this, it was intense. Isaiah Mustafa is good, but definitely the weak one, in this six-way. Andy Bean is another actor that I just want to watch more of. His few minutes on screen, and his voice-over, (spoiler: there are so many voiceovers omg there are just so many voiceovers and just those have to be like 30-45 min of the sound and editing time), are just fantastic. Bill Skarsgard can just stay a few million miles away from me, by the way, I don't know what it was but this guy freaked me out so much. It was probably his very presence, but I immediately wanted to run away when I saw his face. If anyone has a career in horror or suspense it's this guy.
I approve of this movie, I really do, I love when Directors take the gems of my childhood and don't rip them to shreds but I just feel like the plot and the entire movie could have been so much more. I give it an 8 out of 10. The actors save this lazy plot and the directors should probably thank them for that."
"charikoopa","10","1","2","16 September 2019"," Felt so at home seeing this!!
","When I was around 12/13 years old, I would constantly rewatch the original 'IT' movie. Am I gonna overshare? You bet. I grew up on a street where there was no other kids to play with and had quite a lot of family drama going on. I was never very well liked (don't ask why, although it was probably because I was the weird kid) so when I started watching horrors, naturally I was drawn towards the Losers' Club. They were like the friends I never had, so it's safe to say these characters hold a special place in my heart. Fast forward to 'IT: Chapter 1' and I was pleasantly surprised! Like most, I usually despise remakes ('The Omen' made me incredibly angry but let's not go there), but after being left impressed I was excited for Chapter 2.<br/><br/>True, the CGI was a bit much at times, but it was compensated for with the amazing acting and script. Both the adults and kids played the characters incredibly well and I was laughing through the film (Richie was usually the culprit). I did have to hold the tears in at least five times and, by the end, I was unable to. I sobbed. I was a mess.<br/><br/>I'm in no way opposed to that, though, because I love a film that makes me feel emotions-- I think that because the characters are so special to me, I was 10x more prone to bawling for them.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie is that it really feels like they didn't try to top the original. Didn't try to make it better. Not in a 'we don't give a damn how it turns out, we just want $$$' kind of way, more of a 'let's try a different take' kind of way. If that even makes sense. The same goes for Bill Skarsgaard-- it definitely doesn't feel like he was trying to be a better Pennywise than Tim Curry, which is wonderful. He plays Pennywise brilliantly, obviously an incredibly talented actor (along with the rest of the cast) and the clown's personality shines through. He made me giggle quite a lot and I was glad to see more of him in Chapter 2. The playful, evil entity that 'IT' actually is was superbly encapsulated by Bill.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, I loved it."

They have the role of explaining and justifying, or reminding, but I, with the poor memory I have, never remembered anything from It # 1. As such, I will have to see It#1 again.
If you watch the movie, I propose a little attention exercise: Stephen King himself has a 1 minute appearance, in which he says 4 or 5 replicas.

The storyline was quite confusing too maybe it was just me but the ""Deadlights"" I was unsure the origin and how the lights created Pennywise?"
"tonlo-1","3","1","2","12 September 2019"," Lost the magic from part 1
","Like many other fans, I was excited for part 2 only to be very disappointed. It's like they tried to throw everything at us and it was too much. I could have used less shock value affects and more story line. It was all over the place, in constant motion. Nothing scary, nothing to draw you in like the 1st one. The only reason I gave it 5 stars was the kids. They were really the only redeeming factor for me. They had better acting skills and were more believable than the adults.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the ending! I don't want to spoil it, but ""it"" was terrible!"
"CriticalOfEverything","5","1","2","12 September 2019"," Disappointing.
","I don't know why, but there's just something about It Chapter Two that feels off. The casting is great, there are some decent scares and few good scenes, but it just feels incredibly average and a far cry from the original. It's bigger in scale yet feels smaller, it just doesn't have the same impact that the first did. It continues what the first did in blending horror, humour and heart together, but I guess it just doesn't do it as well? I don't know. Like this is honestly the one movie where I am genuinely confused as to why I feel this way. If you enjoyed it then that's fine, but personally I just didn't like it that much for some reason."

","First This Movie Was Actually A Reasonable Adaptation and Wasn't That Bad Of A Remake Nor A Movie Like Those Bad Reviews Say. As a Fan Of It , Stephen King's Work and Horror Movies This Movie Pleased Me. A Lot Of People Wanted To Get Scared By This Movie But In This Century It Is Really Hard To Actually Scare A Horror Fan and In My Opinion It Wasn't That Bad of An Attempt In Horror. It Gave A Lot Of People The Spooks and The Chills Because Unlike Other Horror Films This One Showed How Much Of A Threat Pennywise Was By Showing The Audience Multiple Examples. Some Reviews Said That The Pace Was Slow and Some Parts Were Boring And I Totally Agree With Them , However In My Opinion Some Of The Times Those Things Brought Out The Suspense Even More. Acting Was Great In General , Just Like Other People Say Bill Hader and James Mcavoy Gave Some Of Their Best Performances. I Didn't Really Liked The Twist At The End But It Gave The Charecters More Depth And Seeing Another Side To The Kids Story Was Fun. But Aganist All Those Great Stuff The Ending Was Poorly Written And Couldn't Live Up To Our Expectations. If I Had To Sum It Up , It : Chapter 2 Is A Good Movie And One Of The Best Attempts To Adapt A Stephen King Novel But Sadly The Ending Didn't Help This. Without That It Was Great. My Ratings Are Like This ; As A General Movie 6.5/10 As A Horror Movie 7.5/10 As A Stephen King Adaptation 8/10"
"dannymacquade","5","1","2","11 September 2019"," Didnt float my boat, sadly.
","I loved 2017's ""IT"", I have heard a lot of criticism about how the fim wasn't scary. But i dont watch ""IT"" for the horror. I watch and love the film for the journey. I dont watch ""IT"" for the scares, but for the adventure. ""IT chapter 2"" doesn't feel like an adventure to me. It's a movie of moments and a non compelling story, strechted out over a bloated run time.<br/><br/>The story here just isn't that compelling. Pennywise returns, the losers retun to deal with him. Thats it, stretched out over 2hours and 50minutes. The film moves briskly to start. Opening on a grim note showing just what lurks in the shadows of Derry. The opening shows promise that is never consistently maintained, just peppered throughout. And then the film gets bogged down in flashbacks and having the characters slowly remember what happened the first time around. The reasons why they fear IT.<br/><br/>IT when in the form of Pennywise, is amazing. Bill Skarsgard giving the role everything he has. There is one amazing moment in the film involving a little girl at a baseball game who encounters Pennywise, a fatal encounter framed beautifully with just the head and hands of pennywise visible from the shadows. But this is the only standout set piece for me, and it doesnt even involve the main cast. Every other scare has IT assume the form of some grey CGI monster. And the CG in this film is clean and shiny. Any tension built during these sequences dissipated upon the reveal of the CGI monster. When it comes to horror, i much prefer my effects practical. You dont seem to get the same feeling of grime from CG. The monster can seem to lack presence and weight.<br/><br/>The Losers club is cast brilliantly. The casting director went above and beyond with these actors, with everyone looking like adult versions of the kid losers. the film is also very funny, funnier than i expected. And the film is shot brilliantly and features some smooth tranistions into flashbacks. No one can say this film isn't well made, but i found it lacking the sense of adventure i came for. And when adventure failed me, the films horror aspects did nothing to fill the void. The film is worth watching, I believe you should give everything a chance. But after 2017's ""IT"", I couldn't help but leave the cinema feeling let down."
"Jo-Cino","4","1","2","11 September 2019"," I Fell For It Again!!!
","This ""IT"" series has somehow created a world where there are no rules, no logic and the writers can do whatever they want without supplying answers, no matter how badly you will crave them.<br/><br/>Nothing makes sense here; sometimes it's a dream, sometimes it's real(?) - sometimes they are dreaming yet pulling things out from the dream into reality... all without any explanation or reasoning to when it is one or the other... easily the most frustrating 'horror' series to watch if you want a solid story line.<br/><br/>Another frustrating thing about this movie is that IT IS what IT IS because of the clown, Pennywise, yet, he is incredibly under-used in this movie for some reason. It seems they save his most screen time for the end of the movie when the 'fit hits the shan', but he's not really even Pennywise at that point, it's just some CGI Pennywise hybrid.<br/><br/>The jump scares were easy to identify, especially if you are just half-way seasoned to the horror genre. The run-time was indeed long, but i don't think the complaint about run time is just that it's long - i'm fairly certain people would have no problem with run time it if the story itself was more airtight.<br/><br/>Trust me, i'm taking it very easy on this movie... there's so much more to shred.<br/><br/>** SPOILERS **
so, after all that, i haven't even touched on the end... that.. ridiculous, RIDICULOUS ending. (The running joke with mcavoy's character and how ""the ending wasn't good"" is very fitting for this movie and serves as foreshadowing.... typical stephen king)<br/><br/>As they outlined earlier in the movie, the creature of IT was cast as an ancient curse that has survived thousands of years and with that, it would take a ritual of sorts to defeat this mighty creature... but hold everything... that would only make a LITTLE bit of sense and we have already established, LOGIC is no place for a clown movie like IT... no, no, no<br/><br/>they literally spent ninety minutes of the film gathering things from their childhood JUST for this ritual to NOT work - BUT, fear not - as it turns out - all anyone needed to do ALL these years was some good old fashioned name calling and the IT would go away.. and not only be defeated, but be defeated very meekly and easily... ""You're Just A Clown! You're Just A Clown!"" they would yell and in doing so, the mighty Pennywise shrunk aaalllll the way down to the size of a baby.<br/><br/>seriously... they call him names for maybe...90 seconds.. and just like that, the horror is all over! this is how Pennywise dies - for good!<br/><br/>JUST. SO. DUMB!!!<br/><br/>Look, if the idea is to be entertained, then you will be entertained if nothing else because the cast itself is WAY too good to not appreciate on screen - Hader, McAvoy, Skarsgard and Chastain are terrific - but there's no surprises there and honestly, that's also what makes this movie even more disappointing - you had this amazing ensemble of talent and you gave them THIS weak story and this even worse ending.<br/><br/>... if you are going to watch this movie, enjoy the performances because it's all you're gonna get... it's also the only reason i rated this movie a 4 and not a 3."

"kintsukana","3","1","2","10 September 2019"," Full spoilers ahead to save you the headache.
","The three stars are for Bill, the creature design and the CGI budget.<br/><br/>So much time is wasted. 20 minutes of nothing but swearing or wooden acting followed by a one or two minute CGI scene that ends in a jumpscare. It's a rinse and repeat formula for the entire movie. The preformances from most of the ""adult"" version actors feels very phoned in. Bill Hader was a terrible choice as was Jessica and the guy that played adult Ben. Wooden and stiff throughout.<br/><br/>Thankfully Bill Skarsgård's odd yet terrfying portrayal of Pennywise carried the entire movie, the downside is they've piled so much CGI on top of him it really takes away from the dominant portrayal he had in the first film.<br/><br/>
Whoever designed the forms Pennwise takes (aside from the ho-hum zombies) needs a serious raise because this film truly has some really effective monsters in comparison to the first. It's just an absolute shame all the ""scary"" parts are overloaded with CGI, while I understand practical effects can't be used everywhere something more grounded in reality is much more terrifying than the 90,000th movie with 90% computer generated things. Considering all the actors were more than likely forced to act vs a green screen rather than Bill's Pennywise it may explain why the majority of the actors seem to be bored and just reading lines.<br/><br/>I also wouldn't consider this a horror movie after sitting through the poorly paced nearly three hours. Long movies don't bother me but them being long AND boring for vast amounts of screen time do. So much comedy has been forced into every other horror scene it's like someone watched a Marvel movie right after watching IT and said ""yeah lets do more of that"". It was a bad call and the movie really suffers from it. There are a few really great scenes such as the old woman's house, and the two with the young children in the first half, funny how with the kids both scenes are mostly actually Bill as Pennywise rather than 90% CGI with Bill's face stuck on it. The same cannot be said for the actual jumpscares.<br/><br/>
I know in the original tv miniseries the giant clay-mation spider at the end got a lot of flack, well this version suffers the same fate except instead of clay-mation it's some hastily done you guessed it CGI. The ending is really so farcical that the threater errupted in laughter at Pennywise being ""bullied to death"". I am 100% ALL for an anti-bullying message but this is supposed to be a horror movie for adults not Naruto where love and friendship wins the day. You will be rolling your eyes during the last act and the superly hard forced ""sad moment"" feels very cheap because of it.<br/><br/>Very disappointing after having the expectations after the first movie set so high, save your money and stream it.<br/><br/>PS: Stan Lee is the epitomy of the creator making a cameo appearance in movies, it seems now that the man has passed on others want to get in on it. Next time Steve, leave the acting to the actors and just say no. Such an unnessesary cameo."

","Every 27 years, the town of Derry is cursed by an evil clown who terrorizes anyone he can get his claws on. 27 years prior, a group of kids called The Loser's Club thought they defeated him, but he's back again and they must all gather back at their hometown to destroy him once and for all.<br/><br/>Like any reunion film, there's a pang of bittersweet sadness in the air. The filmmakers of It: Chapter Two use this to create a very moving story of friendship and the bonds we make as children. Unfortunately, in between scenes of genuine emotion and character interaction, there are horrible instances of CGI horror that inspire more laughs than screams. Decapitated heads turn into spiders (a la The Thing, but more laughable) and old women turn into giant Looney Toon characters with pendulous drooping breasts while we're supposed to pretend this is in any way frightening when, more often than not, it looks like something out of a lousy 90's computer game.<br/><br/>Thankfully, It: Chapter Two is loaded with strong performances from an excellent cast who are given the nearly impossible task of selling a lot of the cheesy effects from their reactions alone. In that sense, the film is a rousing success as the actors manage to ground the insanity around them into something tangible and real. It's to their credit that the film wrings any iota of emotion out of the story. SNL's Bill Hader might be the MVP here as the wise-cracking Ritchie who's holding onto a big secret. He's appropriately amusing when needed and heartbreaking when you least expect it. Also excellent is James Ransone as the grown up Eddie who captures some of the nervous and manic qualities of his younger counterpart to an uncanny level.<br/><br/>It: Chapter Two won't be the scariest film you've ever seen (or even the scariest film of the year for that matter), but the strong performances and solid emotional core will tug at your heartstrings a little more than you might initially expect."

You don't get the clownish creepy feeling at all, which in the original was mixed perfectly with comedy and horror.<br/><br/>This is just another modern age evil-grin demon 'horror' movie.

","This movie represents me getting through an awful experience. I watched it with some of my family knowing this horrible past is behind me.... wish the film was better.<br/><br/>I loved the first one. This one just felt underwhelming. Starts off with Pennywise killing a gay guy and then we have to watch all the members of the Loser's Club getting an invite back to Derry. All Pennywise does is scare him. I think the only real threat is the bully escaping a mental asylum (who has a zombie driver, for some reason). Also the film tends to borrow from other films like The Thing.<br/><br/>The movie is really long and you will feel it. The ending, like the original, sucks I'm convinced nobody knows how to end this thing. I also felt that they really didn't have to go through all that trouble to bring the kids back. It almost makes the first film a little pointless. I'm glad I saw it but it's not very scary and I'd stick with the first one."

"searcherer","7","1","2","9 September 2019"," The kids did better
","Not that it's bad, it's just that the adult era, if you'd say, was basically a stretching of the attempt to come up with a conclusion of the events in chapter one. All the elements of the novel, both the characters and the concept, were presented in chapter one, while chapter 2 merely turned-off the camera for 27 years, turned it back on, and had the heroes get back to finish a job previously thought over with, without anything new that's genuinely rooted in their lives as adults, all while spending considerable amounts of time glimpsing back on their past experiences and throwing flashbacks of their time as kids that at some point it felt like the idea of this second chapter was not really as a continuation of the first, but rather an attempt, and not a successful one at that, to apparently try and reflect on it, while at the mean time reliving the same kinds of horrors again, up to the point where they finally re-battle again and the nightmare would be over for good. I think this second chapter simply suffered from an attempt to make it more understandable to audience who didn't see the first one, which in a way made it somewhat fall short of expectations for those who did and also resulted in its running time being prolonged, my opinion.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is scary - though not as much as the first - and is technically excellent. It also delivers a nice conclusion where what has been seemingly a physical challenge that couldn't feel more tangible or real is cracked down by realizing and confronting the essence of its existence, our fear."

","It Chapter Two, the follow up to It, picks up where the original left off. The kids have all grown up and the demon clown is back to terrorize them. Or has it?<br/><br/>Chapter Two suffers from a bit of an identity problem. It's one part Poltergeist, legitimately tense and mind bending horror, and one part... Ghostbusters. Maybe it was just the theater I was in, but there were a surprising number of laughs in this movie. It also can't decide if it should focus on the adults or on the flashbacks with the kids.<br/><br/>The flashbacks also directly lead into the films other main issue. The pacing is all off. The beginning and end or spot on but the middle definitely drags and I started to feel the 169 minute runtime of the movie.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though. The performances are spot on, everyone fits their roles with no real outliers. That said, there are a couple that go above and beyond. James McAvoy and Bill Skarsgard are exceptional but everyone ends up being upstaged by Bill Hader who absolutely runs away with this one.<br/><br/>Performances aside, the visuals are stunning. Penny wise is all about weird and twisted displays, so the visual effects have to be exceptional or the whole thing would fall apart and fortunately they deliver in every scene.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a good, fun movie. It's far from flawless but it's got plenty of honest fun and strong emotions with legitimate tension to satisfy. Absolutely worth being seen on the big screen and will warrant future views as well."

","I am a fan of the book and mini series, and Part 1 of this remake really creeped me out. I can honestly say that the first one (which we rented again just before going to Part 2) honestly made me not want to miss any of the frightening moments. We pre bought early admission tickets and took off early from work, eagerly anticipating this movie! Even the trailer sent a few chills up my spine! We were excited, so perhaps that eagerness helped let us down. While there is a strong cast of dedicated, capable actors, with a moderately strong plot, the excessive CGI made it almost laughable (SPOILER TO FOLLOW).<br/><br/>Starting with the Chinese restaurant, that could've been genuinely thrilling, but the CGI just made it look a little cheesy as human headed lobster spider things just didn't match the spookery of the first part. There is something to be said about less being more...sometimes not seeing and seeing reaction would be even more efffective,<br/><br/>The scene with the old woman, seen in the previews started as frightening, but the globular plasticized old woman took the magical scare factor down.<br/><br/>The leper and the brown soupy vomit took away from the the truly frightening element of Eddy seeing his worst nightmare come to life.<br/><br/>Honestly, if they just removed the excess CGI, and let the creep factor be realized more with what you don't see, it would have gone further.<br/><br/>The deeper story line of the power of friendship really shined through. And I wish the suspense without excess CGI would have been more realized.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's a bad movie, or that you should not see it -- I'm saying maybe don't spend those extra movie theater prices, and make your own popcorn and adjust your expectations."

","Damn, I underestimated how much restraint Cary Fukunaga gave the first one. This film is bonkers and doesn't take a breather. This insanity works for the film's benefit and weakness. In saying this, the characterisation was interesting and I liked the contrast between childhood and adult fears. As you've probably heard the grown-up Loser club are great and their emotional progression throughout help to elevate the film as a whole. For as absurd and over the top as this film is there were instances where it worked in the film's favour and when it worked, the results were very satisfying. When it doesn't it feels like the weight of the film gets lost and all we're left with is a bunch of CGI effects and gross-out scares (some of which verge on comical).<br/><br/>The first one understood that the kids fear was the horror and not the monster itself. This made it more psychologically interesting. This one has elements of that but it kinda focuses on the (jump) scares themselves rather than the implications. Sometimes at the expense of character development. I feel like without Fukunaga it loses some of that subtlety (even if his contribution to the first one was cut down due to him leaving the project). The pacing/length is good for the most part and I didn't feel the run time. The only instances of this were in the middle of the film which gets quite repetitive and the ending which gradually got draining. What helped elevate the ending was the emotional and cathartic resolution for the characters.<br/><br/>Yes, this film is deeply flawed but there's enough good stuff that I ended up enjoying it. Considering how hard a book like IT is to adapt, I appreciate that they gave it a shot even if the final result leaves something to be desired.<br/><br/>I can't decide between a 5 or 6 but I'mma just leave it at a 6 for now cause I'm in a happy mood."

","I am a fan of the book and also enjoyed the original IT movie. Tim Curry was a great Pennywise and the movie itself had enough creep value to make me not think about the ways it strayed from the book.<br/><br/>However this 'remake' is lacking in several ways. From part one to this film Pennywise is hard for me to watch. The ""sing-song"" voice of Pennywise reminded me of Winnie the Pooh on a few occasions . I also felt that the CGI presented in this movie of things that were supposed to be scary, weren't. Big, misshapen heads with googly eyes were portrayed in different variations and seemed to be the main horror theme. But, they made me chuckle at the absurdity of them.<br/><br/>The references to the movie The Thing, including a line from the movie also made me chuckle in a scene that should have been more frightening. There's also a Shining moment....<br/><br/>I was excited when the film finally referenced the Ritual of Chud but was then let down. And the ending...the way they defeated Pennywise was lackluster and ridiculous.<br/><br/>I love love love Stephen King books. He is a masterful story-teller, and his books are horrifyingly frightening and delicious. It's sad that for me, only a few book to movie translations remain as 'good' movies in my mind.<br/><br/>If you want to see a few, they are Salem's Lot (some younger people may not even bee familiar with it) and The Shining.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this film as it has a few moments that make it worth it, and a bunch of Easter Eggs.

"jwwalrath-227-85487","6","1","2","7 September 2019"," Not the sequel I was expecting or wanted
","I liked the first one. Although they were aspects to enjoy here, this wasn't the part two that I wanted.<br/><br/>The film keeps up with the first by having some very good scares and just being visually creative in general. This movie includes a couple of very inspired transition shots near the beginning.<br/><br/>The cast playing the adult members of the Loser's Club all do a good job. I know it's been said to death but SNL & Barry's Bill Hader is the best of them. However, credit should also be given to Insidious' James Ransone. This movie is definitely funnier than it's predecessor and Ransone does a great double act with Hader. They have great chemistry. Of course, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd still steels the show. His Pennywise continues to be unsettlingly childish and inhuman.<br/><br/>The main problem of this movie is that it relies waaaay too much on flashbacks. A lot of people liked the kid actors in the last film. Given that the adult character portion of the book and the mini-series is generally considered weaker, I'm guessing that the creators got worried about focusing just on the grown ups. So, a good portion of the second act relies on flashbacks to never-before-seen scenes of the kids. I mean there is a lot of this. Except for Hader's RItchie, who never really got a personal journey last time, we're not getting anything new. (Plus, I really didn't need to see anymore of Beverley's creepy father.) The setup for the flashbacks results in way too much of the characters just wandering about without much development. The sequel is way too nostalgic for the first, even the adult segments do too much recycling of previous stuff. I didn't want any of this. When I learned that the adaptation was being split into two movies for each of the age groups, I was prepared and content to watch just the adults, and I didn't get that. There needed to be way more time to focus on the lives of the current characters. (Again the character of Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa from the Old Spice commercials) doesn't get a lot of screentime.) BIll's wife and Beverly's husband basically have cameos here. Both actually had roles to play in the book. I would have preferred they cut the flashbacks and focused more on those characters.<br/><br/>The movie includes the last one's flaw of going way too-over-the-top with the real world threats. They are fairly cringey. In the past I could rationalize that the human characters are so evil and/or one-dimensional because everyone in Derry is affected by Pennywise's evil. However, here we see someone from outside the town also acting that way. So, now I'm just thinking it's just a lack of subtlety on the creator's case.<br/><br/>There was a point where I was considering giving this a ranking one notch higher, because I did like the good stuff. But in the end, I realized that I remembered the parts that bugged me far more. Be forewarned that this is one of those movies where personal enjoyment will really differ."
"makatwothousands","7","1","2","6 September 2019"," Very good movie, but missed important book points
","I enjoyed it chapter two a lot and I enjoyed how much the adults look like the children they were playing.<br/><br/>The movie was very rushed ( I understand the book is long so they had a lot to fit in ) and there were scenes in the movie that could've been replaced with better scenes from the book.<br/><br/>The movie was not scary and relied on jump scares. The cgi was better than the first movie but the de aged kids looks absolutely awful.<br/><br/>The movie undermined a lot of important book characters. Stanley uris and Henry bowers deserved more screen time as did Myra, patty, Audra, and Tom Rohan who had a lot more important roles in the book than they did in this film.<br/><br/>I like rhe way they did the flashbacks to them as kids but I do feel they were somewhat repetitive and should've had less of them to make room for more important scenes of the adults from the book.<br/><br/>Eddie and Richie deserves a better love story and Eddie deserved better last words."

","Sadly it's not better than Part One. They had the chance to up the ante on the Horror but they didn't. It was bloodier than Part one but by no way scarier. I actually wished they would've shown Pennywise more. A little more dialogue and some more terrifying scenes in his clown costume would've been perfect which points out the biggest mistake they've made with this movie. The other creatures are wayyyyyy too much CGI !! The scares automatically don't work because the CGI just looks too fake and digital. Almost laughable at certain parts. That ruined a bunch of moments for me. As already pointed out by other reviews Bill Hader runs the show since he's given the funniest dialogue throughout the movie. Sometimes the humor killed the scares too but it's still acceptable. As a Fan of IT I give the movie a good rating and it's still better than a lot of horror movies that are out right now. Just sadly not perfect in this case although they had the chance to create something classic."

"SnobReviews","7","1","2","6 September 2019"," ""It Chapter Two"" is a satisfying conclusion to a great horror film.
","""It Chapter Two"" may not deliver as many scares as it's predecessor but still nails delivering the source material to the big screen, along with the help from a pitch-perfect cast.<br/><br/>In this horror sequel, twenty-seven years after their encounter with Pennywise the Dancing Clown, the Losers Club reconnect in Derry after receiving devastating news.<br/><br/>I'll come right out and say that the real MVP in this film is Bill Hader. Hader is superb in his role offering viewers enough of a comedic performance as much as a dramatic one. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are great, and Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is just as terrifying the second time around. ""It Chapter Two"" does feel long at some points, running close to three hours, the film needed to have its pacing arranged. Other than that, I enjoyed this sequel almost as much as Chapter One. You'll find yourself fully immersed once the Losers Club arrive in Derry and be fully satisfied in the end."
"DanielNeil1237","6","1","2","6 September 2019"," Good follow up for the most part. With issues
","IT chapter two is pretty good for the most part and a great follow up to chapter one. All of the casting is amazing with a stand out from Bill Hader as Richie. Well, Jessica Chastain, James Macavoy and everyone else is also all great as the adult losers in the movie. Bill Skarsgard is once again great and entertaining as heck as Pennywise and all the returning young cast from the first one are good during the flashback sequences. Andres Musuchietti once again like with the first movie does a great job directing and the cinematography is also great with a unique look added to the film. Even the humor is really funny and some of Pennywise's forms are coolly taken directly from the book which I am a huge fan of the book. Issues with the film are with the some of the story choices they can feel very rushed, or sloppy with the pacing feeling off at times. The movie also is missing that unique heart the first movie had of the kids standing up against evil by themselves, it isn't really there anymore though the film has pieces of it. Also it isn't as scary as chapter one but instead a little more shocking and disturbing, or as well put together overall as the first one. The final act can feel really silly at times though being still very book accurate. Overall It Chapter two is a good conclusion to chapter one finishing off Kings book. It sadly isn't as great as the first but still very likable being very book accurate and with a great director, cast. If your a huge fan of the book like myself you really will enjoy it and its book accuracy. I can't wait for the directors cut to see what they left out on top of this nearly 3-hour movie."

","I was appalled and completely disgusted with the homophobic content that was included in this modern day major film. The movie features a brutally violent hate crime against a gay couple, but makes no attempt to rectify or condemn the actions of the perpetrators. In my opinion, this is senseless violence that was used for pure shock-value and has no relevance to the main plotline or characters involved. Later in the film, they try to pander to the gay audience with a hidden secret that is revealed about one of the main characters, but again they fail miserably and disrespect the LGBTQ community with a sloppy and unresolved character development. I waited for three hours hoping some form of justice would be carried out, all the while watching other characters be given their resolves, but ultimately left with a major sense of injustice and a sick feeling in my stomach. I will not support this film going forward, and will warn others of the vile hatred that this film gratuitously glorifies."

","Right off the bat I'll say that some of the comic relief was off-place and terrible. Very few jokes landed. Most of the movie was dead air, reminiscing and ""preparing"" but really - nothing happened. This movie should've been an hour shorter. The script featured a whole lot of mess that we could've gone without. And the ending was cheesy and preachy. Also, was it really appropriate to have a guy dramatically cry for his just-died friend yet another guy and a girl decide to make out 2 seconds later just because 3 hours wasn't enough for you to space things out a bit? That was a baffling choice. If my friend just died dramatically and another friend was crumbling in tears the last thing on my mind would be making out in front of him with some chick who can't decide who she likes.<br/><br/>BUT - all that doesn't mean the music, the occasionally hilarious yet still good CGI, the acting, the emotional moments weren't great, because they were. I appreciated all of this a lot. Bill Hader made me shed a tear! He was that good. Bill Something - the man who plays the clown - obviously way too young for this role when he's playing against people in their 40s and 50s. Even with an old man wig he was still too youthful. Not to say he didn't do a fantastic Pennywise again - he did. Just... his youthful face was less of an issue when he was scaring younger kids. Now he's scaring people over twice his age and even with the makeup you can tell he's much younger.<br/><br/>It's so flawed yet so strong in many ways. Confused in it's writing - much like this review. But they both made their points. Definitely still a really fantastic movie, even with it's problems it's far beyond what else is there to watch."

And Skarsgård scared the living out of many with his blinding performance as Pennywise.<br/><br/>The difference between the first and the second chapter is that Chapter Two takes a very cheap way out. Gone is the realness of decent horror-film making that seperated Chapter One from the rest because it stayed true to keeping it practical in the effects department. Use only CGI IF NEEDED..
Chapter two takes it the easy way out. By cheap i mean lazy routes. not expensive, because this WAS way more expensive to make because Chapter Two relies TOO MUCH on CGI. Skarsgård felt underused and backset in his role. And you got cheap and ineffective jump-scares that 99.9% of most horror movies fails with today.<br/><br/>Besides, it was two long, and felt dragged out with a mediocre ending (but that is okay because the Curry version ending sucked too)<br/><br/>The cast is stellar though. Hader is perfect as Richie, and he has a few fun bits too."

","A fun horror movie.. The long running time didn't bother me at all, and I actually think it worked better being almost three hours long. The whole movie felt more Stephen King-y to me than some of his other adaptations. From what I've read they stuck very close to his novel with this second part and I'm glad they did. If you're a fan of The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episodes, the movie kind of reminded me of that, except in a movie version with real people. Where as some people found the CGI to be cheesy and overdone at times, I felt it worked quite well and the effects were very neat and coolly put together. The adult versions of the kids are spot on and every actor is good in their role. Bill Hader is funny in it and actually so is James Ransone for that matter. There are plenty of jump scares to be had and I must say I enjoyed the second part better than the first. People will disagree with this but hey you still get a good dose of the kid actors in this one too. Also Bill Skarsgard brings back the creep factor again as Pennywise! 8.75/10"

"olgavalentovaov","4","1","3","14 September 2019"," Please, Stop
","That's what I spent most of the movie thinking. Just...stop. Just...don't.
I came to the cinema excited, certain that I was in for a great movie. I was wrong. Oh boy, was I wrong. Throughout the first maybe thirty minutes I was bored - the movie took its sweet time gearing up, but still I held onto hope that the latter parts would make up for it, but as the movie droned on, my hopes slowly dwindled. At the end I was squirming in my seat, bored out of my mind and wishing for all the main characters to just die so that I would be released from this torture.
As I watched, I tried desperately to figure out just what was it about the movie that made it so...bland. What was the main difference between the first IT movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and this one, which I was thoroughly disappointed by? And I think I figured it out. Of course, the movie has more than just one problem. The characters, Bill Hader's in particular, were bland at best and infuriating at most, and the predictable attempts at comic relief just irritated me. As a viewer, I could see most of the one-liners and half-baked punchlines coming from a mile away, and in my opinion, and all of the jokes just seemed so out of place.
The story line was dragged out, it was repetitive and mostly uninteresting, with the same jumpscares and just what were those zombie thingies? They were laughable. And when you find yourself smothering a laugh when you're supposed to be scared, that's how you know a horror movie SUUUUCKS.
Anyway, back to the main reason this movie blows. A story, which worked so very well when its main protagonists were children, just doesn't work when the kids have been replaced with adults. Perhaps it's because the main villain takes on the form of a clown, and a clown chasing adults just seems...silly somehow. I know, I know, it can be done, has been done very well, but Pennywise just doesn't cut it. The clown is a great character, and he pretty much carried the movie, but his creepiness, his malice, ""shines"" the most when he's interacting with children. The way he talks to them, the way he lures them in, the balloons...it all just sends shivers down your spine. But with adults, not so much. The filmmakers perhaps realized that themselves, beause there is very little interaction of Pennywise with the Losers club until the very end, and the main characters are mostly chased around by weird zombies and an asylum escapee, who...you know what, let's not get into that.
And the movie doesn't even give Pennywise a proper send-off. The way he's defeated is childish and laughable and annoying all at once - which can again be mostly chalked up to the fact that the main protagonists are adults. Holding hands and chanting? Overcoming their fears and realizing that without their own fear, Pennywise is nothing? Those aren't exactly grown-up methods.
The final scenes were just painful. I wanted to leave.
There are many other little and bigger things I was annoyed at, but the movie was mostly just bland, like your average C-grade horror movie. It's kind of sad.
PS. Stanley, what the frick? ""I am scared I'm going to die, so I'll just kill myself?"" How is that a conclusion you came to?
Also, don't call yourselves the Losers Club, PLEASE. You're adults now, the irony isn't cute anymore."

"nzmichaelclark","7","1","3","13 September 2019"," A Great Film. However do not look for a scary film in this, as that is not it's purpose.
","It Chapter 2 is the second part of this horror adaption, from the movie which came out in 2017, It.
The film starts with a truly graphic opening scene, with beating of a gay male couple during a ""hate crime"", with the result of one of the characters called Adrian Mellon being thrown off a bridge into the waters below, to be FLOATED towards the clown himself, Pennywise the dancing clown.
After this opening scene we introduced to the Loser's Club as adults, and what their lives and jobs are like after 27 years after the first part of the tale. This brings me to say how physically perfect the casting in this film was, and how they actually felt like the younger versions of themselves. However, their chemistry is different to the kids.
After we find out why Mike has brought them back to Derry, we start explore the flashbacks, which show us the friendship that are being drawn back to after all this time, and even gives us insight to certain things that the first film never really explored, which I thought was well done, as in the book, they explored things that they did as children, and even with a different fashion they went with, it still felt true and faithful to the book.
The comedic sense that they went for during the second act of the film didn't feel pushed, and actually felt right, as most of the gags which adult Richie told were actually also told in the book. By the way, Bill Hader played as extraordinary Richie. I like the approach that they took with the Ritual Of Chud, as they were able to make sense why the Loser's actually needed to explore a certain of Derry, to find the artefacts needed to destroy It.<br/><br/>I liked how they decided to explore Richie's character differently to the book, as making his character gay gave that part of the film a different depth that neither the book or miniseries had. The Paul Bunyan scene was a lot of fun, and had a great appearance of Pennywise. The most suspenseful part of the film however was definitely Mrs Kersh's scene with Beverly, when she went to her old home, where her and her Father once lived. I love Mrs Kersh for five awkward seconds just paused. As a Witch she was quite disturbing, and seeing Bob Gray turn himself into Pennywise was a lot of fun, disturbing fun of course. I won't explore everything of the second act, but as this film was very long, but it did drag just a little bit. Bill's part of film was also very good, as he in the film had met a kid, a kid he was afraid for, as he said to Beverly, ""I can't let it happen again"", a reference to Georgie. It is very emotional to see Bill trying to kick through the mirror house glass to save the kid, as Pennywise bangs his head against the glass to kill the child. Stephen King's cameo was also hilarious, especially as his character also told Bill that the ending of his book that he had written was ""terrible"".
Eddie's part of the film was also good in the second act, and boy does he look like his younger self from the first film. I like how it explores his hypochondria. I like how brought Mr Keene in this scene, to be as unnerving as ever, especially as he is made out to much older now. We also get to see a flashback of the Leper attacking a shapeshifted version of his Mother, which also comes back after his flashback to jumpscare Eddie. Before I go onto the third act of the film, I liked what we got to see of Henry Bowsers, with that same menace and hatred in his eyes, but he could of had a little bit more to him before his death. Still, good scenes which contained him.
The third act of the film is when the Loser's all draw back together, as Bill is willing to confront IT alone. But they find him just in time. This where the climax really picks up, as this is the final showdown, the Ritual Of Chud, where they can defeat the Clown from the Macroverse for once and for all. The final scene is entertaining and puts the two character of Ben and Beverly together, a dream that always had since he wrote her that poem. The end does go on, but gives it the feel that was needed to conclude this film, and was definitely not a disappointment. Pennywise's final form was interesting, and the part where Beverly had to swim in blood was entertaining, especially with the appearances of her Father Alvin Marsh and Henry Bowser's, who said to her as a reference to The Shining, ""Here's Johnny"".
This is a great conclusion to the story, the flashbacks well merged into show the friendship and remembering of what happened before. The first film had a chemistry which was hard to match, a story structure which was a little bit better adapted to this, but only tad this movie does a great job of using it's material from the book. Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was again magnificent, but didn't star as much in this film, but was nevertheless creepy but also clown-like and oddly funny. This is a great film, and while the kids set the characters in a better way, the adult cast did a great job of carrying that legacy on, and altogether felt like the characters. These two movies were both more of an adventure than a horror, and its purpose was well met. But at times it was quite horrifying, and because of Richie, at times quite funny too (especially when Richie is put into the Deadlights pause in the final battle). This gave time for relief like the first film, as did the book at times, which captured Richie's character perfectly.
8.4/10 (while It's predecessor to me was a 8.7/10)"
"Paradroid78","5","1","3","13 September 2019"," Not scary, but overlong and overly reliant on CGI.
","The movie starts out well, but quickly bogs down in disjointed scenes following the individual characters having an encounter with the monster and getting scared, in between unnecessary flashbacks to them getting scared by the monster in their childhoods.<br/><br/>After around two hours of this, where you're left pondering the meaning of life and wondering if the plot will ever go anywhere, the story finally picks up for the CGI heavy third act monster hunt, that really wouldn't feel out of place in an episode of Doctor Who.<br/><br/>If this movie were actually scary or unpredictable it would be one thing, but the plot beats are hugely predictable and because of the overuse of CGI nothing fells particularly scary. The film has a lot on jump scares, but they're telegraphed a mile away and you can literally count the seconds on your fingers when things go quiet before something scary happens. To compensate for the lack of real psychological horror, the film instead goes for shock value by amping up the gore.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the actors do well with what they're given, you do invest in the characters, and the movie is technically well made. But at nearly 3 hours it's just too long, and a lot of unnecessary scenes could have been cut without detriment. If an hour were trimmed, nothing would have been lost and it would immediately be transformed into a tighter, better movie.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie we're shown a street with a cinema advertising Nightmare on Elm Street 5, which shows that someone making this had a sense of humour because, while admittedly never as bad as the worst, this movie feels a lot like a modern incarnation of a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel."
"msbreviews","5","1","3","12 September 2019"," Rating: C
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>So, Chapter Two is a sequel to It (2017), and my expectations were a bit high. I really enjoyed the latter to the point of considering it one of the year's best, as well as one of the best Stephen King cinematic adaptations. Andy Muschietti returning to the director's chair and having such a fantastic cast portraying the adult versions of the Losers (not only in terms of quality acting but also regarding how well the adults look like the older versions of the young actors) are two of the main reasons why I was genuinely excited. Also, the runtime (longest horror movie ever?!) definitely left me wondering how a horror flick could have the same duration of some of the most epic films in cinema...<br/><br/>Well, I got to be honest: I'm disappointed. It's not a bad movie, at all, but it doesn't even come close to its predecessor's heels. I disagree with some headlines I've read though. Some say the comedy was misplaced, taking away impact from emotional or dark moments. There's barely a moment where it was expected seriousness and laughter kicked in instead, but when it does occur, it actually works. I just think it wasn't as funny as the previous film, overall. Granted, Bill Hader as Richie Tozier is hilarious, and a perfect cast as an adult Finn Wolfhard. His chemistry with James Ransone (Eddie Kaspbrak) resembles the one Wolfhard, and Jack Dylan Grazer had, therefore this/these duo(s) being the comedy highlight.<br/><br/>Some say the movie is too long. Now, this is a tricky one. Usually, when people feel bored or not as entertained as they wanted to be, they tend to blame it on the film's runtime, especially if it's over 100 minutes. I agree that the movie FEELS long, but I disagree that the runtime is too long. There's more than enough story to explore, and literally, every single character from the Losers Club has an interesting arc. The problem here is that not all of them are explored in a way that's funny, scary, or just captivating enough. The fact that Jessica Chastain's (Beverly Marsh) sequence with the old lady is entirely displayed in one of the trailers (and consequently shown at every single screening) doesn't help the pacing.<br/><br/>The first act is pretty decent. As expected, it shows us where everyone is, what they're doing for a living, and how they get back together. During this act, it's pretty clear that Muschietti is going to give time to develop each character and follow their respective arcs to the end, hence the lengthy runtime. However, the second act falls flat. Bill Denbrough (James McAvoy / Jaeden Martell) has the most emotionally impactful storyline, one that affects the main plot, making the time that is spent with him worth it. Same goes for Richie's subplot. On the opposite side, the rest of the group doesn't have entertaining sequences or new developments whatsoever.<br/><br/>Beverly continues to be affected by her childhood of abuse from her father. Ben Hanscom (Jay Ryan / Jeremy Ray Taylor) keeps being in love with Bev. Eddie is still a whiny little ""kid"" who's scared of everything that might make him ill. Stanley Uris (Andy Bean / Wyatt Oleff) doesn't do anything, and Mike Hanlon is surprisingly the engine that moves the plot forward, which is a problem of its own since I never really cared for that character (he was definitely the one put aside in the 2017's movie). Honestly, he just serves as an exposition device considering he spends the whole time just explaining everything the audience needs to know to understand where the film is going.<br/><br/>Finally, the third act is a mixed bag. While it does provide a climactic ending with a sweet message, it feels very much like its predecessor. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's incredibly repetitive comparing to the first movie. Considering all things together, it's a big letdown since it feels like the exact same film, but with older versions of the characters. Obviously, each of them has a different arc in this one, something the first didn't have the time to explore, but looking at the main story, it's pretty much the exact same thing, including how it ends (just with a minor twitch). Nevertheless, the performances are all great...<br/><br/>James McAvoy continues his streak of amazing displays, and Bill Hader has to be the MVP for the range he demonstrates. I wish Skarsg책rd had more time to shine as Pennywise, though. In 2017, I thought he really nailed the character and made it his own. Unfortunately, this time around, Pennywise doesn't have that much screentime (such a disappointment), and when it appears, it often looks too CGI-ish, taking away from the gripping performance of its actor. The finale has almost no Bill Skarsg책rd since there's so much CGI. Despite that, I congratulate the team(s) behind the makeup, hairstyling, costume, and production design. Derry looks terrific, and the time jumps between the young and the old gang worked seamlessly partially due to these visual achievements.<br/><br/>Andy Muschietti knows how to work a camera, and the movie is very well-shot. However, he should have been able to come up with creative sequences to deliver a different level of entertainment, especially during the tiresome second act. Gary Dauberman's screenplay is clever, and it brings this enormous story to a fitting conclusion, but he also could have imagined some new ideas for some of the characters. There are a couple of great sequences though, especially one with Bill going through a theme park tent with illusions.<br/><br/>In the end, It Chapter Two fails to deliver a conclusion worthy of its epic runtime. Even with a phenomenal cast, it isn't as funny, as scary or even as captivating as its predecessor. Its runtime is appropriated having in mind that each character has a personal arc, but only a couple of them are genuinely compelling and entertaining. Therefore, the film feels too long, uneven, and it could have used a bit more creativity when it comes to its climactic finale. Its central story feels very similar to the last movie, its scary sequences are nowhere near the quality seen before, and even though the costume and production design are top-notch, there's excessive use of CGI on Pennywise. It still carries some emotionally convincing moments, as well as a couple of cool sequences. Overall, it's ... okay."

Without intelligent storytelling and without the correct atmosphere, an horror movie becomes just a noisy collage of frames.
After a decent first act, recurring jump-scares and cliches (lots (LOTS) of them) make you get tired of this film. It's a 3 hour loop of ""guy walking alone in town. guy sees something creepy. guy gets scared (even though it's clear for him/her that the situation not real). Clown shows teeth and makes loud noises. Clown stops the attack abruptly"".
At the end, the hope of an epic final battle vanishes with the anti-climatic solution that they could have figured out since the first part.

","""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you... I've missed you!"" Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard)<br/><br/>It Chapter Two, set in quaint and vulnerable Derry, Maine, is one crowded horror film. And that's saying something as it is the sequel to the already revered It by Stephen King. It has enough horror tropes such as jump scares, surprises, and toothy, reptilian monsters to keep the almost three hours humming.<br/><br/>However, enough is enough. After twenty-seven years from their introduction to the scary Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the Losers Club must return to face the horrific clown, and they hope, destroy It. Fortunately screenwriter Gary Dauberman and director Andy Muschietti include enough allegorical heft to keep this horror rampage from being just a visually hot mess.<br/><br/>That the club must individually shed its fears and weaknesses to defeat the clown is both a strength and a weakness: strong because allegorically we all have to do this purging to be mentally healthy, and weak because isolating the club members weakens understanding of their development relative to each other and their consuming past. In other words, they are better at self-reflection facing each other, and therefore their past, than going it alone.<br/><br/>Only too obvious is the film's attempt to show how some memories, not always favored ones, linger for decades, powerful enough to draw the initial gang back to end the reign of the ghoulish clown. At various times a magnificent seven of them crowd the screen with their long-suffering hang ups such as cowardice and guilt, all in need of purgation.<br/><br/>King's Carrie and Pet Sematary, two of my favs, are careful to keep the protagonists to a minimum whereas It Chapter Two weighs It down with minimal but provocative leitmotifs, e.g., Beverly's (Jessica Chastain) abusive father or Bill's (James McAvoy) relationship with his deceased brother. Any one of these concepts could be fleshed out at the expense of more trifling ones.<br/><br/>As in many action films, even with super heroes, the now commonplace theme of being who you are with courage gets overused as it does here. Compounding the sense of having seen it before are numerous monstrous visions, with sharp teeth and tentacled arms and legs for just a few of the stock monsters. Granted these are all manifestations of Pennywise's ability to shape shift and the writers to locate character flaws in the characters.<br/><br/>It Chapter Two may suffer from trying too much, but, hey, that's better than not at all. For Steven King devotees, this is nectar; for the rest, this is a long fun-house ride with allegory supplying the fuel. Of course, IT reminds that keeping and nurturing friendships is the surest way to send out the clowns."
"IAmTheShyGuy","7","1","3","8 September 2019"," ""A fitting dark horror sequel with a heavy dose of powerful visuals!""
","The year 2017's horror flick ""It"", which was a box office hit, had rewritten and upstaged the genre of horror films. For me, the film also managed to create an emotional bond with it mainly due to the smart & innocent child protagonists and the interesting way in which they defeat Pennywise, the evil clown.<br/><br/>The story of the film begins with Pennywise striking back into the town of Derry, 27 years after the events of the first film. The group of kids, now adults who live in different cities regroup and get set to kill the clown. Will they be able to successfully kill him? The answer is shown rather impressively in the movie.<br/><br/>This film has a more psychological touch to it with several sinister and spine-chilling scenes when compared to the more lucid screenplay in the earlier film. During the course of the film, at times we are shown the flashbacks of the protagonists wherein they encounter some of their disturbing childhood memories escaping from Pennywise.<br/><br/>The screenplay is quite engaging but the movie feels a bit longer at the ending. During some instances you might feel bored, more when each of the protagonists try their own approach to kill the clown. The film also has some comedy dialogues which somewhat brings down the horror factor.<br/><br/>The director has ensured quite well in ensuring that each of the adult cast members have similarity to their younger counterparts. Especially the casting of James Ransone as Eddie is spot on! The dark cinematography and visual effects are really powerful and effective in bringing out some stimulating moments. The background music is exceptional and gives you absolute chills & thrills!<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a fitting sequel to the 2017 blockbuster and is a must watch if you are a connoisseur of psychological horror flicks!"
"brucemiddlemissphotography","6","1","3","8 September 2019"," Mildly disappointed
","I really enjoyed the first film, had a great nostalgic feel about it. At no stage would I have described it as scary but more disturbing but having read the book and seen the original mini series I felt it reflected the source material well. I always enjoy Stephen King, not for the scares but for the beautiful way he builds characters and friendships.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 I felt dealt with the characters and friendships well and carried on well from the first film. As many have said in their reviews the homophobic attack at the beginning is brutal and really tests your stomach.<br/><br/>What did I like about the film?
<ul><li>it didn't feel rushed</li><li>I liked the fact it explained a bit about ITs back story</li><li>the acting was great and the characters development</li><li>Pennywise was fantastic and the risks they took killing people you wouldn't usually have expected.</li></ul><br/><br/>What was I not so keen on?<br/><br/><ul><li>the cgi/model creatures namely the old lady and the thing with the tongue were ridiculous. Now I don't know whether they were meant to look comedic but apart from the running at the camera which was a bit overused, they weren't scary and just a bit silly.</li><li>this is more a moan about the dating of the source material, I know that this story is about the monster feeding on fear and as such coming together to take its power by not fearing it helps defeat it but it just doesn't seem to hold the impact you want it to. Please don't get me wrong I can't think of another way to end this and so should probably shut up but just felt deflated but I think this is because of the world we live in now and the high expectations we have.</li></ul><br/><br/>All this said this is still a good movie, which tries really hard and I think is successful. I just came out mildly disappointed."
"lewismusgrove88","7","1","3","8 September 2019"," Good but a bit disappointed
","While I did enjoy the movie and it was very well casted, it was too long and dragged at times. For me the cheap CGI, cringe humor placement (audience members will literally laugh at a fake fart these days it seems) and campy acting made it all a bit silly. Overall there were a few jump scares that I liked, but I was hoping chapter 2 would've been much darker in tone."
"Piixie88","7","1","3","8 September 2019"," Beep Beep chapter 2!
","No movie will ever recreate what a book does. No movie will ever include everything that is in the book. What it will do is make changes and only add what they deem is important.<br/><br/>As much as my childhood nostalgia makes me like the 1990 version of IT, I can still admit it wasn't that good, it was too watered down. But Pennywise was great. I still find him creepy. IT chapter 1 came around and is better. At least in terms of the story it told. More from the book was included and that is always welcome. Even the changes were good and the comedic lines and personalities of the Losers gave it its own flavor. Skarsgard made Pennywise his own and did a great job. Overuse of CGI is what ruined the horror/creepy factor in certain scenes of Chapter 1 and there was certainly no exception for chapter 2.<br/><br/>Chapter 2 had great buildups that fell flat because of CGI. They tried to recreate what they did in Chapter 1 with the characters as kids, especially Eddie. It felt forced and a little too much comedy for a horror film. Many people dislike the length of the film and think they spent too much time on getting the viewer reacquainted with each character. I disagree, being a fan of the book, I was engulfed with their stories.<br/><br/>Overall IT Chapter 2 is alright and it's a movie I will see again in the future eventually. Pennywise makes more appearances which is good but it is not better than Chapter 1. You can thank the extra comedy and overuse of CGI for that."
"mistakenlymade1","6","1","3","8 September 2019"," It Certainly Misses A Few
","I certainly enjoyed this film, it was well directed, the acting on point, the soundtrack was amazing, and Pennywise was ""something""<br/><br/>It is mostly accurate to the book, but take it with a grain of salt. This movie is certainly more of a cheap horror and more of a comedy than anything else.<br/><br/>When I hear horror, I want it to be done well. The first few jump-scares were either shown in the trailer, or expected or just hilariously bad. The visual effects on the ""FEARS (monster/pennywise etc.)"" felt rubbery, at times very unpleasing to the eye.<br/><br/>The references were nice to see, at times in the background there's a poster or something to look like Pennywise.<br/><br/>Stephen King makes a cameo as an Antique Store Owner, which was nice and a bit unexpected to see, anyways it's a joy.<br/><br/>The movie was good, but wasn't great. It's a movie I would most likely put on as background noise and so often I would look up, take notice in what's happening, then continue whatever else I am doing, reading a book, writing or whatever.<br/><br/>It's good, but not great. It's funny, but not much of a horror movie. It's ""dark"" but won't leave you speechless. It's something, that is all."
"cuyescalona","7","1","3","8 September 2019"," Good movie, great acting and a satisfying ending, although not scary and too much CGI
","There was a lot of expectation after the big hit IT movie from 2017. Does Chapter 2 meets those expectations? For the most part yes.
Andy Muschietti created some memorable scenes and delivers a solid movie that never gets boring even with it's more than 2 hrs and 1/2 length, with the help of Gary Dauberman screenplay that gives a satisfying conclusion to Stephen King's book adaptation to the big screen. The emotive part that worked in the 1st part is still present and now with a nostalgic sense.
There is a well assembled cast, there is chemistry withing the Adult Losers club and the actors seem they really studied their kid counterpart.
Jessica Chastain is great as always, even here voice matches, Sophia Lillis tone. Amy Adams used to be my favorite to play adult Beverly but Chastain proved to be the right choice. James McAvoy, as Bill, always delivers a good performance. His character seems a little blurred at times but even so he has his moments. But the strongest performances in my opinion were 2: Bill Hader, as Richie, which we already knew he will be funny but he also delivers other emotive shades and his character has a secret, something new in this version, that works fine. The other is James Ransone as Eddie, he hasn't been bad in other movies but here he really has a strong performance with some emotive moments.
Bill Skarsg책rd already owns the character of Pennywise and feels comfortable with it and we also get to see the kids again in some flashbacks (some of them digitally altered because they've grown up) which connects very good the story with the adults.<br/><br/>Also, Spolier ahead, in this version the losers have a reason to explore the town and gather some things to destroy Pennywise, which is something fresh that gives more sense for the characters to be exploring Derry alone.<br/><br/>The movie has some easter eggs from the previous TV movie version and even a Steven King cameo with a whole scene making fun of himself!
(Spoiler, it was great to bring back Brandon Crane, the original Ben as kid and trying to make us believe he is the adult Ben).<br/><br/>The ending is pretty good, it gives conclusion to a well crafted story. Maybe it had too much CGI effects but it is definitely better than the previous version.<br/><br/>On the other side, the movie is not really that scary, even less scary than the 1st chapter. The most creepy moments were already presented on the trailers so the surprise factor was blown away and, again, the CGI effects don't really help
(Spoiler, the old lady, probable homage to the shinning in it's computer version, seems more like a Goosebumps monster)<br/><br/>Most of the humor is fine but there are some unnecessary jokes that feel out of place and break the scary moments.<br/><br/>In general, the movie is a good. If you liked the 1st one you will like this, maybe you will not have a scarier version but a satisfying conclusion. If you are a horror fan, maybe you'll feel a little disappointed but even so it is interesting to see a scary movie with an emotive and well crafted story."
"Troy_Campbell","6","1","3","8 September 2019"," Visually pleasing and super stylish, but also bloated and narratively dull.
","Horror is not a genre I typically enjoy. I love a good horror film as much as the next person, but I find them to be very few and far between; the overall standard within the genre pretty low thanks to countless lazy efforts looking for cheap thrills and easy scares. The 2017 cinematic remake of the first half of the 1990 TV miniseries on the other hand, was a stylish, confident and tension building creep-fest, director Andy Muschietti crafting a string of striking and eerie set-pieces that found the perfect balance between frights and levity. Part two largely swaps the kids from the first instalment for their adult versions, bringing them back to the disturbing town of Derry 27 years after they thought the defeated the menacing Pennywise the Clown. Although the flair is still there, Muschietti can't create anything as memorable as last time out; the spine-tingling sequences this time more predictable and, thanks to an unnecessary extra 30 minutes of runtime, spread way to thin. Pennywise is a fascinating creature of nightmares - Bill Skarsg책rd's rubbery face, sad-creepy inflection, faded orange quiff and an almost imperceptible drool a superb combination to ensure his place in the pantheon of iconic horror monsters (right alongside Tim Curry's bubblier and bigger-eyed 1990 version). Muschietti secured an impressive cast too: James McAvoy as the leader of the pack, Jessica Chastain as the emotionally damaged heroine and Bill Hader and James Ransone as a quibbling pair of best buds who are always good for a laugh. Yet there's a spark missing from the adult group compared to their teenager selves; that recognisable chemistry of adolescents with their lives ahead of them a big part of why the first outing was so entertaining, whereas the beaten-down 40-something versions are less fun to hang out with. A sequel that gets bogged down in narrative filler and hokey backstory, It Chapter 2 still delivers just enough visually exciting sequences and nerve-jangling frights to cap off this two-parter nicely."
"jadepietro","7","1","3","7 September 2019"," It's Just Bound to Go Pop
","GRADE: B-<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A well crafted supernatural thriller that pales to its original source, but still is a fine sequel to its predecessor.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Does It: Chapter Two have the ""It Factor"", that indescribable ""je ne sais quoi"" allure that its predecessor was able to capture so vividly with moviegoers two years ago? Yes and no.<br/><br/>This supernatural horror sequel is again resurrected by director Andy Muschietti and many of his same crew of artisans in hopes to recreate that same bad magic. For the majority of the film, It succeeds in capturing the scary action and establishing a link with the now grown-up cast of characters so convincingly that the audience immediately relates to them and their deadly peril. While It: Chapter Two, more than not, generate the fear factor, this chapter slowly build its scenes of suspense and spends far too much screen time on exposition and subplots that do little to advance the storytelling. The film seems bloated with uneven CGI effects this time around and its formulaic set pieces almost outstays its welcome due to the movie's avid fixation with the gore factor. Less would have been more.<br/><br/>The second chapter of the Loser's Club opens twenty seven years later with a particularly grisly and gratitious hate crime that signals the return of the infamous Pennywise the Dancing Clown. This prologue lingers in one's mind with a bad aftertaste of remorse even though it serves as the catalyst for the new cast of actors to reassemble back at Derry, Maine to fight evil forces. But unlike the first film, this and other moments have a mean-spirited glee that the first film avoided. The extreme violence of this killing hangs over the movie like a shroud of discontentment before the new cast of actors is reassembled and moviegoers can settle in for the fright-fest. Fortunately, the cast and Stephen Kings's essential story overcome this initial dread.<br/><br/>Mr. Muschietti skillfully directs his film and turns up the horrifying action. He stages his set pieces with flair and expertly casts his movie with older actors that inhabit their parts with masterful interpretations of their former younger selves. Each actor has an episode that shows off their character's phobia as they battle with their own demons. This more mature ensemble includes: James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, Isaiah Mustafa, Andy Bean, James Ransome and Bill Hader. All are fine, with Mr. Hader and Ms. Chastain excelling in their roles.<br/><br/>But without Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd as their evil nemesis, the film simply would not be as effective. HIs vocal delivery, physical movements, and iconic make-up as Pennywise ratchets up the tension and delivers the scares. Providing ample support (in flashbacks) are the original young actors from the first film and their presence is crucial to the film's success.<br/><br/>Gary Dauberman's screenplay is very faithful to Stephen King's novel to a fault. (However, some judicious editing of numerous sub-plots could have improved and streamlined the movie much further.) The adaptation creates recognizable set-ups that have a sense of familiarity (the overuse of well-worn horror film staples that are all too obvious like a spooky fun-house with its hall of mirrors, a creepy mansion, the dark wet sewers, etc.). But partaking of these troves is half of the fun and Mr. Dauberman's penchant to fully develop his characters and their unique quirks heightens the frightening action on display. Too bad, he didn't eliminate the unnecessary multiple storylines that complicate matters or connect some secondary characters more astutely.<br/><br/>Yet when plot and characters are rendered with a focus on childhood traumas and the dramatic life-or-death scenario is in place as they are in this imaginative installment, the effect is all the more impressive and relevant, even if the material itself has now become a standard horror package of stock characters caught in stereotypical surroundings. (Special mention to cinematographer Checco Varese and editor Jason Ballentine for their contributions for creating the unease. Benjamin Wallfisch's music score builds the foreboding atmosphere very well.)<br/><br/>It: Chapter Two brings a memorable end to Stephen King's tome. While this final chapter is not as scary as its first part, Mr. Muschietti and his able cast provide an apt conclusion to this classic opus of terror."
"masonsaul","7","1","3","7 September 2019"," Slightly disappointing but still really good and emotionally satisfying
","It Chapter Two is slightly disappointing, due to it not being as good as it's predecessor but it's still a really good and emotionally satisfying concluding chapter. All of the adult losers give great performances and have amazing chemistry with Bill Hader giving the standout performance. It's surprisingly extremely funny throughout. Andy Muschietti's direction is great and the music by Benjamin Wallfisch is fantastic. However, what brings it down and makes it slightly disappointing is that it isn't that scary. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd is massively underutilized (but is still perfect in his scenes) and replaced with weak CG creatures and it relies mostly on jump scares."
"drawnsupreme","7","1","3","7 September 2019"," IT was alright and worth a watch
","The first film felt so new, fresh and original. Horror movies nowadays lack originality but IT: Chapter One was like a breath of fresh air for the genre back in 2017. After seeing IT: Chapter Two, I can say I enjoyed the sequel but there were a few little things that took away from it being on par, or better, than the first.<br/><br/>First off, I thought the originality, the creepiness, and the suspense from the first movie are almost gone in this sequel - it recycles a lot of the same horror concepts of the first one, making the movie a lot less creepy and much more predictable. You'll see just about every jump scare coming from a mile away, and you'll most likely to predict how those scenes turn out.<br/><br/>This movie also had a lot more comedy than I thought it would. Most of the time, the crowd at my theater were either laughing, giggling or yawning. The comedy worked very well in the first film because the kids were just being kids - silly, witty, but entertaining to watch, but as adults, the goofiness felt a bit excessive.<br/><br/>Don't let that sway you away from seeing the movie though.<br/><br/>IT: Chapter Two is still a good little movie that focuses more on closing out each character's story arc. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's Pennywise is still an excellent character whose presence and performance made me want to see more of. He probably could have used more screen time, come to think of it. The entire cast did a great job with what the script they were given - but there's no doubt that the script had room for a few tweaks here and there - along with plenty of room for improvements on the horror and suspense elements, especially considering that the movie had no problem pushing over two hours in length.<br/><br/>IT's worth a watch, at least once."
"xrccatastrophe","2","1","3","7 September 2019"," Identity Crisis
","This movie is extremely chaotic in the worst of ways. It struggles to find an identity throughout the entirety of the movie. There are brief subplots of romance and numerous comedic scenes that completely detract from the horror film experience. None of the comedy is good enough to classify the movie as comedy, and the romantic subplots are never fully fleshed out, leaving horror as the only moderately consistent characteristic of the movie. Despite this, the horror is superficial, relying on occasional jump scares and scary effects to evoke fear. This stands in stark contrast to It (2017) which has an underlying sense of dread throughout the movie, in addition to the standard horror scares. It (2017) develops a mysterious lore surrounding the events of the film that keeps audience members invested while evoking suspense. It Chapter Two attempts to provide resolution to the events of the first movie in an extremely convoluted way, with ridiculous details that remove any sense of immersion in the film. It Chapter Two is far too reliant on the events of the first movie, leading to a convoluted mess that attempts to achieve the feeling of the first movie, with the end result being something that feels like a satirical knock off of the first movie. The only reason this movie gets 2 stars as opposed to 1 is the fact that some of the effects were cool looking."
"TorsoDahlia","5","1","3","7 September 2019"," Disappointing, way too long, but still fun.
","Having waited two years for this to come out I am left with a scurry of emotions. While not as good as the first part, in some ways it is better as Pennywise is actually a little bit creepy here compared to his silly demeanor in the first one. However, he reminded me off Freddy Krueger in the last 4 or 5 Freddy sequels where he would say a silly line or two, get a scare then vanish. Skarsgard's Pennywise was always abnormal and silly, but great fun at that. While he is still No Curry (as actually being scary is important) he is not the problem. The problems and there are many is the pacing, writing, character development or lack thereof, and some of the performances.<br/><br/>It starts off with the infamous murder of gay adult Adrian Mellon which thankfully they included as it is one of the most important in the book as well as one of the creepiest. Sadly, here it is rushed and is only done in around five minutes or so. Not good. Xavier Dolan is an excellent actor and Mellon is a very important part of the story relating to Derry in present day so rushing it was a huge mistake. Still. at least it is here even if they stupidly rushed it and did not do much with it as they should have. People who have read the book know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>For a film that is 11 minutes shy of three hours we could have used more character development instead of cheap scares and constant flashbacks back and forth every few minutes. Yes, this happens in the book and it works but in the film not so much. The problem is the grown up losers do not have much to them outside of annoying Richie and uptight Eddie who are spot on. Plus, if people who pay attention at movies, there is a big reveal involving why Richie acts the way he does which is new and it works perfectly. I was not expecting that and it worked even with Hader as Richie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film although it is nothing amazing by any standards. Chastain's Beverly and McAvoy's Bill, two very important characters offered nothing here as adults. They finally gave Mike something to do as he is integral to the story and the actors who plays Ben & doomed Stan are fine, but nothing you really care about as that belongs to Richie and Eddie.<br/><br/>Essentially, missed opportunities here and a film the drags for long periods of time when it shouldn't. One would think with how painfully long it is at times and feels even longer at others times, that there would be more insight and character development but nada with the majority of the characters. Skarsgard was funny and effective as always drooling and giggling when on screen and Bill Hader's Ritchie has perfectly timed observations and one liners that pick up scenes where we are bored to tears.<br/><br/>A good film but a disappointing one as it did not need to be this long at all despite the huge size of the epic novel. The ending of Pennywise/It, (let's face it they showed him more as a clown as anything and that is another mistake) was interesting in the way it was handled, but we were left with 20 minutes after the fact of over the top cheesiness by the losers. Some will hate this, some may actually love it, and I'd imagine many may be in my spot acknowledging a mixed bag that often dragged, felt empty and just felt off as a whole."

"a_pospech","7","1","3","7 September 2019"," Tripple dose of It
","It (2017) may be just the best horror movie I've seen. After its's success, the ""need"" for a sequel was obvious. Not an easy task to make better movie. Hard to impossible probably. Usually sequel must have more of everything. And that's exactly what It Chapter Two delivers. There is more of a story, more new revelations (some of them with somewhat unclear ""why"" - like the memories from childhood - did these happen before or after they defeated It in 1989? If before, why weren't they in the first movie...). It's looonger, there are more of frightening moments (more like 2.5 hrs of almost constant dread), it's grosser, with more scary scenes, more elaborate and frightening monsters and many many many startling moments (yes, those standard ones when sound goes down, screen goes dark and...). There are new elements too - abundant humor. Sometimes when you're thinking ""what they will come up with now"" the filmmakers may have felt similarly, and the character reacts in a funny way. You can end up laughing heavily with goosebumps all over your body. Great job here. One more thing Chapter Two resembles is playing horror video game with all the elements of action, puzzles, boss fight, etc.
However, the delivery of ""more of everything"" in Chapter Two is what emphasizes It (2017) is a better movie. Because it was the amazing balance of story, fear, visual storytelling, that made ""It"" just perfect. Chapter two feels like ordering a triple portion of a great meal. If that's what you're after, maybe you'll love it more than the first movie."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","7","1","3","6 September 2019"," A solid horror film, but also a mild disappointment after the first chapter.
","I suppose it would be giving It Chapter Two too much credit to say that the magic sort of fading in this instalment reflects how adult life is less emotional/meaningful/magical than childhood.<br/><br/>Because yes, the endearing and thoroughly likeable kids from the first movie have grown up, and they're still likeable, but for whatever reason it just isn't quite the same. Pennywise doesn't really up his standards, and he more or less goes through the same motions he did in the first one, and now that he's targeting adults, he's just not as menacing as he was when he was terrorising the same people as kids.<br/><br/>Granted, I didn't find the first one hugely scary, and found it more satisfying as a Stand By Me-style coming of age film, but it was a bit more creepy the first time around because it was fresher and more surprising.
And with the cast being adults now (apart from some flashbacks), the nostalgia and whimsy and much of the emotion from the first has vanished (again- potentially a metaphor for the fact that growing up kinda sucks).<br/><br/>So after all those complaints... why still give it a positive score?
Well, the acting was all around quite good, the scary sequences were still fun (though really not frightening), it was really funny in parts, there were a couple of neat cameos, and despite being almost three hours, it moved along pretty nicely, and apart from some points in a somewhat repetitive second act, didn't really feel its length.<br/><br/>If you liked the first you'll like this one too, just probably not quite as much."

","I saw the original made for TV (1990) movie which was considered at that time one of the best horror movies ever made. Considering the incredible success of the 2016 remake; it is obvious the material was really good and terrifying. Putting kids in danger always is.
I never read the IT book; but I understand that chapter two is basically within the same book.
Chapter 2; gather after 27 years the original ""Loosers Club"" when the only member staying in town realizes Pennywise is still alive.<br/><br/>It is not the same threatening kids than adults; so Muscetti uses lots of flashbacks with the original kids; but as we already know who survives there is no much to be scare there. So to compensate that, the movie takes the characters apart;. creates a few horror scenes for each character and then join them together in the final act in the big confrontation.<br/><br/>I cannot deny that I had several jumps on my seat; after the first two hours the movie becomes repetitive as the horror scenes and there is still another 50 minutes to go.<br/><br/>In terms of acting; Bill Skarsgard perfectly fill up Tim Curry shoes and sometimes is ever more terrifying.<br/><br/>As the adults; Bill Hader and James Ransone are the ones who really shine mostly because they are the comic relief. Chastain is completely lost here; her character is less written than the younger one. Mc Avoid is better but his characters is also underwritten. The rest is just standard fare.<br/><br/>In brief; if you see the first one you probably will want to see the second; but it is not really as good or terrifying"

It does have its humor and intense sequences just like the first film but it doesn't rely too much of the scares. Also, all the adult Losers are really good with their performances. I'm also glad to see the kid Losers play their part as well, as you'll also see some of the encounters with Pennywise you haven't seen before.<br/><br/>One nitpick I have is how goofy Pennywise can look when he's trying to scare the audience. I think he's a little more intimidating in the kid part from Chapter One but not much for this one.<br/><br/>Overall, I do enjoy this film. I went to the early premiere at my local theater at 5:00 pm and had a great night with my mom. If you enjoyed the first movie and are invested with the Losers, then don't hesitate to watch this film."
"samuelwhittaker","2","2","10","9 September 2019"," Everything which mad It: Chapter One special and fun is missing from Chapter Two
","It: Chapter One felt a lot like an adventure film; tonally it was closer to what you would expect from a Stranger Things movie than a typical Stephen King adaptation. This made the first film enjoyable for a wide audience, the jump scares and the horror was mixed in with childish banter and fun montage sequences (even when the losers club cleans Bev's blood-soaked bathroom the scene makes you feel good); it's a film which is ultimately about friendship and the potential for togetherness to overcome evil. It: Chapter Two fails to properly recognise that this is what made the first film standout.<br/><br/>The performances of the adult cast in It: Chapter Two are very passive and the film feels more like a straight-to-DVD affair when they are taking up the screen time. There's no chemistry between the adult actors and the script isn't strong enough to overcome this problem; there are some entertaining lines here and there which help to distract the viewer from the lacking quality which the film offers, but they are few and far between. The child actors still do a reasonable job but again the script doesn't give them the same scope for excellence.<br/><br/>The third aspect of the film which falls short is the plot itself; of course some of the problems here aren't necessarily the director/filmmakers fault as it is a project which is derivative, but with this said the pacing of the film and the way that the film is structured is extremely dull. As a viewer you're begging for the climax to the film, you know what to expect - Pennywise is going to scare the children and adults in various situations and this will lead the adults to finding their given artefacts through which they will eventually attempt a ritual to fight their foe; there's no fear. The adults and children will be fine, they have to be or the film can't continue along the structure mentioned.<br/><br/>Finally, the scares which are present are spoiled by a trope in the horror genre which is almost always negative and frustrating - the overuse of effects and CGI. Scenes which are otherwise tense and interesting are spoiled by this problem and that is perhaps the biggest shame in terms of this particular film.<br/><br/>Overall the film is underwhelming and it would have benefited greatly from a more subtle and careful approach in its direction. Audiences need to see these problems in order for the genre to move forwards, as if they do not then directors will continue along this path due to the attractive margins which are there to be sought within the horror genre; films like It Follows and The Babadook are one offs in the field and one can only hope that films like It: Chapter Two are critically assessed to improve future films of this ilk."

","Since the 70s, there's been great Stephen King adaptations (Shawshank, Green Mile, The Shining, Misery and Carrie), there's quite a few mediocre (Cujo, Children of the Corn, Pet Cemetery) and quite a few that are just rubbish (The risible Maximum Overdrive, Dreamcatcher, Dark Tower etc).
King's not to blame for the variable quality of course, not every director is Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>So where does It: Part 2 rank?<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first film for what it was, despite some silly moments and excessive jump scares. I appreciated director Andy Muschietti's style for the film and looked forward to seeing where the second film would go.
Unfortunately this anticipated follow up is quite frankly, more of the same.
Despite strong performances from all the cast (In particular Bill Hader) and some well executed set pieces, the genuinely creepy moments are dwarfed by CGI jump scares, but I have to admit, I jumped back in my chair several times. Cheap or not, those damn boo moments work.<br/><br/>However I still miss the era of films like The Shining, where slow tension and atmospheric chills were more important than cheap boo scares.
Not a bad film by any stretch, it's leagues above the frankly crap TV miniseries (Apart from a bonkers Tim Curry as Pennywise, the 90s version is pretty forgettable).
A solid addition to the genre (With a fun cameo from a genre master), but it's not exactly going to dethrone the great Stephen King adaptations.
But goddammit, I jumped back in my seat three times. And my partner loved it.
Recommended. I guess.... Yeah... go see it. Shrug."

","Personally, I expected to see a second chapter far better than I'd imagined. First of all, I was expecting a second chapter full of horror effects, which unfortunately I didn't get to see, from my point of view. Even the character of Pennywise, if we really want to talk about it, did not convey all this terror, that maybe I would have expected more from a character who should have instilled a lot of fear. In short, a second chapter that presents itself with endless facets, but that in the end, in my opinion, has only given the impression of a comic film compared to a real horror, by virtue of some ironic scenes, covering the real horror of this movie."

It took time to develop each character and felt like a kids movie at times. Also it wasnt just jump scares, but was really creepy at times as well.<br/><br/>Part 2 now is a whole different story. Even though calling it a story is wildly exaggerated, because really there is none and it is little more than a couple of scenes thrown together that serve as build up for jump scares.<br/><br/>I watched the movie with a female friend and she predicted every jump scare and was able to cover her eyes with her hands at the right time.<br/><br/>At some point the losers discuss they should not split up - the single dumbest thing people in horror movies always do, even though no one in their right mind would actually do that. Disappointing: one of them says ""we have to split up"" - no further explanation, no questions asked, and of course they do split up.<br/><br/>Plot holes - theres many of them. Of course part 1 had a couple as well, but it was a lovable movie, so the viewer could forgive that. Part 2 though is a hot mess.<br/><br/>Not a plot hole, but has anyone noticed that eddys band aid is on the wrong side of his face when the losers go down into the sewers? Though not a big deal, i am still always amazed how things like this happen in big budget productions.<br/><br/>And speaking of big budget, how did they mess up the cgi this bad? Even the clown looks ridiculous most of the time. The scene in the mirror cabinet, when his tongue is hangig out, might as well have been generated in snapchat app - it is that bad. And unfortunately it is exemplary for many more scenes to come.<br/><br/>Well anywho, in conclusion It part 2 really isnt a movie that has a well built up story.

It was missing so much magic of the first installment.<br/><br/>Even the actors, who are a great cast, felt slightly mistimed. There were many times where you knew they were trying to establish some connection because of their history together, but it came across as a delivered line rather than an emotional connection and believable.<br/><br/>It just didn't come together and close off what should have been an amazing ending with the storytelling and buy-in to the characters.

","'It Chapter Two (2019)' is larger than its predecessor in almost every way, most notably in its record-setting run-time (it is, after all, the longest horror film to date). As we all know, bigger doesn't always mean better. Thankfully, its inflated length doesn't necessarily feel like a misstep. Its pacing is pretty consistent and, despite a slightly baggy second act, it manages to remain engaging throughout. Even though it never quite captures the rag-tag spirit of the first flick, the piece seems like a genuine continuation of the overall story. Its cast are basically dead ringers for their young counterparts, recapturing their personalities within minutes of being on screen. The group dynamic isn't as strong as before but it still feels tangible, affected by a shared history that no member can quite remember alone. Plus, some scenes capture a real sense of child-like joy or heart-wrenching camaraderie, further highlighting the characters' indelible chemistry. When all the actors are together, the movie works rather well. This is especially true of its climax, which is exciting and entertaining in equal measure. It makes you care about every member of the losers club and, this time, the stakes are real. It helps that most of the key players have somewhat of a character arc as they each reveal their repressed, more real-world fears and struggle to overcome them. Of course, the flick has its issues. Firstly, it's really over the top. Most of the time, the on-screen horror just comes across as a little silly (people were laughing in my screening). Some of its horrific imagery works well, don't get me wrong. Pennywise is meaner and almost more menacing this time, leading to a villain that's not so much frightening as straight-up despicable. The picture is at its most successful when it pulls back on the CG and focuses on what you can't quite see, slowly tugging at what the characters fear most. Occasionally, it's rather suspenseful. However, it's never scary. Its second major issue is its tendency to aim for, and usually miss, comedy. Obviously, the odd bit of levity is in its DNA but, here, the humour doesn't always feel character-based and is often quite clunky - especially since the piece has an overall darker tone than the prior title. It takes you out of some key moments, as opposed to grounding you within them, and is only successful when it's the kind of uncomfortable laugh used to alleviate tension, one that comes strictly from a place of character. The film also has a slightly repetitive structure, primarily in the aforementioned baggy second act. For all its issues, though, it's still an enjoyable experience. By its end, it satisfyingly wraps up the saga. In a way, it's more than the sum of its parts. It's fun, but it's an imperfect part two. 7/10"

"julfeathers","2","1","5","7 June 2020"," Hey, Y'all Are Forgetting A Whole Lot of History To Film
","I haven't read every review here, but I agree if the whole crux of the movies rests on the Losers 27 years ago and in the present, it is like trying to make a meal out of a bag of potato chips--it is mostly air trapped in a big wind-bag of a few tasty morsels. I am an author so I always pay more attention to the book than the movie. Everybody is focusing on the Losers, then and now. But IT, in all its forms, is just as much of a character as Derry is because it has shaped the town for centuries to meet its needs.<br/><br/>IT comes to feed every 27 years for roughly a one year period. Its cycle starts with a particularly gruesome killing, and ends its cycle with a bloodbath. In Stephen King's book, some of the bombshells that closed out IT's season was a lumberjack going mad and chopping men up inside of a barroom like he was in a trance; the shooting massacre in the main street of Derry, Bonny and Clyde style, of a minor gang in the 1920s who were just passing through when they had car trouble; an Easter egg hunt for all of the kids of the town held out by a factory that exploded during the festivities and killed tens of children and adults; and my favorite recounting, the burning of The Black Spot, a club the black enlisted men at the army base in Derry built with the approval of their superiors because they weren't allowed to go to the whites' only club on base, circa WWII. IT didn't just feed on children; IT also fed on the root of adult fears too.<br/><br/>I think if the above had been included, IT could've been made into THREE movies that tied up all loose ends that are left hanging. Beverly's backstory could've been carried out to its conclusion with the death of her control freak husband. Bill finding and buying Silver would actually have a point instead of just being a throw-away cameo (which makes me wonder if Stephen King really has that accent since he has lived most of his life in Maine?) There's no reason to find Silver again except for the appearence of Bill's wife.<br/><br/>The one thing I LOVED about the movie was how Ben and Beverly saved each other from their respective fears which were about to kill them. Ben knew Beverly thought Bill wrote the poem from an earlier conversation, and had it hidden in him that he would always be known as the fat kid who never got the girl. But he whipped out that poem that gave her the strength to beat the trap she was in, so that she could save him.<br/><br/>The clown is sparingly used, as are the other incarnations used to scare the Losers. In the book, they aren't Mentally CGI'd on steroids. It is the simplest things in life that are the scariest. The rest is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Anyway, my thoughts that are definitely different because I want more of what I think are the most interesting parts of the story."

","There are few films that can create such imaginatively creepy monster but also be so void of tension. Halfway through I was confused that this somehow linked to one of Jim Henson's Universes. The constant flashbacks to youth and the empty town meant that the scares seemed like they were just gags. I couldn't tell if this was a Thriller horror, or a horror comedy - the result is either too serious or too inadvertently humorous."

","Whether it's 1 or 2, ""back to the clown"" is all about overcoming the fear that maybe something you're afraid of, maybe your family, maybe a painful memory you don't want to face.
When the members of the loser grew up and left the town, their memory of what had happened became more and more dim and even began to forget. It's just like in reality, we use avoidance to face the fear and responsibility we don't want to take on, and we use forgetfulness to hide the past we don't want to look back on, but in this way, we also lose the happiness we feel.
As the movie shows, when they come back to the town, their fear and pain in the town all come back, but more importantly, their happy time in the town, their unforgettable friendship, all come back.
Life is bound to go through all kinds of experiences and sufferings that you don't want to face, but if you don't want to admit that this is part of your life shadow, then how can life be complete?

","This movie is peurile, cashing in on the first one which wasn't much better. Absolute drivel. It's not even stupid, it's sad to think that humans would spend so much money on making this tripe. The creature toward the end looks like Iggy Pop on a good day."
"khanbaliq2","6","1","5","6 December 2019"," Small gripes aside, there's enough to love about It: Chapter Two to satisfy anyone's inner cynic.
","N an earlier post, I wrote about how only two films that were released in theaters during the summer pleased me. They're Toy Story 4 and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Well, Avengers: Endgame played in theaters during the summer too, but I don't consider it to be a very good film. There were also several other summer movies that I kind of like. So, when it comes to new Hollywood films, it wasn't a good summer or a bad summer. It was an average summer. I mean, one can't expect an excellent new film to be released every week. Who would have the time to go to a theater every week? This isn't realistic. Well, anyway, after the summer movie season came to an end, Hollywood quickly released several enjoyable films that make the summer movie season pale in comparison to this autumn movie season. I haven't seen every film that has been released in the autumn yet, but I can say that Terminator: Dark Fate, Zombieland: Double Tap, Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil, and Abominable are worth seeing. Most are so good that they can be seen more than once. I'd also like to see 21 Bridges, Charlie's Angels, Frozen 2, and Jojo Rabbit. Joker is a film that I think isn't worth seeing more than once. It's not a bad film. For a modern film, it's good, but the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired. I mean, it's no Apocalypse Now (1979). That's for sure. There are a few moments of brilliance in Joker, but, for the most part, it's a rather dull film, and I'm not judging it based on its message or content. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is good, but not extraordinary. The cinematography doesn't look very good. Most of the scenes in the film aren't interesting. And the direction, though certainly better than average for modern times, isn't very good either. What did surprise me is how much I enjoyed seeing It Chapter Two and Doctor Sleep. I don't think that these films are very good, but they're better than I expected them to be. In It Chapter Two, the director, Andy Muschietti, showed more of his artistic side, as he did in his fine horror film Mama (2013). It Chapter Two is more atmospheric, better shot, and features better acting than It (2017). And it doesn't rely as much on silly jump scares. All of this added together made it a more enjoyable film for an adult like me. But the film still suffers from the fact that, like It, it was made to appeal to as large an audience of modern moviegoers as possible. Doctor Sleep is another well shot and atmospheric film that was directed by Mike Flanagan, who directed the fine horror film Oculus (2013). As a film, Doctor Sleep is kind of enjoyable. The novel by Stephen King is, in my opinion, bloated and rather dull. Still, the film isn't much better because there's nothing about it that stands out. The acting is fine, but not great. The story is fine, but not very interesting. The cinematography is good, but not in any way truly appealing. The music isn't memorable. Some of the scenes are good, but most of the scenes are just passable. By the way, one of the horror films that I really enjoyed seeing lately is Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh (1995). It's better than I expected it to be. The first film, Candyman (1992), is, in my opinion, fantastic when it comes to its artistry. It's easily one of the best horror films of the 1990s. When I was thinking about it, I thought that it must be the best of the 1990s, but then I remembered that Scream (1996) was released in the 1990s too. Scream is overall a slightly better film than Candyman. With Candyman: Farewell To The Flesh, the filmmakers at least attempted to make a good film, and in some ways they succeeded. It's obviously inferior to Candyman, but the acting, the cinematography, and the direction still make it worth seeing. And, finally, I'm almost done with my Marvel Cinematic Universe marathon, which I began in May of this year, when I watched Iron Man (2008) again. From then on, I've been watching every MCU film in order, and I'm still not quite finished. Of course, it hasn't been an obsession with me because I haven't been watching the films one after the other all in one sitting. I've seen many other films in this time period too. In this way, I've now seen every MCU film at least twice, and I don't consider this to be a bad thing because MCU films are good. There still hasn't been a single bad MCU film. Quite impressive. The years 2018 and 2019 are particularly memorable in the history of the MCU because Marvel released four fantastic films one after the other. They're Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man And The Wasp, and Captain Marvel. When I watched these films again on home video I noticed how well made they are. The acting is good. The stories are interesting. The music is fitting. The entertainment factor is high. The special effects are excellent. Need I say more? I can say that by the time Phase Three began in the MCU, Marvel truly found its groove."

"gregoryfrancis","3","1","5","15 September 2019"," The CGI was bad, the character development was worse
","This was a long movie. A really long movie. Despite being such a long movie, every bit of character development occurred in the opening scenes. Not only that, but the character development that did occur was literally just the director/author taking a couple minutes each to tell the audience that yes, in fact, these characters as adults have lives consistent with their characters as children. Girl with abusive dad has abusive husband. Funny boy is a comedian. Hypochondriac boy does risk assessment. Fat boy is a now a certified HUNK but we don't even get the slightest back story on that.<br/><br/>Once this has all been established (as forcefully and mind-numbingly dull as possible), the characters no longer matter at all except for one-liners regarding their childhood traits. Sure, there are several scenes where the characters perform CGI-infested quests to retrieve ""artifacts"" related to their battle with It from childhood but, again, anything within these scenes that requires it to be that specific character is always done via reference than revelation.<br/><br/>Bev has had dreams about how all the characters die but this is somehow pushed aside and forgotten as soon as its brought up (as is any aspect of her character relating to the abusive dad to abusive husband thing).<br/><br/>If the movie was half the length it actually is, this would be somewhat forgivable but it isn't.<br/><br/>This brings me to my problems with the plot. Pennywise is the cheapest villain in horror film history. He is a clown that murders kids! This is the sort of nightmare stuff that should write itself. Instead of watching a killer clown meticulously plan out murders or stalk and seduce his victims (OR EVER DO A SINGLE CLOWN THING!) we get this way over-complicated story of him being some thousands year old spirit or god knows whatever that I guarantee no one paid attention to because its so boring. Its a movie about a clown that kills kids! We don't need the Native American spirituality backstory! What is wrong with you, Stephen King? I get it, I'm not as smart as you!<br/><br/>We get one scene of the clown killing the little girl, but it is entirely predictable and more or less a repeat of the scene with the little brother from the first movie. Neither painful nor scary to watch."

What's missing is a lot of the heart of the young cast, who show up on occasion to remind us how much better their chemistry was and how, when turned against unsuspecting children rather than seasoned adults with various coping techniques, It's over-the-top scares and shape-shifting antics were far more effective."
"2001ASOfan","4","1","5","11 September 2019"," A watchable mess, but just barely
","Note that I wasn't a fan of the original theatrical ""It"" this is ""Chapter 2"" to, as the mix of shape-shifting Pennywise goofiness mixed with heavy drama just didn't set well with me, and I thought it ultimately failed both as a horror film and serious character study. Pennywise and his various forms just aren't that frightening to me, and some of the heavy drama is downright brutal compared to the shapeshifting silliness. It's jarring, and just doesn't work. This new chapter, without getting into spoilers, also manages to add a depressingly mixed, confused, and vague message to viewers about hate crimes that is truly queasymaking. Bill Hader is the standout for acting among the adults here, but the character he plays is also given a too-vague treatment. The subtlety means some (maybe even many) viewers will not even realize what his character's epiphany is as a person. I will say I wasn't bored watching it, even at almost 3 hours long, but I was put off by the lack of clarity and some of the more ridiculous, loud, silly monster moments. This film also veers wildly between extremes of heavy drama and some completely goofy monster and demon special effects and noise, just like the first, and, again, the combination just doesn't work."

","It chapter 2 was a fine follow up to my personal favorite horror movie of all time. The first movie to me was the best horror film of all time and nothing as of now can top it.
It chapter 2 was a good movie but to me didn't need to be as long. I have no issues with long movies as long as it doesn't just stretch the runtime to stretch it. The length needs to add detail, meaning, entertainment and feeling. I feel like they stretched the movie during certain parts that they didn't need. The mid way point of the movie where they all went separate to get the artifacts seemed totally unnecessary. This movie also wasn't even close to as scary as the first one and only made me jump a few times. The jumps scares weren't pulled off well because the tension building up to it wasn't pulled off very well. Another thing was that it just wasn't as creepy or had as much gore as the first one. Bill hader made the movie for me. He was hilarious in every scene and that was what he was supposed to do. He made the movie a lot better for me. I think there were some great parts in this movie, but it never felt fully complete. I was so excited for this movie, and I enjoyed it, but I walked out of the theater not as satisfied as I wanted to. Over all it's a fine movie, but as a sequel to one of the best horror films ever, very underwhelming. 7/10 for me."

"TheMovieDoctorful","3","1","6","9 September 2019"," The Magic is Gone
","I want to make one thing perfectly clear before I get into why this film doesn't work at all. I loved It: Chapter One. You're gonna see a lot of pieces on Letterboxd over the course of this month go on about how the first film was never that good and that's just not something I'm going to buy into. As far as I'm concerned, the first film was a masterpiece and, in my opinion, the best film of 2017. I was so excited for the 2nd installment (I'm of the opinion that the 2nd half of the book is actually better than the first), that I opted to see it in IMAX instead of a regular theater (My first IMAX viewing since I was 5 years old) So when I tell you this is a really bad film, understand that I left that IMAX feeling like someone had died. I was the last person who wanted to be the bearer of bad news.<br/><br/>Not everything fails. This is, after all, a follow-up fona great film in my opinion. Almost all of the acting is quite excellent. Jessica Chastain as Beverly absolutely steals the show. You can tell she really studied the Hell out of this role as she captures a lot of the subtle facial acting choices of Lillis in this first movie. She's strong, she's fierce, she's funny, she's sympathetic. I have friends who are only interested in seeing this film for her performance and they likely won't be disappointing. Isaiah Mustafa is also fantastic as Mike Hanlon. Chapter Two gives Mike a lot more to do and definitely makes him into a more well developed and rounded character than the first film and Mustafah really helps to mold him into a rather mysterious, wise presence. James Ransone is practically a clone of an older Jack Dylan Grazer, in both appearance and vocal delivery. In fact, only one actor in the film seems to deliver a bad performance in my eyes, who we'll get to later.<br/><br/>The aesthetic is impressive as well. From the stunning and shocking practical effects used for the film's wide variety of monsters to the pleasing cinematography (IT Chapter Two's clever use of Dutch angles in particular really stuck with me) Muschieti (clearly a talented filmmaker, despite this film's failure) has a wonderful visual eye that's fully on display here.<br/><br/>Remember earlier when I said that only one actor gives a bad performance in this film? Unfortunately, that actor is the lead. James McAvoy, despite being a great actor, seems to completely phone it in as Bill Denbrough. His performance seems disinterested and devoid of passion. It's like he out so much into his earlier performance this year in Glass that he had nothing to give to his performance as Bill. It doesn't help that Chapter Two's characterization of Bill comes off as creepy and possessive (""Why can't you be the woman I want you to be?"" he tells his own wife.)<br/><br/>It Chapter Two is possibly the worst edited film I've seen in theaters. That includes both Justice League and The Snowman. I'm not exaggerating an ounce when I say that nearly a third of the movie is just deleted scenes from the first film used as flashbacks. Almost every single one of these scenes don't exist in this cut of the movie for the purposes of character development or exploration of theme, but for more random spooky clown scenes. Not only are they unnecessary, not only are they lazy ways to make a rather small and unsubstantial film feel artificially epic, they're incredibly distracting and actually end of removing a lot of development from the adult cast. Ben's scene with Beverly in particular really rubbed me the wrong way. It's funny how Beverly's most in-character scene in Chapter Two is when she's actually Pennywise in disguise.<br/><br/>So much of the film seems aimless. It will set up certain aspects like a child in danger who reminds Bill of his late brother or an ancient Native American ritual of faith and friendship used to banish Pennywise and then go absolutely nowhere with them. Said child dies anticlimactically and the ritual that the film spent so much of its plodding, meaningless runtime ends up failing.<br/><br/>Ideas that the previous film set up are equally wasted. I was very curious to see where Beverly and Ben's romance would go in Chapter Two, one of my favorite love stories in literature. Sadly, it ends up having the passion of 2 sock puppets rubbing against each other. The attraction begins and ends at ""Beverly loves poetry, Ben wrote a great poem, now they're gonna kiss."" Maybe the film could have given their romance more depth and believability had it spent less time on unnecessary and pointless scare scenes, but that's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>Not only is It: Chapter Two a bad movie, it's a morally offensive one. The brutality and pointless nature of the film's beginning homophobic hate crime is horrible to witness. Fans of the book will argue it's merely being accurate to the source material, but with all of the pathos and humanity It Chapter Two removed from King's masterpiece, what made this one scene an absolute must to include? Don't even get me started on the film treating Eddie's suicide as a good thing because he was ""the weakest of the group"" and couldn't weigh down the Losers Club (I'm not even making that up, that's the exact terminology the film uses)<br/><br/>I never thought that a film could be released this year as disappointing and potential shattering than Pet Sematary, but It: Chapter Two takes the cake. An insult to its predecessor, an insult to the book and an insult to King as a storyteller."

","First thing, his film is waaayyy too long. The first half is entertaining and creeping with glimpses of Pennywise. However, the main problem with this film, is when they decided to let the CGI team run away with their ridiculous ideas. The CGI part when Pennywise becomes some monstrous spider is plain silly, and just seems to go on and on and on. Why in a multi million dollar film, did someone what realise that sometimes less is more.
This seems to be a problem with a lot of Stephen King films. The idea is good, the films usually start off well, but then just seem to spiral out of control, into a CGI mess. Instead of creepy, Pennywise became boring, non scary, and too be honest, I couldn't wait for the film to end. I didn't seem to be alone in this, as the majority of the audience also appeared bored and disappointed.

"kennysphomer","1","1","17","15 September 2019"," Homophobic movie
","I am extremely disgusted by the fact that this movie contains so many homophobic subliminal messages. They try to balance it out with small frictions of scenes where they show support for the LGBT community, but the fact is it's not balanced out at all. The scenes where they show support towards LGBT community is so disguised that barely you can even see it or recognise it, unlike the violence parts which are extremely explicit and shown all the way. The scenes where homophobia is displayed and encouraged are far bigger then the opposite ones. When you look at the plot it self, of course out of all of the possible characters only the ones that are shown to be in touch with their sensitive side or that are shown to be gay, end up being either dead or in eternal sadness. What normal message can a young gay person get out of this kind of movie? I'm extremely disappointed that Hollywood is producing such movies in 2019 which are doing no good to LGBT community what so ever. I am also truly disappointed in all of the actors that played roles in this movie giving their support to it as well. I truly hope people will open their eyes and see how many bad subliminal messages this movie is showcasing to millions and millions of people. The only people that end up happy in this movie are of course the straight people, where the other ones end up dealing with either great loss or terrible death. Wake up people! Don't show support for movies that are undoing all of the positive work that has been done for LGBT community!"

","Bill Hader was the only redeeming quality in this film. I loved the original IT and was excited for my teenagers to watch this one with me. The setting was great, the adult actors seemed fine but the cartoonlike campy villans were exceptionally distracting. Pennywise reminded us of Turbo from Wreck-It-Ralph in both physical form and personality. The storyline made little sense and the character arcs were shallow. Checked the time more than once to see how much longer the movie was going to continue. Sad."

","Gloriously entertaining and deliciously macabre, the much anticipated follow up to the incredible reboot a couple of years ago has plenty of fun scenes, although it could do with a tighter edit. 27 years after the terrifying events in Derry, Pennywise has returned and the group of friends that went their seperate ways must reunite to face and defeat him. It's a truly great feeling when you're watching one of these sequences in which Pennywise manifests into a creepy old lady moving peculiarly in the background or bizarre creations lurking out of fortune cookies; the feeling that a dedicated film crew spent time making these grotesque beauties for horror fans to revel in is deeply enjoyable! Bill Skarsgard is naturally fantastic in his now iconic role as Pennywise the Clown; the tense encounter between him and a young girl towards the beginning is a nerve shreddingly and greatly comic example. All the cast are great and the visuals are really extraordinary in Pennywise's altering of the groups perceptions. There's no doubt that, clocking it at almost three hours, it is absolutely overlong and there are flashback sections which do not particularly add to the narrative, making it less rewatchable. Nevertheless, it's a must for fans of the previous film and it knows how to do blockbuster horror spot on"

","On one hand I'm happy they didn't make a trilogy out of this story. On the other hand I'm not sure if a sequel was needed. I liked the first movie as it was but based on how the first ""It"" ended, with pennywise not being defeated entirely. I understand why they made a sequel to end the story completely. I enjoyed the first movie because it was fun to see kids fighting a monster and facing their fears. Now 27 years later it feels like every other horror movie with adults in it. So I'm not surprised of how it ended. Thus I don't like it. I think the flashbacks towards the past were among the funnier and scarier. I preferred seeing the characters as kids like they were in the first movie. Also the way the characters eventually defeat Pennywise is kind of dumb and lazy. I could see where the writers were lazy with the script and it's near the end. Calling Pennywise a ""clown"" and mocking him was really a lame idea. I don't know what else I would have done but the ending to me felt like one of Bill's disappointing book endings. At least there's a cameo of Steven King."

It drags so much, that by the time the final hour or so rolls around, I was just tired. It's a pretty diverting final hour, but it too is needlessly extended.

","Living up to It (2017) is a difficult task to do, but I really can't fault the creators for It Chapter Two not being as good as the first. It Chapter Two tries too hard to be as good as the first that it copies everything about the first. The camera tricks and chase scenes are literally a copy and paste. They should have done some new things to make It Chapter Two feel more like a sequel and not a remake. The best sequels of all time added something new, like Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.<br/><br/>The plot brings back all of the characters, except for Stanley. The plot contains a lot of subplots; a little too much in fact. I'm surprised that they were able to make It Chapter Two 2h 50min, which sounds long, but there was a lot to unravel in this new plot. What It Chapter Two suffers from is the choppy pacing. Luckily, the pacing wasn't too choppy enough to make the film lose it's intensity.<br/><br/>What I disliked the most was the characters. None of the new versions of the Loser's Club were likable, except for Mike. It Chapter Two focuses a lot on the characters' quests rather than the actual characters. They gave a bunch of exposition about the Losers after beating Pennywise when they were younger, but little exposition about their new current lives. Because of the lack of exposition given to the current losers, they weren't even comparable to their younger versions from the original. Also, the acting was way worse for some reason. These new actors are adult professionals, but they gave worse performances than their younger counterparts. I hated Bill Hader's performance of Richie, he made Richie seem like a jerk who cracks stupid jokes all the time. Finn Wolfhard did a way better job with the character, he made Richie goofy and likable.<br/><br/>The good part was the use of CGI. The CGI created a lot of cool imagery that seemed like illusions. Because of the CGI, it really made It Chapter Two feel like an It movie. There was a little too much CGI being used to create the monsters, but I guess it's just personal preference whether you like it or not. But for some reason, the scenes that were supposed to be intense, didn't really feel that intense.<br/><br/>I really liked It (2017), but It Chapter Two really failed on almost every level. None of the characters were likable; almost unlikable. There was too much subplots, even though it was necessary for the story. Because of all of the subplots, there was little exposition given to the new versions of the characters. It Chapter Two also suffers from a subpar screenplay and terrible acting. It Chapter Two isn't a bad movie, but it's really disappointing."

","Whether it is 1 or 2, it is all about a theme, that is to overcome fear, this fear may be something you are afraid of, perhaps your family, or a painful memory you do not want to face. When the members of Loser grew up and left the town, their memories of the previous encounter became more and more blurred, and they even began to forget. It's like in reality, we use evasion to face the fears and responsibilities we don't want to take, and use forgetting to hide the past that we don't want to look back on. As expressed in the film, when they returned to the town, their fear and pain in the town all came back, but more importantly, those happy and happy times in the town, those they The unforgettable friendship has also returned. Life will certainly experience all kinds of encounters and pains that you do not want to face, but if you are not willing to admit that this is part of the shadow of your life, then how complete is life.

","I finally saw this movie after being sorry I missed it in the theaters last summer.<br/><br/>Well, I have to say the wait was worth it! I only paid $5.99 to see it on Google Play rather than a full movie theater ticket of $12.00!<br/><br/>The movie is full of special effects and gore - occasionally I got a good scare but more than anything else this film tired me out! After about an hour I was caught up more with all the composting of film, the trick shots, the editing, the set design, etc because all I could think of was ""How did they come with that idea and how many people and hours did that shot require???"" Shot after shot, sequence after sequence.<br/><br/>The main problem - without giving anything away - is that this ""It"" alien can distort time and space by affecting people's minds. So all kinds of things happen but then - guess what - they really didn't happen. Or maybe a few really did? After awhile I just gave up and chalked it up to the alien, then ultimately just chalked it up to the director and writer.<br/><br/>The secondary problem is that King's work usually entails personal dramas, histories and relationships between many of the characters. That may work well on the page but for a real killer-diller monster movie it just bogs everything down. In this film particularly - I guess because the producer and director wanted to be really faithful to the book - it's just one personal conflict after another. The ""It"" monster uses these personal facts to create horrors specific to the characters - but, again, in order for those moments of horror to happen, we have to sit through memories and recountings and confessions ad nauseum.<br/><br/>Every monster movie has a final confrontation with the rampaging beast and this movie is no exception. Unfortunately, in this movie, given all I've said, it's just more of the same only on a bigger scale."
"mikbanerjee1","6","0","1","15 April 2020"," It doesn't have the same feel as its predecessor!
","I loved 'IT', the first movie. That is surely one of my top favorite horror movies like ever! So as usual I had too much excitement for the sequel 2 years after. Alas! That eagerness resulted in a poor Sigh. This chapter two isn't bad but not great either. As most of us are coming from the first movie; expecting the same experience once again! That's why majority of us couldn't really liked the film. No matter how hard I tried, believe me; I wanted it to be good. But unfortunately, honestly saying it's not even close to what 'IT' was!<br/><br/>The Storyline here is convoluted, messy. The writing here arouses much more questions than answers! Characters lacked depth unlike the first one, where the character build ups were brilliantly done! As a result of poor characterization; I couldn't really feel much connection to them. The relatability factor was on the lower side. The performances are fine, Greatly assembled set of actors who are both talented and experienced; gave all they could. But The emotional connection I felt with the child actors on the previous film was surely missed in here. The horror scenes are too many, at one time it becomes repetitive in nature. The extra long duration don't help either. Some scenes seemed unnecessarily stretched! Although the scenes themselves are made well enough regarding the technicalities and CGI work but the surprise element was long gone after the first few. Having said that, the confusive blend of Sci Fi And Horror, that I couldn't really fathom. It looks like the makers decided to put some tributes to Some Famous Sci Fi films like Alien, ET etc.<br/><br/>In the end it's a decent okayish movie, that doesn't really justify as a sequel, but could have done better, had it been a standalone one."

","A second time viewing Chapter 2. What can I say? I love it. It along with Halloween are my favorite horror franchises. They were the first horror movies I've seen as a kid in the 90s. Initially I felt like Chapter 2 was the weakest in the franchise but it has grown on me. I think you can like all the parts for different reasons.<br/><br/>Initially I didn't like the long runtime. 3 hours for movies was popular in 2019. I sometimes feel a movie takes itself too seriously and it makes me not really want to watch it. However as a fan of IT it's actually a treat. You get more time to enjoy the movie. Also it's different watching it at home than in the theater when it first came out. You can split this up in two viewings. This is actually enjoyable as it feels like you're watching 2 movies for the price of 1.<br/><br/>I also initially wasn't really impressed with the story. A criticism of the 1990 It was that the first part with the kids was better than with the adults, because their bond felt more natural. Because I wasn't really in the mood for this movie also because because back then I felt the 1990 version is superior, I wasn't really locked into the story. The chemistry is actually terrific in this version. The Losers Club have that special bond that made It 1990 a classic. A group of abandoned people must fight darkness and only have a small group of true friends to help them. That has always been the heart of It. Even though it's 27 years later the Losers Club are still as close as ever. This is the result of good acting and good writing. With almost 3 hours worth of movie a lot of time is spend giving the characters depth.
What I also liked is the humor. This is criticized but I liked it. A bit of comic relief made the friendship feel more genuine but also because it's a movie after all so a bit of comedy never hurts it.<br/><br/>Lastly Pennywise was terrifying in this one. Always the menacing presence that somehow always seem to be present. I liked how there's different scenes with Pennywise than the 1990 version. There were some parts that are familiar but overall it was a fresh story.<br/><br/>A very entertaining and solid sequel and I'm sure more fans will appreciate it more as time goes by."

I was not very old when it came out and I saw it, only 10, but it scared me so much that it lasted well I to my adult years. And I LOVE horror movies. I watch all of the horror movies that I can possibly come by, and none of them have scared me. The only movie to truly horrify me is the original Tim Curry version of It. The last time that I was able to watch it in ends entirety was when I was 20 years old. I am now almost 33 as I am watching the second installment of the remake. if you are capable, completely remove your expectations based on the old movie. There is nothing that could ever or will ever come close to the amount of insane horror that movie brings, and I can't explain why. With that being said, love these new movies were pretty darn good. They stood true to the old movie, while adding some pretty interesting aspects. It's true, that pennywise was not as scary as Tim Curry was able to make him be, but these movies added an emotional depth that the old movie lacked. yes, the old movie made us feel things, but this movie made us feel a whole lot more for the characters. It wasn't just horror it was romance and drama and love and sadness and anguish and everything that somebody could possibly feel all wrapped up into one tiny horrifying clown bundle. I am sad to say, and this is why this movie is not a 10 and is instead a 9, that the clown himself and all of his monstrosity is did not terrify me the way that they are original pennywise dead. Maybe that is just me, and anyone like me who was subject to the original torture. I am not afraid of monsters, and so therefore the only time my bad dreams have ever scared me has been when they are of pennywise the clown. the original.

","Hi there! Just a 2 cents or a penny.<br/><br/>I saw this film online (missed it in theaters, although theaters are becoming deserted with the virus happening) and was really looking forward to it. I can say it is a great film (not to Oscar level but very good yes). I read the reviews after seeing it and I am amazed (in the sad way) that it takes so much for people to find anything good these days (I'm not difficult in general with most films, no that does not mean I have no taste or I am witless -> Tastes will be tastes, to each their own). It's like that:<br/><br/>Lots of films, lots and lots of films -> People want Excellence, each time now. Because, now, more critical and 'don't have time/money' to give to 'lesser' film...
That's a huge problem these days, and not just films basically everything in arts (movies, books, video games, art pièces, etc). Nothing is ever good enough.
I will respect people's opinion about this film, I just find it sad that people can't be happy (about anything). Are there derivative films, books, etc...? Absolutely, but the Entire domain of art is derivative in itself. I don't like this word but it is what it is; films are influenced by everything and many other films before. Things can repeat themselves at some point (at the 1millionth film). Everything has been made/done/created/invented...not much more to do/invent/be original.<br/><br/>In other words people should be more lenient and forgiving instead of hypercritical and judgmental about everything. But such are our times.<br/><br/>Anyway, to review this film here, for my opinion/feeling, I loved it.<br/><br/>I watched the First It and it was great, I remember watching the It film in 1980s...great film. The remake was great...and this one too.<br/><br/>''But...CGI...But...boring story....But....CGI....But....Not scary....But...Jump Scares...But.....CGI....But want Practical Effects/Make-Up....But...But...But.''<br/><br/>Look we are in 2020, yes the audience still decides what goes in the film, but we aer Today and today, things are bit diferent about how they are made. That the films (It Chapter 1 remake and Chapter 2) are not like the original 80s anyone is normal...we are today/things in film are made differently for Various reasons.<br/><br/>CGI is used to save money (albeit it can be costly), in general, it saves a lot, it is economical and why is used. It is also safer (don't need to have stunt people), there is a place for it, jsut like any other tools (like prostethics). No, it does not look good as those old 'real' effects, true, but it looks pretty good even so. There is good blend of real and CG effects in this film, ok yes, there is more of them, but I thought they are Extremely well-made (you can tell this is Not a crap VFX movie, they put Lots of effort in them and they look pretty impressive.) People are taken out of it becasue they can't 'suspend their disbelief' when they see a CGI pennewise clown. Suspend it. I did it, anybody can. It takes convincing yourself and not 'seeing CGI'...because that'S what people are doing, don't focus on that, focus on the 'whole'. But people focus on micro-détails and say :''That's it I'm disengaged in this film/I just don't 'get in it' because everything looks fake''. It is like when you were Young and your mommy would tell you a story in bed...you have to get in it - you have too even if you don't believe it for a second.<br/><br/>Story: 5 or 6 friends from early days get back togethere to destroy an ancient evil force that lives in the town sewers; taking the form of a 16th century costumed 'renaissance-style' Clown. Pennywise. The town is called City of Derry. The Second Chapter is them as adults (first chapter was children). In first chapter they k*ll him and so it ends like that. In 2nd chapter he comes back 27 year later. Mike the friend in the group calls them all back - after nearly 30 years....it's awkward. But they were best friends so he tells IT is back, and IT wants to end it (them - not IT...I know confusing). The Clown is a manfestation of their fear...because clowns are a fear humans have. Clowns are scary because they related to childhood. Children....clowns make children laugh and give them funny balloons...except this clown...is no clown; but death with jaws and k*iller wits. He can sense their fear and this film has a lot of 'Nightmare of Elm's Street' vibes...where Freddy was in 'the nightmares'..came to you while you slept. IT is clear the director of this film plays on that. By going the people's fear and by exploring this past through flashbacks whence they were Young kids. IT 2 tries to blend pure horror with comedy, in some places it might be a bit shoehorned in...but most of the film did a great job of meshing 'jokes' with serious horror/scares. There quite a few jumpscares..but Nothing that really Terrifies you..but yes this film is scary (By moments) and have lots of comedy thrown in the two (because the film is trying to make moment of 'relief' and comedy...to not be continuously scary). Now I know some peolpe hate that because it is neither comedy nor horror but a mash-up. Yet, I would say, this film blends it very well and Nothing is so cringey or really dumb...or takes you of it. Because, the film is capable of exposing their lives with lots of details...flashbacks etc...these Feel like real people Not fake people. They crack jokes and constantly are 'self-aware' of their situation whic is 'implausible' yet they make it plausible. Because they laugh of it and go straight in it. And there are moments where they cry, they are completely frozen in fear....the film does really good job of showing Nuanced characters. I read the reviews and some said ''we don't care about them, they have 0 characterization....''. I have a diffrent opinion, I believe they are Very characterized, through Many Many flashbacks and we know their Entire life...I even felt bad when one person dies..because you Care about them - All. Like a group of friends. Real people, they tease each other, they make jokes, they Even face a Monster...in the film...talk about cool. Very few films can blend this so well. It makes me think of the film 'Drag me to Hell', 'Evil Dead', 'Army of Darknes''...those old comic-horror films of the 80s, that did a nice job of blending comedy and horror (also 'Shaun of the Dead'...like that).But if I were to compare these films to IT Chapter 2...I was much more scared in it, because the film going quite serious in its horror when it does happen; there are a Lot of F* bombs word in this film..which is a no-no in films..but here it works because these people are real and talk real. The actors were Really good and did their best to give it all. All of them went through the all gamut of emotions during the film. I understand people may not like this if don't like comedy-horror combo; either one or the other, but not both. As for the CGI, cut some slack. It was very good and loved this film. It is 3 hours long but I was very rivited for whole this time...I truly feel I had a great time watching this, even if 3 hours long. IT was not long because enjoyed it very much. I look forward the IT Chapter 3 very much. If people want to make a IT like they want...they can go do it, but making films is Huge process and you can't please everybody. Just a 2 c/penny."
"baileycrawly","8","0","2","15 March 2020"," An Improvement On the First One
","Going into It Chapter Two, I was fully expecting this movie to be awful.<br/><br/>The adult portion of the story has notoriously been poorly portrayed. The adult half is easily the less compelling part of the book and the part of the miniseries where the story quickly begins to lose favor with the audiences.
Once again, this film does a good job of making an abridged version of a novel that wasn't all that great to begin with.<br/><br/>The positives are much the same as the original one. I loved the efforts to go back to story elements of the first one to add things in that were left out of the original. It creates a nice little nod to the original and offers enough additional content to maintain interest and enrich the story. The way in which the side of the story in this film is portrayed was done successfully and interestingly, and the surplus runtime was sufficient enough to tell the story without making it feel cramped, rushed or diluted.<br/><br/>Pennywise falls victim once again to the awful special effects that have a major diminishing effect on the final product. Bill is a fantastic actor who doesn't need digital enhancements. This film, however, is a little less of a disservice to him, offering him a bit more of an opportunity to act without hiding behind a computer generated artificial image.<br/><br/>This is a movie not without its flaws, but it's by far more enjoyable than the first chapter with enough of substance to make it worthwhile to watch again. Still, the two movies together are more than sufficient. A supercut would be interesting but, beyond that, I'm hoping that this story stays where it is. Just like I said in the review for the first chapter, this is a story that works best when it's limited to the imaginations of the readers instead of diluted for film. Although I will always maintain IT to be among the weakest of King's novels, it would be foolish to not acknowledge the beloved status it holds among Constant Readers. The films will only have a diminishing effect on the books.
This was a solid entry in the King universe, but let's let it end with that."

"TxMike","Null","0","1","26 January 2020"," Pervasive filthy language is a put-off but otherwise an interesting sequel.
","I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. It is disheartening that script writers choose to add so much filthy language, not just occasionally but all the way through the movie. It is at best a distraction, at worst ruins the viewing experience for many people. It is unnecessary and just represents lazy writing.<br/><br/>I watched the first movie, ""It"", almost two years ago. It was set in 1989 and the kids were generally around 13 during filming. They used the same kids for this movie, filmed two years later, so they were generally around 15-ish.<br/><br/>In this story it is 27 years later, 2016, and Pennywise has made his appearance again. The kids are all grown up now, all 40-ish, and scattered around the country, mostly not keeping in touch. Until Mike, who still lives in Derry (fictional Maine town), contacts them and tells each they must return. They had made a pact back in 1989, if Pennywise indeed did show up again the only way to eradicate him would be the participation of all of them.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed the dual time period and the dual sets of actors. At appropriate times the story switches to 1989, at other times to 2016 and is done in an interesting way. Rather than dwell on the horror that the movie includes, and there is lots of it, I mostly focused on the relationships between the old pals and at times the townspeople, comparing what was going on among them in 1989 vs 2016. Even Stephen King himself has a role, as a shopkeeper of old items, one of the grown boys finds his old bike there and buys it.<br/><br/>Yes it is long at almost 3 hours, but except for the pervasive and unnecessary filthy language, I enjoyed the movie."

"glyn-25860","3","0","1","23 January 2020"," A Bloated Mess
","It Chapter 1 was a 5 out of 10 film and that film shares the same problem as the second chapter. They are not scary. This chapter however manages to be something even worse. The second chapter could have really built upon the lack of tension and scares but this seems to want to be a comedy. The grown up cast are ok but the flashbacks that were done via de-aging is so obvious and really off putting.
The film is also way too long. It is so bloated where you are given scene after scene of characters being chased by something. There is absolutely no fear element here what so ever!! I found myself laughing where Mrs Kersh chases Beverly. This was promoted in the trailer as a suspenful scene but comes off as probably the funniest scene in the movie.
The film is just so badly paced compared to other Stephen King films at 3 hours. The Director's Cut of Doctor Sleep and The Green Mile both clock in at 180 minutes and they are both hugely satisfying. Again just like the first movie, Pennywise is just not menacing. Everytime the clown is about to kill someone the scence cuts to CGI teeth or a CGI face.<br/><br/>The fact remains that Cary Fukanaga's version would have been so disturbing and utterly scary if only Warner Bros. had the balls to go through with it. The concept art for Pennywise alone is more scary then Bill Skarsgard's performance!!
Instead they opted for a Director whose only film before IT was Mama that equally as forgettable. Yet another example of how not to do horror."
"Sprinklethealoha","8","0","1","20 January 2020"," great horror flick with an actual story line
","Horror has changed sooo much in the last few decades that I've been watching horror. Most sequels are painful to watch but the fx on this was amazing and there are a ton of scares to make this a true horror flick. But the pace is much faster than most of Stephen King's movies so I appreciate that. I loved how the group of friends are older now and reunited and it's their strength of friendship that keeps them going. Much like real life. It's much more gory than the first one. It had a great story line, there was a ton of swearing, but no senseless sex that usually pops up in cheeesy B horror flicks"

Stanley did not sacrifice himself, he was just a coward and why did they make ITs true for half a clown?? Its meant to be a full blown alien spider type thing!

There are several flashbacks of them as kids encountering Pennywise and his terrifying antics in this second one too. Speaking of which Bill Skaarsgard is so impressive.

"fatamorgana-40208","7","0","1","12 January 2020"," Another failed ending....
","The ending to Stephen King's novel ""IT"" was awful and this movie made sure to follow the same path.
In this movie they poke fun at how bad the finale in King's novel actually was, not once but several times, in a not so subtle tongue in cheek manner, even by the King himself in a cameo role...so knowing this, the makers of this film then proceeded to make an ending that was actually worse than the novel's ending! Unbelievable!!!
The ending blatantly stole the climax to every lousy ""possession"" movie in existence..... non-believing skeptic goes their entire lives without believing in god and then in a matter of two seconds does an about face and believes in god and goodness and the evil is vanquished.
Same premise here but actually somehow worse....the whole gang is terrified of Pennywise but amazingly in a span of a few seconds their fear becomes strength and they come up with a last ditch effort to chant that he is small. He then magically shrinks down to the size of a small child and has no power left...
Why? It's chanting people...come on... the power of chanting....Ha!!
The rest of the movie is a 7 at best...probably a 5or 6 if I felt like being brutally honest...but Pennywise is cool right?"
"Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews","8","0","1","7 January 2020"," Will we float down to the theater for IT: Chapter 2?
","The Stream: The movie is definitely about 45 minutes too long.<br/><br/>The Big Screen: The comedy and scares keep you going the whole time.<br/><br/>The Final Bill: This movie is way too long but quite entertaining.<br/><br/>-S2S: Movie Review<br/><br/>Welcome back to Derry... I mean welcome back to Stream to Big Screen. This week we have before you a review of Stephen King's IT, Chapter 2. IT2 is the sequel/second part to It (2017). With a star-studded cast featuring James McAvoy as Bill, Bill Hader as Richie, Jessica Chastain as Bev, and Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise, the movie is not lacking for acting talent to finish up the revamped horror classic. Speaking of revamped, I do recommend watching the original It (1990) and/or reading the best-selling novel (1986). Those of you that take that challenge, please comment and let us know how this version of It compares to those versions. For those of you living under a rock, we've included below the trailer to freak you out in preparation for the movie.<br/><br/>IT2 does some things very well. I really enjoyed how the story was told. I didn't read the novel, but I'm sure it gave the movie crew a ton of material to expand upon and visualize. And boy did they take every liberty with those. Nonetheless, I often found myself glued to the movie and not taking my eyes off of the screen. The writer and director worked well together to really dive deep into the emotions and fears of each character. On top of that, the writing did a great job of keeping the comedy and comedic relief through the movie, just like the original. IT2 stayed true to the original in those facets, which I appreciated, but it found a way to be it's own as well.<br/><br/>Next, the cast did a really good job channeling their younger selves and matching their adult selves in the original. The main cast that I mentioned above, fit so well. I couldn't imagine the movie without them (If you've seen the movie, comment on a couple actors you think might have been good replacements).<br/><br/>BUT THE GLARING ISSUE WITH THIS MOVIE IS THE LENGTH. I mean the original movie was told in a marathon,3 hours and 7 minutes, but included both child and adults halves. IT2 alone was 2 hours and 44 minutes of only the adult portion of the novel/movie. I understand the producers grabbing at money by splitting the movie but can we think about the consumers/viewers at all. Nearly 3 hours for half of a story is unreal. The director definitely could've shortened this movie by 30 to 44 minutes. There seemed to be endless amounts of flashback scenes or hallucinations from the past. While they were all good to watch, I would've preferred them to just shorten the movie instead.<br/><br/>The only other issue for me dealt with the scares in the movie. There were a few really good jump scares in the movie. The problem for me is that I felt the movie didn't give us anything new to be afraid of or fear. On one hand, I could praise the consistency and continuity to Part 1. On the other hand, I would've preferred a surprise or more originality. On top of that, I can think of at least 2 scare scenes that elongated the movie unnecessarily. Those could've been taken out and no one would've missed them AT ALL.<br/><br/>Lastly, it bothered me that the film didn't dive into Mike's mental state as a pre-teen like they did the others. They mention his issues in passing but it seemed like each character had a dedicated 10 minute deep dive but he was forgotten. It wasn't a huge issue for me as it didn't really occur in the original movie either but with all the liberties that were take, they could've done the same for his story.<br/><br/>Long story short, of course this is a movie you should see in the theaters and judging by the first 3 weekend sales (171 million), you already did. The issue is that this movie is way too long for no reason and a lot of the scares lack umph because they are too similar to Part One. Nevertheless, the cast, suspense and the laughs make It: Chapter 2 the perfect matinee movie, if you have free time and a must see Halloween season stream."
"SafReviews","6","0","1","6 January 2020"," Liked most of the movie, except the ending
","I actually liked chapter 1 and I was eager to watch chapter 2 and It didn't disappoint for the most part. The plot was very intriguing and kept me engaged up until around 2 hours, and the ending ruined it for me. I felt the last scene with It just didn't have any logic and it wasn't thrilling. Also, I didn't find the movie scary, just like chapter 1 which I did expect to be honest. The movie was probably a bit too long for my liking, especially with that ending. Overall the movie is decent, but a better ending could've made the movie great for me."

","A surprisingly entertaining film that offers enough new material to keep you engaged. IT suffers from a rather predictable script and can't seem to make up its mind on if it wants to be a comedy or a horror film. There are only a few truly scary moments, as the film follows a pretty linear pattern of events. What shines here is the cast, which offers some strong chemistry and the ability to keep you connected with the characters. The film offers many flashback moments which help tie the overall story together nicely. Overall, I thought it was an enjoyable movie and sequel. Most fans of the first chapter should walk away satisfied."

Bowers' character is completely pointless. And wtf was up with the ritual of chud?

The entire thing is decent, but forgettable.
Go watch part 1 instead. That was a lot better in every department."
"heyitskeane","6","0","1","26 November 2019"," A bit underwhelming
","Finally got around to watch It: Chapter Two and...it's okay. Alright.<br/><br/>It 2 is the sequel to It (2017) also directed by Andy Muschietti, and follows The Losers Club after 27 years of the events of It. This movie is alright, it could've been a lot better, or a lot worse, but it's okay.<br/><br/>Possibly the best aspect of the movie are the performances, especially by Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain. Honestly, the whole cast is amazing. The chemistry between them is just flawless that you really believe they were in the previous movie and now all grown up and back together. If that isn't good acting then I don't know what is. The directing by Andy Muschietti is also terrific, some shots were just like falling right into the novel (which I loved).<br/><br/>The narrative however, not so great. It felt like the movie was basically doing the exact same thing from the first except now the characters are adults. Which also means the movie is just not as scary as the first one. And that kinda sucks.<br/><br/>Another point is the runtime, which has been heavily discussed. Honestly, this movie is a bit too long. I get it they're trying to include as much as possible from the novel, which is great but when its almost 3 hours long and the narrative isn't that good, things start to get boring and dull. If they wanted to include as much from the novel as possible, they should've just made it a series, which could've been a lot better.<br/><br/>However, there is one part that I really enjoyed from the movie. That was the characters themselves. Watching them reunite as friends (after most of them left Derry) was honestly quite heartwarming. So, it's a movie about a scary children-eating clown and that's my favourite part.<br/><br/>Overall, It: Chapter Two was alright. It's not bad, but it's not great either. A shorter runtime and a more engaging narrative would made it much better."

"Willie-12","5","0","2","25 November 2019"," Second Time The First Part Was Better Than The Second Part
","They say that most people learn from their mistakes. Maybe that's true, I don't know. However, what is less true I believe, is someone learning from someone else's mistakes. No one wants to think that they're susceptible to the same potential problems as someone else. And I think that's one of the issues when it comes to It Chapter Two. Andy Muschietti (director) and Gary Dauberman (writer) had the example of It (1990), the television miniseries that was very popular, to learn from. The main problem the miniseries had was that when the makers decided to split the film into two distinct parts (instead of interweaving the kids' story with the adults' story like the book), the first part was largely considered better than the the second part. In other words, the kids' part of the story (as well as the child actors' performances) were better and more interesting than the part of the story with the adults. Well guess what? Muschietti and Dauberman, knowing this, decided to go the same route, and split the part of the story with the children up from the part of the story with the adults. And the results were pretty much the same. Most people consider It (2017) to be much better than It Chapter Two (2019). Including me. IC2 is a number of things. Unfortunately none of them are positive. It is too long. It is too convoluted. And, quite simply, it is no where near as good as the first chapter. I had a feeling that this was going to be the case. Even when one of the story lines for a certain adult gets shortened before the rest of the adults get together, it's not enough to lighten the load with too many characters. And the problem is, the makers of the film obviously felt as if each character had to have equal screen time with equal scary events happening to each one. And going through those stories one by one, in that manner, takes away any kind of surprise that may have otherwise existed. And when there aren't any real surprises in a movie that's supposed to be scary...well let's just say that tends to neutralize the frightening parts of the film. In other words, it's poison. How disappointing. Perhaps, if anyone ever decides to adapt this story again into a film (honestly I, and a host of others really hope that never happens) they will try and tell the two parts of the story the same way Stephen King tells the story in the novel...simultaneously."

","This was always arranged as a two movies saga. So this is the end of It, and it doesn't live to the expectations.<br/><br/>Allow me to explain myself.<br/><br/>The first movie was the perfect dark comedy and you might believe that may be it wasn't risky enough because the cast was full of kids and they were all destined to survive for the sequel. So they make a good choice focusing more on the comedy on the first movie and then the sequel will be more dark and scary.<br/><br/>You were incorrect. This movie isn't scary again. It's a horror dark dramedy and is monotonous as you don't have any idea.<br/><br/>The first act of the movie is all of the characters being invited to come back to the town where everything happens on the first movie, so you have to observe their reactions to the invitation. I wouldn't consider this as a spoiler because it's something that everybody recognizes is going to happen. Over here are the spoilers of the format<br/><br/>THE SPOILER BEGINS - The second act is they collecting the things they need to defeat Pennywise but everybody has to go alone in their quest. The format is: First they go to one place, then they will have a memory of when they were kids that explains why that object is so meaningful for them. When they get the object, they probably will see pennywise and all their fears seem to be coming true. - THE END OF THE SPOILER.<br/><br/>The second act is so repetitive and slow that causes you feel like this movie could last just two hours without the filler. The ending is pretty satisfactory, they are deaths that will make you cry and the message is excellent for the movie. It's another pleasant dark comedy but it's just too long."

As we all know most of Stephen King's stories take place in Derry main and some other of Stephen king novel inspired movies gave us a hint of pennywise being alive. Like in the novel it was narrated that Bill was breaking all of Pennywise's eggs and it was pretty dark in the cave so he was not sure if he had crushed all of them or not.Just would like to say that it's a good movie but could've been better .

The CGI done of the younger versions of the main cast threw me off and ruined my immersion of the film and I went in hoping it not be predictable. I was hoping the writer and director would want to shake up some of the story, including the ending, to give audiences an entertaining and original experience. What we got was a rated R version of the 1990 miniseries. I did not leave the theater hating the film and found my initial experience enjoyable.

","Yeah.. Were to start with this one.<br/><br/>Well it's definitely a missed opportunity. It has none of the charm or character of the first movie. The Losers club are a far more likeable and believable bunch of characters in chapter 1 than what we're offered in this effort.<br/><br/>Half of the intended to be scary moments are just plain ridiculous. I know horror is in it's nature far fetched but the scene with the Paul Bunyan statue is just plain stupid. I would expect scenes like this from a movie like scary stories to tell in the dark (a far superior horror film btw!) which is geared toward younger audiences, not grown adults.<br/><br/>There's not enough Pennywise and way too much drama over the Losers club. I found the whole love triangle between Bill, Beverly and Ben in chapter one endearing, in this however it's just a boring unneeded distraction from the main story, mainly I think because I couldn't give a hoot about the characters. Especially the new buff Ben, who of course poor emotionally unstable Beverly would fall for now he's all ripped. That for me portrayed her character in quite a poor light tbh, shallow Bev very shallow. Does that class a spoiler? Maybe! But to be fair it would be hard to spoil the film anymore than they already have.<br/><br/>The final act is again just stupid. unimaginative and insulting to Bill Skarsgard's tremendous character that he built in Pennywise.<br/><br/>Overall this is a true testament to the acting power of children over adults with the only refreshing, truly enjoyable moments is when they are back on screen for short periods of time during this movie. Chapter one is a far far superior effort to this for many reasons. It truly is a missed opportunity to create a fantastic up to date 2 part adaptation of one of Stephen Kings finest works!"

"kluseba","6","0","2","30 October 2019"," It wasn't necessary
","It: Chapter Two tells the story of what happened to the members of The Losers' Club as they confront evil clown Pennywise to kill it for good twenty-seven years after the events of the first movie. In my humble opinion, this second movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. The first part had an intriguing atmosphere, stunning characters and diversified plot that ended on a bittersweet note. Some stories don't need a conclusion as some unanswered question might actually spark the audience's creative imagination. In order to cash in on the first film, the producers decided to opt for a sequel nonetheless.<br/><br/>The main issue is that this sequel doesn't have the magic of the first movie. The coming-of-age vibe of the teenagers with their beliefs, bonds, fears, hopes and motivations was second to none. What we get here are seven rather depressing adults in their mid-life crises who haven't become the wonderful people they could have been.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the movie constantly dwells on the past, has a ploddingly repetitive script and re-tells parts of the first film over and over again. There are numerous horror movies with considerable lengths that never get boring with classics like The Shining or recent masterpieces such as The Wailing. However, this film here overstays its welcome with lengthy storytelling, tiring flashbacks and endless dialogues. This movie should have been about one hour shorter than it actually is for a more dynamic, entertaining and relevant structure.<br/><br/>Not everything is bad about this movie as you might have guessed by looking at my rather positive rating. The special effects are as great as they can get. The smalltown settings are perfectly chosen. The light techniques and camera work are precise, captivating and atmopsheric. The film includes a good balance of humorous and serious parts. The adult actresses and actors are doing a wonderful job and one has to point out a charming but melancholic Jessica Chastain in particular as well as James McAvoy who underlines his reputation as one of the most diversified, talented and unique contemporary actors as usual.<br/><br/>The movie's saving grace however are the gripping final thirty minutes. The duel between The Loser's Club and Pennywise is fascinating to watch and feels like a reward after a stuttering start. The action scenes are intense, the characters develop depth and the special effects are spectacular. Make sure to enjoy such cinematography on the big screen while you still can.<br/><br/>In the end, It: Chapter Two is quite a mixed bag. The film is technically well done but simply overstays its welcome. Personally, I didn't need a sequel at all but can objectively admit that this film has slightly more strengths than flaws."
"marc5477","3","0","1","30 October 2019"," A repeat of the originals
","Chapter 2 stinks. Simply because it was the same as Chapter 1 but with adults. The big distinction is they want you to believe that the adults are just children. Well guess what? I wasn't convinced because they were indeed adults.<br/><br/>I was amazed at how unintelligible the characters are. You are adults... you are facing some sort of demon and you get to plan your actions. Wouldn't you think that arming yourself with gear and weapons would be wise? Gee... Also who the heck would be afraid of that clown as an adult? Maybe a few scaredy cats might be but I want to believe that most adults would treat the clown like a threat that needs to be fought. The entire premise of course would fall apart if the characters were not scared which is the flaw from the start. This plot really only works with children or creatures much more frightening than clowny.<br/><br/>So anyway, it was a slog to develop the story and a chore to watch if unfold. The story should have been rewritten with some sort of twist or at least more comedy. Overall, not a good film."
"kingmasada","9","0","1","29 October 2019"," Nostalgia riddled primal fear
","Ever since I found the story of It, I've been drawn to its story and concept. It features stuff from your worst nightmares, a scary clown, creepy crawlers, hideous monsters. And yet, it is not the stuff on the surface that scares you most, it is the absolute manifestation of your emotional fears. Crap that you have buried under layer upon layer of mental walls, making it disappear from your mind and thoughts. Until it is uncovered again.<br/><br/>This film embodies this. Takes a shovel and digs its way into your fears. This is what happens when you let a director loose who wants to do the source material justice. Not only for the fans, but because it is such a clear representation of what deep, emotional fear can be like. And when the shovel stops working, it takes a pickaxe. Then a drill. Then dynamite.<br/><br/>SkarsÃ¥rd has been compared to Heath Ledger wearing his role. And they're not wrong, the comparison is spot on. He lives and breathes Pennywise. If not for that brilliant casting, the movie would have falled flat for sure. And it's not only the clown that's been handed to capable hands, the rest of the losers are all one by one perfect in their adult rules. This is beautiful film making in a genre that has gone mostly unnoticed by talent. It's a great movie to end this decade of excellent horror movies.<br/><br/>It's not only scary, it's sweet too. Banding together with your friends to beat the demons of your past, together.

"harrymartin-54768","7","0","1","16 October 2019"," Pennywise Is Back!
","After around 27 years the losers club is called back to derry after hearing from Mike that the demon known as pennywise has come back. In the first film they made an oath to come back to derry to kill pennywise once and for all.
In this movie pennywise is creepier than ever making for some truly scary scenes. Also the acting from all the actors is top notch especially Bill Hader as Richie. In his performance I found myself emotionally invested in his character.
Overall I think this movie is very good but it does just fail to land with the ending. The ending was emotional and that side was very good but the pennywise part was found very different for an ending although I definatelt preferred this over the It miniseries."
"tatbtsisb","6","0","2","16 October 2019"," An okay horror flick.
","A sequel to the first and amazing movie, It Chapter 2 has its pros and cons. The best part about this movie for me would be the cast. Every single member of this cast had chemistry and you actually feel like they've known each other since they were children. It genuinely feels like they are childhood friends catching up. Bill Skarsgard also did an amazing potrayal of Pennywise. But I feel like that's the only good bit about the movie. The story was abit stretched and boring. The jokes were not too bad but some parts the lines were really cringy. Only a few scenes in this movie made me get goosebumps. The rest were just abit long and stretched. I wished they used less jumpscares because the overall tone of the movie was already creepy enough. Especially with Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, he is absolutely terrifying. In conclusion, this is an okay horror movie that has an amazing cast but is abit long and stretched. I also wished they used less jumpscares and depend on more creepy elements to make the movie scary. I'm gonna give this one a 6/10."

"amybourque","7","0","1","15 October 2019"," Another messed up Stephen King movie
","The movie starts off good. As a survivor of domestic violence I cringed during Beverly's opening. But once the monsters came out it was just a farce. The monster under the bed was scary at first. Then when it pulls up in a car and fourth walls the camera it looses all. The old woman was terrifying. When she passed the door I was shaking wondering what was about to happen. What came out of the door was so fake looking I actually considered leaving.
The ending of IT was horrible and not frightening at all. A babydoll clown. Ugh. The lepper was obviously fake and just gross, not scary at all.
The Logger scene was scary. The people in the background was freaky. The clown makeup scene was scary. The jump scenes were overdone. It was a good scare while in the theater but there was no take you home scare. It didn't last past the credits.
The movie was funny. I loved Stephens cameo.
But it was drawn out. The water scene was disappointing because it was going on and on so it made you think something scary was going to happen. The walking through town and seeing their younger selves was an ending. The water scene was an ending. The letter scene was an ending. Three endings is overkill.
I just need to say, Talisman is in production and it's my favorite Stephen King book. If they mess that move up, I will never read anything else or watch any of his movies again."

Oh, scary scene, I should act scared. Oh, fighting scene, I should be brave. Oh, sad scene, I should cry.<br/><br/>It's cheesy, it's long, the jumps scares don't work at all... and yet, I gave it a pretty high score.<br/><br/>It's because I consider it an adventure movie that tries to amaze you with new CGI. Almost like a video game. I know I'm doing the movie a disservice but if I review it as a horror movie where character development is important, I'll probably give it a one.<br/><br/>It feels pretty epic, even though I rolled my eyes a couple of times.<br/><br/>So yeah, go watch it if you're bored."

And it just wasn't quite as scary. They being said the acting is again all top notch Hader and Skarsgard in particular shine. I'm reviewing as someone who has only watched the movies not the read the books so I'm sure people might be thinking but the things you were complaining about were in the books and that might be but I'm looking at purely the movie and to me the things above didn't fit."
"karmazyn","8","0","2","10 October 2019"," Great finale to one of the greatest horror novels of all time !
","IT Chapter 2 captures the spirit of the book rather well and for most of it I felt really happy with the direction production team took. Certain important aspects of the book have not been explored or just briefly touched upon but overall I did enjoy it. I liked it much more than first movie, it is not that I disliked the first movie but I did not find it particularly scary, the setting and production values were top notch. Second movie is such as improvement over the first part. From the first moment you can see that they had bigger budget to play with.<br/><br/>So the story continues when kids start disappearing fom Derry again, there are more murders, killer Clown is back, after many years of hibernation he got his strengths back. He is ready to take revenge on Losers Club who once almost killed It. You do not mess with devour of the worlds and think that there will not be consequences. The oath once took will have to be honored.<br/><br/>Mike who stayed in Derry to research this extraordinary town was first to realize what is going on. He was not under the spell of the evil so as a guardian of the oath, called all the members of the Losers club. As we remember from the book some took it worse than others but this oath cannot be broken and the Losers clubs is once more reunited to face ancient evil.<br/><br/>Speaking about the cast I was not initially entirely sure about cast of the movie, Bill in particular. His character as far as I can remember was bold in the book also role of his wife was far more important. Some other side characters important to the book were not properly fleshed out in this adaption. I understand it though, director wanted to focus on different aspects of the book. I can say that I was wrong and my original feeling about the cast was completely unjustified. All of the adult actors did a really good job, Bill's appearance aside, McAwoy felt the role and gave a good performance. He did not feel like a leader to me, he felt kinda lost but in the end he pulled it off in the end. He is a good actor. We also got to see Henry Bower once again. His part within the movie is fairly accurate to the source material. Really impressive job.<br/><br/>I was also really happy to see Mr King in the movie, he acted really well, fit bizarre town just perfect.<br/><br/>
Special effects, music, production values were really good. The clown was scary as always and there were few scenes which really superbly gave evil and vicious character of the clown. Bill Skarsgard really pulled it out, yet again he showed that he fully understands what is it to be demonic-killing machine. The way he moved, delivered his lines, it was very good acting.<br/><br/>Bill Hader was funny as Richie, there was genuine chemistry between him and the rest of the cast. Jen Ryan playing Ben was just as I imagined this character to be. Successful, reserved but still kind and well just awesome. He is back and this time he will conquer Jessica Chastein's heart. Eddie is played by James Ransone. He does really look like adult version of his younger self. Younger cast once again shines on the screen.<br/><br/>Although it is really hard to recommend this movie to anyone who has not read the book as quite simply they will feel lost and confused I could easily recommend this movie, it is a good adaptation and a very effective finale to one of the greatest Stephen King's classics."

The cast is extremely successful and I can give full marks to the film about the actor. What I found missing was that some scenes were too long. It's a little bad for them to postpone what they have to do and engage in other events. Since the film was R-Rated, the blood was used very successfully. Bill Skarsgård's wonderful Pennywise performance adds a distinct taste to the film. The player elections were also very successful. I can say exactly the same. Dialogues are very well written by place. The first film is better, but it's nothing less than that. It was a nice sequel. In short, it was a film that could be enjoyed. I can assure you that you will get a better experience if you watch the first movie without forgetting.<br/><br/>⭐ 100/70"

I saw many people complaining about this. I think it was ok; I'm not fond of jumpscares, but there were many, many scary sequences (and all of them lead to a jumpscare, so that's a 50-50 score).

As for the story, I thought that the ending when the house fell down was a bit anticlimactic but to be fair in the book, the entire town collapsed, and I don't think they could have done that in theaters.

"gsolis-54533","10","0","3","3 October 2019"," Is IT Really That Scary?
","The killer clown is back?!? Yes, IT is! As soon as I heard that a second movie of IT was going to come out I was extremely excited. The first movie, IT, was a great movie; it was full of horror, thrilling scenes, and a slight bit of action. When I first saw the trailer for IT Chapter 2, I was amazed at how much more action there was going to be this time around. I'm an action and horror movie fan, so what's better than having both genres in one movie?! Ever since a young age, I have always had a passion for horror movies. There were times where I was scared but I was always curious to watch was going to happen. Since then I always try my best to watch every horror movie that is released. If a movie isn't entertaining since the beginning, then I instantly stop watching it.
Anyway, I will be reviewing IT Chapter 2 since it is the most recent horror movie that I have watched. Since my little brother is still 13, I asked him if he wanted to go watch IT Chapter 2 with me, he said yes because he also loved the first movie. CAUTION: IT Chapter 2 is a Rated R movie so if you have siblings or family members who are under the age of 17, then I strongly recommend to be accompanied by an adult who is over 21 (e.g. A parent, uncle, aunt, guardian, etc.).
Several days ago, we decided to go to the Classic Cinemas North Riverside Luxury 6 Theatre at North Riverside Park Mall, and watch IT Chapter 2. However, the tickets had already been sold out, due to the great demand of this movie. We were pretty disappointed at first, but we were determined to go watch it. Therefore, two days later we went to the ShowPlace ICON Theatres at the Roosevelt Collection with ICON X, where we were finally able to watch it. We bought a small bag of popcorn, a small pizza, and two ICEEs. We were the happiest siblings alive. When we arrived at the theatre, there were like four other customers. At first I thought, is this movie really that scary? Or is this a joke? We watched several ads because we were 15 minutes early, but when the movie finally started, we were ready to watch what this movie was all about. The beginning was a bit frightening but as the movie went on, my brother and I realized it hadn't been what we thought it was about.
In order to give you an idea about what IT Chapter 2 is about, let me refresh your memory on what happened in the first movie, IT (released in 2017). The movie takes place in Derry, Maine in October 1988. It starts off with two brothers, Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) and his little brother, Georgie Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott) making a paper boat. Georgie goes outside on a gloomy day and sails his new paper boat. Unfortunately, the boat goes down a sewer. As he gets closer to the sewer, he begins to see two bright intimidating yellow eyes. All of a sudden, the murderer, Pennywise the dancing clown (Bill Skarsgard) pops up, and after a quick conversation he bites Georgie's arm off in the most violent and grotesque manner and then drags him down with him. Bill and his friend Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard), Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer), and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff), who all form The Losers Club, decide to kill Pennywise since they now know he was responsible for Georgie's murder. One day, when Bill gets home, his father Zach (Geoffrey Pounsett) yells at him for designing a model with tubes of the sewer system in Derry, Maine because he still believes that Georgie, his brother, is only missing. Zach tells him to stop thinking about other outcomes because Georgie is dead, but Bill keeps trying until him and his friends finally defeat Pennywise.
SPOILER ALERT! At the end of IT, we see that Pennywise was killed by Bill and his friends aka. The Loser Club, but was he really killed? The answer is NO! Pennywise the dancing clown was not killed which is why there is now an IT Chapter 2 movie. The movie starts off with a gay couple being harassed by a homophobic group of teenagers. One of the teenagers pushes one of the men off of a bridge, landing straight into a lake. All of a sudden the man is pulled out by Pennywise and he is his first victim! The Losers Club is reunited at a restaurant and Pennywise leaves them several clues letting them know that he is still alive.
The movie starts off 27 years later since the Loser Club killed Pennywise, and they are reunited once again when Mike calls the rest of the club because innocent adults and children have been disappearing again. After experiencing the traumatic events from their past, they have to face their fears and defeat the deadly clown, who keeps traumatizing them and has become more powerful than ever.
For the most part, the movie was great. I honestly loved it! I loved the story line, and how well the actors and actresses acted it out. Even though I don't like comedy as much, there were still some scenes that were pretty funny, and I couldn't do anything but laugh. My little brother as serious as can be, also laughed. So if you're looking for a horror/thriller movie with a slight taste of comedy, then this is the movie for you!"

","I just watched IT1 (and reviewed with a 8/10) a couple of days ago to have the direct comparison now with chapter two. What I loved in particular on the 2nd part was the very dark atmosphere and some rather uncomfortable moments. Whereas IT1 felt partly as a movie made for teenagers IT2 was in every sense more grown up.
The opening sequence felt very raw and made the audience immediately clear what to expect in the upcoming 2,5 hrs (which btw was an appropriate time to tell the story in detail). Overall the flow and tension was nicely built with some amazing scenes (I will blow it away...1...2... you know which scene im referring back to!) also the labyrinth scene stood out so well as it was not only frightening but also showed the emotional aspect of the cast.
An aspects I didn't like at all (similar to the 1st part) have been the unnecessary use of jokes in the worst situations.
This said, pennywise, king, the cast delivered and created a strong movie experience with all the components a classic horror tale needs."

"RhapsodyReviews","8","0","1","26 September 2019"," Great Sequel.
","Review:
'It: Chapter Two' is an American supernatural-horror film directed by Andy Muschietti. It is a sequel to the 2017 film 'It', both based on the 1986 novel by Stephen King. Going into this movie I was the most excited I have been to see a film in a long time. But I can honestly say I was nervous too. I wasn't nervous that the movie was going to suck, I knew Andy Muschietti could pull off a great film with the material he had available to him. I love the first 'IT' and his earlier work with 'Mama' was fantastic. He knows what needs to be done when constructing a good horror movie. I was nervous for two reasons. One being the fact that I enjoyed the first movie so much that I didn't want this movie to fall short like a lot of other sequels do. The other reason is the ending, because I was never a fan of the ending of 'IT', whether that be in the novel or the 1990 adaptation. I will discuss my feelings about the ending of this one later in this review.
Set in 2016, 27 years after the first film, the story follows the remaining members of the Losers Club reuniting in order to defeat the eponymous being who has returned to terrorize the town of Derry, Maine.
I'm going to talk a bit about the casting decision in this movie before I get to actual acting! This is some of the best casting choices I have ever seen in film. Not one actor felt out of place, everybody looked, acted and overall embodied the kids that they were supposed to be playing. We all knew that Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy were going to crush this movie, they're amazing in everything. Everybody else did a wonderful job, and not once in this movie was I taken out of a scene because something lacked or felt off with the acting. But, I need to discuss how brilliant this one person was in this move because he was the standout for me by miles and that person is Bill Hader. I did not expect to come out of this movie saying Bill Hader was the standout, but my god he was good. He plays the adult version of Ritchie and it's brilliant. He is so funny is this movie (of course), but he was so quickly able to play different emotions when he needed to whether it be anger, sadness, happiness or whatever, his character felt it all and he played it so well!
It's hard writing a review for this movie (especially spoiler free), because I loved it so much that I just want to talk about it for hours. Sure, it has some problems, but I personally feel that a lot of the problems in this movie are forgivable. It has some pacing issues at times but being nearly 3 hours long one could expect that. It had so much story to tell you can't expect it to be balls to wall every minute. You know if it was and they shortened the movie people would than complain that it's nothing like the book. The movie is not as scary as it's predecessor, but I think that was purposeful being that the first one was kids being terrorised by this evil clown. In this one it's more of a revenge tale on Pennywise. Going back to Bill Hader being super funny, another actor who was amazingly funny was James Ransone - who plays the adult version of Eddie Kaspbrak. These two played off of each other a lot throughout the movie and I can honestly say I have not laughed so much, or so hard in another movie this year. They didn't over do the comedy though, at times where you think maybe this shouldn't have a joke in it you remember this is Ritchie, I wouldn't believe the scene if there wasn't a crack about something.
A movie's ending is everything. A bad ending can ruin a good movie, a good ending can save a bad movie. With the ending to this movie I left feeling okay. I didn't love it, but it was a lot better than what it could have been. I'm not going to talk about it other than that because I will get into spoiler territory. If you're a fan of the book it could honestly go either way with liking it or not.
Overall, as a super fan of Andy Muschietti and Stephen King I would gladly rate this movie 5 stars, but I do understand some flaws with it. If you liked the first one you will have a great time here, maybe even a slightly better time dare I say. I loved it and can not wait to see it again.

","As a big fan of the book, i thought this was the perfect sequel to the 2017 film. the casting was spot on for every character and of course Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd's performance was brilliant. i feel like Muschietti really made this film for the fans who already adore the characters and the whole story of IT and Derry, therefore its hard for any big fan to not instantly fall in love with this film. it brought so much more than just a scary clown in a horror film, it's comedic, devastating, romantic and a true story of friendship with the most heartwarming, emotional ending dialogue which was a beautiful way to end both the film and the story overall. personally i couldn't have asked for a better film to complete the story of the losers club."

"wackywhovian11","6","0","1","23 September 2019"," Not True To The Book
","Well I finally got to see IT chapter two after 3 weeks of finishing up that very very VERY long book Stephen King who I love but seriously why does he have to write such long ass books. But anyway I finished it last week so I saw the film on Friday (September 20th) and I'll start this review off with it's NOT like the book at all. Okay that's not true, some of it is of course BUT they changed ALOT of the book to fit the movie which I understand but after you spent weeks reading the book you want to see what you've read? Does that makes sense?
Anyway if you are knew to the world of IT and didn't see the first film shame on you because it's a great film. IT Chapter One is basically about these kids who classify themselves the Losers Club are haunted by the evil clown Pennywise who can change his appearance into anything that frighten you to feed off your fear. Okay so kids band together to take down Pennywise at the end of the first film by making a pact that if it's not dead they'll come back to finish the job.
Alright so you're caught up on the first film so now on with Chapter Two where it's 27 years later (which I guess IT has to wait to gain his strength to attack again after what happened in the first film?) I didn't understand that part in the book/movie so I'm just guessing that's why Pennywise had to wait so long to attack the adult kids from the first film. Anyway Mike calls everyone back for a reunion of sorts to try to band together again to fight Pennywise again and finally kill it for good. Their is a member of the group that isn't with them and I won't spoil it because it's a key factor to the story. Anyway the film takes a lot of liberates from the book to the film like I said which I understand because you can't fit a long ass book like that into a 2 hour and 50 minute film <== yep you read that right nearly a 3 hour film so be prepared for a long film. Bill is still dealing with the death of Georgie from the first film. Ben of course is still in love with Beverly and too scared to tell her even after all these years. Eddie is still OCD over every little thing from germs to sickness. Richie is a stand up comedian which is understandable because he was always the funny one. Bev is a fashion designer and Mike take care of the library in Derry, Maine. Okay good now we have our characters set up, let's get to why I didn't really like this film. Okay that's really not true I liked the flashback scenes of the kids from the first film and that was basically it. The adult version of the kids I didn't care for because to me they were a dry in their performance but the kids scenes were fresh because it took me back to when I watch the first IT film and loved it. I wish they had jus stuck with the kids more and not waited 27 years for them to be adults to kill Pennywise because it would have been more entertaining (for me). I won't spoil the film climax scene of the fight with Pennywise because if you've read the book it's WAY different (trust me) but I'll just say I didn't care for it. I felt Pennywise powers 27 years later were a bit lacking in his goal to get to the adults who hurt him which made no sense. If you've been lying in wait for 27 years ago don't you think that's a pretty good nap to regain your powers to take out a bunch of kids who are now adults?
The things I did enjoy about IT Chapter Two were like I said the kids from the first film scenes were great. The Paul Bunyan part with the adult Richie was awesome. The Fortune cookie scene was creative. The part with Bev and the old lady in her old apartment was not scary but funny as hell.
Would I suggest this film for y'all to see? Hmm well if you've seen the first film then I mean why wouldn't you see the second part that's just silly. That's like reading first part of a book and then saying nope I'm good I don't want to know the end. So yes I would suggest it but wait for Redbox or on demand which I wish I had done that OR watched Downton Abby BUT like I said I finished that really LONG book and I wanted to see the conclusion of the film. Would I buy this film on Blu-ray? Well of course, because I have the other film and the also the mini-series and I'm sure they'll be extra scenes that we didn't get to see in theaters that I'll be interested in viewing BUT I won't rush out and get it the day it comes out I'll wait until it's on sale."

The musical score is a joke. The editing is terrible, the movie drags and drags and is so slow and boring. The CGI is terrible, the creatures looked Corny, cheap and there was way.... too much CGI. I very very much hated the opening scene, it's extremely bigoted and hateful. There was absolutely NO rhyme or reason for that opening scene. Finally... I hate how much the loser kids are in Chapter 2. The losers had all of Chapter 1 devoted to them, Chapter 2 should've been all about the adults. It Chapter 1 is terrifying and suspenseful, it looks fantastic, the music is scary and the pacing is perfect. It Chapter 2 is slow and boring, clunky, corny, cheap looking, and way too long. It Chapter 2 almost feels like it was directed by a different less experienced tv show director. Before going to the cinema to watch the movie, I pre-ordered It Chapter 2 on VUDU because that's how much I was looking forward to this movie.
I just cancelled that pre-order."

"gramsden-21958","9","0","2","20 September 2019"," What do you know?
","This film will divide viewer's opinion based on one simple factor. Have you read the book or not? if, like me, you have read the book there is so much in this film that will delight and satisfy those who know the story well. The film cleverly uses many small and subtle scenes and visual/verbal hints at things that are in the book that don't appear in the 'other' version, but nevertheless tell the informed viewer that they know what they are doing. If you haven't read the book then you will miss more than you will see. it seems clear that those who decry this film as being too long don't get the fact that it is long but indeed not long enough to tell the full story. if your patience is run thin with this film for goodness sake don't read the book you simply don't have the cognitive stamina for a good and thorough story well told. I agree with a previous comment this is perhaps about 40% of the book. please do us all a favour read the book before you comment on what is wrong with the film. I agree that CGI can sometimes let the film down but given the tools available there are few choices to be made to recreate the sheer imaginative horror of Stephen King. if you think that CGI is poor just think back to that frigid spider of the 1991 series. This is as good as we wiil get today. Huge applause to Andy M and the team. Good job."

I liked what they did with the story it was well-adapted, well written, and shot beautifully. Every cast member brought a great element to the story as well as they all worked off of each other masterfully. Both Adult and kid versions of the characters did magnificent jobs portraying their respective characters. I do recommend Stephen King and overall horror fans to go see this movie or wait for it to come out on video if you prefer not sitting in the theater that long because it is worth watching. I especially thought each Pennywise scene amped in thrills in comparison to the first chapter. So my advice to those who want to see this sequel is make it through the beginning and you'll be surely satisfied."

"chelseatayla","6","0","1","18 September 2019"," It was alright...
","Pros:<br/><br/>-Loved the opening scene, the homophobic threat of real people combined with the supernatural threat of Pennywise was really effective.<br/><br/>-The adult cast were well selected, resembled their child counterparts and were (for the most part) believable as the grown versions of their characters.<br/><br/>-Bill Skarsgard did a magnificent job as Pennywise, (duh)<br/><br/>-Liked the added information of Pennywise's/It's origins.<br/><br/>Cons:
-This movie is not only looooong but you can feel it. It tended to drag, to the point I found myself bored in certain parts. Particularly when the group split up and did their own thing in the middle. I found myself most entertained when the characters were actually interacting, particularly with Ritchie and Eddie.<br/><br/>-There were lots of jokes that fell flat and broke up the tension. A few were well timed and gave me a giggle, but more often than not they weren't effective.<br/><br/>-It's true form was a bit disappointing (a clown head on a spider body?), at least with the mini series they committed to the alien arachnid creature.<br/><br/>-Lots of jump scares, yet not a scary movie. I think it failed to create the tension that the first movie and even the mini series managed to achieve.<br/><br/>-Henry Bowers, completely wasted. Might aswell not have been included. Again, could have used the character to create more tension, instead didn't really achieve anything.<br/><br/>-Probably a very unpopular opinion, but I found Jessice Chastain and James McAvoy a little dull (and I actually believe they're magnificent actors), maybe it was just the way they portrayed the characters or the characters themselves, but I actually found these two the least believable out of all of the Losers.<br/><br/>-Not much growth or character development, to the point I almost didn't care about the Losers fate in the end. (other than Ritchie and Eddie who were the most believable and I think really stole their scenes with the others).<br/><br/>As a whole, it wasn't a bad movie, but wasn't anything to brag about it. I found myself bored in parts, entertained by others, a bit fatigued by the end of it. I've heard rumours of a Pennywise origin story movie with Bill Skarsgard returning, which I think has the potential to be fantastic."

I thought the whole friendship thing was melodramatic and corny in both films. The main reason to watch is to have a laugh and a scare.<br/><br/>Bill Hader was an excellent casting choice. He brings the comic relief that hits 90+% of the time. It satisfies the curiosity of the casual viewer (with no previous knowledge of the material) by revealing that It was actually an alien that feeds on fear and children (apparently both seem important). Though, too little detailed info is given for a sci fi designation. Apparently the history only goes back to the 1800s, but the alien has been there millions of years? I liked It & It 2, not for a cerebral plot or cheesy bonding between friends. I liked It for the clown, which is of course the best part. He's creepy, he's mesmerizing, and also somehow hilarious. Thankfully, I've never understood the fear of clowns (or clowns at all really), so there's no nightmares from this. But, it's not really that kind of scary movie. My favorite part, personally was the old lady scurrying naked in the hallway, and it demonstrates what's morbidly entertaining about these films. They're funny and scary at the same time.

","I enjoyed It chapter 1, for what it was, a fun, jumpy monster movie.<br/><br/>It Chapter 2 was disapointing not because of bad acting, or for budget reasons, but rather for a director and editor who did not understand pacing. Either that or they had spent the money and were told by higher ups that they ""had to show it"".<br/><br/>This is all made worse because the first act was fantastic, my expectations were met, all the characters were well introduced, and the lead actors were on top of their game, everyone seemed up for it.<br/><br/>The problems begin when the gigantic fetch quest that was act 2 reared it's ugly head. Our film crew seems to be a fan of video games. They should have known that spending at least an hour fetching trinkets was fun to play, but not for a general audience to watch. During the many, mnay actions scenes, you *know* that the main characters were not in any danger. Rendering the whole experience dull, and plodding bore.<br/><br/>It's not all bad, the last battle was fun, and the closing lines were actually quite touching, but getting to the end was a nightmare (not the kind the makers had in mnd), I just could'nt wait to leave the cinema. I'll have to download a copy and edit out a good 40-50 minutes so that I can have a watchable version of this movie to finish off the enjoyable first chapter.

Also, I still haven't seen the first ""It"" movie, so I went in hoping that everything previous of which I was not aware would be self-explanatory! Largely, through flashbacks, it was! I learned that this film was directed by Andy Muschitta, who had previously directed Ms. Chastain in a very good horror film called ""Mama"", so I felt confident that I was in for a good cinematic experience! For about the first hour and a half, I was: the story was involving, and the film was quite well-made up to this point! Unfortunately, it went on for what seemed like the most interminable additional hour in the history of time! Attempts to make what should've stayed a small, tightly-woven tale into a forever escalatingly epic scarefest greatly diminished the effectiveness of the story! There were enough good performances and good moments to recommend the story to any horror fan, but, Mother of God, if ever there was a movie in dire need of editing, it would be ""It Chapter Two""! And that's a real shame! In trying too hard to wow its audience, the film instead ultimately burns a lot of the creative good will generated by its infinitely better first half!"

Good actors wasted in this movie."
"joseandresbriceno","10","0","1","15 September 2019"," Very solid adaption
","Ok so, a lot of people need to understand that IT is a NOVEL, a very complex novel with various themes; it's more than just a horror story about a monster that chases and eats children. It's about the feeling about misfit, friendship, loss of childhood innocence, loss of sexual innocence, childhood trauma that stays with us, IT is a superb story of the journey from childhood, through puberty and into adulthood.
They did a very incredible and solid adaption of the novel between both parts. It does have a lot of strong scenes which represent the true feeling of the book.
If you liked the first part you will probably enjoy this one as well. As a Stephen King and IT fan, I was not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>ps: don't even bother in reading those bad reviews where people trash the movie because it's ""not scary"", that's like the dumbest argument ever."

","I've been deciding whether the film was a 7 or a 6 and for now it's a 6. The positives outweigh the negatives, the sort of criticism that came from when the film was first released perhaps has influenced my judgement when I saw the film and I agree with a lot of the points.<br/><br/>IT Chapter 2 is decent, it's funny, it attempts to have heart (which for some reason I just don't feel like it delivered on and it came across quite cheesy).<br/><br/>Andy Muschietti clearly has a love for the source material and creates a sequel that benefits solely from it's strong cast. Some scenes seem overly directed and crammed with stylistic decisions that don't further narrative.<br/><br/>The script seems a little muddled, there are some utterly brutal sequences, some incredibly funny sequences and some cheesy moments. It's sort of all over the place, whereas the first film had a strong foundation of a coming of age horror film.<br/><br/>The cast as I said is incredibly strong, Chastain,McAvoy, Mustafa, Ryan and Ransone are all great with of course the stand out being Hader, although personally I believe the child actors Martell, Oleff, Wolfhard, Lillis, Jacobs and Taylor were somewhat better with my favourite being Jack Dylan Grazer.<br/><br/>Bill Skarsgard is great when he's not being screwed with special effects. Should've left him alone and let him perform without any unnecessary CGI.<br/><br/>The special effects were a little iffy, I think the deaging (and refatting of Ray Taylor) were jarring whilst other visual effects were just silly and didn't have the effect I believe they intended. Looking at you severed Stanley head.<br/><br/>The cinematography was decent whilst there were some odd editing cuts with some reaction shots but this was forgivable.<br/><br/>The score should be commended. King's cameo was a bit cringey which I think can be said with the ending, it all feels a little bit wet and cringey.<br/><br/>The runtime didn't feel as long as I thought it was although the ending dragged on. The scares were few, this is down to the silly effects and the reliance on CGI.<br/><br/>Overall this is a decent perhaps forgettable sequel that I think suffers from the glory of it's predecessor, Muschietti, his crew and cast should be applauded for their commitment in telling this story which I believe does the novel justice if not losing some cinematic flair in the process."
"verrucktcarlos","7","0","1","15 September 2019"," IT may need to be re edited.
","I actually really enjoyed this film. Cinematography was great, effects were great, overall it is a really well done film. Even if you think the movie sucked I don't think you can give this a rating like ''1'' when technically it is so well made. Anyway. What I didn't like were the jumpscares, WAY TOO MANY, seriously way too many. Too many times where the music slowly builds up, then stops, complete silence and then BOOM, scary stuff with loud noise. I don't think a story like this needs these many jumpscares, I don't think it needs them at all, the premise itself is scary, it's kinda like the exorcist, 0 jumpscares in that film, and it is one of the most terrifying movies ever made, because the story is pure nightmare fuel. I think the original 1990 movie is scarier, it has a very eerie and unsettling atmosphere, unlike this one. The part with Beverly and the old woman is equally good in both movies until that huge monster shows up, with a jumpscare of course. That scene is a great example I think on why the original is scarier. Also the infamous ''Dont you want it'' scene, which I was hoping to see in the new one. That scene is extremely creepy and unsettling. Overall I think the movie is great, it could have been excellent if it was re edited, seriously get rid of the jumpscares, some of the jokes, some of the CGI and some of the same boring ''movie'' music, seriously the original one has such a disctintive soundtrack, this one is just so average."

Hader's was cursory but his fight was in the present day. The other two already had theirs and the fight was in flashbacks that had nothing to do with obtaining anything.<br/><br/>Seemed to veer away from the rules they set up in favor of more visuals and the fight at the end had elements that looked pulled out of the filmmakers' asses when they were stuck.<br/><br/>They knew that denying the threats were real would destroy the threats, but decided to repeatedly ignore them.<br/><br/>Making fun of King's history of poor endings in his books was funny. The reference to John Carpenter's The Thing was good.

A town that small would be in panic mode and would be flooded with news outlets.<br/><br/>For its length, they could have worked a bit more on the cursory character arcs for all six. I know it's time consuming, but it sure was long to begin with. Could have swapped that with other things.<br/><br/>What happened to the ghoul driving the Trans Am?

"DarthVoorhees","6","0","1","14 September 2019"," Great moments aside 'It Chapter Two' underwhelms as it attempts to be a sprawling horror epic
","I couldn't help feeling underwhelmed upon exiting the theatre. I've thought about it a lot and really there just isn't a whole lot of substance to 'It Chapter 2', it just doesn't have much of a thematic soul to it and you know you are adapting King wrong when that is a complaint levied against your movie.<br/><br/>First off, I loved It (2017) or Chapter One. The success of that movie lies on the shoulders of it's cast of child actors who all had chemistry, motivation and distinct personalities. 'It Chapter Two's adult losers are extremely well cast. The heavy hitters Hader, Chastain, and McAvoy are all inspired choices and their talent and star power lend a lot of presence to the film. Honestly though I was more impressed with the B list members of the Loser's Club. Isaiah Mustafa is outstanding as Mike Hanlon, the only character whose depiction 'It Chapter 2' improves from the King novel. James Ransone is the spitting image of Jack Dylan Glazer who played Eddie in the first film. He has that right mix of comedy and being the fearful member of the group without going too far. Andy Bean has a small scene as the tragic adult version of Stanley Uris but it may be the best scene in the entire movie. Stanley's fate always seemed cruel and for shock value in both the King novel and the 1990 miniseries but Bean brings out the sadness and bleakness of it. The juxtaposition of the adult Stanley and the young Wyatt Oleff flashing back and forth while being underscored with the beautiful music by Benjamin Wallfisch is genuinely heartbreaking. It's kind of a shame the moment is revisited in an awkward ending.<br/><br/>Sounds like a rave so far huh? Well the individual performances are great. The adult losers have no chemistry whatsoever. The scenes where they are together just never click. I mean sure you can get caught up in the action during the scenes of peril but when they are reminiscing and laughing it just falls flat. Notice that I didn't mention the adult Ben played by Jay Ryan when I was handing out praise. He is a pretty big weak link in the chain. I don't know if the character is written poorly or Ryan is just going for easy choices but the entirety of Ben in this film is his not so subtle crush on Beverly. This is supposed to be a big emotional pay off and Ryan just over does it.<br/><br/>A lot is being made about the run time. Honestly for a movie that long I felt that it was kind of half baked. No time is spent exploring the town and it's culture and how Pennywise hovers over anything. You need that and the first film did it so well. The clown himself disappears for some very long stretches. The film is padded with flashbacks to the kids. I don't mind this but they don't really interconnect with the adult narrative. The kid flashbacks just sort of pad the story from the first film. I'm sure if you've read up on the movie you know about the CGI removal of puberty from the 2017 cast... it's distracting and highly noticeable.<br/><br/>The musical score is great, the cast shines on an individual level, and try as I might I can't bring myself to condemn a three hour horror epic. This is probably the most intense horror film in size and scope you are ever going to see. Personally I'd like to see more horror films with this broad a canvas and so I want 'It Chapter Two' to succeed despite my problems with it. It (2017) was great and I walked out dying to see the adult saga and so maybe I'm having the 'Game of Thrones' finale syndrome where the movie I had in my head was better.<br/><br/>It's serviceable."

"tineshnairmogan","7","0","1","14 September 2019"," CHAPTER 2 WITH AN IMPRESSIVE ENDING
","POSITIVE (PROS)
After two years of waiting for the second movie of the franchise, It Chapter 2 has come to cinemas. I expected more horror than the first one and it did fulfilled it. The story of how the first movie scenes which were connected to the actions developed in the second movie are well screenplayed by the team.<br/><br/>The actors acted in the film can be seen as they well known studied about their characters in order to be connected to its audience from the first chapter. For example, Eddie's fear on helping his friends when pennywise strikes them. In addition, Richie's human sense that made audience engaged to the character to his hilarious dialogues and making fun of his friend. That's brought life of the characters of the child actors to the adulthood. James McAvoy as Billy has a standing ovation and the cast chosen are reasonable for the movie demands.<br/><br/>Horror sequences are well made and make the audience to the edge of their seats especially the arrival of Pennywise to hunt the main characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie also focuses the spirit of a team of friendship that represents their togetherness. The scenes in the movie will make the audience to remember their childhood lives and to be together with their old friends. This could be another plus point for the movie to be more emotional and message giving movie besides horror.<br/><br/>
NEGATIVE (CONS)
The run time of the movie is a minor con that could be minimize by avoiding several scenes in the movie sequences. The dragging of the screenplay that made the movie to be 2 hours 50 minutes which is longer than the first chapter of 2 hours 26 minutes. Scenes such as the horror sequences of the Losers meeting point which is the chinese restaurant can be cut to shrink down the time.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie where the Losers make pennywise to be weak in order to kill it can be improvised as the larger half clown-insect legged horrifying pennywise shoudln't be dead by only listening to the negative words of shringking him to be small in order to kill it. This is because pennywise is a powerful character and its capabilties. The ending of killing it can be done as the Losers may have weapons to kill it and take its heart instead of saying and cursing it with just words to make it small and easy to be killed.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION
It: Chapter is a wonderful ending of the franchise and it still makes a wonderful box office collection. It is a fun-filled, horrifying and more hilarious minor scenes that brings you a whole package to the audience."
"ronakkotian","5","0","2","14 September 2019"," Went on for too long...
","This was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. The whole premise of It fascinated me and I thought Chapter One was a good adaptation of Stephen King's source material. What worried me was how the adult portion would be handled since the 1990s mini-series had a very disappointing take on the adult segment. Whilst this is an improvement on the mini-series version, it doesn't reach the level of its predecessor.<br/><br/>It: Chapter Two follows the reunion of the Losers Club, 27 years later, as they try to defeat Pennywise once and for all.<br/><br/>My feelings towards this movie are quite mixed. There are portions which I enjoyed and parts which I disliked. What I thought was perfect about this movie was its casting choices. Seriously, the adult cast fit right into every one of their characters. You actually feel like the kids grew up to be like the adults. The best amongst them was Bill Hader who effortlessly acts like Finn Wolfhard's Richie Tozier. I felt the chemistry between them in the same way as the kids. This is one of the film's biggest strengths.<br/><br/>A big issue I had with this film was its runtime. Whilst the first chapter had a continuous pace, you could feel the 2 hours 40 minutes here. Some scenes dragged on for way too long and some didn't feel necessary. If 20-30 minutes were trimmed off the length, then the pacing wouldn't suffer as much.<br/><br/>A few flashbacks to the kid versions of themselves felt distracting. I couldn't help but notice how some of the kids, especially Finn Wolfhard, were digitally de-aged to fit the time period and because all of them grew up since the last film. Some of their dialogue had a sense of ADR done to them as well which put me off during my viewing.<br/><br/>An important element that a movie like It should have is scary scenes. There were a few good scares in the first one but Chapter Two fails to recreate that same impact. Apart from one scare which genuinely shook me, nothing else affected me. A complaint I had with the first film applies here as well. There were too many jumpscares. I wish some of the effects were practical as I think that would've been more effective when it comes to the scares.<br/><br/>However, what I loved about this film was Bill Skarsgard. His performance as Pennywise is so creepy and entertaining. It's not just the make-up that creeps you out but his way of speaking alongside his expressions make the character of Pennywise all the more scary.<br/><br/>It: Chapter Two is by no means a bad film. Despite its flaws, there's a lot of appreciate. The camaraderie between the Losers felt really believable and the humour was actually funny. Muschietti's direction is once again great and the cinematography is good as well. I feel that they tried to fit in too much which affected the end result."

","You want your boat, it's nice this boat (flu-sou in the 1).
Yesterday I had the very good idea to watch This: Chapter 2, the session took place at 8:05 p.m., and then the film started at 8:25 p.m., and then the movie ended at 11:00 p.m. (I was exhausted). I watched it with my brother and my mother, we thought it was great. And then the film is super scary, one of my biggest freaks of horror cinema, in fact I would say that it was the film that scared me the most, because there are jumpscares, but I'll come back to that later.
The Clan of The Ratés are going to come together again to beat the big bad guy, being an adult because in the movie they're not a kid, and besides you have James McAvoy in the role of Bill, and I'd say he's the most endearing character , after I still love the other characters but there is a character in I don't care completely, Stanley, the
dude dies already from the beginning
, I don't understand why they put him in the cast, and then his role served no purpose, and then the other one is asthmatic and he had more burns to come.
So starts first in
a carnival, with two homosexuals spending their time together, but after they've come out of the carnival, a group beat them up and throws a homosexual into the river and that's where we'll still see the first appearance of that, and it doesn't Don't do something very, very nice, he eats the heart of the gus.
And it starts great because the film already puts us in the mood from the beginning (like all horror movies).
SCARY AND ANTAGONISTE:
So I'd say it's more scary than the first one, and then there are more jumpscares, not to mention when
The little girl wanted it to make her disappear her stain on her face, and then all of a sudden you have 15 seconds of silence and jumpscare
intense, there's also the moment when
Ben (child) ends up with the Clown in the locker. Every scene in this movie is scary, super stressful and beautiful:
Ex: The mirror scene where Bill tries to save the child, and then the child gets trapped between walls. And behind it's that and it starts to break the window
, this scene put me in a tense situation. Every scene stressed me out, the hairs of my arm bristling, my legs shaking, the jumps. Now I'm going to go on the antagonist. The one who sought the look of That is genius, the eyes offbeat (it makes his look scary), the face all white with the two traces he has on the face and in addition the voice that goes perfectly with. A big icon of horror.
PERSONNAGES:
They're all cool because I really like James McAvoy in the role of Bill, because he's super endearing, after I really like Beverly, and I felt so much emotion I had towards her, because for a moment she was thinking about her past with her father, she was living a difficult past, traumatic and besides his father is a real jerk, and if I could also remember what is on him in the 1 is that he is a pervert, a rapist and he wants his daughter to be like his mother. Richie Tozier always as endearing, funny I really like the moment when he says ""We're all going to float""), often he comes out hilarious phrases. Ben is also clearly one of my favorite characters, and then he's lost weight (we're fighting the squeaks) and he's super well interpreted. Eddie, the asthmatic, pretty much interesting but he doesn't really bring much to the film and lately there's Mike Hanlon who is my favorite character because he brings a lot to the film, because he knows how it was born (I think) and then that's the element important part of the film, a valuable person.
IMPRESSIVE SCENE:
This film features an impressive scene, neat at the level of special effects, I'm talking about the end fight scene. the
It's impressive and I'm in love with the scenery.
After for the script, I find it very correct, it's sought normally, it's clean and then it makes you want to see the movie a lot.
CONCLUSION: That: Chapter 2 is an excellent sequel, even better than the first. Stuffed with jumpscare, with an endearing villain and super creepy. In short a great discovery, if you want to see it, it's now or never.
I do not recommend for under 16s."

The casting.. Every single adult who played the part portraying the child characters honestly did a flawless job.<br/><br/>It did a good job at building tension AT TIMES.

This where the spoilers start, so if you haven't seen it, don't read past here. I didn't think the ending was very well thought out. IT was literally defeated by name calling. They could have just done that when they were kids, right? It kind of rendered the whole story being told for almost 3 hours completely pointless.

","It part 1 was a pretty much lovable movie, even if it wasn't the horror it should have been. It mixed the 80's charm with modern elements. It has its own flaws, but overall succeeded to be kind of a complete experience.
With part 2, as the movie has everything done again bigger and louder, even the flaws are more articulated this time. Too long, unbalanced, incoherent, even though i liked almost all of the sketch-like parts of each character, it was nothing really what we haven't seen in the previous part.
Even the ending was very similar, only complicated a bit more, longer, and somehow less scary. It's okay that they decided to stay with the clown figure, but meanwhile they forget to make him scary. And this is the main flaw of the films, mostly this one. Not enough suspense, but loud jump scares, and shoved in the face violent moments. Sadly it slowly started to be an older teenager version of Scooby Doo.
I guess the problem is that they wanted it to appeal for the widest range of audience, and it definitely hurts the possibility to become something a bit more edgy, creepy, rough horror material.<br/><br/>Overall, i enjoyed most of it, but i wanted it to be finished around the last half hour or more."

The first film in this series gave me a lot of hope for the second, and for probably the first hour of this movie I really enjoyed myself, but then, unfortunately, this movie started to really fall apart after the first act. I actually think watching this film has made me appreciate the first film more. This isn't the worst ending we could've received- it's fine- it looks good and it's got a few truly creepy moments, but I found myself wanting a lot more from it. I'll probably still end up watching this film once more at some point in my life- I'd like to watch Parts One and Two back to back to see if I've missed anything.

","Here's the short... The film was definitely fun and entertaining. Although I didn't find it scary enough to be a horror movie nor funny enough to be a comedy, so it falls somewhere inbetween, making it a little bit of a confusing experience. But definitely fun.<br/><br/>Where this movie shines is in the nostalgia. The first one did a great job of transporting us back to our own childhoods, and it was clear that we were seeing the world through the eyes of a child, with adults and bullies all being characatures. This one was almost a nostalgia overload as the kids came back to see their home town, yet I really liked those bits. I was a bit dissapointed that the theme of seeing the world through their eyes didn't continue, this time with kids being characatures.<br/><br/>Perhaps my biggest problem with the film played itself out in the first couple of scenes...<br/><br/>It opens with a gay couple who are attacked by a bunch of thugs simply for being gay... Something I would've bought maybe of we were still back in the 90's but this is taking place in present day. Not only was this a forced little piece of woke, it had absolutely no relevance to the plot, making the filmmakers look desperate to appear intersectional.<br/><br/>The next issue was the following moments where we learn that Mike has been living above the library for years. Now in the original version this would make sense because Mike was the one obsessed with Derry, but for some reason in the first movie they made Ben the one that was into the history of the town, so they just abandoned that and instead decided to try to convince us that Ben was actually a prodigy architect, capable of building an underground structure most adults wouldn't be able to.<br/><br/>These changes are odd because they don't lend themselves to the story in ways that could've been done otherwise.<br/><br/>Steven king makes a cameo as a shop owner which had a lot more opportunities for jokes than they went for, which was a bit of a shame to be honest.<br/><br/>The entire movie is sort of pointing towards the characters getting artifacts from their past to perform a ritual that is supposed to kill the monster. It kind of trudges through these sequences intercutting new scenes with the kids being terrorized by the clown. The scenes from the past are great when they shed light on their present, but boring when they try to include new suspense sequences because we already know they point to nothing.<br/><br/>Another area that confused me was that in the first movie, the things that scared people were fake. But in this movie that seemed to change... To the extent that a zombie was chauffeuring the grown up Henry - so it makes for a confusion of the world we are in.<br/><br/>The other thing that was somewhat frustrating was that Pennywise didn't have any clear goal. In the first one he woke from his slumber to feed on fear and kills kids along the way. Here it's like all he's doing is waiting around for the grown up version of these kids. The only other person he kills is the gay guy from the beginning a d a random kid which also seemed to be to get at Bill.<br/><br/>It's a bit of a she because there was a lot of potential for this to be something special, but instead it took great casting and a great premise and didn't respect itself enough to give us a good ending - which is ironic seeing as one of the elements of the story is that Bill is a writer who is unable to write a good ending.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's fun but didn't live up to its own potential."

I am a big fan of the first one and was really looking forward to a worthwhile closing. But man, was it awful. I considered the first one a true horror movie, but this one was just over-the-top. Spiders bursting out of heads (which reminded me of the Evil Dead movies) and all those ridiculous looking CGI monsters appearing again and again. Just an overkill. And what the heck, is it even a horror movie anymore? Apparently not. It is a horror comedy, again like Evil Dead. People behind us laughing continuously.

","I was blown away by the first movie. Still have it as one of my favourite horrors.
Naturally I was excited for this one. Disappointed I was not, but it just doesn't peak like the first part. For a nearly 3 hour movie, it felt well paced, with the various transitions, and I didn't feel exhausted or bored from watching it. The transitions between the present and past is genius, especially with a cast that really resemble their younger selves. The character developments and arch's end up really satisfying, and they really get you connected to them all. The way the story is told, is mesmerising, engaging but... It won't keep you on the edge!<br/><br/>I found the ambient and atmosphere of this one, feeling like a drama. Where the first movie was full of surprises, with a gloomy atmosphere and a constant intensity. This movie is more relaxed, and as mentioned, feels like an HBO drama at times. The comic relief is really good, but it is way too overdone. They spent a lot of minutes to build up scary and hard hitting scenes, to ruin it with a funny but unnecessary one liner. This is a huge thing, because it feels like the build-up is wasted on a clever remark, instead of a hard hitting sense of fear, anger or drama. Huge potential loss. Hereby it relies on predictable jump scares, instead of the dark and horrific atmosphere from the first movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie good, but not great as expected after the first one. The connection to the first movie was good, there were great details and Easter eggs. Characters and the cast are amazing, the creatures are terrifying and the story telling is great. But I would call it a thriller, not a horror. Good movie nonetheless, but really tends to lean towards drama feel."

","Saw IT: Chapter Two Thursday, and I it was a pretty fun film. For those that have read the novel or watched the first chapter would know that 27 years after the events of the first film, It resurfaces in Derry, Maine, to continue its spree of terrorizing the denizens and eating its children. Mike Hanlon, the token black member of the Losers Club, remained in Derry to document information on how he and his friends could possibly destroy It if he ever returned. And sure enough, he had, thus began the revival of the blood oath they made years ago.<br/><br/>The acting is stellar for the most part. While many have already stated this, it is true; Bill Hader does an amazing job at portraying the grown up Richie Tozier. He carries most of the humor in the film, but when the time calls for emotion, he does fantastically. The other cast members also do a good job at portraying the grown up Losers and they do resemble them in some likeness, but I felt they weren't as impactful. Bill Skarsgard once again kills it as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, who here is actually a little more goofier, but nevertheless, the 27 years did nothing to file down his fangs. He's just as creepy as he was in the first film - maybe even more so.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my issues with the film mostly lie in the writing. The film for starters is 3 hours long. Normally I don't mind long films. I mean Avengers: Endgame was roughly around the same length of time but I felt that it flew by quickly without me having to excuse myself for a bathroom break. It: Chapter Two, however, didn't need to be that long. I am aware that the novel is a long read, 1,138 to be exact (and I read it for a few months to complete it), but the side quests that the Losers go through really weigh down the runtime and are nowhere as interesting as they may as well should've been. There were also new additions to the film that I felt could've provided something new for a story that had already been established, but those moments are ultimately for nothing. The biggest issue, however, is the adults. The adult portion of the story was never my favorite part of the original book, not in the miniseries, and it's still there in this take. I guess what makes it problematic is that...let's be real: children being put into dangerous situations with an evil, ancient monster is infinitely more terrifying than adults facing those childhood traumas. This is especially true if you have little ones who you do not want to be put in harm's way. That is what made the book Pet Sematary and its 1989 adaptation scary. The adult portion of the It story was always the weakest of the two.<br/><br/>Overall, It: Chapter Two is a mixed bag. As a conclusion, it is definitive and mostly satisfying, but when you take what the first film had done, it comes off as more feeble."

"Fancorrect","8","0","1","8 September 2019"," IT Chapter 2 Review From FC
","The truth is IT chapter 2 will probably feel a bit too long as a horror film for most viewers but it was a great closure for this remake sequel. Now, don't go in expecting the movie to be a scare fest because it isn't. It's a psychological thrill & although there are some wtf moments, it's not meant for that. So your date may be disappointed if they prefer jumps on every corner. The director Andy Muschietti was able to bring it all together both with great performances & with an amazing visual world that highlights what the character Pennywise really is all about. And that's probably what I personally enjoyed the most about it. The rest of the cast all deserve some kind of recognition, from the kids all the way to the grown ups. Bill Skarsgard once again plays an eerie Pennywise with his own twist but not too far from the original creepiness & James McAvoy still shows his skills no doubt about it. But it was Bill Hader who stole this one IMO. His character ""Richie"" will get your attention from the beginning & never let you go. Plus he ends up getting some help from his battering partner James Ransone's who plays ""Eddie"". They will make you feel as if they really grew up together (no joke/all jokes). So in conclusion, I (FcYoPeace) enjoyed this remake very much & I recommend more if you enjoyed the first one. But if you didn't, still go see it.... you may like this one.<br/><br/>PS: I hope you love the Easter egg as much as I did."
"fredschaefer-406-623204","7","0","1","8 September 2019"," I liked it despite some obvious problems.
","One of the most anticipated movies of the year has been director Andy Muschietti's IT CHAPTER TWO, the second part of the his adaptation of Stephen King's much beloved and mammoth 1986 novel, which had been adapted before in a much beloved TV miniseries in 1990. The first film, released two years ago, was both a box office and critical success, more than that, this new big screen version of King's story resonated with audiences, drawn to the story of a group of misfit teen agers, who dub themselves The Losers, and who must confront an ancient evil entity haunting their small Maine town of Derry in the summer of 1989; this entity, who presents himself to the world as a malevolent clown named Pennywise, lives on fear, especially the fear of children. It's a great coming of age story, with some of King's most vividly realized characters, not mention one of his most terrifying villains.<br/><br/>This second film, which centers around Bill, Beverly, Richie, Mike, Ben, Eddie, and Stan - The Losers - 27 years later and now adults, who must now return to Derry and take on a resurrected Pennywise. And it has problems, not the least of which is the nearly three hour running time, but more to the point, a story line that is overstuffed with a lot of business. These were same problems with King's thousand plus page novel, which I have always thought would have worked better as two books. The movie does get off to a strong start, where we are introduced to the adult counterparts to the kids we met in the first movie, all of whom are scared in some way by the trauma they endured in Derry - Beverly is married to an abusive man, Eddie is still a germaphobe, Bill is a once successful writer now blocked - who come home and catch up over a meal in a Chinese restaurant, where things take a turn. In the second half, the group (sans suicide Stan) ventures out on their own, attempting to reconnect with their childhoods, and to find a personal totem that time that will help them defeat Pennywise once and for all. Here we are treated to essentially the same scene over and over, where Bill, Beverly, and the rest, visit an abandoned movie theater, and old apartment, a drugstore, the park, have a flashback, and are confronted by Pennywise. And boy is this section heavy on jump scares, so much so, that after awhile you can see them coming. To me, jump scares are the equivalent of a sugar high. It's also very heavy on the CGI, some of which is better than others - I was impressed with the long tongued leper who torments Eddie, the monstrous Paul Bunyan statue that comes to life and chases Richie, and the old lady thing Beverly encounters. But I didn't find any of it particularly scary though. In the third act, our heroes descend deeper into the sewers under Derry for a final confrontation with Pennywise, and this plays out much more like a giant monster film than anything else. It's a satisfying ending, even with all the obvious CGI, but I understand if anyone finds this wearying. There is still the Ritual of Chud (not the mutant cannibals from that other 80's horror movie), but much is left out from King's book, which for many, went cosmically off the rails in the finale, which included the giant turtle Mataurin, who spat out the universe. It's a classic example of something that might have worked on the page, but would have looked ludicrous on the screen. Many think King attempted a concept in that finale that he failed to pull off, though many fans love it. Also missing are subplots involving Beverly's awful husband and Bill's movie star wife. A central problem with this second film, which was true for the book as well, is that the adult Losers' story lacks the sense of wonder, discovery, and triumph that was palpable in their teenage versions.<br/><br/>Still, despite all of its faults, I could not dislike this movie. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Andy Bean, and James Ransome are first rate as the grown up Bill, Beverly, Richie, Mike, Eddie and Ben; all of them give winning performances, totally selling me that they are the older versions of the young actors who played them in the first film, which could have been a problem when those young actors show up in flashbacks (though some have been noticeably digitally de-aged, because kids change a lot in two years). Bill Skarsgard owns Pennywise every bit as much as Tim Curry did in the miniseries. There are a number of scenes that really work, starting with Pennywise luring a little girl under the bleachers at a ball game that is scary and terrible in the way great horror movies should be; the hate crime murder of a young homosexual that shows that things in the Derry of 2016 are just as awful as ever; Ben and Beverly reaching for each other in the final showdown when Pennywise is about to drown them in their own fears. Stephen King himself turns up in a funny cameo, where he chides the adult Bill Denbrough for the bad endings of Bill's books, a knowing wink to King's own fans that have made the same complaint for years. Director Peter Bogdanovich turns up as well to make the some complaint. And though I've disdained CGI plenty, there is one creature that is a nod to one of the most infamous effects from John Carpenter's THE THING that I loved. I also like the tweak Muschietti did with Stan's suicide, something absent from the book.<br/><br/>And if any producers are looking for other Stephen King works to bring to the big screen, I'd like to put in my two cents for an adaptation of FROM A BUICK 8, and if anyone really wants to take a risk, take on RAGE from the Bachman books. The latter would be quite controversial, but never timelier in this political climate."

","Although the horror itself impressed me and was at times brilliant, there were a lot of parts where I found myself cringing unexpectedly too much. This was mostly during scenes where lame and pathetic jokes were being cracked after the characters have just witnessed some gruesome and horrific scenes that should have left them scarred and scared. But no, they find it in themselves to be joyful enough to make a quick joke to which by the way nobody in the audience laughed.<br/><br/>Why do you writers/directors approve of this? Don't you realize it's ruining the film?
Don't you see? It's like you quickly forget what you are shooting and throw in completely random stuff like this? It doesn't fit with what you're filming whatsoever. Don't worry, someone will make a parody of this film and they will bring the jokes in that you want to bring. It's the same as if you go to a comedy film like ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and at the end of the movie a monster shows up to eat Sarah's face, just for s & giggles. It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>Imagine if Stanley Kubrick allowed for this type of nonsense in film-making during ""The Shining"". It would have never, ever received the film-classic status it has today. And that's the difference! You want to make a horror movie? Well then you better be very careful in how you bring humor into it, as that itself is an art that a lot of directors and young writers simply do not possess these days."

","After seeing the first movie I was already worried about how this one would go. Not saying the first one was bad but it wasn't very scary to me at all and the tone was all over the place with a lot of moments that were a ""scary scene"" that would go right into a laughing fun scene. The second installment is pretty much the same but less scary, bad CGI monsters, and very predictable. All the characters go off on their own and you already know they are all going to have a penny wise encounter before all meeting up to go defeat him. Not only are these scenes repetitive, but also just not really scary at all. There are some side plots that add absolutely nothing like the return of Henry Bowers. I know it sounds like I'm just trashing this movie but it just could have been a lot better and they could have used Bill Skarsgard more who is a great penny wise and really created the stuff of nightmares instead of scenes that were almost laughable."
"rcolgan","6","0","2","8 September 2019"," You'll Float Two
","Stephen King films can be difficult to get right. There are some aspects of his writing which are quite hard to put to film, especially when it's a 1,200 page novel that contains a lot of lore that's impossible to condense it to even two movies. But he also has some of the greatest horror movie scenarios ranging from the goofiness of killer cars, the terror of being trapped with your most psychotic fan and of course a killer clown from space taking the form of everyone's worst nightmares.<br/><br/>Whilst chapter 1 of It wasn't able to include some of the more bizarre elements of the novel such as the ancient space turtle who created the universe, it instead focused on the battle for survival between a bunch of outcast kids known as the losers and an alien who wants nothing other than terrifying and eating them. Now chapter 2 takes place 27 years after the events of the first movie and the losers have all grown up and almost all have forgotten the horrors of their childhood. But when Pennywise reawakens, they are all called upon to make good of their promise to defeat the evil creature if It ever came back.<br/><br/>Though the film seems less interested in focusing on any plot and instead plays out more like a horror anthology film. Similar to the last film, the losers are separated through most of the films run time with Pennywise cornering them all by turning in to their own personal nightmares. This ranges from anything between being trapped in a hall of mirrors to encountering an old granny, at times delivering on a level of brutality that most films usually shy away from.<br/><br/>But in spite of the films increased budget, the scares aren't as effective this time around. There's nothing as visceral as the bloody bathroom or as frantic as Pennywise's monstrous form reaching out from a projector. Parly this is because of the absence of cinematographer Chung-hon Chung's who played a massive role in developing the nightmarish visuals of the first film. Also at 2 hours 45 minutes, there is a fair amount of repetition of the standard Pennywise formula. There's only so many times it's entertaining to see the same formula of one of the losers ending up alone, Pennywise jump scare and the loser running away unharmed before things start to get boring.<br/><br/>As for the characters themselves, all the new cast are all individually very entertaining. James McAvoy delivers with both emotional intensity. Jessica Chastain carries all of her characters trauma from the first film. And Bill Hader is an absolute treasure who's able to make anything hilarious. However as a group they don't share the same chemistry as their childhood counterparts, mostly because similar to the original TV miniseries the dynamic of young childhood friends is just more fun to watch.<br/><br/>And at the core of the movie once again is Bill Skarsgård's unhinged Pennywise. He's one of the few recent great movie monsters with an unsettling presence whenever he's onscreen, always moving in an unnatural twitchy way.<br/><br/>It's just a shame that Skarsgård is often only limited to being part of brief jumpscares and isn't given enough time, with the film favouring some more generic CGI monsters instead of just giving Skarsgård more time to deliver on some psychological terror. Overall watching It kind of feels like walking through a haunted house at a carnival. You'll get a few good jump scares and you'll have some good laughs, but not offering anything which is likely to resonate in any meaningful way."

","All in all I enjoyed the film a lot more than I expected. I'm not sure it needed to be almost 3 hours long, however trying to cram a version of one of Stephen King's chaotic narratives into a film, must be difficult. Some truly scary and hilarious moments within the film, being at the edge of your seat and then relaxing into a laugh was refreshing.<br/><br/>I'm interested to watch the film again as it seems there's a lot of hidden symbolism. I mean, the characters are now grown up and Pennywise's 'lair' seems to be like a symbolic womb, this combined with the fact the only female character is dripping in blood in a look I can only describe as mimicking Carrie, seems too symbolic to miss. There's a lot of other things I noticed too. Perhaps I'll like the film more after a second time, or perhaps I'll decide that it isn't as good as I've Initially deduced."

","I enjoyed the movie I thought it was scary at times well get to that later and an overall pretty good adaptation<br/><br/>But I feel very mixed with problems like I never was interested with the Ben Beverly and Bill triangle and that's another thing Ben was really different in this movie in the book and original movie I remember him as a drunk playboy millionaire something like Tony Stark he reminded me of but now he just looks like a bodybuilder or model or something like that and it bugs me<br/><br/>I do really like the rest of the characters like Richie and Mike have been my favourite because Richie is amazingly played by Finn wolfhard(sorry if spelled wrong) and Bill Hader is just great and Mike I really loved because he's so emotionally broken from It for 27 years because he has never forgot about It people might disagree with me about Mikes character but I like him<br/><br/>The directing was another great part about this movie with all the transitions and things like that and this is way scarier then It 2017 because we got stuff like a wired bug with a baby face come out of a fortune cookie and that unforgettable Ms.Kersh scene witch is on par with the shinning but there were a bit to many jump scares if you ask me<br/><br/>Something I didn't like was the new Henery Bowers the kid I thought was good but the older him was just over the top and just boring to watch in my opinion<br/><br/>I do like the Steven king cameo that was pretty intertaning and how they always say to bill his endings suck witch is a lot of things people say about King great book bad ending another problem I had is while it was funny it was a bit to much at times for example the Chinese place was good to be funny but not when Eddie gets thrown up on and they play it comical<br/><br/>Overall a good movie my thoughts might change but right now It chapter 2 is a 7 for me"

"ilikedre","7","0","1","7 September 2019"," A good time for fans of the first and the book alike.
","It chapter 2 is nearly 3 hours long and you can feel it. It's more of a comedy than a horror and relies too much on cliche jump scares.
The source material and the cast (particularly bill hader) carry the movie far even if it never quite captures the charm of the first. All in all it's worth a watch if you enjoyed the first one."
"sean_tidball","6","0","2","7 September 2019"," More of the same
","It kept me gripped for 2 hours 49 mins, another minute and I'd have walked out. It's full of quick snap scares, but once you have seen one scare you've seen them all. Skarsgard is once again amazing and is a reason to watch it alone. The story differs so much to the original mini series. Quite a few references to other king films which was cool and the ultimate Easter egg as well as King appears as the shopkeeper selling bill his old bike
Completely closed off and no 3rd film. Pennywise is gone.

"samlaakso","7","0","1","7 September 2019"," Surprisingly meh but decent!
","Look let's be honest the scares were just jump scares nothing like the first movie. I say this because the first movie nobody expected the scenes like that! The second movie you kind of expected what was to come, BUT I'm not dissing it! Bill Skarsgard another Incredible just Incredible performance as PennyWise! And the fact they let the kid actors pick who played them as adults was Genius! Bill Hader was amazing! James McAvoy was Incredible! A no name James Ransone played Eddie to perfection! And the rest of the adult actors were amazing! All in all A great ending to a two movie series and Yes I Obviously will miss pennywise. I hope more clown horror movies will look up to IT and see what to do! And for the director, Andy Muschietti I hope he keeps making horror movies"
"elliserkintalo","7","0","1","7 September 2019"," It Chapter 2 Review
","IT Chapter 2 tries to go for what the first one succeeded at but fails at it. While the first movie was more scary and tense Chapter 2 is an echo of its predecessor full of lazy jumpscares and very few actually scary scenes.
However the character building and Pennywise scenes were much better than in the first one and the pacing was better."
"funtasticfour","7","0","1","7 September 2019"," Pretty much what I expected
","I've loved the book for years, and It Chapter 1 was my favourite movie the year it came out. This one doesn't live up to that one, but is still a pretty good follow up. The adult actors are pretty good comparisons to the kids, and I especially liked Bill Hader. There is a great cameo by Stephen King, poking fun at himself. I wish there were more scares. The best scenes in this and the first, are always when the kids are separated with Pennywise. Overall, the kid scenes are always more fun, as are the 80's."
"prankt","6","0","1","7 September 2019"," A good follow up to a very good horror movie.
","The modern adaptation of the classic IT series follows in the footsteps of the original mini series, that being that the second part is worse than the first. It's still good mind you, but not as good. Overall, almost everything about this movie felt like a downgrade to the first or didn't improve at all. The parts that are better in my opinion is the casting and the dynamic between the characters. Every main character in this movie feels like they have known each other for their whole life and have comradery to them. The casting is perfect, every actor does a phenomenal job in this movie. What can you say about Bill Skarsgård that hasn't been said already? He's the best actor in both movies, no one comes close. This movie doesn't pull any punches, if you don't like lots of blood and gore then stay away, cause there's lots. The horror itself is my biggest problem with the movie. All the scary parts build up a lot of tension, and then it falls flat on its face. The ending is also pretty bad. I wont spoil anything but it is not that good. It's still a good movie, and I would recommend checking it out if you're interested in horror, or comedy even. This movie has a lot of jokes in it that work very well even with a shape shifting clown that prays on kids fear."
"Kakesphere","6","0","1","7 September 2019"," What exactly happened here?
","I have looked forward to ITC2 since the credits rolled on the first, and thought the spirit of IT 1 matched the best parts of the novel and the miniseries.<br/><br/>I am so sad to, at this point, be unable to recommend the second. (Ymmv, as I was toggling between the events onscreen and the voice in my head that kept thinking things would get better.)<br/><br/>The ""worst"" parts of the first film, the episodic beat of the encounters with Pennywise, as well as the CG, are writ larger in Chapter 2, with graphics being the worst offender. (Where there were just a couple tetchy moments in IT 1, there are gobs in 2.) Together these two elements bloat, neuter, and generally disable this movie from about 30-40 minutes in all the way through to the end.<br/><br/>The adult losers are all fine actors, but the vocals (accent/dialect/whatchamacallit) could've been coached much better than they were for those from across the pond. Sadly this was true even for a particular actor who's got to be among the best in the biz. Muscle-memory-wise, I felt like Isaiah Mustafa and Andy Bean (however little he was on screen) matched the performances of their Chapter 1 counterparts the best. But due to script choices and the abundance of flashbacks, some other characters/actors never even got the chance.<br/><br/>And oh, the flashbacks. I'd read that they had to budget to de-age the kids, but even with help those differences were distracting. Had they reduced these scenes instead of mainlining them throughout, it wouldn't have been an issue for me.<br/><br/>In all, Chapter 2 felt like a different film entirely, which I get is what was supposed to happen. But rather than two apposite halves that somehow make a whole, this half felt blander, safer, more cynical, and about as energetic as a tree snail.<br/><br/>Will I still get it on BluRay? . . . I plead the fifth."

"medeeam","7","0","1","6 September 2019"," Could have been better
","Disclaimer: I haven't read the book, so I'm only speaking from the perspective of someone who saw It: Chapter One in 2017 and really loved it.<br/><br/>I might have set my expectations too high, but with a movie as outstanding as the first one, I couldn't help but do so. And, unfortunately, that led me to some sort of disappointment. The cinematography isn't as great (although we still get to see some beautiful shots, don't get me wrong), and the storyline isn't very consistent. For most part of the movie, we follow them trying to remember what happened 27 years ago (or just trying to find their artifacts maybe?), but that's mostly a pretext for us to see the many forms Pennywise can take to scare them. The narrative with the ritual that Mike tells them about felt to me like a cheap excuse to justify defeating IT (and thank god, that's not what actually worked). It's just we spend so much time on an idea that isn't grand, nor original. The last half hour of the movie is when stuff finally starts to go down, and it was definitely the most exciting part of the film.
There's also lots of good elements, though. The acting is top notch, the cast itself is fantastic. We get a couple of brilliant scenes from Bill Skarsgard, like that scene with the little girl at the baseball game. I only wish we got to see him act more (as in the first movie, they rely more on cgi and jump scares to creep the audience out). I also enjoyed the dialogue and the character arcs we got to see.
There is a lot of effort put into this movie. It's definitely worth watching if you loved the first one. However, it doesn't hit the potential it had. Judging by how they nailed the first movie, I personally think they could've done Chapter Two better."

"varun-25071997","7","0","1","6 September 2019"," An Untraditional Horror
","It Chapter II was a much needed sequel after the splendid It which gave us the kind of nostalgic horror adventures the audience have been craving. The movie has a very promising cast and we expected it to be a sure shot blockbuster but it isn't, not to worry it still is a decent horror film to watch with your friends.<br/><br/>Set 27 years after the premise, the story begins with Mike calling back his friends to Derry to help him stop Pennywise from terrorizing the town again. The film gives us a lot of chills and heart beating moments but it does also have unnecessary arcs, like we definitely didn't want Bowers to return. The 169 minute running time could have definitely been trimmed or used better.<br/><br/>Bill Hader steals the show in this one and his arc is the best written one too. The cinematography and music were great add-ons to the film. On the whole It Chapter II is a little less better than its predecessor but still a good enough sequel."

","For 2 years, I dreamed of IT, I craved IT, I missed IT!<br/><br/>IT Chapter Two is once again directed by Andy Muschietti, screenplay by Gary Dauberman and starring Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, James Ransone, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan and Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd.<br/><br/>Twenty-seven years after the Losers Club defeated Pennywise, he has returned to terrorize the town of Derry once more. Now adults, the Losers have long since gone their separate ways. However, kids are disappearing again, so Mike, the only one of the group to remain in their hometown, calls the others home. Damaged by the experiences of their past, they must each conquer their deepest fears to destroy Pennywise once and for all.<br/><br/>IT was a great horror movie, and it was faithful to the source material.. it was a great adaptation to part of the novel! So clearly IT Chapter Two was one of the most anticipated movies of 2019, I was so excited to see how Muschietti will make it, and after the cast was announced, I was even more excited! And there's a lot to admire in this movie, but still, the first one was better, and there're a lot of reasons why the first IT was better than the second chapter.. but let's start with the things I liked about this movie:<br/><br/>The movie was so epic, especially the third act, which was insane, I LOVED IT, the way it was directed, the performances.. Pennywise! Everything was amazing about it!<br/><br/>The performances were also great, the two Bills stool the whole movie, especially Skarsgard, once again he's my favorite part of the movie, even though he's not in the movie that much compared to its duration, which is a problem, but we'll get to that point later... Anyways, McAvoy did a great job too, also Chastain, but my second favorite is Ransone as Eddie, he did a great job to capture the humor very well, and he was amazing as scared Eddie too!<br/><br/>If it comes to the scary scenes, the movie wasn't scarier than the first one, that's because back then, they were kids, they were in grave danger, but now they are adults, so you don't feel like they're in danger or anything till the third act, but it had some good scares to keep the audiences entertained enough.<br/><br/>The movie also has a great message, the second chapter is even deeper than the first one, and funnier too!<br/><br/>Let's move to the cons:<br/><br/>Starting with the duration, the movie is almost 3 hours, the plot is good and everything, but if you think about it for a second, the movie could have been shortened a bit, yeah the performances were great, it was so good to see them that great that long, but still, some scenes weren't necessary, they just added time to the movie... The first 15 to 20 minutes felt rushed and you kinda feel like there are a lot coming at you, but then the movie moved slowly, but the cast managed to make the 3 hours worth watching and rewatching from time to time.<br/><br/>And with that length, Pennywise wasn't there that much, that could be disappointing to some, and some could be good with it, I'm right in the middle.<br/><br/>The movie is kinda filled with flashbacks, and the young actors are older now, so they don't look the same, so they had to CGI their faces and digitalis their voices to look the same, sometimes it was distracting, and the bigger problem here that they used so much of these flashbacks, sometimes for horror's sake and sometimes for the plot, and I understand that they had to do it, but they didn't do it good enough.<br/><br/>So IT Chapter Two might disappoint some of the fans of the first one, but still it was so well made, and it's emotional too, and sometimes people can relate to it.. with a great message at the ending, all of these thing made IT Chapter Two deeper than the first one, and with that amazing cast, the humor did hit even harder than the first one, but still as a horror movie, the first one wins the round, and as the length, lots of scenes could have just been cut and shortened, because the plot felt a little bit stretched to fit the length, but it didn't always hit! Also Pennywise lost his mystique a little bit, and there's not that much of him too. But still IT Chapter Two is so watchable and entertaining, and I think lots of the fans are gonna love it, and find themselves so satisfied too.<br/><br/>I'm gonna give IT Chapter Two a B!<br/><br/>Thank you guys, for reading another review of mine, if you liked this, click on my name up above and see all my reviews, look forward to my review of the first IT. Thanks again!"

","... But it could have been better. Honestly the run time didn't bother me. I felt it moved along pretty well. Seeing their journeys for their special parts of the past was cool, but that's also where it falls to pieces.
The special effects weren't that special and at times just downright cheesy and laughable. Many of the incarnations Pennywise takes whole haunting them look like were taken out of an 80s horror film with poor stop motion and cgi work.
Did I like it? Overall I would say yes. Would I recommend it to someone else? Not really."
"dominikkatusa","7","0","1","6 September 2019"," JUMPSCARES/AWESOME ACTORS
","Only thing that will scare you are jumpscares and they are pretty predictable. Movie,in my opinion, is to extended,they could cut some parts of it to make it shorter. Best thing about this movie are actors. They did amazing job and look very similar to their younger versions. Actor who stood out the most was Bill Hader who delivered us some very funny moments.Overall, it is a solid movie and if you liked the first movie you will probably like this one because they are somehow similar,second chapter is more brutal than first one. If you are IT fan you should see it cause I think the movie covered themes that Stephen Kings mentions in his novel and concludes story in nice way."
