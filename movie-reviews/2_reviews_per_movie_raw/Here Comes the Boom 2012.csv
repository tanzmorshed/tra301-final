"rgblakey","7","96","114","12 October 2012"," Kevin James brings the Boom
","Whether you find him funny or not, Kevin James has been racking up the hits since focusing on movies. While not all were hit with the critics, he has managed to garner a following. The trailer for his latest Here Comes The Boom looked like a mix of the same old fair that he normally delivers, but does it have any chance of working to deliver a funny comedy or will it end up being just another forced goofy addition to his resume.<br/><br/>Here Comes The Boom follows a biology teacher who is determine to save the music program from being cut in their school by becoming a mixed-martial arts fighter. While the premise is a bit out there and some of the scenarios are a bit far-fetched this movie works surprisingly well. There are plenty of laughs here that work on numerous levels, but depending on how big a fan of James you are will determine how funny they are. The real surprise here was the fact that there was so much more here than just a stupid comedy. The story is a typical underdog tale with comedy, but enough heart to keep you rooting for James throughout the whole film. Gone is the usual over the top bumbling funny fat guy, in its place was a cooler everyman that works perfectly for this story. James steps up to really deliver more than he has to date. He shows not only a good range with some different emotions, but is pretty impressive with his ability to carry the fight scenes. It was nice to see that while this was a comedy, they still took the fighting side of it seriously to deliver something not only believable but entertaining and will suck you right into the action. The rest of the cast do a great job of bringing everything together, with the real highlights being Henry Winkler who is a spitting image of the band teacher in the Simpsons and former MMA legend Bas Rutten. Both of these guys never take themselves seriously and deliver some funny memorable and likable characters.<br/><br/>This movie was a real surprise on almost every level. It delivers an almost Rocky like underdog tale with some over the top funny moments to create something completely unexpected. Kevin James really knocked it out of the park here and hope he sticks to these kinds of roles and continues to stretch his acting range."
"padraig_power","8","103","124","12 October 2012"," Very funny feel good movie
","I had low expectations for this given the plot (which you can't take seriously) and figured the best parts were shown in the trailers. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>The plot is all very predictable but really who cares for this type of movie. The dialog is not that sharp (Seven Psychopaths it is not) and while some parts are a little corny, the film is light hearted, does not take itself too seriously and is excellent entertainment if you want to switch off your brain at the end of the week.<br/><br/>This film moves at a good pace, is funny throughout, with some real laugh out loud moments, and leaves you with a good feeling at the end."
"actionlad","8","40","51","29 October 2012"," Finally, a Kevin James film I enjoyed all the way to the end.
","I loved ""King of Queens"" and I think Kevin James is a very talented comedic actor, but until this film, he hadn't made a film where he was the star that I could really get behind. Each of his past flicks had him in some unlikeable loser role with a problem nobody cared about. This one figured some things out in how to make him likable and fun to watch. I don't want to give away too much on this film as you may see some of the plot points coming from a mile away, but this is just a nice feel-good comedy. It's not trying to be something more than that. By the way, former professional MMA fighter, Bas Rutten steals every scene he's in. Way to go Bas!"
"intelearts","8","37","48","18 January 2013"," 525th Review: Huge surprise -James finally makes very good indeed
","This has real charm, motivation, comedy, and a superb Henry Winkler and Selma Hayek - and a very good Bas Rutten as the coach who will be getting a ton of work based on this - all in all this is a surprise from beginning to end - and James finally seems to have learnt to rein it in and learnt that OTT all the time is just deadening.<br/><br/>So, a confession - Mall Cop, not my favorite movie, just OK, the one at the zoo, definitely not my thing (or my kids), so I had very low expectations indeed going in to see Boom - but what a difference! The plot is simple: loser teacher seeks to raise school funds by becoming a MMA fighter. And it works. The surprise is how inspirational this is - the school aspect is a really smart move - and totally lifts the movie.<br/><br/>If you want a pizza movie you could do much much worse, this is a well-made, well-judged, and fun movie. One strongly suspects that James found a character he could totally connect with and it gives him what he does best - heart."
"Treyroo","7","27","34","6 December 2012"," Kevin James scores
","You've been doing the same job for most of your adult life and stopped making an effort a decade ago. Then you hear the news that someone who's been doing the job even longer and still makes an effort is about to be fired. Do you let it happen?<br/><br/>Scott Voss (played by Kevin James) is a 42 year- old biology teacher. Ten years ago, he was given a Teacher of the Year award but when we join the story, he's sleeping late, making little or no effort in the classroom and seen as an embarrassment by the principal, Mr. Betcher (played by Greg Germann). When Betcher (Germann) catches him sneaking into class late via the classroom window, he gives Voss parking lot duty and strips him of a vacation day. Rather than accept more work that he's in no way interested in doing, he tries to find someone to fill in for him. His colleague, Marty, the music teacher (played by Henry Winkler) is more than willing to assume the responsibility but also a little shaken by the news that his wife is pregnant. Later, at a school board budget meeting, he's given the even more troubling news that thanks to budget problems, the music program is in jeopardy. Voss, despite his long-standing apathy, offers to raise money to save the music program and his colleague's job. He resumes the job of teaching citizenship classes in night school but sees that the wages would make it near-impossible to earn the money in time. One of his students, Niko (played by Bas Rutten) asks for additional tutoring and Voss agrees, reluctantly. It is during a tutoring session at Niko's apartment that Voss, who wrestled in college, sees a mixed martial arts match, learns that the loser was paid $10,000, and decides he can raise the money by joining this very punishing sport.<br/><br/>Now, the last Kevin James movie that I saw in theaters was Zookeeper. I wasn't impressed. I won't say that Here Comes the Boom was impressive, but it was easily a step up from Zookeeper. Also, naming the movie after what would eventually become the main character's theme song isn't particularly creative. Still, I was entertained. Watching an overweight 42 year-old enter the ring and take serious punishment over and overÂ…and over was hilarious and watching the effect his decision to make an effort had, not just on him but on the entire cast of characters, was bizarrely uplifting. I don't imagine James or any of his co-stars will receive awards for their work in this film, but I liked it and you might too."
"DUKEJBM","Null","43","58","12 October 2012"," What A Pleasant Surprise! Capraesque Feel Good Film!
","High art this is not but anyone that expects high level stuff from a movie with this premise is not watching it with the right frame of mind. It's a good old fashion feel good film with a message. Dare I say Capraesque? I wouldn't even classify this as a comedy. It's a fantasy of goodwill film that induces plenty of smiles and packs heart. Kevin James is perfect in the lead and his common man qualities play extremely well here. They lean on the Rocky formula a lot but that's not necessarily a bad thing. One thing is for sure, Salma Hayek is the hottest ""Adrian"" type love interest to ever play in this type of film. She's amazing throughout. A warm shout out to Henry Winkler who is also perfectly cast as the somewhat eccentric music teacher with the heart of gold.<br/><br/>A wonderful surprise that I enjoyed very much."
"Deepfried-Egg","9","96","141","2 October 2012"," Great clean comedy-drama and The Fonz stole the show!
","The King of Queens is at it again and he hit this one out of the park! Salma Hayek also put in a fun performance as did Henry Winkler. Kevin's real life brother offered up some of the funnier moments dealing with domestic realities. Every character in this film made me laugh until it hurt. This film is a sure crowd pleaser as it has the Asians, Hispanics and the white crowd both old and young covered quite well. Most of the comedy is from the older actors in this film so I think the older crowd will appreciate this film as much as teens will. At times you know you are watching a comedy. At other points you know there is good heart touching drama added in with a comedic touch. And then when the fighting kicks in you feel like you are watching a real fight. If you have a heart for music studies you will cheer these characters on! If you enjoy the UFC/MMA fighting then you'll have a blast watching Kevin James dive into this world and get/give a good whooping! A lot of the real players/announcers/refs from UFC are in this film adding to the feel of a real UFC match. It's a smart film in it's comedic moments. On the other hand, as contrived and predictable as many elements in this story are, you will still find yourself cheering the players on and maybe even feel your eyes water due to feelings from either end of the emotional spectrum. I had given up on comedy films in recent years as most of them our just way too raunchy. But the PG rating on this film...I applaud all those behind this production. This movie works and it will make anyone laugh!"
"Deshawn-raimey","10","99","147","27 September 2012"," Best Feel Good Comedy of 2012 So Far!
","This move was much better than expected! At first I gave it 8 stars, but then I thought about it and could not think of anything this movie was missing for a PG film! Many adults look away at PG films because maybe they think the movie will have their type of entertainment. This flick will definitely give adults and children a lot of comedy, more comedy, action and even inspiration!. This is the best feel good-comedy I have seen all year. Kevin James has always had his own type of unique comedy, which was funny to me. His chemistry with the supporting case was wonderful. This is Kevin James's best film to date. Give this movie a chance if your looking for a movie to watch with the family, date night, or just want a great laugh and a little inspiration."

","My wife and I really enjoyed this movie! It's a must see if you've been waiting for a quality family movie and provides a full spectrum of Friday night entertainment. Even though it won't win any Academy Awards it's my favorite movie of 2012 because it just made me feel good.<br/><br/>Good Points: Perfect casting; all the characters were very believable and enjoyable to watch. I really liked Henry Winkler's performance. He stole the show. The movie is genuinely funny with many out loud moments. It's a family movie with a clean positive message. It was also touching at times. The screenplay was well-written. It's didn't contain too many original ideas but you know it really didn't matter--it was satisfying. It wasn't a cheaply made movie; it showed a quality production and was the pacing was perfect--I was thoroughly engrossed from beginning to end and it never lagged. Salma Hayek provided both eye candy and a lot of substance.<br/><br/>Bad Points: There really wasn't anything bad about the movie. Perhaps it was slightly corny but I didn't care. It contained violent and bloody fighting scenes, so exercise caution for children under 8 years old. The title of the movie is odd and I wish they had chosen a better title.<br/><br/>10/10 rating; well worth a full price ticket!"

A must see funny feel-good entertaining movie! Shocked at the current low rating."
"osj2507","6","3","3","16 September 2015"," Feel good movie and that is really what it does :)
","I think it can always go up and down with Kevin James, as a comedian and Series man he is very good, but at times the film he is in tends to be to long :) he is better at the sprint then the long distance usually, thats my humble opinion.<br/><br/>I saw this with the misses (she always go for comedy given a choice), and we really found it was funny, it is kind of a comedian version of warrior (from 2011, one of the best fight films for MMA I have seen), it has nothing really new or ground breaking. It is solid comedy, with good acting, great characters, nice one liners, well basically the whole thing works and is entertaining for a good afternoon flick.<br/><br/>You should see this, it is a classic feel good movie and that is really what it does :)"
"brimcq5477","6","3","3","29 September 2013"," Kevin James..does he deliver the ""boom""?
","Kevin James delivers as only he can! The reigning ""big man"" of comedy shows off his slimmer physique and pretty impressive MMA skills as the teacher turned fighter.. I laughed at parts but being a ""King of Queens"" fan i guess i wanted more(no Leah Remni or Jerry Stiller?).. still think James is super talented actor and very funny... kudos to ""The Fonz"" Henry Winkler and UFC great-turned actor Bas Rutten who both give great supporting roles...and Salma Hayek...well she isn't bad to look at..her acting...eh..a comedic Rocky-esque motion picture that everyone can enjoy! If you are a Kevin James fan this won't disappoint. good family film!!"
"kevandeb","6","5","6","20 May 2017"," Sucker Punch!
","I have to admit I am a sucker for Kevin James, ever since King of Queens was broadcast in the UK I have loved the persona he plays as the 'average joe' he typifies what most of us guys do in life or would like to do and that is to act like a kid, never grow up and do as little as possible!! His transposition to the big screen has not been without troubles and whilst this is a bit kitsch, borrows from other movies, I still will forgive his choices as he is, like Simon Pegg, so likable that watching him gives a warm feeling like a mug of cocoa on a rainy day. Not an Oscar winner but an above average afternoon movie that is easily watchable"
"Chrisgunn91","6","9","13","31 January 2013"," Typical Kevin James Film
","Here Comes the Boom is Kevin James latest film which sees him tackling the world of MMA. James a lifelong fan of MMA trained in mix martial arts for this role and it is evident in his performance as a teacher turned UFC fighter.(This being the first film with official UFC licensing.<br/><br/>This film is aimed at the same demographic as those who enjoyed Chuck and Larry or King of Queens, its an interesting watch with enough depth to keep you watching. Though this film has a few good laughs and a steady if a somewhat predictable story line its main flaw is attention to detail with the minor characters that make the story.<br/><br/>Overall it is worth a watch but don't expect to see it on any all time great lists. The best is yet to come from Kevin James and I am sure we will see it from him in the future."
"zabelb","8","6","8","12 March 2013"," Kevin James provides a refreshing and underrated performance in ""Boom""
","I would like to start off this review by saying that I was expecting to hate this movie with a burning passion. Kevin James seems to be on this trend of being in movies with a ridiculous plot line in hopes to attract the youth audience.<br/><br/>""Here Comes The Boom"" was a refreshingly good movie that may not have provided me with gut-wrenching laughs throughout the movie, but left me in a great mood and happy I watched it. I feel that it was put in a difficult spot by being labeled a ""comedy"" movie because I feel it wasn't aiming to be the most humorous movie out there. I think it would have been better labeled to be a ""feel-good inspirational"" movie.<br/><br/>""Boom"" may not be your traditional comedy, but it was a fun ride none the less. Give it a chance, but don't expect to be rolling from laughter. View it as if it was an inspirational movie, and you'll see what I'm talking about."
"laserdiscguy","10","21","37","5 October 2012"," Chaster (Charice Fan) Review of the movie
","A Chasters Experience - from a Charice fan perspective<br/><br/>Before anything else, Be warned, Spoilers Ahead!<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Kevin James movie in the past. I've loved him it Hitch and my favorite was Mall cop. HE's the lovable chunky guy. The average guy we know that we all can relate too.. In this movie, Kevin James pretty much played it straight. HE had a lot of funny lines and scenes but he played it straight which was a good move because it made it seem funnier. The comedy was provided by mostly Bas Ruten and Henry Winkler. I give props to those two. Henry Winkler nearly stole the show. And Bas Ruten was an MMA Fighter turned analyst/commentator and he did a great job, you don't even realize he's not an actor. He was genuine and enjoyable. Kevin James did not play this role for laughs, he made his character believable. The fight scenes and moves were all believable. Having recognized some of the actual MMA fighters, there's even an inside joke that most movie viewers wont catch.( I.E> Chael Sonnen Tapping out lol)<br/><br/>Now let's get to Charice. Hold on to your horses as Charice appears close to the very first real scene of the movie.<br/><br/>WE all know by now that she plays Malia , a Filipino student. But I want to give props to Kevin James here for changing this role originally written for a Vietnamese student to being Filipino. I can see why it could be more believable as Vietnamese. But Having Charice play Malia,named after Kevin James real life Filipina wife is a tribute to Filipinos. Charice role is a source of pride for Pinoys. Her character is the embodiment of the Pinoy ideal of studious, talented, smart Filipino that Pinoys would want in their daughters. She's so smart, even her own biology teacher thinks she's smarter than HIM!<br/><br/>She plays a musical genius in the music room too, she can sing, she can play the piano. What else can we ask on how to portray a Filipino.<br/><br/>Now Charice has lots of scenes interspersed throughout the movie. Kevin James and Henry Winkler and Bas Ruten dominate the scenes as well as Salma Hayek. But other than those main characters, it seems Charice has the most important character and number of scenes. She gets to do most everything here. she sings, she plays an instrument, she gets to laugh ... and she even gets to cry ... a dramatic moment. Here she is in that pivotal scene<br/><br/>Now her acting here is so much improved and better than she did in glee. Charice appeared in 3 Glee episodes, roughly 3 hrs, and this movie is a little over half that time but it seems she appeared twice as long than all the Glee scenes combined! I can't see a detriment or anything to pick on , things that people picked up on glee. She held her own , even, in my opinion, during the most dramatic scene of the movie . If you didn't know Charice, you would not know she never acted before in a movie. Her character is very important to the plot and storyline. Kevin James is a teacher who used to be idealistic, involved and passionate of his work. Malia makes him realize that what he says and thinks affects these kids directly and he really does influence their hopes and dreams. It helps develop his growth and transformation and reignites his passion for teaching and caring.<br/><br/>*BIG SPOILER HERE* The most dramatic and important scene other than a scene at Henry Winkler's house with Kevin James, is a scene where Charice goes through major problem with her life and cries. She is asked to give up Music AND school which both are very important to her. Here she shows the difficulties an immigrant Filipino in having to learn a second language and how important music and studies are for her as a Filipino. Kevin James gets hit hard when he tries to help and encourage her to pursue her dreams when she reminds him he himself said, what they learned in school didn't matter. This is very pivotal, as Kevin James realizes he makes a big impact on this kids. that him not caring is no longer an option. This is where you believe his character has made the commitment and realization, he has to change and start caring.<br/><br/>Charice gets to appear in more scenes specially and the big finale fight in the UFC for Kevin James. Her singing Holy Holly gave me the chills , although I wished to have seen more of her instead of Kevin James (but this is about Kevin James after all ). One of the highlights of the film which I can't wait to buy the soundtrack for a full version of the song.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very enjoyable and uplifting movie. There's RomCom's (Romantic Comedy) so I would call this more of a Dramedy. There's drama with lots of comedy. I think this has a potential to be a sleeper hit and with being showing on OCT 12, it definitely has staying power to stick around till Thanksgiving weekend and even Christmas holidays. <br/><br/>Charice really did make Pinoys proud in this film. She showed Pinoys are studious and hard working, talented and smart, beautiful, caring and helpful. If pinoys can't be proud of her for that, I have no idea what will."

","I was rather ready to skip watching this one but what a disaster that would have been. <br/><br/>This movie has all sort of stuff. U name it and you have it. <br/><br/>Its inspirational and motivating to connect with a guy who is practical but follows emotion. His weakness and his uniqueness, clubbed with events around makes him do what he believes if right. <br/><br/>A highly recommended movie to be watched when you have a kind of low feeling all around.<br/><br/>An wonderful journey which should be enjoyed without prejudice and distraction."

","Here comes the boom is a film about a Teacher who wishes his school had more funding in which he decides to take up Boxing.... Hmm.... Yes, it's self explanatory. He's not very good. And it's very predictable. And because it's American, everything works out well... What a shock. However, I was cunningly surprised by the film. Overall it was quite good. Very aggressive, violent, made me jump back a few times and hilarious! There was some parts what kind of let the film down a little. The ending... Now I'm not one to spoil it so I'm not going to but for god sake.... This is like the symbol of American Boy Teen films. And it really did kind of ruin it...<br/><br/>I must say, the consumer's really did enjoy it. The cinema was loud, full of people laughing. It obviously isn't the best film I've seen; nor worse. It's probably just in between. Hmmm... I maybe would consider this to a boy about 13/14+ (I'm that age myself) However older people, I'd give it a miss... :/"

"LegenDairy","9","8","13","21 October 2012"," This one caught me by surprise.
","I'm a comedian...and I can tend to be a bit of a harsh critic on comedy. I went in expecting your average cutesy family comedy. I left feeling like I'd seen an effing good movie.<br/><br/>HCTB has a ton of heart...something that has been scarce in the 2000's. Somewhere along the line filmmakers have just quit giving a damn about making the audience feel something good. There tends to be a lot of generic laughs in comedies these days a la D*** and poop jokes. The situational laugh...the one where we can put ourselves in the characters shoes and understand what they are feeling are scarce.<br/><br/>Kevin James is believable in this an unhappy teacher inspired to help a fellow friend. Granted....we have to suspend reality in the sense that he could become a fighter...but if you have a hard time suspending reality when watching a film you may want to stick to video games.<br/><br/>Henry Winkler is great and his vulnerability really plays on the screen. You immediately wish you had this guy as a teacher in high school....He's super charming and has several great laughs.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a feel good movie definitely check it out."

","I have to admit, that I was more than surprised by this movie. I never thought I'd actually would think of it as funny. Or laugh a couple of times for that matter. While Salma Hayek has not much to do (other than look good and have a few other scenes), Kevin James does the heavy lifting (no pun intended). While he re-unites with his brother in this one (also known from the hit TV show), he actually feels like a real human being (his character that is).<br/><br/>There are some sub-stories that do not make that much sense, but other than that, the movie is clearly well edited and written (for its purpose that is). The underdog might take a few punches, but you do know where it is all leading. Still you can watch it and be entertained and that's all that matters (action does look good too, which is very important with a movie like this of course)"
"akrasian-500-47915","7","9","16","11 October 2012"," Broad crowd pleasing comedy
","I'm not a huge (or even a small) fan of Kevin James, but I was dragged to the Phoenix area premiere of this film tonight, and was surprised by it. It was definitely an enjoyable film, even if not a classic. It was funny, even if the filmmakers obviously went down the list one by one on how to make a crowd pleaser. Combine something culturally hot (MMA) with a comedy - check. Have the hero's brother's problems resolved quickly, while also solving another character's problems - check. Warm message glossed over quickly - check. Sudden setback easily resolved - check. Resolution provided by the hero remembering a telegraphed lesson from an unlikely character - check. Love interest going from hostile to very helpful - check.<br/><br/>Despite the formulaic nature, it features some funny (albeit broad) humor, and a nice performance from Henry Winkler. It's worth seeing."
"estebangonzalez10","5","7","12","31 January 2013"," Recycled inspirational comedy
","Â¨ If you're gonna lose, then I'm gonna help you lose. Deal? Â¨<br/><br/>Fans of any Kevin James (or Adam Sandler) comedy will get what they expected going into the movie: a lot of cheap laughs. It isn't a terrible movie, it just is clichÃ©, predictable, and full of the same jokes we've seen repeated over and over again in his other movies. Of course I didn't go into this film expecting it to be an artistic groundbreaking original movie, so I can't say I was disappointed. I knew what I was going in for and I did get what I expected. The truth of the matter is that I laughed through several scenes, but this was honestly a terrible and predictable movie. I would have been better off laughing at any other sitcom comedy on TV during that hour. Kevin James has played this sort of ordinary guy who turns out to be a hero in pretty much all his films, and he has his fan base so it seems to be working for him pretty good. The reality is that these movies are so forgettable some times that you even forget you've seen these same scenes play out over and over again in their previous films. You even have the typical gross out scenes involving throwing up and having food fights. Here Comes the Boom receives a zero in originality, but it does get points for cheap laughs now and then. If you're a fan of this light genre you will get your money's worth. Come next year you will watch the same movie again with the characters having different names and professions, but facing pretty much the same situations and telling the same jokes. You will share laughs for a couple of hours and then forget everything about it, but at least it takes your mind off things for a while.<br/><br/>Scott Voss (Kevin James), once a successful wrestler during his teens, is now a high school biology teacher who has seemed to have lost his purpose and vision in teaching over the past decade in the school. He is more of a slacker now and is constantly late for school. His glory days of the past when he was voted the best teacher of the school are long past him now. When the principal (Greg Germann) of the school announces that they are going to cut out extracurricular activities in the school to reduce the budget, he decides to speak up for music teacher, Marty Streb (Henry Winkler), who will be left out of a job if they can't come up with the 48,000 dollars that the music curriculum is costing the school. Scott and her colleague Bella (Salma Hayek) decide to help Marty out by coming up with ways for raising the money. Scott decides to prepare immigrants for the citizenship test in order to come up with some extra income. Here he meets a former MMA fighter from Holland named Niko (Bas Rutten) who introduces him to the MMA world. Scott realizes that if he can get into a professional fight he may win 10,000 dollars just by participating therefore he makes it his goal to become a mixed- martial arts fighter so he can raise enough money to save Streb's job.<br/><br/>Here Comes the Boom has a very ridiculous plot and unfortunately instead of going all the way with the satire they try to give it a Rocky like tone. It didn't really work for me and some of the actors were pretty bad. Henry Winkler was probably the funniest character in this film, while Bas Rutten tried too hard to be funny but some scenes really didn't work with him. I am not surprised I didn't like this film considering it was directed by the same guy who brought us Zookeeper, although I was a fan of his when he directed The Wedding Singer. I think he fails here by not going all the way with the satire considering how ridiculous the plot is. It will have success however with its intended audience, but I just wasn't the right target for it.

","My husband and I just watched this last night and we were blown away. We came in expecting a normal Happy Madison/Kevin James movie and were very pleasantly surprised at what a good message it had and also how well written it was. It was refreshing to have a good comedy without a million swearwords and naked women. Definitely a must-see!<br/><br/>The movies does have it's slap-stick comedy, as expected, but it was all very tasteful as it is PG. <br/><br/>It had a wonderful message regarding the school system and teachers and was a great film. I hope many teachers see this movie and become re- inspired.<br/><br/>The movie is yes a little far fetched, but it also realistic in so many ways and the ending is perhaps one of the best that we have sen in years."

","Excellent film, I highly recommend going to see it. All of the actors were hysterical!!!!! The fight scenes were excellent too, really good movie. Safe to see with the kids, but perfect for just grow ups too. With a cast like this you knew it was going to be good, but I didn't realize just how good! Sandler is a genius. I'm already hoping for a part two!!!! Def worth a trip to the movies, might even go back for a second time. God knows it's been a while since I've seen a movie this good! Have you ever come to a point in a comedy where it's a quiet storyline part, but you think back to the last funny part and start laughing out loud inappropriately? Lol well this is that kind of movie. Don't listen to negative reviews, see for yourself, it's a RIOT!"

","In the Boston area, biology teacher Scott Voss (Kevin James) is a few minutes late to school. The principal (Greg Germain) gives him bus duty and docks him a vacation day, too. This hurts. Scott makes his way over to his friend and colleague Marty's (Henry Winkler) music class to plead with his pal to do the bus work. That's because there is a VERY important staff meeting that afternoon. Marty agrees. Later on, when classes are finished, the news at the get-together is anything but good. Finances are in bad shape and the school is dropping all extras, including music. Now, since Scott has just learned that Marty's wife is pregnant at 48 and the loss of Marty's job would be crucial, Scott announces that he will make the $50,000 needed to keep his friend's job. Okay, but how? Teaching night school won't do it, even though Scott enjoys helping the immigrants studying for their tests. But, amazingly, one of his pupils, Niko, informs Mr. Voss that even the lower levels of mixed-martial arts fighting give paychecks of hundreds and thousands of dollars. A lightbulb goes off, because Scott wrestled in college. THIS is how he will raise the dough, even if he loses every fight. Maybe, too, then beautiful school nurse, Bella (Salma Hayek) will accept his many, many invitations for a date. Most all think Mr. Voss is nuts, but he starts training. At his first fight, Scott wears Viking gear and plays a pounding song, Here Comes the Boom. Only Scott gets pounded into the ground but good. However, with $750 in his hand, Scott vows to continue. Soon, he is losing by a slim margin, then gains some victories. Will Mr. Voss make enough money for Marty? Also, will he become a better teacher in the process? That is, before broken noses and bones set in! We will see. This funny film makes good on a statement that Boom beats Gloom. James is becoming a national resource of tremendous value and he can make any role worthwhile. What a fine comic touch he has and what a pleasure to watch him. Hayek is extremely likable, too, as is Winkler. The rest of the cast is also just great, although some members are not well known. The Boston setting is good while the costumes, amenities, script and deft direction give viewers a really nice film, worthy of the ticket prices. So, ditch your doom and gloom but good. Run to buy a seat for a swell time at the movies."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie it didn't really stand out as a movie I had to see in theaters. I ended up going to see it with some friends, that convinced me, and I was shocked. A movie that to me had what seemed to be a silly plot actually turned out to be pretty good. Yes it does seem silly that a almost 40 year old teacher, who wrestled in high school, would join MMA fighting to save a school program. Honestly Kevin James pulled this movie off. It was a action filled comedy that hit you emotionally in some spots. I'll just say that this movie was good and I am glad I chose to go with to see it. Plus it was pretty fun to see Kevin getting in a ring."

Bas was awesome; Kevin James- a total teddy bear; Salma- still a cutie! -Henry Winkler was hilarious and perfect for the role- he may've stole this whole movie.<br/><br/>This was heartwarming and my daughter & I loved it! It's not an MMA/UFC documentary- it's a Happy Madison, film!

","I can't count the number of times we've seen this type of movie. It's just another rehashed story about a loser guy who decides to stop being a loser and try and kick someones butt because suddenly he gives a crap. If you want to see the same movie without paying the price of an admission ticket, go watch Joe Somebody with Tim Allen. It's basically the same thing and with some of the same actors to go with it, that play the same characters. Oh well, it's a shame we haven't been able to see Kevin James full potential on the silver screen yet. Maybe he's best suited for a secondary character role, that way he can be given more opportunities to be funny and not have to worry about being a likable character. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong but whatever he's been doing so far has been wrong too. He's played the same character in all his films so far, maybe that's the problem. Who knows. Screw it.

","Kevin James stars as Scott Voss, a high school biology teacher who's gradually lost his passion for education. But when budget cutbacks threaten to cancel the school's music program and lay off its teacher (Henry Winkler), Scott volunteers to raise money to save his job. Teaching night classes at the local community college doesn't pay nearly enough, however, so Scott enlists the help of one of his students to train him to become a mixed martial arts fighter after he learns you can make good money even by losing. Though the school principal believes that Scott is making an embarrassment of himself by getting beat up, he quickly earns the respect of his students and the faculty while unexpectedly rising within the MMA ranks. Here Comes the Boom doesn't provide many laughs and is too predictable for one's liking. The film extends and doesn't provide much twists, turns or anything much of greatness."

","Just seen this film over the weekend and must say what a great little movie. Although the mixture of MMA fighting in what is basically a family movie may be slightly off putting to some , however going with younger teenagers would be a bonus. It is a movie that the whole family can really enjoy (but equally works if you watched it with a bunch of mates few beers and a pizza), its hard to describe , i guess it was like a family movie from an adult perspective. Entertaining throughout, I actually laughed out loud several times (once so hard and you'll know which bit if you see it, i surprised myself) , it was surprisingly uplifting , tender, exciting in parts. Really great to see Henry Winkler , Kevin James gives a believable and charming performance and there are some notable moments from the rest of the cast. I would echo what other forum posters are saying , ten times better than what i thought it would be , Kevin James should be proud of this great little movie, go and see it or hire it out at home, one of the most enjoyable movies of the year."

No Boston accent, but who cares?

"akp0583","6","4","6","19 November 2012"," A comedy movie without a lot of comedy.
","Here Comes the Boom <br/><br/>Starring: Kevin James, Salma Heyek and Henry Winkler<br/><br/>Synopsis: When budget cuts threaten the music class and music teacher (Henry Winkler), Scott (Kevin James) a lazy biology teacher at the same school decides to help out by trying to raise the money by fighting in mixed-martial arts cage matches for the prize money. <br/><br/>Review: The film opens with under-achieving biology teacher Scott hardly finding the energy to make it to the school on time let alone to teach and inspire his students. When budget cuts threaten the extra-curricular music department and the last inspirational teacher Marty, Scott although with ulterior motives showing off to school nurse Bella (Salma Heyek) he stands up for Marty and soon realizes he's the only one willing to help. This movie is advertised as a comedy however you'll struggle to laugh more than a hand full of times through the duration. I found it constantly struggling with what style of comedy it was aiming for with some gross-out humor and then some subtle humorous moments. Kevin does take to the fighting scenes very well and I believe him to have lost weight and bulk up during the film as the story lines plays out. <br/><br/>As Scott settles in with training and the occasional victory in the ring he also learns to become a better teacher in the process and quickly becomes favored by the students. It's a very predictable movie seen hundreds of times before but a strength this film has is that the fights are not predictable and are played out incredibly well. Henry Winkler gets a lot of laughs playing a mild mannered music teacher, whose eyes are opened when introduced to the world of mixed-marital arts. Many of the laughs do come from Niko a fun loving Dutch MMA and gym instructor however and unfortunately written with a lot of stereotype. The next 'Rocky' movie it won't be however an enjoyable movie that will keep you entertained throughout. <br/><br/>Watch this if you liked: King of Queens, Zookeeper or Grown-ups.<br/><br/>Verdict: Enjoyable movie with great fight sequences shame the comedy is not polished and the story is predictable."

Meheux is the cinematographer behind one of the best James Bond movies out there GoldenEye 1995.<br/><br/>Kevin James was a star as usual in this movie, somehow you just get to love him, but everyone else just strolls by, except Henry Winkler (Fonzie as he is popular known that is if you are familiar with the 1970s American sitcom Happy Days.)

"poyrazbaklan","4","7","13","13 February 2013"," incredibly average
","First of all, when you hear Kevin James, the lovably clumsy chubby guy, doing an mma movie, you no doubt will have doubts. It sure is a comedy but how will he pull it off? Will it be about him going in the cage and doing slapstick routines or maybe the movie will fit the fight scenes in a montage and focus on the comedic parts. Apparently it's not, James sure pulls it off and although it is kind of unbelievable to see him do roundhouse kicks, the fight scenes are decent to watch. Yet, the rest of the movie..just...isn't. This has been done before, in the perfectly average nacho libre, which in turn was inspired by the true story of Fray Tormenta. People are wrong about complaining how the jokes in this movie aren't funny, because there are hardly any jokes at all. It is rather set up as an inspiring movie, just short of drama, with some scenes of james falling down or getting punched, just to make it more comedic. Other than the ""teacher needs money for school so he fights"" setting, there is no story to speak of. I think the producers just thought about putting Fonzi, Kevin james and mma fighters in a room and waited for hilarity to ensue, and it just didn't happen. Though henry winkler is a little over the top with his devoted music teacher attitude and including Bas rutten is also a nice touch, the rest of the movie is in shambles. It is not bad, it just isn't a comedy, or simply not good enough."

","If you see the trailer it's very obvious and predictable how it's going to all play out. It's a decent movie but if the build up was a bit better and had more inspiring and bonding elements going for it. The finale would have stood out more. The story is about a high school teacher named Scott Voss played by Kevin James. Who usually gets these likable character that has a good heart. In this he is basically a lazy nice guy practically. And when the school is having budget cuts and laying off good teachers. He decides to find a way to raise the money and to impress another teacher that he has the hots for. And to raise the money he decides to fight in MMA tournaments. So it goes in a predictable direction of him training, getting better at what he does, building a reputation and inspiring his students. Now this is a fast paced movie and the development isn't done all that well to the point it leaves a big impact at the end. Bas Rutten is also in this as Voss's trainer and he is great in this.<br/><br/>5/10"

This movie is so exciting with everything going on in it, the music, the kids, the cage fighting, the endearing reason he was fighting to raise money. I loved the excitement of the fighting and the hilarious comedy by all the actors. This movie seems to have it all, the emotion is high, the laughter is great, and the fighting is exciting! There is so much going on in this movie for everyone. Its a great movie for children, I don't remember hearing one swear word throughout the whole movie. Kevin is very believable in this movie, as all his movies. But this one for me tops all of his other terrific movies. The idea of a high school teacher going cage fighter was hard to believe. But his background explains how he could possibly do this. And if you think about it, all it really takes to win one of these things could be a lucky punch. Great job Mr. Kevin James, and to all your supporting cast members. I love, love, loved this movie and will put it in my movie library at home. Waiting anxiously for another one like this.

Henry Winkler was wonderful â€“ as was Salma Hayek and everyone else in this film, for that matter. In spite of the fact that, in a row ahead of me there was the unwelcome distraction of a half dozen empty-headed teenage girl who evidently didn't think they could live for an hour or so without their cell phones lit up like miner's lamps...until I shut them down with some choice words...the movie was one that got us caught up and kept us there until the very end. A good film for the whole family â€“ finally. So many of these pictures leave a lot to be desired in that respect but this one didn't fail us. I'm not even a fight fan, but I was right in there for the fight scenes feeling each and every punch. By the end of the movie the audience (even the previously mention girls might have forgotten to fire up their phones for a few minutes, had I not already encouraged them in that direction) was totally engaged in the action.

","I suppose my expectations for this film could be described as mediocre. I hadn't heard too much about it and the trailers looked okay. I began to hear some feedback that was somewhere between ""awful"" and ""yah it was okay."" So to say that Here Comes The Boom exceeded my expectations is a sincere understatement. This movie was fantastic! Yes it was cookie cutter, it was the stereotypical, near predictable sports hero Rocky underdog type movie. That doesn't make it bad at all. I love a lot of those types of movies. They still have to make it interesting with good characters and they do that and beyond. It was just so nice to sit and watch a movie that was a little bit of comedy, a little bit of romance, drama and quite a bit of action. It was also nice to watch something that turned out to be clean family fun!! It does have some pretty violent fight scenes so certainly viewer discretion is advised but no nasty toilet humour, sex talk, bad language or anything like that. It was believable and sweet and the cast were all so good together. The chemistry was just about perfect.<br/><br/>I like Kevin James, not love him but like him a lot. He definitely has some genuine lovable qualities and he proves in this movie that he can carry a movie effortlessly. This isn't his usual silly slapstick comedy and he really puts forth a great effort and actually is very believable as a 42 Year old fat biology teacher that trains to be a UFC fighter. He makes you root for him!! Henry Winkler who is always amazing (and looks incredible for his age by the way!) is absolutely perfect as the music teacher whose job is on the line. Winkler and James are wonderful together and will bring tears to your eyes more than once. Winkler balances drama and comedy like a seasoned professional which he is. Salma Hayek was, in my opinion, a bit of an odd choice for the romantic lead. She is okay and her and James are okay together but the movie is so good and I feel like a better female lead might have made this all the more together. Out of everything I didn't buy their romance and didn't feel invested in it. Bas Rutten was simply fantastic. He was a scene stealer and was just so terrific in his role. He was hilariously funny and yet really great in the more dramatic scenes. They couldn't have found anyone better for this role. Plus him and James were simply awesome together. The supporting cast were all great with honourable mention to Shelly Desai in an adorably sweet role that will have you laughing and then crying, and Charice as a student of James' that is his support system in his classroom.<br/><br/>It didn't surprise me when I saw director Frank Coraci helmed this film. He also directed the absolutely amazing ""Click"" which is probably one of the greatest comedic-dramas I've ever seen. He knows a good script, cast and story and just knows how to bring out the best in each and every scene. This film will get the typical complaints about it because people hate to just let themselves enjoy something and be uplifted. Yes you have seen this before or at least something similar but that doesn't make it less enjoyable! It is a genre in and of itself, the ""underdog"" sports movie and this one does it extremely well. Sit down with the family and laugh and smile and cry because this movie will make you do all of the above. Loved it! 9/10"

","""Here Comes The Boom"" Is A Movie That Is Truly Terrible Without A Single Redeeming Quality. The Plot Simplistic And Utterly Moronic. Kevin James Plays A Teacher Who Becomes An MMA Fighter To Raise Money For The School In Which He Teaches. This Movie Is So Completely Dumb That Watching It Will Result In The Death Of Several Brain Cells. Salma Hayek Is Also In The Movie, Being Completely Above The Material. ""Here Comes The Boom"" Is Filled To The Brim With Mindless Physical Comedy. The Promos For The Movie Feature The Black Eyed Peas' ""Boom Boom Pow"", A Mind-Numbing Song That Represents America's Increasingly Vapid Culture. ""Here Comes The Boom"" Is Marketed As A Family Film, But I Could Never Recommend This Movie To Anyone. I Absolutely Hate ""Here Comes The Boom""."
"tavm","7","5","10","25 October 2012"," Kevin James' Here Comes the Boom is a pretty good dramady
","Just saw this Kevin James comedy with my movie theatre-working friend. Mr. James usually does lots of slapstick stunts in his movies and he does a few here too but he's actually a bit more subdued as well as his role is that of a high school biology teacher who's trying to raise lots of money to save a fellow instructor's job-that of Henry Winkler's music teacher. Seeing The former Fonz-30 years after ""Happy Days""-playing such a different role wasn't so surprising to me as I remember when he played a version of Scrooge named Benedict Slade in ""An American Christmas Carol"" so long ago on TV. Anyway, like I said, the only time James does some stunts is when he's in the ring fighting to raise the necessary funds for his friend. So while this was not a non-stop hilarious movie, it still had some good amusing moments here and there. Another good turn came from the Filipino singer Charice as a student of his who, yes, does a number near the end. And Salma Hayek is okay as James' love interest. So on that note, Here Comes the Boom gets a recommendation from me."

","I have never had the urge to write a review. But this stupid fkng movie pushed me to my limits. There is nothing positive to say about this ""movie"". I just finished wasting approx. an hour and forty minutes of my life, I am frustrated and completely annoyed. I felt brain cells withering away with each passing minute. I was literally talking to myself and asking myself ""why this was happening"". ""Why this movie even existed"" and how much hatred i was building up inside me towards the familiar faces involved in this pile of steamy pig feces on a hot sunny day. Kevin James, Adam Sandler and the rest of that lot need to just stop. We get it....<br/><br/>This movie is an insult to the sport of MMA and its athletes. It is an insult to your intelligence and the genre of COMEDY. This steamy pile of clichÃ© ridden clichÃ©s wrapped in crispy clichÃ© strips and dipped in clichÃ© sauce was supposed to be a comedy i believe, (not quite sure to be honest) because of how irritated i am just having suffered through this. It was so cringe-worthy that i am genuinely embarrassed for some of the faces that make random pointless appearances that i normally have some respect for. If you are a fan of MMA, Stay the hell away from this mind numbing, torture chamber disguised as a movie. <br/><br/>Am i being melodramatic enough for you? Good. For your own sake, stay away from this, especially if you are looking for a feel good ""comedy"", or are a fan of the sport as I've stated over and over again. Im just ranting at this point but it is well deserved. I had to release some of my frustrations somehow. I hope my review will save at least one person from suffering a concussion by sitting through this god-awful unfunny movie. Kevin James is just embarrassing himself at this point (similar to his buddy Sandler). These guys put out sh** movie after sh** movie and they only seem to be getting worse with each one. Luckily for me, I was never a fan of either.<br/><br/>Let me end off by stating that I in no way paid a dime to waste my hour and forty minutes. I downloaded it and felt guilty for the bandwidth I used for this sh**. I am convinced all the 10 star reviews are given by hired goons working for the studios themselves. I want to give the majority of our species more credit than this. I really do. -End rant."

"neil-476","8","3","5","16 November 2012"," Much better than I expected
","Forty-something overweight slacker teacher Scott (Kevin James) is upset to learn that, because of budget cuts, the music programme at his school is to close and music teacher Marty (Henry Winkler) will lose his job just as his wife has become pregnant at 48. So, after a couple of false starts, Scott buckles down to generate the $48,000 necessary to keep the music department going - by cage fighting, where you get paid even if you lose.<br/><br/>From the films I have seen Kevin James in, I don't rate him - I have always found him a functional actor: he wears the costume and says the lines, but brings nothing else of any significance to his roles. So I was not expecting anything very much from this movie, especially given the ridiculous plot.<br/><br/>And yet I really enjoyed it. Kevin James brings a niceness to Scott - for all the lack of motivation in his work at the start of the film, the determination he shows to help Marty keep his job carries through into his work, and he both finds himself and also connects with his students (not to mention with fellow teacher Salma Hayek, who rejects his constant advances more or less throughout the film). After a dodgy start, there are a couple of laugh out loud moments (not particularly tasteful, admittedly) and a lot of smiling nearly all the way through. Winkler and Hayek have great fun, there is excellent support from Gregg Germann, Charice, and Bas Rutten, and James does a good job of holding the whole thing together.<br/><br/>If you fancy a feelgood comedy based on Rocky crossed with The Blackboard Jungle, you could do worse than this.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I don't know whether the title means something in the USA, but it means nothing in England."
"ryansassy1","7","3","5","4 November 2012"," For those days when a little inspiration is all you need!
","I am going to whisper a little secret that could destroy my cred on IMDb. Promise not to tell? Okay, here it is: I don't like Rocky all that much. There, I said it. Skewer my review with negative votes later, after you've heard me out.<br/><br/>Not being the usual target audience for standard boxing films, it therefore came as a surprise to me that I liked HCTB as much as I did. Kevin James was previously unknown to me (I never saw even one episode of King of Queens), and the Fonz used to irritate me back in the day when Happy Days was on the air. So in short, I have no idea why I wanted to see this movie in the first place, but I'm glad that I did. <br/><br/>Here are my three theories why I could get past myself to buy into this story:<br/><br/>1. Kevin James turned out to be a smart writer, a sympathetic actor, and really very funny; 2. Henry Winkler as it happens, has an impressive acting range -- and he's also really funny; 3. Bas Rutten -- downright hilarious! Who knew?<br/><br/>These three unlikely heroes transformed the familiar Boxing Movie Formula into something with tremendous heart. (You know the formula: underdog aspires to be a great fighter, overcomes huge odds, eventually makes it into the ring to face his arch nemesis).What made middle-aged Kevin James aka Scott Voss believable as the disillusioned high school teacher turned pro MMA fighter, is a combination of the film's unflinching look at how brutally he was defeated time and again, but also a kind of optimism that sneaks up on you--yes he's old and out of shape at the start, but he learns a lot along the journey, and he has a growing passion for his righteous cause. You will be rooting for him and his cohorts in no time.<br/><br/>So don't pay attention to that little voice inside that says you're not the type to see this film, or to the film critics that can't get over themselves because this movie isn't complicated enough or depressing enough to be winning any Oscars: HCTB is inspiring enough, and that's the hallmark of a winner to my way of thinking."

Someone should had mentioned to the co-writer and star Kevin James that MMA is regarded as being even more brutal than boxing.<br/><br/>It is an amiable and sporadically amusing movie. James is likable with his heart in the right place who steps up to save Winkler's job. There is a side plot where he romances Salma Hayek (we live in a universe where Hayek is single, lonely and available!)<br/><br/>The plot is simple, the fights are brutal where Voss should be left paralysed, especially with the last fighter Ken Dietrich the performer playing him (a real life MMA star) is magnificent.<br/><br/>The disappointing box office showed that this was only a half developed idea."

Many of the jokes you've heard in various forms in other D grade comedies. The plus side is that it actually is a heartwarming story, it's too bad the actual comedic execution falls so short save for a few jokes.

I am a HUGE Kevin James fan (thought I don't know if he has made GOOD choices since ""Hitch"" {still riding the ""King of Queens"" train maybe} & sorry Kev - I DO SERIOUSLY think you're hilarious, I found this movie extremely juvenile at best (not exactly a slight to Adam Sandler because I am a fan and do feel he has potential but hasn't yet reached it - & possibly hasn't tried - obviously this isn't a forte) Here is my take. Kevin had some moments - though they are few and far between. Trying to go again for a quasi-sentimental story line should be OK since we're in America this is ""tried & true"" but frankly failed miserably this time) I know this shows my age but I did enjoy the ""tip of the hat"" (though now not sure if intentional) to Henry Winkler's character in ""The One And Only"" and Niko's learning through music like Anson Williams in ""Happy Days"" (ie ""Pumps The Blood""). The rest? Kinda repetitive and ""used"". I would like to see Adam graduate to something ""semi"" adult and see how it goes.

Kevin James puts a fantastically lovable quality into this character but it's hard to believe someone in his physical shape could ever fight MMA and walk out of the ring without broken bones or at least a body completely covered with bruises.

","Mindset before movie: I watched this on an air-plane returning from a 1 week vacation in Mexico. I've been fighting airport security, line-ups and the Mexican language barrier for 6 hours so I was very tired and unamused. My thought was that though my respect for Kevin James as an actor was hanging by a thread I felt I could use a laugh, whether it was laughing with or laughing at, I didn't care. It was the only comedy on the flight's selection, and it was free, so losses would be painless. Expectations were low.<br/><br/>Mindset after movie: Still tired and slightly disoriented but mind-blown. The respect for Kevin James is now hanging by a rope. You can tell he worked hard for this movie. It had very little of that cartoonish, off-the-wall, slapstick that I have grown to expect out of Kevin James casted movies. There's something at work behind that awkward plump figure of a man. Henry Winkler, hitting the role of a seemingly complex comical character on the head; I feel we need to see this man in more movies. Other notable performances include the big guy with the accent, Bas Rutten. This guy was awesome, sharp, funny and it didn't seem like he was one of those sports figure heads doing his best to do what the director says. The other was Gary Valentine who apparently only plays Kevin James' sibling. It blew my mind to find out they aren't related.<br/><br/>When the credits started rolling I felt the same way I did at the end of ""School of Rock"". I felt warm and fuzzy and damn proud to be such a devoted music fan. If you're like me and don't like Kevin James or anything Happy Madison has put out in the last 10 years (excluding ""Grown-Ups"" and ""Hotel Transylvania"") I still think you should give this movie a shot. It's fun for the whole family over the age of 8. And if there is any scrap of a UFC fighter in you, he/she will be somewhat satisfied as well."

","So is, 'Here Comes the Boom', the best movie I have ever seen â€“ nope, I can't say it is. I will say that this was even far from the worse I have seen as well. The writing was a little disjointed in the beginning and maybe the character development was a bit slow. The cast was very good. Selma Hayek is always a hoot to watch, I mean she is a breathtakingly beautiful woman who can also be very funny. As always, Henry Winkler did not disappoint, his performance as a music teachers with a very loose grip on reality was an excellent interpretation. Bravo to Kevin James, not only was he enjoyably funny but he lost some serious pounds to play this part. No longer will I look at him and see, 'Mall Cop' (although â€“ I won't be looking at him and saying UFC champ either or consummate science teacher.) Just from watching the trailers one knew this was going to be the underdog movie of the year (well maybe the month or the week.) I always enjoy stories about the downtrodden rebounding from the bowels of impending defeat and winning the day at the very last moment. Oh, and I will tell you,, 'Here Comes the Boom', did not let me down. Basically (a word I hate to begin with), the movie begins with a group of displaced townies and misfit teachers, each members with their own story, each of these folk are suffering some kind of distress and all aimless wandering around Hooterville Mass. â€“ wanting and needing something. What do they need â€“ what do they need? Well duhhhÂ…the Hootervillians all are looking for a hero and the obvious choice is the loser biology teacher. I should stop right there since I do not wish spoil it for everyone. I will say that this truly sad excuse for a town had absolutely no direction and really needed a hero. This is where Mr. Kevin James and his team step it up and saves the day. I thought the movie was well worth the time and the, 'Red Box' fee, and, for me, it was worthy of quite a few laughs."

I would download it when its out on iTunes to show it to the friends who were stupid enough not to see it on the big screen. Kevin, Henry and Salma really blended together that made you believe that they were actually happy to come to work everyday.

Ignoring its own predictability then, the film instead strives to amuse, and while it's far from mature or intelligent, the intended viewers of the movie will be thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>James is an eager front man and the supporting cast, though an eccentric mix, often garner the best response.

I think this movie will rid stereotypes associated with the great new sport of MMA. I was surprised at how the stupid humor was still funny and if you watch Inside MMA then you would see that Bas is right at home clowning around. Selma is always a treat for the eyes and while she played the old fashioned girl with principles she was a gentle distraction from the main storyline.

"Ed-Shullivan","8","1","2","11 February 2014"," A Disney clone with a lot more punch and non stop humour
","Wow, what a nice surprise this film was. Instead of watching another boring TV rerun, we decided to pop in the Blu Ray version of Here Comes the Boom and the missus and I ended up pleasantly surprised at just how good this movie was. The film stars the trimmed down King of Queens TV Star, Kevin James, as a despondent high school Biology teacher named Scott Voss with 10 years of service behind him. I am going to assume that Kevin James spent a considerable amount of time training in a gym to get down to the weight he did and to reduce so much of his body fat in preparation for the amount of time he would spend in the Octagon during the many fight sequences that appeared in the film. A special note for parents of young children, the violence is limited to a few ""biff, boom, bangs"" sort of in the realm you would witness in the World Wrestling on television, so not to worry, I would allow a child to watch this film. <br/><br/>Supporting Kevin James is actress Salma Hayek who plays Bella Flores, the school nurse, as Scott Voss's tough to win over love interest. Scott's continued and failed pursuit of Bella makes everyone want him to win her over at some time, somehow. The ""somehow"" comes in to play when the mean school principal, Principal Betcher, played by Greg Germann who is probably best known for his womanizing role in the 1997 TV series Ally McBeal, announces he has to cut from the school budget the entire music program. This is why I felt Here Comes the Boom has that Disney style look and feel theme, but with a lot more ""oomph"" to appeal to a mature audience. The film contains a romantic theme, with some great music similar to GLEE productions dispersed throughout the film, an underdog hero, namely despondent Biology school teacher Scott Voss, who uncharacteristically steps up in defense of the music teacher who is about to lose his job. The music teacher, Marty Streb, played to perfection by Henry Winkler, adds some comic relief as the victim in the film and he agrees to support Scott Voss as his corner man in the Octagon. <br/><br/>Scott announces that he will attempt to raise the $48,000.00 needed to save the music program, and Marty Streb's job. Unfortunately for Scott he does not have a game plan as to how he will actually raise the needed funding to save the school's music program, and more importantly, Marty Streb's job. Scott then realizes that the lovely Bella is impressed with his willingness to TRY, so Scott figures out with the assistance of one of his night school students, a retired mixed martial experts fighter named Niko, played exceptionally well by former MMA fighter Bas Rutten, that he could possibly WIN the money through MMA prize fights just by losing a bunch of fights in the Octagon. <br/><br/>Again, in true Disney style, (although this is not a Disney production), the comedy that ensues is priceless. I must say I did a lot of belly laughing throughout the film. There are far too many good and truly funny scenes in this film, to point out. I gave it an 8 out of 10 rating, and I would be very surprised if Kevin James does not make a sequel with the same cast. This is well worth a watch for all ages."

","People are way too quick to bash this film and Kevin James. Yes, Paul Blart and Zookeeper were ridiculous, but enjoyable. This one however, is an actual MOVIE. I'm a huge King of Queens fan and always like James in whatever he's in, even if it is corny. But the corniness was left out of this one. Anyone who disagrees is clearly not watching this film with an open mind. The humor is not super goofy/silly, it's more natural and realistic. His character, unlike in his last 2 movies, is a normal guy who actually has some self confidence. He's a lovable, believable character in a movie that one critic quite accurately described as ""School of Rock meets Rocky"". It's about redemption, pride, ethics, perseverance and just taking one for the team. The Dutch guy who trains him is great. Funny as hell, love to see him in something else. The Philippina girl was perfect in her role and of course The Fonz came through as always. The incorporation of music made the movie. All done with a PG rating too. That's tough. Can't wait to see more of James, looking forward to Grown-Ups 2"

","Admittedly, I fell for it. I actually had a great time during Here Comes the Boom. And all the way to the predictable sports ending.<br/><br/>This movie screams the stereotypical ""Based on/Inspired by/Is a"" true sports underdog story, but I looked it up. Yes! I did research. It's not. Sorry, spoiler.<br/><br/>But, I didn't look that up until after the movie was over. And that's too bad, because all the way through this, I was finding this very clichÃ©, predictable and has an enormously weak premise if this happened in real life.<br/><br/>That all said, it's still a very clichÃ©, predictable and has an enormously weak premise and even thenÂ…I had a good time. The humor made me laugh out loud at moments, the heart was there and best of all, Kevin James ran around without a shirt on for a good sixth of the movie. Bonus!, but I understand irrelevant.<br/><br/>Terrible teacher, Scott (James,) with a minute, though growing, amount of a heart takes on the self-imposed task of raising $48,000 to save both his peer and music teacher's job and the entire school's music department. After a series of failed money attempts, Scott meets the right folks to align him with the cash from mixed-martial art fighting. Will Scott raise enough? Will he die trying since this is MMA and he's an overweight, out-of-shape, inexperienced, late-forties dude? Will he get the girl?<br/><br/>Seriously? I don't like spoiling major plot points, and I won't start here since you can draw your own conclusions. And yetÂ… AND YETÂ…<br/><br/>I still had a great time. I went along for the ride and in rare form for me and my reviews, I ditched the critic side. Perhaps it was because the characters had charisma, or because the comedy did make me laugh, or the energy from the cast and their respective fictional characters had me pumped. Maybe it was the Vegas shots I wasn't expecting. I dunno. I just had fun.<br/><br/>And that inevitable finale, with the funny homage to the movie this might be slightly imitating, had me sitting up and cheering. I even loved so much the following line by the Henry Winkler character I grew to love:<br/><br/>""You've already done it. To hell with my job. Look up there, look at those kidsÂ…Let me tell you what you would see. You would see a bunch of our students witnessing complete resolve in the face of an unbearable obstacle. They are invested. Scott, they're inspired. That's what we're supposed to do as teachers, right? Inspire. You can quit right now and everything that we've worked will have been accomplished. You know, last night, Molie said to me on the phone that you thought I was your hero. You're mine."" â€“ Marty.<br/><br/>I know this movie, on the surface, may appear like cheese. And it's certainly one I would normally chew up and spit outÂ…But, on a rare occasion, they got to me and they won. I had fun and would recommend this movie."

This is a movie with action, humor, romance, and all without the harsh words, but it has several fun surprises and twists. Great Family movie. The UFC challenge was choreographed very well and may be more than little ones(under 6 years) can handle. If you are UFC or wrestling fans, give this movie an honest try. We are NOT fans and we enjoyed it immensely. We'll be adding it to our home library."

","I normally don't watch too many comedies because they usually don't turn out being very good. When I saw this movie had Kevin James in it, I instantly thought of Mall Cob and thought no thank you. However, I decided to take a gamble and let the movie speak for itself. I was glad I did. <br/><br/>While a comedy will probably never be as well received as a really good drama or action in my opinion, this one was a really good feel good comedy that was actually truly funny for a majority of the time. It had a great storyline, great action (for a comedy), and pretty good acting in my opinion. <br/><br/>I probably would not rewatch this movie on my own accord, but if the opportunity arises to see it again I wouldn't turn it down. Great movie for families with kids, Kevin James fans, or a movie to just unwind and have a laugh."

So I didn't watch it in theaters. Though I get free movie tickets. I avoided renting it and would rent Wrong Turn 4 and feel as if I made the right choice. But finally I broke down and rented it. I mean I was baking drum sticks and that takes an hour, so if anything I had a good movie I could half pay attention to and then eat some good food before I put a real movie in (ironically my ""good movie"" is the latest installment of lake placid).<br/><br/>What I found was I would be burning my drumsticks. Kevin James actually made a movie worth the watch. Not just something to confusing and let down movie goers (i.e. Paul Blart Mall Cop, which is not observe and report). <br/><br/>Half of an hour in, when I should of been turning my drumsticks I was in love with the characters, and curious about their futures.

"jaxbubba","6","1","2","13 January 2013"," An enjoyable, but totally ridiculous film.
","Being a former educator, I am kind of a sucker for movies where teacher's defy the odds and do great things for the betterment of their students. Though this film is no ""Stand and Deliver"" or ""Lean on Me"", I have to admit that I did get a little choked up at the film's climax as Kevin James (Scott Voss) is entering the arena while the students (and the music department) are playing his theme songÂ… First and foremost I have to preface this review with the statement that the premise of this film is totally ridiculous, and that the Scott Voss (Kevin James) character would have been brutalized in the film's climax if this were real life. That said, I still enjoyed this film.<br/><br/>Kevin James stars is this film as Scott Voss, a once inspired teacher who has been beaten down by all the bureaucracy of the education system. When Marty Streb's (played wonderfully by Henry Winkler) position as music director is put on the chopping block due to school budget cuts, Voss (James) steps up to help his friend raise the $48,000 needed to keep Streb's job. While teaching a US citizenship course, Voss meets up with a former MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighter / gym instructor Niko (played by Bas Rutten). Voss soon realizes there is big money to be made in the MMA octagon (even by losing), and coerces Niko to train him in exchange for private citizenship tutoring secessions. Bas Rutten (Niko), a three-time UFC Champion / Dutch MMA fighter / Karate and Taekwondo blackbelt, is the film's true gem; a very likable character, and the film's most delightful personality on screen.<br/><br/>Again the premise of this film is absolutely ludicrous; however, keeping it within the realm of the 'losing aspect' you can deem it somewhat plausible. As the film progresses, Voss starts to gain the respect of his students and his zest for teaching is reignited. As the Voss character continues to grow in popularity, the 'teacher turned fighter' gains some national attention (much like Rocky), and Voss is offered $10K to fight an undercard battle against real life Polish MMA fighter turned actor/stuntman, Krzysztof Soszynski.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a really nice enjoyable, light-hearted film with a highly improbable outcome, then this is the film for you. I actually believe the 'Red Dawn' premise of North Korean's landing in Spokane, Washington may probably be more likely to happen; I did find this film mildly amusing and delightfully pleasing. So I am recommending this comical farce on its uplifting theme; and not its preposterous likelihood of occurring. Therefore check your minds at the doors prior to renting this tale of good intentions; then sit back, relax, and enjoy the comical genius of Kevin James.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel"""

","I never truly was a fan of Kevin James, back when he was the ""King of Queens"", but ever since he synched up with Sandler, he's been doing some fun movies. My favorite of all he's done, was ""Paul Blart"". But here, James isn't such a fun character. He's got heart and determination to save his school's extra-curriculars, and that's good, but he's kind of crotchety and grumpy. Yes, he's know for jokes like pratfalls and screaming at people for laughs, but... unfortunately there wern't many in this movie. I appreciate the effort he put into this movie, because there was a lot of work he had to do for this role, but it just didn't work out. If you're a fan of MMA, and like your comedy light, this might be the movie for you. If you're a kid, you might not be interested, or the MMA action might be too much for you. I remember seeing this film advertised on Cartoon Network, but the audience for this movie isn't exactly kids. It's not inappropriate, just rough...and tough. So I'm not sure exactly who this movie *is* for? Teens maybe. (They sure didn't flock to this film.) It is good to see Salma Hayek and Henry Winkler in fairly big roles. They're enjoyable actors regardless of material. My vote, this might be worth a rent depending on what interests you about this movie, but it's not worth paying 10-20 bucks for. 5/10"

"David_Brown","10","1","5","1 March 2013"," The Best Film Of 2012
","I really love Here Comes The Boom (HCTB), and everything about it, in fact it is my favorite film of 2012. That includes the music (Holly, Holy), the script and the characters. I think the standouts were Charice (Malia), former UFC Champion Bas Rutten (Niko), and of course, Music Teacher, Marty Streb (Henry Winkler). The comedy between Niko and Marty was priceless, particularly spoilers: The food fight scene in the Vegas Hotel. There are a lot of dramatic undercurrents throughout the film such as cutbacks in schools, people giving up, and bureaucracy. Perhaps the most interesting performance belonged to Salma Hayak as School Nurse, Bella Flores. If you are a Salma fan (You know she usually plays extremely lusty over the top characters (The ultimate eye candy)). But here (With the exception of the dinner scene), you do not see that Salma. Instead, you see a very dignified woman who really likes 43 year old Biology Teacher, Scott Voss (Kevin James), but not the way he is. Like when she pointed out ""You never ask me out standing up."" Also she is the one who fixes him up when he is hurt, and makes sure he has a rooting section when he has to go fight Dietrich in the Octagon. One important point is, there are some people who think there was no chemistry between Scott and Bella. Trust me there was, it was just very understated, and not overt. Anyone who sees the film, knows Bella was only in scenes that involved Scott, and she always had his back (Even in the beginning when he was still a screw up (Such as they showed in the beginning of the film), but was the basically the only teacher who really wanted to help save Marty's Music Dept). All she wanted was for him to respect her, and even more importantly, himself. One thing about sports films (and HCTB with Ultimate Fighting is without question a sports film) is they are almost never ambiguous, you know exactly how they end. One notable exception was ""The Main Event"" with Barbara Streisand as Hillary Kramer and Ryan O'Neal as Eddie Scanlon. What happens to these two after she throws in the towel to end the fight (When he was winning). HCTB offers up an ambiguous ending as well. Major Spoilers ahead: We know by Scott winning the $50,000 in the Octogon, Marty's music program is saved (And he can provide for his wife and the new baby), we know Niko and the other immigrants gain their citizenship, we also know his brother Eric (Gary Valentine)has his marriage saved, and regains the love of his wife and kids after he becomes a Top Chef in a Phillippean restaurant owned by Malia's dad, thus, Malia can focus in on her music and studies, and we know Principal Betcher (Greg Germann), was caught stealing from the school, and will go to jail. But what happens to Scott in the end is not so clear cut. What I think happened, is hinted at in the final two scenes: First, you do not see him back in his Biology Class, he is also shown very well dressed (unlike throughout the rest of the film), when he goes to check in on Marty and the music program, and when he and Bella (Holding hands) go to the Citizenship Ceremony for Niko and the other immigrants. It is almost like Scott is saying goodbye to everyone in his previous life (Except Bella who is going with him). Keep in mind, he sacrificed a lot to make other people's lives better, and instead of going back to teaching (And dealing with many of the same people who really don't care about anyone or anything except themselves (The types who said nothing or even encouraged the shutting down of the music department)), he realized now it is time to move on, and essentially for the first time in years, do Scott (And I think based on his dress and increased self confidence, became successful doing it). Where will he go and what will he do? Wherever and whatever he wants, because he knows with Bella beside him, he will succeed. Basically a great film, and my favorite of 2012. 10/10 Stars"

","I was not optimistic about another sports comedy but it's curious how much charm this tale of an underdog just trying to hold his in against the system has.<br/><br/>A lot of this is attributable to Keven James' rascalish charm even if he does take a very ""no means yes"" approach to courtship. Henry Winkler is also a treat as the hippie music teacher who we are supposed to love they make us do it by showing, not telling.<br/><br/>They do not skimp on the sports content here and as a non-sports fan, it's very intense. The combat cinematography is breathtaking and it's easy to appreciate the grandness of Scott's undertaking starting at the sordid bottom and journeying to the big leagues which involves more than a little suspension of disbelief but they meet you have way.<br/><br/>A sentimental picture to be sure but they earn that by rich characters anda professional approach to plotting and visualization. At times it may indeed feel like a mix of Nacho Libre and Rocky with just a dash of Dead Poet's society but it works.<br/><br/>An uplifting story of struggling agaisnt a corrupt system that makes it easy to just want to give up but never impossible to inspire."

He's definitely funnier than Kevin James, making you wonder why that guy really has a career.<br/><br/>I didn't really believe the set-up. James wants to raise money to stop his school's music program from shutting down, despite not being a music teacher. Henry Winkler is the school's music teacher.

","""Here Comes the Boom"" starring Kevin James is a predictable and generic film that uses too many lame jokes and tired tropes to be ignored, but I enjoy the ending.<br/><br/>The Good. The actors. The thing this movie has most going for it is that its main cast is very likable. Kevin James, Henry Winkler, and Bas Rutten all deliver enjoyable and endearing characters. Not very funny at any point, but a good chemistry and charisma can be felt. And what perhaps is an underappreciated moment of the movie is seeing Greg Germann as the principal give a really sincere moment near the end which flushed out his character. It would've been all too easy to paint him as the villain of the movie who is stuffed up and too conventional for his own good. They didn't go that road and I'm grateful.<br/><br/>The Bad. Sadly, not all actors left an impression. Selma Hayek doesn't need to be in this movie. It's not that she's particularly bad in anyway, but her character is just the generic romantic interest character bringing nothing new or interesting to the character. She inspires Voss (James) to care for the students and looks concerned when he's getting hurt. Outside of that, you could write her out of the movie and it would've made no difference.<br/><br/>The Ugly. The writing. This movie is just too on the nose in too many ways. I like the idea of a teacher fighting to save a music program. They've could've done so much more with that. Instead, the comedy is lazy and generic laughs (if it gets any at all) and it tries to walk the fence between Comedy and Dramady, but never picks a side. So the film has misplaced tone. And as far as laughs...this movie has two good written lines of dialogue and they were both in the trailer. Disappointing.<br/><br/>The Fantastic. The final 20 minutes. So despite all my criticism of this movie, what I must say though is that it works. They build up the underdog so well in this movie that in the final fight of Voss vs. Diedrich, I was totally engaged as if I were watching a real fight. The ending was well-written, well-acted, perfectly placed, perfectly choreographed, emotional, and incredibly engaging. This is what I mean by the movie has mixed tones. If this movie had been a dramady, this ending would've been perfect, instead...it feels like a different movie. But in the film preceding this scene, we had guy gets knocked out by ball, guys slipping and falling in water, James overdressing in goofy outfit for fights, etc.<br/><br/>So if this film had not gone the route of ""we want to be taken seriously, but we also need those slapstick moments to remind people we're a comedy"" this would've been a pretty good movie. Once again, mostly because of the ending. But instead, the film's tone is too mixed to be anything special.<br/><br/>6/10"

But, long story short...I ended up loving this movie anyway! Bas Rutten was a hoot!"

","If you want a funny and entertaining movies with some good characters and good moments, you could certainly do a lot worse. This is a classic rags-to-riches sports movie that follows a fairly common formula of an underdog rising up to take on a big challenge. However, unlike many other sports movies, we are not meant to like the main character from the beginning. Kevin James' character is shown right away as an example of everything that is wrong with being an uncaring educator. He then realizes the err of his ways and tries to find redemption, and that is when the story takes off.<br/><br/>The premise of him fighting to raise money for a noble cause is great. But you really need to suspend reality for the story to make any sense at all. First of all, schools do not accept donations for pay for a single teacher's salary. And if they did, that means Kevin James needs to keep donating his fighting profits for the rest of Henry Winkler's career to really make a different. And it is not just Winkler's job that is about to be axed, it is the entire music program. So just raising money for one man's job will be a drop in the bucket.<br/><br/>Another ridiculous part of the movie is when Joe Rogan (playing himself) has the whole band flown out to play a one-minute song for the match. Hey Joe, this is a financially strapped school about to lose its music program. If you want to make a difference, don't fly out every member for a tiny performance. Donate that money to the school! Maybe I am a cynic, but that really bothered me.<br/><br/>While those parts of the movie were ridiculous, the overall experience really is quite good. Obviously your expectations coming into this movie would be to just enjoy yourself and have some laughs for 90 minutes. In that respect, this movie delivers."
"alindsay-al","8","0","1","19 December 2016"," A great real feel good film
","I like a good sports film so I thought I would watch this film with low expectations and I ended up really enjoying this film. The premise of this film Sees a biology teacher attempt to train in MMA so he can save the music department and the teachers job. Kevin James is very hit and miss with mostly misses but this is the best I have ever seen him. He is really funny in his film and he adds lots of depth to his character that makes you root to him and care about him succeeding to help save this guy's job. You see him progress throughout the film and really get some pride out of possibly having a chance to win these fights. Henry Winkler plays the music teacher in the film and he is great, he is just such a likable guy and you end up liking him so much. You truly understand why James is going through these fights to save this guy's job. I loved Niko who is James trainer and he was hilarious in this film and was just a great character that has great chemistry with james. I also really liked how all the kids in his class become more interested in him and school as the film develops. Salma hayek plays his love interest in this film and she doesn't really add allot to the film but is competent in the role. The story is really uplifting as you see this guy doing everything he can to help somebody else an try and make his school a better place. It's a really motivating movie and you really do care about the journey the characters go through. But I will admit that this film is incredibly predictable and a bit clichÃ© as you can probably guess the ending of this film. The script has some really good dialogue in this film both dramatic and humour that really helped build the characters and really make me laugh and care. The style of the UFC fights are really good an you totally buy James starting to get better at the fights as the film progresses. But there is some pointless things in the movie to pad it out and also some toilet humour that just doesn't work. Overall though I really enjoyed this film and I think it is definitely worth a watch."

","I haven't seen a movie that Kevin James is in yet that I didn't like. Henry Winkler was amazing in this movie, they made a wonderful team, I hope that more movies like this come out soon. I laughed so hard with my family when we watched it. I've probably seen it 4 times now and it never stops being funny. The characters are believable, regular every day people that are trying to do something outside the box for some kids. It wasn't predictable either, and it wasn't made just for one age group of people. I really hope that Kevin James and Henry Winkler work together again. They are very funny together. I can't even pick my favourite scene, there are too many. Great show to watch with your family! They should make a sequel. I would love that!

","This was such a fun and inspiring movie. Easy to watch, nothing to hide from kids in the room. It delivered a solid message without heaping a ton of depressing material on its audience before making it's point. A lot of inspirational movies consist of 90 minutes of guilt and tears followed by 5 minutes of hope. This one was great all around and easy on the heart. The diverse cast, realistic dialogue and down-to-earth characters were a breath of fresh air as well. Overall, very well done, even if it didn't blow people out of the water in any particular way, more movies like this need to exist. Salma Hayek played a great, realistic role as a woman with basic dating standards. Thank you! Her dialogue was playful and real, delivered naturally. Kevin James did a great job embodying the bogged down feeling real teachers experience. His character was very believable and i'm grateful for his honest role, honest heart and participation in this exaggerated but otherwise very real story about school funding and what it does to the people trying to keep the wheels turning."

","Kevin James is not one my favorite actors, and some of his other movie roles in the last few years have been corny, to say the least. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this film all the same. Despite some opportunities for over the top physical humor, he played it as realistically as possible with some truly funny moments and a Rocky-like ending. Lots of clichÃ©s here but in the main, a funny take on the age old underdog theme. Salma Hayek is passable as the female love interest and Henry Winkler does a good job of delivering the goofy one liners he seems to be doing in more and more film roles as he ages and leaves his Fonzy image far behind. Definitely worth a look."

","This was really fun to watch. Surprisingly so. I was afraid to see yet another movie with Kevin James playing a bumbling, lovable idiot with a number of cringy jokes, but they definitely toned down that element for this movie. And it certainly worked for me.<br/><br/>To get the obvious points out of the way: Yes, this is a pretty generic underdog/feel-good story with a rather far-fetched plot (teacher turns UFC fighter) and a predictable ending. However, they really executed it well. For a start, the cast really carries this movie and makes up for the generic elements of the plot. All the actors seem to be enjoying themselves and it shows. Henry Winkler as the music teacher is fantastic and MMA legend Bas Rutten is a comic revelation on screen, providing a lot of comic relief and a generally positive aura in every scene. In addition, long-term UFC fan Kevin James took the time to make sure that they made this unlikely underdog story as realistic as possible, with several mixed martial artists being consulted for this movie and acting in cameos. Also, while the plot is far-fetched, they still tried to make sure that the teacher's journey doesn't look too easy. After all, you can't just waltz into professional MMA fighting like this. But with a bit of suspension of disbelief the movie works great.<br/><br/>This movie surely won't earn much praise from serious film critics, but I found it really enjoyable for what it is and, thanks to the entertaining cast, I'd happily watch it again soon."

","Here Comes the Boom (2012): Dir: Frank Coraci / Cast: Kevin James, Salma Hayek, Henry Winkler, Bas Rutten, Gary Valentine: U.F.C inspired comedy about challenge. Kevin James plays a Biology teacher who takes up mixed martial arts fighting in order to save a friend's job in the music department as well as create needed funds for the school. This is all very well until it becomes repetitious with an ending that will either have you cheering or completely numb by the fact that it was so obvious. Director Frank Coraci will no doubt inspire some viewers with its message of never giving up but this theme seems numb within all the conventions. A target audience will be difficult, unlike another Coraci comedy, The Wedding Singer, which also pitted its hero against great odds, yet it played up great 1980's nostalgia for viewers of that period. James seems to be having fun as the teacher, tired of his job until finding a place for which he can contribute more successfully. He is involved in several fights, well staged with a lot of action. The romantic subplot is useless with Salma Hayek as a fellow teacher whom James is smitten. There is good supporting work by Henry Winkler as a passionate music teacher whose 48 year old wife is pregnant. Bas Rutten has a nifty role as a fitness trainer who attends a class that James teaches in the evenings regarding becoming an American citizen. Some may like the message while others will not likely feel the boom and cast it off as another misfire comedy out to poke fun of a sport that is more entertaining than it is. Score: 5 Â½ / 10"

"dee.reid","8","0","1","13 April 2014"," ""Here Comes the Boom"" (2012)
","It's been a long time since I last reviewed a new(-ish) movie for the lovely crowds of IMDb. Earlier today, I got the chance to watch the 2012 martial arts/sports comedy ""Here Comes the Boom,"" directed by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison regular Frank Coraci (""The Wedding Singer,"" ""The Waterboy,"" ""Zookeeper"") and starring the always-affable Kevin James.<br/><br/>James is one of the most watchable and likable personalities working in big movies these days. Perhaps, that's why his starring character in ""Here Comes the Boom"" works so well. The genial, portly James plays 42-year-old, apathetic Boston-area high school biology teacher Scott Voss, who's just screaming for a big ""Rocky""-style inspirational makeover.<br/><br/>Voss's inspirational calling comes in the form of looming budget cuts that threatens his school's extracurricular activities, which includes best-pal and dedicated music teacher Marty Streb (Henry Winkler) being laid off and his band program getting axed - unless someone somehow magically comes up with the $48,000 needed to save everything. Bake sales and car washes won't cut it, so Voss does the unthinkable and signs up for a series of amateur mixed martial arts (MMA) bouts, where even the loser can net up to $10,000 - which is more than what most of today's educators make in a month - and the winner can make off with a $50,000 grand prize.<br/><br/>But because Voss is 42 and out-of-shape (though he was a division-one wrestler in college) and COMPLETELY out of his element, no one takes his scheme seriously, though he does find unlikely support in Dutch immigrant and MMA trainer Niko (retired Dutch-American UFC champ Bas Rutten), Mark DellaGrotte (playing himself), Marty, and lovely school nurse Bella Flores (the always-lovely Salma Hayek). And somewhere in there, Voss also manages to find what it takes to live again and inspire his students and everyone else at his school.<br/><br/>""Here Comes the Boom"" is pretty by-the-numbers formulaic. But Kevin James keeps everything above water with his cool and personable Everyman portrayal of the once-apathetic Scott Voss. Salma Hayek isn't really given all that much to do, but - damn it - does she light up every scene that she graces. One of the great charms of ""Here Comes the Boom"" is watching Bas Rutten deliver (what I've seen from him) his best acting portrayal, since it's well-known that most athletes are pretty poor screen performers - the guy energizes every sequence he's in; but watching Rutten here, you get to asking yourself why he hasn't been in more movies before this one.<br/><br/>""Here Comes the Boom"" isn't an Oscar-winner by a long shot, but the movie works because of two key players - Kevin James and Bas Rutten. It's not a knock-out winner, but it does land a few solid punches to the gut that will elicit a few painful, well-deserved laughs.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Here Comes the Boom is a good, light-hearted film that offers up some quality family-time entertainment. It's very clichÃ©d and predictable but the charm of Kevin James is to hard to resist and it has a good number of laughs. It's also a feel-good film that has the main theme of doing anything you possibly can to help others or institutions in need. The fighting matches are well-choreographed and worth watching despite some predictable outcomes.<br/><br/>Frank Coraci's film is about a schoolteacher named Scott Voss who decides to participate in the UFC in order to raise money to save his friend's and fellow teacher's music program.<br/><br/>The acting isn't too bad in the film. Kevin James is very charming here and has persona you can't resist. Of course he does the usual ""fat guy gets punched constantly"" clichÃ©, but it still was entertaining. Salma Hayek is good as Jame's love interest and I kind of liked the romantic interplay between these two. Finally, Henry Winkler does a good job and is often quite funny.<br/><br/>Overall, Here Comes the Boom is a solid family flick that has some cool UFC fighting scenes. It's predictable but it's charming enough to be forgiven. It has several funny jokes, especially regarding the issue of American citizenship. I must say when the movie was over, I was in a good mood because of this film. A charming, entertaining film. I rate this film 8/10."

I also like Henry Winkler and I thought he was great in it. I am guessing this was kind of a dream role for Kevin James. I think he has always had a fantasy about competing in the UFC. Kevin James did a really nice job by playing the role pretty much straight up without going overboard to make it seem like a comedy. And lets face it, any film where you get an opportunity to look at Salma Hayak gotta have some value. But if you take the film as an entertainment device I think most people will enjoy it.

Kevin James was (IS- IS!) a very funny guy. Unfortunately, the formula ""comedies"" he's been involved with since departing the Small Screen have been... lackluster, at best. The man has talent (we've seen that and can attest to the fact), but the by-the-numbers feature films he's been involved in haven't begun to scratch the surface of what he has to offer. Like Bob Newhart, Kevin James is one of those guys whose greatest asset is his Every Man approach to humor (though they're about as different, stylistically, as Night and Day). Here's to hoping someone with the right mindset hooks up with Kevin James before it's too late. (I liked the IDEA of an unknown coming from nowhere to win the day- it happens from time to time in sport, in mixed martial arts more often than it should- but the execution left a lot to be desired.)

","Through his last few film roles, Kevin James has put a spell on me. His controlled goofiness, innocuous sweetness, and charming ""everyman"" persona make him at least likable for roughly ninety minutes. Perhaps it is the tough times endured in our world, or my cynicism winding down, but through an unexplainable force I enjoyed Frank Coraci's Here Comes the Boom perfectly on its own merits. It delights with comedy and commentary, moves with its undertones, and achieves satisfaction without being too crass or too manipulative.<br/><br/>Kevin James is Scott Voss, a biology teacher for a high school in deteriorating shape financially. Budget cutbacks proposed by one of the board members shows reverting back to salaries of the previous year, financial conservation, and the elimination of the school's music program. Voss, who seemed to be often lackadaisical and unmotivated during school hours, is reminded of the music director, Marty (Henry Winkler), an aging man who confides in him when he realizes that his wife is pregnant. He decides to take a stand for Marty and raise the $48,000 needed to save the music program by taking up mixed martial arts, when he discovers from a friend that just losing a professional match grants you $10,000, where winning grants you a whopping $50,000.<br/><br/>Voss, who also teaches a citizenship class to cheery, optimistic immigrants, takes lessons from Holland-native Niko (real-life UFC heavyweight Bas Rutten), and is driven by the spirit and beauty of co-worker Bella Flores (Salma Hayek), who admires his doughy-self for pushing through in efforts to get a date with her. And so the odyssey begins, with Voss attempting to fight in numerous events, receiving money, and hoping to save the music program before the end of the year.<br/><br/>I just finished reviewing Rob Cohen's Alex Cross, a polar-opposite from Here Comes the Boom. I introduced my critique by saying, ""We've seen Alex Cross before, in numerous other detective films, and even if we haven't, or can't quite recall where, somehow we arrive at the expected conclusion in our heads roughly twenty-five minutes before the characters of the film do."" The same statement applies for Here Comes the Boom. This story isn't original, subversive, or unpredictable, yet there's an incandescent charm to its story and a motivation to exercise full potential rather than be a lazy slog through screenplay odds and ends. This is the kind of entertainment that doesn't burden us, beat a moral over our heads, provide us with sappy emotional manipulation, and doesn't feel like it's taking away one-hundred and two minutes away from us in a criminal act.<br/><br/>Kevin James' previous film was Zookeeper, directed by the same Frank Coraci. Despite the same well-meaning efforts being present there, its humor derived from mainly farcical concepts such as James' collapsing or the fact that him and a gorilla straight from the zoo were dining out at Applebee's. It was forgettable and almost entirely unremarkable. Here Comes the Boom, on the other hand, is sweeter and more concerned with humor deriving from wordplay or character relations. The matches between Voss and his competitors are not played for laughs or even petty remorse. They are fierce, slickly captured, and quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Here Comes the Boom isn't that will be remembered as more than acceptable genre-fare and, in a sense, that's the way it should be. To overblow it to anything more is to completely over-compensate its worth as a film. It's not something to hold on the highest step on the pedestal. It's a film to appreciate once, maybe twice, and then move on. There are better pictures in this same genre lurking out there. Yet there are worse ones. Way worse ones.<br/><br/>Starring: Kevin James, Salma Hayek, and Henry Winkler. Directed by: Frank Coraci."

I loved James in The King Of Queens, but Paul Blart was an absolute stinker, and this had 'fat teacher fights' slapstick all over it.<br/><br/>It turns out that I really hate myself for falling for it's charms and it's predictability so much.<br/><br/>No matter how much his films vex, James is a really likable screen presence, so you cannot help but root for him, and beside him for the most of the film, we have Winkler, who is as equally nice, according to his movie output for the last ten years.<br/><br/>The score is that uplifting tune you hear on every underdog movie ever made, and it's flashily edited.<br/><br/>It shouldn't be good, but thanks to diminished expectations, it entertained, and for a few minutes, it sucked me in and hit the spot, even though I knew what twists would occur, that he would get the money, Hayak, and the respect of his peers.<br/><br/>It's not laugh out loud funny, I think I may have chuckled once, but the feel-good factor is there, and that's why it worked.<br/><br/>see it, and forget about the whole film ten minutes later."
