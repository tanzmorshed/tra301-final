","I've been slowly making my way through Guillermo del Toro's catalogue of movies and this is my first time watching Hell Boy. If you're a Del Toro fan, then this one won't disappoint. He's such a superior director - he adds artistry to this action film through his use of shot making, pacing and colour. At times, the dialogue attempts to be a bit too cute and the love story adds little to the plot, but overall, it's a fun movie that doesn't try to overextend itself."
"has_no_pseudonym","7","144","180","1 December 2004"," Hellboy, not perfect, but entertaining.
","Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.<br/><br/>This is one of few movies I've ever gone to see on the opening weekend, possibly the only one. And I did so because I was already a fan of Ron Perlman and it was great to see him in a leading role, even though he's covered in makeup. Perlman is the best thing in this movie; he is perfect as Hellboy. He swaggers through it as if he'd always been a leading man. Delivering one-liners with ease and to perfection, battling monsters through subterranean sets and city streets, and giving a great comedic performance as well as a very emotional one that makes you just love the big red oaf. A great feat considering the extensive makeup he had to act through.<br/><br/>And the makeup and prosthetics are the best of its kind I've ever seen. There's movement and expression in the lips at times that you would think would be impossible. You might at first think that the lips are rather stationary and unexpressive, but if you just pay attention you'll see that there is a lot of movement and subtleties to it. Rick Baker should be praised for his work in this, it's amazing.<br/><br/>Doug Jones is awesome as the body of Abe Sapien. His movements are truly beautiful. And David Hyde Pierce as the voice is perfect. Abe is a very interesting and neat character that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. And his makeup is as amazing or even more so than Hellboy's.<br/><br/>John Hurt is great in this, as is Jeffrey Tambor. Everyone in this does a great job. But Perlman's performance as Hellboy really holds the movie together. His character stands out and speaks to the audience better than any other.<br/><br/>If you liked X-Men or Spider-Man don't expect a movie as well polished and put together, but you should be able to enjoy it and the more overt comic book feel of the movie. And unlike the aforementioned movies there is quite a bit of light humor throughout Hellboy that should garner some laughs from most anyone.<br/><br/>Hellboy isn't perfect, I would have changed some things, but I had fun watching it and in the end, especially for a movie of this type, I think that's what matters most. In fact I like it more now, after seeing it again, than I did when walking out of the theater."
"BrandtSponseller","10","178","225","2 February 2005"," One of the best comic book films
","Towards the end of World War II, the Nazis engage in efforts to win the war through means of invoking the paranormal. They attempt to open a ""portal"" for seven beings who are meant to invoke the apocalypse on Earth, but a U.S. Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense is on hand to stop them before they get too far. They do not stop them as quickly as they'd like, however, and the U.S. troops soon discover that a bizarre infant, part devil, part man, red, with horns and the demonic works, with a large right hand made of indestructible stone, has gotten through. They acquire the infant, we go forward in time to the late 20th Century, and most of the film concerns an adult Hellboy still working in conjunction with the U.S. government to help battle monsters and the paranormal.<br/><br/>Hellboy was a 10 out of 10 for me, but there are a number of criteria for any viewer to have such a high opinion of it. One, even though director Guillermo del Toro is a big fan of the Hellboy comic books and many comments have been made by him, comic creator Mike Mignola and others that the film is faithful to the books, they've also said they've changed it to suit the context of the film, so you have to not be a purist about source material to screen translations (or current screen instantiations). Two, you have to have a taste for fantasy where the creators are not very concerned with making the material coherent with or plausible in the actual world. Three, you have to enjoy your fantasy both very dark (on the horror side) and humorous/sarcastic at the same time. Four, you have to like an epic, sprawling feel to your fantasy. And Five, you have to not hate cgi creatures. I meet all of those criteria. How many you meet will likely determine how well you'll like Hellboy.<br/><br/>What worked best for me was the material that showed Hellboy, portrayed exquisitely by Ron Perlman, as just a regular guy cum sassy detective. Even though he's half demon, a large part of the comics, at least--and this is hinted at in the film, particularly in the climax--is a continual nature versus nurture ""debate"". He was raised by humans who were as normal as they could be, being government agents in a bureau dedicated to the paranormal. So he has a large number of human-like quirks, including a love of old music, beer, cats, pancakes, chili, and so on. He's also a cigar-smoking, smart-assed detective. Hellboy is at its best when it focuses on these characteristics.<br/><br/>But everything else works well, too. Hellboy has a monster-like counterpart, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), and a ""freak"" love interest, Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), who are almost as fascinating as he is. The villain and neutral creatures (such as the ""half-creature"" with a speaking role towards the end) are just as captivating. There are also other characters providing enjoyable comic relief, most notably Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor). His adopted father, Professor Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm (John Hurt) is intriguing. And newly recruited ""caretaker"" John Myers (Rupert Evans) shows promise, even if we do not get to spend much time with him here. Like many films of this type, I'd love to see all of these characters further explored in prequels, sequels and spinoffs. That's a good sign, because it shows that del Toro and fellow writers Mignola and Peter Briggs have successfully conveyed a world with ""deep"" characters who have extensive histories.<br/><br/>Also worth noting is the cinematography/lighting/production and set design, which is consistently beautiful, and ranges from the popular recent trend of more monochromatic textures (blue is the color of choice here), to the strong chiaroscuro of the comic books, to striking contrasts, such as a mostly monochromatic scene which is suddenly penetrated by a supersaturated red stream of blood. The sets are all engaging, from exteriors (one hilariously claimed to be in Newark, New Jersey) to interiors, urban to expansive countryside and even outer space environments.<br/><br/>As for effects, which are a large part of the film, I can't for the life of me imagine someone claiming that cgi looks ""fake"" compared to mechanicals, practicals, stop motion (ala Harryhausen), and so on after they see this film. For my money, these are some of the most impressive cgi creations yet, including some great cgi fight scenes.<br/><br/>Hellboy is captivating, suspenseful and humorous. It is well worth watching for anyone with a taste for fantasy."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","15","16","20 June 2008"," Great entertainment delivered in a visually stylish package
","Guillermo Del Toro's ""Hellboy"" is really the sort of comic book adaptation that should be commonplace- a film that feels every bit like a comic book in its energy, style, and visual feel, but is entirely worthy on a cinematic level as well.<br/><br/>Sadly, ""Hellboy"" doesn't really have much of a plot, at least for half of its running time. Its first hour is Hellboy fighting squids and the mandatory character introductions, and its second hour feels pretty rushed as a result, having to introduce and resolve the bulk of the film's story. Thankfully, however, ""Hellboy"" avoids the comic book-to-film clich√© of basing the first film of any given franchise on the 'superhero origin story' (not that Hellboy is much of a superhero, he's really just a smartass with a gun, except he's from hell), instead keeping all that to a short and dazzling pre-credits sequence. Other than the somewhat rushed and oddly-placed plot aspects, Del Toro's screenplay is fairly impressive, providing plenty of nods towards the comics and a good amount of wit and humor, also echoing the nature of Mike Mignola's work.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspects of ""Hellboy"" are Del Toro's direction and Guillermo Navarro's photography. Del Toro was always a superb director in terms of visuals, although I've had issues with several of his scripts. His most accomplished film to date in this regard would probably be the superb ""The Devil's Backbone"", but ""Hellboy"" shows that he has a surprising knack for directing action in a fluid manner without resorting to the cheap method of quick cutting. Also notable in terms of Del Toro's work here is how he subtly manages to pay homage to the memorable artwork of the comics, for example the overhead shots of Hellboy.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are quite good considering the film's relatively modest budget, and thankfully they don't form the basis for much of this film. The cast are all solid if not fantastic, although Ron Perlman is probably the best actor I can think of to play Hellboy. The final shot is beautiful and perfectly in keeping with the pulp poetry of not only this film but also the comics it is based on. <br/><br/>8/10"
"Quinoa1984","8","14","15","9 March 2007"," Guillermo Del-Toro's exciting, fun tribute to the flamboyantly cool powers of comic books
","Hellboy is self-conscious, perhaps, but in the best ways possible. Actually, it's more due to writer/director Toro being very aware of what makes up the conventional bits to every sense character-wise to the world of a comic-book, but also what can be entertaining as well, than it is just to having it being a Hellboy movie where the comic-book Hellboy already exists IN this world (guy sees the Hellboy comic, looks up, it's Hellboy!). We get the tough-as-nails, dryly witty, and possibly ticking-time-bomb hero in Hellboy, a deadly serious villain in Rasputin (yes, Rasputin, with a blonde Nazi as his evil side-kick no less), the young apprentice to the hero (Ruper Evans as John Meyers), the hero's love interest (Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair), the father figure (John Hurt's Professor), and the reluctant 'boss' (Jeffrey Tambor), not to mention the plucky side mutant in Abraham (Doug Jones) AND a magnificent creature in that hard-ass slug. They're all there, bright as day (or dark, depending on point of view), and it all works wonderfully due to Toro running with it all head on. It's not done in a way that's meant to pander to the audience, either, but just to have fun with the conventions, to see what makes them all crackle and pop under big-time special effects. It's not quite a guilty pleasure because Toro is also a smart craftsman.<br/><br/>And craftsman just as much as director, he crafts this world where the creatures (which were and still are Toro's forte) are fierce and radically charged, whether they're crucial to the picture like Rasputin's rabid, rapidly hatching slug-monsters that can only be killed one or two ways, or if it's just a minor creature like the zombie Russian corpse that leads a little of the way when Hellboy and his crew are in the main hideout of the villains (""I was better off dead!""). Toro is sensitive to the characters alongside this, and makes them all pretty believable- and I say pretty cause it's all a little simple, yet effective, in the main thrust of Hellboy's emotional core being about Liz and if she may or may not go for John over him- and doesn't dumb it down too much or contrive the relationships for the audience. It's a good balance, because there is A LOT of action in Hellboy, in fact probably at least a 60% allotment to either Hellboy fighting the monsters after him (usually in the subway, or in the Russian castle), or with the possibly un-dead assassin in the mask and leather who marks as one of the fiercest forces in comic book movies.<br/><br/>So, fan-boys rejoice, because Hellboy should, and hopefully will, have everything one looks for in a brawny, high-octane entertainment where humor isn't confused with cheesiness (Perlman is too well focused as a possible anti-hero to get into any of that, as he makes that hugely built red lug a very real being), and the action isn't over-done with a tongue-in-cheek. Not that Toro doesn't flirt with having goofy things in his picture, like a moment where Hellboy has to save a box of kittens from the grasp of the slug-monster. But they're earned moments among a very tightly constructed story where human evils in history and the bizarre in what is in the facts (Hitler into the occult, Rasputin's very long death) into a comfortably understood framework of comic-book clich√©s that never get too old when done right. Bottom line, can't wait for number 2!"
"Ithorianjedimaster2","9","16","18","17 May 2007"," A highly over-looked movie that surpasses Van Helsing
","Someone told me a long time ago that ""Van Helsing"" and ""Hellboy"" were in the same level of quality, saying they ""both sucked"". Well, that's a filthy lie. What you have here is a movie (based on a popular comic book of the same name) that does EVERYTHING that it seems ""Van Helsing"" slipped on. Don't get me wrong; I liked ""Van Helsing"", but let's face it, it wasn't the best movie ever and it lacked a lot of character development and an ending that was a bit of a cliffhanger (because you never find out what Van Helsing's past is), but ""Hellboy"" is another story.<br/><br/>The movie starts off during the end of WWII. It appears that Nazis have been meddling in something that Paranormal Specialist Dr. Broom doesn't like too much, dark magic. With the help of the notorious Resputin, along with some unnamed woman with a sledgehammer and, despite him being a Nazi, my favorite assassin, Alex Kronen, the blade-wielding gas-masked bad boy that you meet in the early part of the movie. In an attempt to awaken the seven gods of chaos, Resputin's plan is foiled by American soldiers, who are aided by Dr. Broom. After a cool looking gun fight, the portal that was built to reach the seven gods is destroyed, along with Resputin. However, the portal was open for too long and Dr. Broom warns the American general ""something may have gotten out."" Which leads to the discovery of a certain red 'ape' with the world's largest whammer (for you sick-minds out there, I mean he has a large fist made of stone) and is quickly adopted by the Americans, after given the name Hellboy.<br/><br/>Then the movie sets off, and that is when more of the fun begins. Hellboy, now about 60, (but looks just out of his 20's since he doesn't age as fast as we do) is the monster-hunting character that Stephen Summers wanted Van Helsing to be. Hellboy is a lord of wisecracking and doesn't really take things seriously, and he also has the coolest gun in the world, the Simaritan, a revolver that shoots ""big bullets"".<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is very well done. Hellboy's character is realistic and believable, since you can't help but love his sarcasm, such as discovering a egg-like parasite on his arm and when Agent Myers asks ""What is that thing?"", Hellboy puts the parasite in his lap and replies ""I'll go ask."" Then there's the smart guy that makes up for whatever Hellboy lacks in intelligence and knowledge, the ""fish guy"" Abe Sapien, who, by touching any object, can see its past and future. Finally, you have Hellboy's ex-girlfriend and still-love-interest, Liz, who is a pyrokinesis who is trying hard to control her fiery powers, and is scarred from a childhood memory of when she killed many people in one of her ""outbursts"", which means her fire lets off a big explosion, killing everyone and everything around her at quite a distance, without harming her.<br/><br/>The villains are also very convincing and though there is some acting quality lacking in Sledgehammer Girl (I didn't catch her name), she has little lines and doesn't have much screen time, unlike the very creepy and just-as-deadly Alex Kronen who has been made into something of an immortal, due to his surgical addiction (he's like a killing, cool version of Michael Jackson, except Jackson's blood isn't dust and can't increase his adrenaline by cranking a dial on his chest).<br/><br/>The action scenes are also very fun to watch, and never go out of quality like ""Van Helsing"" sometimes did. This is done by not a lot of shooting or explosions or people running in circles screaming like in ""Van Helsing"", but is done by clever dialogue, Hellboy's constant wisecracking, and some awesome special effects . . . along with a lot of shooting.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" is a highly over-looked (and sometimes, under-rated) movie that makes us remember how ""Van Helsing"" lacked in character development and high-quality action scenes. While ""Van Helsing"" has its big mean monsters, which outnumber the amount of monsters in ""Hellboy"",""Hellboy"" gives us the experience Stephen Summers wanted ""Van Helsing"" to provide, along with some extra wisecracking and a little more attitude. ""Hellboy"" is a must-buy for fans of the comic or just about anyone who likes special effects and clever script-writing."

","I'm usually pretty skeptical about comic book to film translations thanks to such esteemed turkeys as ""Captain America"", ""Daredevil"", and ""Punisher"" (the early 90's version with Dolph Lundgren). But this movie, which could've been bad.....real bad, somehow found a way to be ammusing and entertaining, while at the same time staying faithful to the comics original characters, storylines, and influences.<br/><br/>Now this film's not gonna win any awards and isn't going to turn non-comic fans into hardcore comic maniacs but it is a great pre-summer action/adventure film with some comedy and a bit of the eccentric tossed in for good measure.<br/><br/>I won't go into the usual routine and start giving away plot points and story snippits. All I will say is ""Go see the movie"". But before you do you must take all logic, all sarcasm and cyncism and toss those all out of the car window on the way to your local cinemas. This movie has alot of things that may contradict alot of things that most people believe in, but remember, ITS JUST A MOVIE. Thats what movies are for, they are meant to take the impossible and make it possible and so on. Like I said, this movies not going to be an award winner, and won't be on any critics ten best lists, but it will be a film that you'll laugh at, and generally have fun watching. Its a great escape from the surrealistic existence that many of us live every single day. So, take my advice, go see this movie, sit back, relax, and have some fun."
"ghoulieguru","7","137","190","29 January 2005"," Hell of a Movie!
","Alright, so seeing as how I'm comment #430, I don't imagine that anyone is going to read my review, or that anyone will be encouraged to watch Hellboy because of anything that I'll say. There are others who have written short novels on IMDb about what a great movie this is, so there's no point in me doing more of the same.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that this movie is beautifully shot, well acted (with the exception of the kid who plays the FBI agent) and directed by masterful Guillermo Del Toro with style and grace. It's not for everyone, and those who are fans of the comic will probably enjoy it more than your average moviegoer. But if you like movies like The Crow or Darkman, this one is right down your dark little alley."
"rbverhoef","7","62","84","28 November 2004"," Entertaining comic book movie
","When you are watching a comic book movie you have to take certain things for granted. The superpowers, strange villains, things like that. They are there in a non-existing world; saying they are implausible is true but not relevant. What a comic book movie needs is a nice story that is set in its own world (although real existing places can be there too), an entertaining superhero played by an actor who is able to really create the character, spectacular visual effects that fit the action but most of all it needs to breath the right mood. 'Spider-Man 2' did a perfect job, 'X2', 'Blade II' and now 'Hellboy' come very close. The difference is that 'Hellboy' is the first from what will probably become a series.<br/><br/>The superhero in 'Hellboy' is, of course, Hellboy (Ron Perlman). How he arrives on earth has something to do with Nazis, around 1944, which we see in the first ten minutes of the movie. Let us say he is just here, present day, on the good side, with a professor named Bruttenholm (John Hurt) as his father figure; he was there when Hellboy came from hell. The villains are the same Nazis, you learn why they are still alive, and a lot of monsters they have created. We also meet a love interest for Hellboy named Liz (Selma Blair) and his new partner, Agent Myers (Rupert Evans).<br/><br/>So Hellboy will fight the Nazis and the monsters, but there is more. His father figure is close to death and the love interest, who sets on fire when she is excited, is not really interested. What makes this movie entertaining, besides the right mood we constantly feel, is the dry humor Ron Perlman brings to the character. Hellboy is supposed to be a secret for the outer world although rumors of his existence are there. When Agent Myers goes for a walk wit Liz Hellboy gets jealous and follows them over rooftops where he encounters a nine year old boy. The boy recognizes Hellboy and the scenes that follow the encounter are close to brilliant.<br/><br/>There are other very fine moments. At one point a character asks why photographs of UFO's, aliens or Hellboy are always blurry, not very sharp. We see the truth in this question although ironically in a comic book world the question is very out of place; Hellboy does exist. May be this is not the best comic book movie, but entertaining it is. Compare it to another 2004 movie like 'Spider-Man 2' this one seems flawed although we can see the same amount of fun the characters have. Compare it to the dark and brutal 2004 comic book movie 'The Punisher' and this one is terrific, feels like a comic book the entire time, has an interesting hero with humor. That everything around it is pretty silly we just have to take for granted."
"garlonuss","8","10","11","12 July 2008"," An amazing spectacle
","This movie is a fun watch, but mainly because of Ron Perlman. The action is well done and the story is great, but Perlman makes the character of Hellboy (a demon raised by ""the good guys"") just amazingly human, with a wry sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find anyone anywhere who could do this character as well as Perlman, let alone better. The physicality seems to have been tailor made to fit Perlman's features and the delivery of the lines is just so understatedly comedic that there are few who could pull it off at all.<br/><br/>Of course, there are a couple times when the special effects are a little weaker than you would hope, but it doesn't detract from the movie as a whole. For instance, in the final battle scene, there are a couple shots where the Hellboy character clearly appears to be GC. But the fight moves so fast that you don't have much time to focus on those shots before something else amazing happens.<br/><br/>See it. Love it."

Well-done. Almost all of the other significant characters are equally well-presented by their respective actors, save for one. del Toro certainly dropped the ball in writing/directing that character (though I won't mention who so as not to give anything away).

","I must say I would have never expected in my wildest dreams to enjoy a film like this so much, much less this one.  Hellboy has it's faults but it's truly comic book/horror/fantasy hybrid masterpiece. It is the probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Based on a little known comic book I'm sure people will be running to buy now. Hellboy is the story of a group of bad guys whom are trying to destroy the world and end up bringing forth a small child like hellboy. After years of being raised by his founder he becomes a superhero monster fighting bad guys like himself and bringing them to justice while defending humanity. He's helped along in his quest by pyro girl Liz Sherman played beautifully by Selma Blair. And a very cool intellectual fish Looking guy referred to as Blue. But those people are back to destroy the world again as they have ressurected their master and it's up to Hellboy and his gang of misfits to protect humanity and foil their plan. I'm sure it sounds surely predicatble but that something this film lacks in troves. It's completely original, completely new and just great. The performances by Ron Pearlman, John Hurt and Selma Blair are completely involving. The story is well developed, emotional, scary and funny. The direction is taut and well developed. Definatly Del Toro's reigning masterpiece. I must say I was overly impressed by this film probably because I wasn't expecting too much but I can guarantee you one thing I will be going to see it again. Hellboy is amazing!"

Sixty years later, those who birthed Hellboy are back for him and the end of the world.<br/><br/>I loved this movie! Loved it! For anyone who is interested in history and cultural mythology and believes that movies, to some extent, are the telling of old tales in new ways (and some will become tomorrow's myths), ""Hellboy"" will definitely keep that belief alive. Not to mention it's simply just one exciting damn fine fun kick butt movie! There is not a weak performance (onscreen by actors or offscreen by crew) in this film. You do not have to be a fan of the comic to enjoy this movie. It's fantastic storytelling mix of family devotion, burgeoning love, acceptance of personal power, overcoming prejudice, sacrifice, with action, comedy, horror, comic book stylized evil and one of the eeriest bad guys ever to weld a knife, as well as one of the most intense (and well dressed) villains to ever threaten the earth. <br/><br/>Ron Perlman has the lead and, as in the past, gives the excellent magic of make up artist Rick Baker life. He takes what would be for most actors stifling full make up and a weighty cumbersome costume and gives the audience a being with the flesh of a demon, the voice of a dark angel, the attitude of a blue collar worker, the humor of a college student, the mind of a professor, the heart of a young man in love, and the soul of a human being. <br/><br/>Favorite line: ""There are things that go bump in the night Agent Myers, make no mistake about that, and we are the ones who bump back.""<br/><br/>Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman (a lot): ""Awe, crap.""<br/><br/>Definitely worth a buy!"

","If Mike Mignola isn't careful he's going to have a whole cottage industry devoted to his comic strip creation Hellboy. Having just come from Hellboy II: The Golden Army and seeing his credits at this website makes me think about what a gold mine Mignola has found.<br/><br/>I saw the original Hellboy and I was struck by the fact at the time I could enjoy this film as an action/adventure and the tongue in cheek humor that is prevalent throughout. A lot of that is due to the fact that Mignola was apparently given a free hand to bring his comic book creation to life on the big screen. A lot is also due to Ron Perlman and the marvelous character he creates beneath all that demon makeup.<br/><br/>Hellboy is brought to life by the son of Rasputin the Mad Monk in the final days of World War II. Rasputin being the good royalist he is, finds work with the Nazis who are now down to using black magic to pull out a victory. Adolph Hitler was known in fact to delve into the occult. <br/><br/>Anyway their experiments produce an infant demon plucked from the spirit world, but he's rescued by John Hurt who raises him like a son and he grows up to be butt-kicking demon Ron Perlman who's grown to like such earthly pleasures as beer and cigars. <br/><br/>Hurt functions as the Obi Won Kenobe of this piece and when he's killed, there ain't no stopping Perlman.<br/><br/>Hellboy is rollicking good fun, Hellboy II is even better and I'm sure we've got a Hellboy, III in our future."
"A_Different_Drummer","10","4","4","14 December 2013"," Did I miss the stargate to the alternate film dimension?
","I look at the IMDb review tally and I have to wonder aloud whether I missed the Stargate to the alternate film dimension where every director is as good as Del Toro, and therefore every film is as good as Hellboy?? Because only in such an alternate dimension, where such films are commonplace, would the mediocre score be justified. Lets get to the point. Tel Toro is one of the greatest living directors, period. Although I did not ""love"" MAMA, for example, as a total experience, I was mesmerized. That's what Del Toro does. He mesmerizes. (I did love the Orphanage, one of the greatest horror films of all time and largely unknown in NA). But what makes this production extra-special is Perlman. In case anyone missed it, Ron is a solid actor whose career by and large is one B-movie after another. And, if he is not starring in a B-Movie, then he is in a supporting role in an A-movie -- eg, Driver. Here, Ron not only gets to star but steals scene after scene. For all his size and presence, he manages to present Hellboy both as a capable hero and at the same time a fratboy jealous of his girl (Blair.) As much as I loved the sequel (it was great) I gave a top score to this one because of the sheer joy of discovery the viewer gets to experience when encountering this team (Del Toro, Blair, Perlman) for the very first time."
"loganx-2","8","4","4","11 June 2008"," Red Horns Do It Better...
","Great comic series, good times on screen. Del Toro doesn't capture the shadowiness and the Gothic art of the books, but does the get the heart of the material, and plays it well between lighthearted comedy, lighthearted action, and as much weirdness(talking corpses, psychic merman, pyroknesis, Rasputin, clockwork Nazi assassins, and Cthulu, to name a few of the flourishes), as the story can handle.<br/><br/>It is a super-hero movie, but one that mixes in occult myths, weird tales, and conspiracy theories, into a fine entertainment brew. Can't wait to see the next installment in the ""The Golden Army"". One of the best comic to film adaptations, not for style, but for heart and for fun's sake."
"MovieMannia","8","8","10","9 January 2008"," A New Look at ""Hellboy""
","There's a new trailer out for the sequel to Guillermo del Toro's 2004 ""Hellboy,"" which made me remember the original. I saw it in the theaters back when it was released, and frankly, didn't like it very much. Seeing the new trailer, and given del Toro's new found fame and recognition from the success of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" I felt compelled to give ""Hellboy"" another try.<br/><br/>My main complaint with ""Hellboy"" is more theological and philosophical than stylistic. Spiritually speaking, I don't proscribe to the traditional Catholic belief that we are born into sin. I believe that people are fundamentally good, and become evil through their choices. So the idea of a hero who comes from hell, who is fundamentally bad, who then chooses to be good doesn't really jive with my sense of the human experience. Consequently, I didn't walk away from the film, having one of those profound spiritual experiences like I've had from movies like ""The Matrix"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""<br/><br/>But on this latest viewing I tried to set aside this more philosophical complaint and examine the film on a more entertainment level. Technically speaking, I enjoyed the film a lot this time around. Stylistically, it's near perfect film-making. <br/><br/>Del Toro, as shown in ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" has a real gift for creating unique creatures and monsters. Every villain, monster, and character in ""Hellboy"" is fascinating. There's an almost abstractness to their design that makes them feel like they're out of a very strange dream- like/fairy tale.<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch. Special effects shouldn't draw too much attention to themselves. Sometimes filmmakers can overreach and the effects look cheesy. This movie blends both old and new methods, creating a film that draws you in rather than reminding you that you're watching something fake. I appreciate that Hellboy is acted by a real actor, wearing prosthetics, which always looks better than even the best CGI.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the Hellboy character this time around as well. He's sarcastic, insecure, funny, sensitive, and tough. I really got a kick out of his little scene where he's trying to write a love letter to Liz and he asks, ""What's a good word for need?"" His staggering love- sickness over Liz is one of the most human and endearing aspects to his character. I also like his common muttering of, ""Crap!"" in the face of very large and scary monsters.<br/><br/>The ""Hellboy"" script has great pacing as well. It's not too short, not too long. It just clips along like a good action flick should, always understandable, always inventive, always fun. This is a good old-fashioned B-movie.<br/><br/>If ""Hellboy"" resonated on a spiritual level, it would be a great film. Without viable spiritual depth, it remains good entertainment. Not a bad accomplishment nonetheless."

","Ron Perlman. I've seen his face before but never been inclined to put a name to it. His performance in Hellboy changes all that.<br/><br/>The film is undoubtedly an entertainment. It's a comic book story with the usual spectacular effects we take for granted these days but Red Ron is the star. The effects are merely supportive, the way they should be.<br/><br/>Charismatic is probably the word to explain his performance. It certainly raised my interest in the comic plot. An icon for weak willed smokers everywhere, a rarity in the media these days.<br/><br/>BTW, where do I get one of those clockwork heart tickers. Sounds like a marketable idea to me."

I was looking forward to this movie FOREVER as a huge fan of the character, and knowing PERLMAN would play him made it that much better. No one in the world could screw this up. Wow. Was i wrong or what? Perlman ended up being about the only thing that made this movie tolerable. Horrid effects, Selma's dry acting (Oh wow. i can make fire. meh. seems to be her general attitude), and a poorly laid out story. There's just nothing here for any Hellboy fans. Except perlman.

"Boba_Fett1138","6","65","118","5 March 2005"," Quite stylish but somewhat disappointing movie.
","Director Guillermo del Toro already showed with his previous movies that he has a great visual style. ""Hellboy"" is no exception and it has a great dark comic book atmosphere. Too bad that the story and most of the characters don't really work out the way they're supposed to.<br/><br/>The character of Hellboy self works out just great! This is thanks to mainly Ron Perlman but also to the very convincing make-up effects. The rest of the characters feel like they are only put in the movie to fill up the screen. Selma Blair is very boring as Liz Sherman and it never became clear to me in the movie why professor Bloom, out of all people picked John Myers. Not really a good character either. The two characters Abe Sapien and Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful!), who were about the two most entertaining characters, disappear way too soon out of the movie. But most disappointing are the villains which are often the most important in 'super-hero' movies like these. Having Rasputin as the main villain of course is already a ridiculous idea itself but on top of that he simply isn't a very good and convincing villain. Uber-Nazi Karl Ruprect Kroenen is a way more interesting villain. He is the kind of villain I love in movies, cool outfit, awesome weapons, he can't seem to die and he has no lines. Excellent, scary, cool and mysterious all in one. Not bad for a 107 year old. He also was way more better than the most of the time, special effects monsters.<br/><br/>The special effects were at times good, mediocre and just at times unconvincing.<br/><br/>The action also was somewhat disappointing. I think this is due to the wrong offbeat pace in the movie. Everything is happening way too fast. One moment Hellboy is giving away some great, fun and cool one-liners and the next he's fighting a monster in the subway. Because everything is happening so fast, the story also isn't always easy to follow. The movie wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped and expected. I'm sure that when I read the script I would like the story better than I did while watching the movie.<br/><br/>It still is a somewhat entertaining movie to watch but not one that I would recommend to everyone. However I'm still looking forward to ""Hellboy 2"" also because 'superhero' sequels are only getting better and better these last couple of years (""Spider-Man 2"", ""X2""). Hopefully the title will be; ""Hellboy 2: The Return of Kroenen""? One could only wish for...<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","A lot of the movie kept throwing new ideas and twists in but nothing was developed.  Characters had extremely small roles.  John Myers was hardly developed and yet played a crucial role in the end??  His credability was not brought out enough.  And the powers of Rasputin were not really shown, he just kind of did everything he did with no real motivation.  Characters were just kind of left out?<br/><br/>Hellboy's one-liners got old --Very old.  He only spoke to an 8-year old in full speech and the sad attempt of a love scene in the end.<br/><br/>Overall the movie had  the right idea but substance was lacking.  The script could have  used several revisions and a sequel would be a bad idea."

Hellboy looked like he was wrapped in foam painted over with cheap red fingernail polish.  Abe Sapien looked even cheesier, and Liz Sherman looked like a junkie instead of the love interest.  The special effects were below average quality.  The villains were a waste of screen time since they didn't even convey enough character for the audience to even dislike them.<br/><br/>
To get at least part of my money's worth I sat through the whole thing unlike half the audience which walked out.  I lost to perfectly good hours of my life and six dollars watching this monstrosity of a movie.  Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage."
"Maciste_Brother","1","26","44","25 January 2005"," Hellboy? More like Drearyboy!
","I didn't like HELLBOY. In fact, I didn't like ANYTHING about HELLBOY, which is a first. You see, even if I don't like a movie, I always try to find something in it, like a certain scene or piece of music or some acting, that's good in an otherwise awful production. Well, not with HELLBOY. I couldn't find anything original or worthwhile in the entire super derivative film.<br/><br/>This film is so derivative that I actually had to make a list of movies/TV shows HELLBOY reminded me of: X-MEN (group of mutant like heroes); X-FILES (secret government esoteric department); MEN IN BLACK (see X-FILES); THE RELIC (the monsters and the whole scene at the museum); THE FIFTH ELEMENT (a character's secret power which can change the world); FIRESTARTER (easy one there...); RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (HELLBOY's beginning looks like the ending in RAIDERS); THE KEEP (about Nazis trying to resurrect an evil force for their own good); LEGEND (big red horny guy played by Tim Curry)...on and on it goes. This movie has almost not a single trace of originality in it. It's truly amazing.<br/><br/>But what's unforgettably bad about HELLBOY, aside from the bad script and bad acting from the entire dull cast, is the whole direction and tone of it. It's leaden, super slow and DREARY. It makes the following unoriginal proceedings that much more difficult to watch or sit through. It's simply awful. As fun as nails on a chalkboard. The director is known to be a ""fanboy"". Fanboys should never make movies."
"jamesrupert2014","8","3","3","4 February 2019"," Good, demi-demonic fun
","During a secret Nazi paranormal experiment in Scotland, a red and horned child from the nether-regions crosses into our reality. He grows up to be 'Hellboy', an agent of 'The Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense' and becomes our hope when a reborn Rasputin unleashes a fecund demon as part of a plan to bring about an 'end-of-days' apocalypse. Typical of a Guillermo del Toro film, the imagery is striking, especially the brief scenes of a post-apocalyptic Earth. The characters, drawn from the 'Hellboy' series of graphic novels (created by Mike Mignola, which I have not read) are imaginative and engaging and the production team do an excellent job in bringing them to the screen. I particularly liked Kroenen (Ladislav Beran), the self-mutilating, 'clockwork' Nazi assassin, the character design and make-up is outstanding. Ron Perlman, also under a lot of makeup, is quite good playing the wisecracking titular demi-demon, as are Doug Jones (equally made-up) as Abe Sapien, the PBRD's amphibious scholar-agent, and the ever-moribund John Hurt as Prof. Bruttenholm, Hellboy's adoptive father. All in all, a great 'superhero' film: clever, fast-moving, fun, and much more imaginative than most of the films in the better known DC or MCU franchises."
"lord-of-the-lez","9","3","3","5 January 2019"," Hits All the Sweet Spots
","This movie hits all the sweet spots for me. It has action, Lovecraft-esque horror/supernatural elements, emotional intensity, interesting heroes...and cats. Lots of cats.<br/><br/>And that mainly has to do with Hellboy himself. He is such a compelling character. He's an otherworldly beast who was raised by humans to be a good person. He fights monsters because his monstrosity enables him to know them well. He feels the pressure to look and act like a human as best he can so he won't be lumped in with other monsters. He kicks ass and acts macho, smoking cigarettes in a cool demeanor...yet, his many adopted cats shows that he has a soft side. And this vulnerable side is seen even further when we see how deeply he feels for the woman he loves. Unlike most heroes in the MCU, Hellboy has depth and charm to his personality that wins you over in an instant.<br/><br/>Hellboy just might be my favorite superhero movie."

"bowmanblue","9","3","3","20 March 2018"," They don't make 'em like they used to
","If ever there was a film that probably shouldn't work, it was one about a reformed demon, born during World War II and designed to help the Nazis take over the world, but now spends his time slaying monsters and saving the world instead. 'Hellboy' was a film made in 2004 and came just before the massive resurgence in comic book adaptations which, to this day, still dominates the Box Office with superhero movies. It's a strange kind of film that, although popular enough to generate (and equally good, in my opinion) sequel, it never got the third part to send off the character and give him the trilogy of films that us die-hard fans felt that he deserved. The reason I say it's 'strange' is because (like many, I guess) I never knew much about the film before watching it at the cinema. I didn't know it was based on a comic and merely saw the posters advertising the movie prior to its release. I knew that (the ever brilliant) Ron Perlman was in it and that was enough for me. The fact that much marketing material centred on a giant demon silhouette sporting a huge firearm was merely a bonus for an action/horror fan like myself. <br/><br/>I watched it, really enjoyed it, and didn't think that much more of it. However, now I can see in these days of 'mega-franchises' why it didn't quite set the Box Office alight like it should. By its initial marketing, it looks like an outright horror film. However, it's actually a superhero film that borrows horror tropes, plus it was made before the superhero/MCU really took off. Nowadays, we're well used to rooting for our heroes after they've been granted some sort of special power enabling them to fight the forces of darkness, but most of them look like Chris Evans or Chris Hemsworth, rather than a giant, ugly, red, semi-horned monster. I guess what I'm saying is that 'Hellboy' was destined to have a real 'niche audience.'<br/><br/>However, if what I've already said intrigues you, I do recommend giving it a watch. First of all, it stars Ron Perlman as the titular anti-hero. Now, he's normally good in whatever he's in, but it's fair to say that he carries this film completely on his broad (red) shoulders. The other cast members, including John Hurt and Selma Blair, are good too, but it's Ron's show (although I should probably give a nod to Jeffrey Tambor as the long-suffering head of Hellboy's secret Government unit).<br/><br/>There's not an awful lot to say about the plot. If you've seen one superhero movie (regardless of when it was released) then you can probably predict what will happen - evil megalomaniac wants to take over the world, hero has to put the brakes on that one. However, Hellboy does it slightly differently simply because of its general 'horror' look and feel. But - don't worry - it's not all Gothic darkness - there's plenty of top-notch action scenes, cheeky one-liners from our cigar-chomping, cat-petting red hero and special effects that look more on the 'practical' side, rather than an excessive use of CGI. It's worth mentioning the effects because Hellboy's make-up is particularly simple, yet flawless in bringing the character to life. He's pretty scary at the best of times and the only things more ugly are the beasties he's sent to despatch before they destroy the world (that clockwork assassin-Nazi still gives me the creeps!).<br/><br/>Even though I stand by my belief that 'Hellboy' stands up today as it did when it was released, I know there's a reboot in the pipeline. I'll watch that too, simply because I like the way the film is done. However, I have my doubts that anyone can fill Ron's big red boots and whatever we'll get next (instead of the much desired third part in this franchise) will be nothing more than a studio trying to cash in on the superhero craze and going for an easy cash-grab."
"generationofswine","8","3","3","26 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","It is a lot of fun, it has a sense of humor...it is flawed.<br/><br/>Hellboy is one of those movies that seems to suffer from a lack of elaboration. There are elements in the films that are beyond interesting, things that we as an audience would like to see more of, things that we would like to know more about.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film never goes into it and that is possibly because there was never an intent to turn Hellboy into an out and out franchise. Because of that the mythology that the movie hints at is only given a lip service and it is done to move the plot along.<br/><br/>It is a shame. It touches enough on it's own little mythology that it could have been an X-Files style franchise with a superhero.<br/><br/>Instead of that you get an entertaining movie and really little more. The elements are there but they had to move along.<br/><br/>What remains is a fun film with a good sense of humor, an action movie that took a bit of time to develop a few characters and make sure to give the others a real personality.<br/><br/>It is not bad, but it is frustrating watching it, no matter how fun it is, because you know what could have been."
"sam_smithreview","10","3","3","25 April 2016"," What a Comic book film! Just Brilliant
","Hellboy was a 10 out of 10 for me, but there are a number of criteria for any viewer to have such a high opinion of it. One, even though director Guillermo del Toro is a big fan of the Hellboy comic books and many comments have been made by him, comic creator Mike Mignola and others that the film is faithful to the books, they've also said they've changed it to suit the context of the film, so you have to not be a purist about source material to screen translations (or current screen instantiations). Two, you have to have a taste for fantasy where the creators are not very concerned with making the material coherent with or plausible in the actual world. Three, you have to enjoy your fantasy both very dark (on the horror side) and humorous/sarcastic at the same time. Four, you have to like an epic, sprawling feel to your fantasy. And Five, you have to not hate cgi creatures. I meet all of those criteria. How many you meet will likely determine how well you'll like Hellboy.<br/><br/>What worked best for me was the material that showed Hellboy, portrayed exquisitely by Ron Perlman, as just a regular guy cum sassy detective. Even though he's half demon, a large part of the comics, at least-- and this is hinted at in the film, particularly in the climax--is a continual nature versus nurture ""debate"". He was raised by humans who were as normal as they could be, being government agents in a bureau dedicated to the paranormal. So he has a large number of human-like quirks, including a love of old music, beer, cats, pancakes, chili, and so on. He's also a cigar-smoking, smart-asset detective. Hellboy is at its best when it focuses on these characteristics.<br/><br/>Also worth noting is the cinematography/Special Effects crew and set designs, which was consistently beautiful, and ranges from the popular recent trend of more monochromatic textures (blue is the color of choice here), to the strong chiaroscuro of the comic books, to striking contrasts, such as a mostly monochromatic scene which is suddenly penetrated by a supersaturated red stream of blood. The sets are all engaging, and amazingly large in scale from interior to exterior."
"garyvanhorn","9","3","3","11 January 2011"," I should have seen it on the big screen.
","I really regret not seeing Hellboy in the theater. The comic book it is based on is printed by Dark Horse Comics, a relatively small independent publisher that most people have never heard of. I flipped through the source material and was not impressed, I mean really, a demon that wants to be human, a fish guy and an out of control psychokinetic fight the things that go bump in the night, sounds really lame to me. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>Hellboy is both engrossing and visually spectacular. The plot is a little more complicated to explain properly than is convenient here so I'll merely say that powerful Nazi occultists have set a plan in motion to unleash forces that will destroy the Earth and it is up to the bizarre collection of unlikely heroes at the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense to stop them. Nazis are great villains, nobody ever doubts their sheer capacity for evil, add the fact that they are chaos worshiping occultists and you have some truly diabolical foes.<br/><br/>Ron Pearlman is fantastic as Hellboy, who is, much like Vincent from Beauty and the Beast, a misunderstood monster that wishes, more than anything, to fit in and be normal. To facilitate this he grinds down his horns in order to look more human. Of course a seven foot tall, 500 pound, red skinned, stone fisted demon with a tail won't appear human under any circumstances but this small bit of silliness underscores a tender side to the often gruff and rebellious Hellboy. It's small details like these that make the movie so enjoyable to watch, like little Easter eggs, each revealing a little secret about the strange creatures before us. I was very pleasantly surprised by Hellboy, and you will be too."

","When I first saw the trailers for this flick I knew I had to see it!! Guillermo Del Toro did a fantastic job of bringing Mike Mignola's comic to life. For years I had always wondered how a Hellboy film would look, seeing as the comic was different than traditional superhero comic books. Thankfully, the director doesn't let us down. But who could play such a role? Ron Perlman answers the call and it's because of him that many people like me have come to love this film. He plays Hellboy jut right, delivering the right comic touches. But that's not to say the rest of the cast isn't up to par.<br/><br/>Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, all are superb. I love the conflict between Hellboy and Jeffery Tambor's character and add tension but also comedy. Kronen is my favorite villain in the movie but the real highlights are definitely the fights with Sammeal, the one in the subway being the best action scene in the whole film. To add to this there are some great sets and one can easily tell this a Mike Mignola adaption. One has got to love the BPRD (Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense) sets, especially the library one. Marco Beltrami completes the movie with a bad-ass score and I certainly hope he returns to do the sequel's music. Overall this film will appeal more to specific audiences then to main stream ones, but I think everyone will find something to enjoy in it. A true genre-bending, one to remember, Del Toro flick."

The effects are very special, the mise en film is interesting to view, and the scenes are arranged with the care of a great director and the fast-paced yet somehow somber and dramatic feel of the comic. The film contains many in-jokes that only readers of the comic will get, and actually has the feel of Mignola's work sprung to life.<br/><br/>The plot is a collection of coolnesses. Nazis summoning demons! Wind-up mechanical swordfighters from hell! Red 6'5 demons saving kittens while holding the tongue of the Hound of Resurrection! Giant hammers pounding already precarious walkways into oblivion! But seriously, this film's plot might not have won academy awards, but that isn't the point.

","Perlman is a demon from another dimension, rescued at the end of World War 2 by John Hurt. Almost sixty years later, Hellboy is a member of an elite paranormal defense unit, along with a strange guy who looks like the Creature from the Black Lagoon's peaceful cousin, and Selma Blair, who's a pyrokinetic. They end up fighting the same group who brought Hellboy to Earth, led by Rasputin, of all people.<br/><br/>Very entertaining story based on a comic book I've never really followed. It's carried completely by Perlman, who delivers an amazing performance underneath all of that makeup and makes what would seem like absurd situations (Hellboy battling a monster and trying to save a box of kittens), rote situations (his interactions with Hurt, who he considers a father), and hackneyed situations (his love story with Blair, made difficult by his appearance) believable and even touching.<br/><br/>Most everybody else in the movie does a fine job as well, although I think Blair's role was somewhat underwritten and her motivations a bit opaque, especially early on.<br/><br/>The effects are decent, although it's fair to say the action doesn't really take off. On the other hand, it's hard to know how del Toro would really sell a battle with a Lovecraft-style monster in a library in any ""realistic"".

","If you are like me, and thought that this movie just might be worth seeing in theaters, I'm here to warn you that it's not.  I went in without hearing anything about it, knowing nothing of where hell boy came from, and hoped that I could lend an unprejudiced view.  Right from the start, the movie begins throwing characters, important concepts, and bizarre events at you. Thinking that most of these things will be explained, you wait....and wait. The truth is, no explanation ever comes.  You never really even figure out what Hell boy is or who he is.  This goes for most every character in the movie.  All of them are developed only enough to loosely connect the plot, which suffers from the same development issues.  I'm not an idiot who can't things out on my own, the others who went with me also had fifty questions, and we all had different answers when we walked out.  The acting is not good, but it is bearable, and only hurts the film in a few places, thankfully. Basically, you're going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on and who everyone is, and you'll have lots of time to ponder since this movie is mostly just a few long, drug-out action sequences anway. Save your money, folks."

","No word on the story. It's a adaptation of a (comic) book, so the film is not responsible.<br/><br/>But the film is responsible for the bad special effects, for the poor sound, for the pathetic scenes, for the lifeless actors and for wasting my time.<br/><br/>It's like a bad demo of a graphic cards abilities, only disturbed minimal by the ""story"" and pathetic and lame acting. Hellboy has much of Blade (Blade 2): a boring, supercool dude, nearly unstoppable and instead of ideas he solves most with his immortality. He gets crushed in several walls, falls down far distances and gets one wound on his arm and ONE scratch in his face in the hole film. Wow, it's thrilling like a tank attacked by soldiers with bare hands.<br/><br/>Get some GOOD comics and read them...but don't waste your time on this lifeless film."

The only thing hellish about this film is that it is certainly a marriage made in hell, between nothing and nonsense, baloney and balderdash. These films should carry a physiological health warning so as not to damage one's spirit to the point where one might believe that all good film makers have left the planet and their resources have been handed to the dunderheads who have make this classic piece of trite garbage just like it's sister in arms ""League of Extraordinary Twaddle"".

","Hellacious Spoilers.<br/><br/>They say he's from Hell ¬ñ now is that the Christian version or the ancient Jewish version? Or the Greek version, or Nordic, or Moslem? Why, there are as many versions of Hell as demons FROM there. But enough about George Bush Junior.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic example of hype over-riding content. I am as big a fan of comics/graphic novels as the next geek-cheese, but I am a bigger fan of well-made movies, and ""Hellboy"", for all its glitz and glam-blammo, is not a well-made movie. ""Beige"" is a suitable adjective, for though it LOOKS fine (the costuming, set dressing, cinematography are without fault), the stunted attempts at humor, romance and plot construction leave the viewer slightly crestfallen.<br/><br/>For example, it was not made clear at all that THE Rasputin was the monk attempting to open the gates of hell with special effects. This doesn't make for an effective foreshadowing device if this same character turns up later and we are unclear as to who he is.<br/><br/>Then there are the large gaps in continuity, as when Hellboy and his goth chick are cornered by Too-Much-CGI and she uses her power of fire-starting to defeat the CGI ¬ñ suddenly we are in another sewer-like lab with Hellboy strapped down and the fate of the universe in the balance ¬ñ wha-? Apparently, Hellboy's brick fist plays an important role in unlocking some gateway to Huge Savings or something and Rasputin wants to be the first in that door.<br/><br/>You lost me.<br/><br/>There were many scenes which brick-walled in this manner and I was sure that somewhere along the way, all would be explained to my Pre-MTV consciousness. But my hopes that that would happen were dashed when about five minutes before film's-end, a gargantuan entity which had nothing to do with previous creatures, villains, plot or character development ¬ñ but everything to do with throwing superfluous special effects at the viewer in a last-ditch attempt to have them exit the film with a hellishly-unnecessary image burned into their neo-cortexes ¬ñ grabs Hellboy and quickly gets killed by his big gun. That event proved that this movie was made for a demographic still conversant with transforming robots into trucks. And I knew I would get no explanations¬Ö <br/><br/>The characters evoked no sympathy from me. As far as I'm concerned, Anthony Daniels should sue the fish-guy character. And I find it hard to believe that Selma Blair was the best they could come up with for the clinically-depressed goth chick ¬ñ why, the casting call should have turned up thousands of this species in Orange County alone. The young detective was a formless puddle. John Hurt tried, I'll give him that. And Rasputin chewed some scenery.<br/><br/>Granted, Ron Perlman was the only person on earth who could have pulled off the lone, laconic, lantern-jawed Hellboy, and his tale IS one of Grande Concept. It was just not executed terribly well.<br/><br/>There are intimations of deeper messages, such as teen alienation and social outcasting, but they are not dwelled upon, and one of these ""teen-love"" scenes between Hellboy and his goth chick is one of those non sequitur brick walls.<br/><br/>There were many reasons the movie lacked a sense of grand scale, one of them being Hellboy's major battles against creatures which were simply unimportant cogs in some other being's master plan. There were many replications of one single creature, which resembled a triceratops with a medusa's head, Hellboy having to chase down and fight a LOT of them. Consequently, he seemed to be making no headway whatsoever and it didn't give the audience a sense that he was moving up a progressive ladder of evil, soon to face the Inglorious Mastermind behind the Grand Plot. It gave us a sense that we should have seen the matin√©e for three bucks less.<br/><br/>Also, I think the Long Leather Coat thing has run its course as Hard Guy Haute Couture, fellas¬Ö<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

"kurt49","4","17","29","25 August 2007"," Obvious potential wasted
","Hellboy revolves around classic comic book/action/superhero genre story lines. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth. He is brought up from a child by a priest and within a government society and has chosen to protect the people of earth from the supernatural, rather then be a menace (the normal career route for a demon).<br/><br/>The set up of the story involves creative uses of history, combining Nazi experiments with the occult. It's preposterous, but so is the whole idea of a demon roaming the streets. I find the explanations of the characters, who they are and how they came to be very well handled. The sequences are to the point and very entertaining. In fact the opening is the best part of the film, therein lays the problem¬Ö.<br/><br/>Essentially Del Toro who both writes and directs this piece bottles it. The film is absent of all tension or any major conflict. Hellboy is essentially established as invincible within the first act and so the rest of the film comprises of scenes in which any conflict is automatically rather crass because we know inevitably Hellboy will be OK and the bad guy will die. I hear you cry that this is the case for any action/hero film. Well yes it is, but once we are drawn into a well made action film we can't help but feel the hero may die. Die Hard works because John Mclane looks likely to die at all parts. He escapes death by the slimmest of margins. The stakes are raised as his wife is also in danger etc etc¬Ö Terminator and Terminator two work because in both cases the villain is far superior than the hero. The threat and tension is constant.<br/><br/>Some of the other major weaknesses are: Del Toro is also guilty of employing deus ex machina. Characters generally disappear and reappear as their skills are needed within the story. The villain is featured in maybe three scenes. He has no motives. Turns up unexpectedly and inexplicably. In the one scene Hellboy looks to be up against a real threat (groups of monsters) a character unleashes her abilities - the screen fades to white and inexplicably the monsters are dead but everybody else lives. A minor character established in an irritating and undeveloped love story becomes the key to the conclusion of the film. Her character is so thin, the relationship so undeveloped. It is clear she is nothing more than a prop of sorts to push the plot along and to make it all make sense. I don't want to ruin the ending of the film but essentially a character that is dead is miraculously and unbelievably brought back to life¬Ö.<br/><br/>The film suffers from poor dialogue and one liners that just aren't smart or funny. After a while it all starts to grate.<br/><br/>What's more Del Toro blows the action scenes with some uninspired visuals. And whoever made the creative decision to make hellboy's primary weapon a gun instead of his clunking arm should be fired. Essentially the use of the gun weakens the concept of the film, degrading the fights to nothing more than a one sided shoot out <br/><br/>The few positives include: The cinematography is very good. At all times a sense of mood is established by the dark lighting and the darker colour palette. As well as the use of interesting locations. Yet perhaps it is all a bit samey as well.<br/><br/>The use of cgi and Fx is well done. Never do we get an over load. When effects are used they are used well and the sense of realism is kept. Rather similar to how Nolan used FX in batman. I much prefer this method to the overtop effects we often see.<br/><br/>All in all this is a pretty poor film. The real shame is that (despite not reading the comics) I found the film wasted a lot of potential. Hellboy as a character has a lot of instantly apparent fascinating dimensions which are completely unexplored. The film has watch-ability, in the sense that if it comes on TV and nothing else is on it might be worth a viewing. But in any other situation I wouldn't bother with it."

","Hellboy did have its fun moments but it just seemed too over the top for my tastes. It featured too many cheesy moments that ruined the feel of the film. There was also an underlying frustration factor present as the movie unfolded. I don't think the director was aware of this mounting viewer frustration but he re-enforced it with practically every scene.  The good guys were buying the farm at every turn.  From the beginning with the Nazi slice and dice to the museum guard massacre to agent after agent of the bureau being slaughtered to innocent guards and bystanders dying to poppa Hellboy through the end, I hate the overwhelming supernatural enemy that can't be killed but takes out good guy after good guy.  It's one thing to establish a horrific and formidable villain but it's another to frustrate the viewer.  This movie had more of the flavor of an idiotic Freddy Kruger movie instead of the feel of a good comic/action film. It seemed more interested in making the audience delight in the way people were killed instead of portraying the actions of the lead hero.  When the agent with Hellboy that had the talking half corpse on his back was killed by the giant hammer/pendulum fell to his death, did anyone laugh at that subtitle? This director missed the mark by being all over the place in terms of style and he seems to be too warped to notice.  The ending also seemed so very anti-climatic. Spoilers ......................... ...................................................... ........................ ................. The mastermind of all this carnage has a giant squid jump out of him and gets squashed by it off camera??? What??? An interesting effort but this film is ultimately a failure because the plot couldn't keep up with the CGI.

It was very entertaining from the beginning to end, the atmosphere was dark, wonderful and the visuals were captivating, showing us a lot of unique, weird creatures that are creepy but beautiful to look at the same time.<br/><br/>The story was quite simplistic, but it was very funny to watch, mostly because of the characters: I think that Ron Perlman is a great actor, and here he made one of his best performances. Also, Jeffrey Tambor, from ""Arrested Development"" makes here another funny, interesting character. Doug Jones (The creepy Pale Man and the faun from Pan's Labyrinth)made a great work with his character. The rest of the cast is just perfect as well. Guillermo del Toro is a great filmmaker and Hellboy is one of the best superhero films ever made. I give ten stars, because it was a great fantasy film."

","It's hard to be a freak, even when you have been brought to life by Rasputin, Hitler and a few other crazy humans. But even Satan can fall in love with another freak of his type and even Satan can be attached to the catholic professor who became his father, the one who provided him with candy and sweets, because Satan has a sweet tooth. Satan somewhere is slightly human and a tiny bit catholic. A cross may burn his palm but when it has been served to him for sixty years by a benevolent old man who he considers his father he may start to like it, to love him and then to hate those who are on the other side. Don't expect any kind of deep emotional feelings though but expect some beautiful special effects that look so realistic that they will make you thrill and shiver. And what's more they will be exotic and lead you to rainy New York City and snowy Moscow and underground everywhere, in the NYC subway or in some Russian cemetery. You will meet with dead people who are revived and then can lead you to the very center of hell, or with surgical fetishists who have recomposed their bodies bone by bone and muscle by muscle. But the most attractive element is in the use of fire, the fascination with fire and that has to do with the constant reference to the apocalypse, that of the Book of Revelation of course? Fire seen as the ultimate cleansing element that can bring the universe to its end or destroy up all evil from earth. The ambivalence of this fire is fairly surprising in many ways since most people are afraid of fire and here it is the ultimate redeeming element. It is true when you are surrounded by meters of snow and tons of ice you are grateful for one little small fire in the living room hearth. And be satisfied: the FBI director who is in charge will end up locked up underground to die peacefully, at least deep enough for no one to be pestered by his protest and yelling.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","Guillermo del Toro proved his feeling for comic-book styled action with Blade 2. So it's maybe no surprise that this movie is also full of just that: feeling.<br/><br/>Hellboy is the story of a demon who came to earth as a child. He was part of Rasputins evil plan to destroy humanity, but the demon child was rescued and raised to good instead. Now he, and a bunch of other special heroes, fight the occult evils in modern day society. Rasputin is back though, and he has other plans for Hellboy...<br/><br/>There are a couple of factors that make this one of the most successful comic-book adventures i've seen so far in terms of style. First of all the casting is perfect throughout. Ron Perlman is very entertaining as Hellboy, and the other parts of the cast are equally up to their tasks. The special effects are also excellent, among the better i've seen actually. The action sequences are also well done without being too excessive. But mostly it's the feeling for what does and does not work that strikes me with this movie. Guillermo Del Toro seems to really like the genre and know exactly what he wanted out of this film.<br/><br/>Of course there are also flaws as always. For instance the movie becomes a little silly sometimes, and a bit more action wouldn't have hurt i think. Mostly though i feel the ending, without saying too much, is sort of an anticlimax. But all in all this is very entertaining in a way that comic-book action should be. I rate it 7/10."
"oneflewovertheapocalypse","Null","4","5","8 September 2004"," Approach with Caution
","Hellboy started off like no other comic book film I have seen in a long time. It reminded me more of an Indiana Jones film the way the Nazis and Rasputin were trying to open the gate you could say, so it does have a very strong beginning, but after that it feels like the director lost his way really as the movie doesn't really go anywhere, if it does I must have missed something. For me I need a little characterization and bit of story but this film just flew past every plot hole and didn't correct it.<br/><br/>John Hurt was on very good form just as I expected, Ron Pearlman was very good also as Hellboy but I don't like the way they portray him. It has some really good characters who start good but end in a way you don't really care anymore. It keeps your attention and then it is taken away from. No new fresh ideas or action set pieces makes this film overall quite a dull one. I would say Ron Pearlman is the best thing about this movie as his portrayal of Hellboy is more comical than scary. If your wanting your summer blockbuster then Hellboy is your film but if your looking for some in-depth movie about a comic book character than I would say Hulk is the one you should be dividing your attention to. Hellboy isn't awful but it isn't great or even very good. Approach with caution."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","5","7","28 January 2007"," Stops short of being a great comic-book movie.
","As far as most comic-book movies go, they usually follow the same-old path of showing us the origins of whatever hero for about 45 minutes before getting into a real (but usually superficial) plot. This can lead to a never-ending list of deadbeats such Hulk, Spider-Man and Catwoman and rarely ends up with a good movie (Batman Begins is one rare example). Guillermo Del Toro seems to make a compromise of introducing Baby Hellboy during the end of WWII and then flashing forward 60 years to adult HB (though genetically he's barely out of his 20s) working for the Government.<br/><br/>The Beurau of Paranormal Research uses Hellboy as a weapon against the forces of evil. Being a demon from Hell himself, but preferring to fight for the good side, HB works with Abe Sabien (a very likable sort of fish-man) and his pyro-kinetic would-be girlfriend Liz. Raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt) he regularly has fallings out with his human father and even hides his cigarette smoking from him. I find the stroppy teenager attitude a unique character quirk that works well. What's even cooler is HB fondness for cats. Which not a typical characteristic of a demon born in Hell.<br/><br/>The world's last living super-evil Nazis resurrect the mad-monk Grigori Rasputin and aim to bring about Armageddon by awakening sleeping Lovecraftian Gods, frozen in time at the edge of the universe. A tough job, even for HB, but it's all in a days work for the Beurau of Paranormal Research.<br/><br/>Del Toro works wonders in bringing to life atmospheric sets (check out the flooded subway station) and horrific creatures but stops short of making Hellboy a dark epic. The CGI is impressive and the visions of Hell are interesting but there's just some intangible element that seems to be missing and the film feels incomplete. Even the Director's Cut still feels a bit alienating.<br/><br/>However the action and humor is quite entertaining and the villains (especially 107-year-old, crazed assassin Kroenen) are definitely the kind you want to see die horribly. Enjoy it for what it is, even if you feel it's not entirely wholesome by the end."

","Until I watched this move, I new nothing about Hellboy except that he was in Injustice 2 (a DC fighting game) and that he was a demon. When I watched this film, I was completely blown away. Guillermo del Toro brings Hellboy to life with breathtaking imagery and truly likable characters. After I finished, I couldn't stop thinking about the movie.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman as Hellboy was a perfect fit. Not only did he make Hellboy seem like a real life character, he also made him so likable and human that I couldn't help but fall in love with him. Hellboy perfectly exemplifies the message of the movie: it's the choices that a man makes that truly defies him, not where he's from or what his origins are. Despite being a demon and destined to bring about the apocalypse, Hellboy shows that just because he's supposed to be the bad guy, that doesn't mean that he has to be. I truly enjoyed every single moment that he was on screen. Not only is he funny, but he's also caring, charismatic and kind-hearted and will do whatever it takes to protect his friends.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast was also amazing to watch. Abe Sapien was so likable and sweet that I loved him from the moment I saw him. John Myers is also very memorable. He's the 'good cop' to Hellboy's 'bad cop' tendencies. Myers is not only funny but also brave and kind. While I do believe that Selma Blair's acting was a little too unemotional at times, Liz was still an enjoyable and engaging. Her relationship with Hellboy was one of the best parts of the film and the flashback to her childhood was heartbreaking and a tearjerker. Professor Broom was one of my personal favorites. I loved that fact that he truly believed in Hellboy which in turn led Hellboy to become a good person and a hero. As for Jeffrey Tambor's character, not much to say except that he made some weird faces when yelling and he was pretty cool when he hit Kroenen (one of the bad guys) in the face with a gear.<br/><br/>The villains were some of my favorites ever. Rasputin and Ilsa both had a charm to them and also relished their evil deeds. Kroenen was very intimidating. Del Toro's choice to keep Kroenen's face hidden for most of the movie amped up the fear factor for me. And when it was revealed, it was really disturbing to look at. Along with his crazy fighting style, the mask Kroenen wore basically told me that this was a guy that I didn't want to mess with. Sammael and the Ogdru Jahad were also super cool. Sammael was cool looking and an incredible fighter. I really liked that he wasn't easy to beat and that he kept resurrecting. I also really liked that the Ogdru Jahad were never fully shown. The giant tentacles that are shown are scary enough. It reminds me of the Kraken. The monster as the end was good but I felt that he needed to be a bit stronger.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts of Hellboy was music. The composer outdid himself. The saddest scene, when Hellboy discovers that his dad died, has this incredible music that is so powerful and conveys just how special the professor was and how close he was with Hellboy as the latter's reaction was truly heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Overall, Hellboy is a truly amazing film that is worth watching over and over. It had great characters, visuals, music, villain, awesome theme song and a hero who truly shows that a man is defied by his choices not by fate or destiny."
"Spike-Washington","8","2","2","12 July 2018"," Good adaptation of the Dark Horse comic book
","When I heard that there was going to be a Hellboy movie I was excited. I hadn't read any of the comic books but it made me curious about the series. I watched the movie and was intrigued from start to finish. Dark fantasy with horror elements and lots of weird creatures. What more could you ask? I later found out that the first book of the series was Seed of Destruction. It's been a while since I've read the comic book and seen the movie, but I want to go back and experience both.

Guillermo Del Toro, in tradition, turns Pulp into Poetry. Hellboy has some of his best defined characters.<br/><br/>Hellboy is the reverse chosen one. Instead of the farm boy destined to prophecieded to save the world, He is told to destroy. But thanks to the nurturing of Professor Broom, He decides to fight for everything good and just.<br/><br/>What keeps this entire dilemma engaging is Hellboy's constant attitude. He is a hero, and you root for him. But it's very visible that if the wrong thing happened, He could turn to the dark side.<br/><br/>Anyone self conscious will relate to Hellboy, and for the record Hellboy and LIz is easily one of the best movie couples ever. <br/><br/>This movie is fantastic."
"elicopperman","8","2","2","7 April 2018"," An Entertaining Comic Book Adaptation Worth your Time
","In the early to mid 90s, comic artist Mike Mignola created the character Hellboy for Dark Horse comics, and the series became a favorite amongst the comic community, mainly for its dark atmosphere, gritty design and sardonic humor. Fast forward roughly 10 years later, when the director of Pan's Labyrinth and The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro, helmed a film adaptation. Despite it being more of his own interpretation of the series than Mignola's, it went on to become a cult favorite. But does this film truly stand as a worthy adaptation, or is the upcoming reboot more of a blessing in disguise?<br/><br/>The plot itself is rather simple and straight forward, as it centers around a devilish creature named Hellboy, an agent in the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, where he, the psychic merman Abe Sapien, and the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman protect America against dark forces. However, these beings called the Sammael are resurrected by Nazis in an attempt to not only open a portal to a paranormal dimension, but to also summon Hellboy in his true form. Simple enough, and most of the first half of the movie does sort of drag on at points with Hellboy trying to stop the Sammael creatures. That being said, what does keep the film going is the entertainment value, the relation between Hellboy and Liz, as well as his father, and the mythos behind the nazis plan.<br/><br/>In a way, the film is very much like a graphic novel turned into a movie, and the grim atmosphere aided by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and the production design by Stephen Scott bring out a very spooky presence to an already unsettling and suspenseful feature. Not to mention, the action scenes are very well choreographed and it shows how much hard work the stunt team put into the film (although sometimes they can be hard to make out due to the dark shadows). In addition, the makeup for Hellboy provided by the phenomenal Rick Baker is so fantastic that it's hard to only see Ron Perlman playing the character. Admittedly, the computer animation of the Sammaels and other things does look dated, although that mainly comes from the moderate budget the film had to work with, but they still look cool nonetheless.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are more of a mix; some are worth rooting for, while others feel somewhat shallow and underdeveloped. Hellboy is the tough and sarcastic albeit subtly emotional demon who knows how to pack a punch but also has more layers underneath him based on his origins, Liz is the emotionless fire starter who has to keep her powers from getting unleashed after a traumatic past, and Trevor Bruttenholm, Hellboy's adoptive father, is the most knowledgable head of the BPRD who carries a strong emotional bond with his adoptive son. Abe Sapien also has strong knowledge through being psychic, aided by a wonderful physical performance by Doug Jones. These are the characters that keep the viewer intrigued enough to follow their mission, especially to take down the notorious Rasputin who will not stop in any way to fulfill his plans of world domination.<br/><br/>However, the characters that don't stick out as much are just sort of two dimensional. John Myers is the somewhat neurotic FBI agent who tries to help out when needed, but he isn't developed enough to really warrant much stakes when he's in danger, but at least he gets brave by the third act. Tom Manning is the stuff-shirted bureaucrat who tries so stubbornly hard to do things his way over anything paranormal that he gets too annoying and selfish for his own good. Also, many of the antagonists like Kroenen and Haupstein are the typical power hungry nazis who will stand in nobody's way to get what they want. To put in bluntly, the film has its share of underdeveloped and inflexible characters as much as it has its share of highly determined, charismatic, and emotive characters.<br/><br/>Overall, while it may not pick up much until the second half and some characters are more interesting than others, Hellboy packs enough raw action and stakes, mythos of the titular character, well detailed set pieces and makeup, and even some occasional snarky humor. I think fans of the comics will get a big kick out of the film, even if it does kind of stray away from the source material, as it represents the iconic rough and sardonic agent they've come to know and love. Heck, even if you haven't read the comics, this film will be a welcome introduction to newcomers who want to get sucked into something exciting and macabre. While I'm not sure how the reboot will play out, we still have this entertaining thrill ride to get sucked into."
"Tweekums","8","2","2","6 July 2017"," A demonic superhero
","In late 1944 a group of Nazis, with the help of Rasputin, the 'Mad Monk' who didn't die as history told us, attempt to open a portal to a demonic realm hoping to unleash various demonic forces. They are stopped by a group of US soldiers guided by Professor Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm. One demon comes through the portal; a young red demon with one outsized hand, horns and a tail. Cutting forward to the present day the demon, dubbed 'Hellboy' has grown up and is working for a US government agency that deals with paranormal threats. We are introduced to this agency as Agent John Myers arrives for his first day working there.<br/><br/>It turns out that two of the Nazis survived and are apparently unaged; they resurrect Rasputin before summoning a hellhound known as Sammael. Hellboy manages to defeat the Sammael but there is a complication; every time it is killed two more soon appear! As well as dealing with Rasputin, the Nazis and the Sammaels Hellboy has another problem; he has feelings for a girl named Liz, who can start fires, but can't bring himself to tell her how he feels. To make matters worse she seems to be getting closer to Agent Meyers. Inevitably there will be final confrontation as Rasputin tries to force Hellboy to open the portal and begin the apocalypse.<br/><br/>This is certainly different to most superhero moves; not only is Hellboy a demon but apart from being very strong and impervious to fire he doesn't have the usual wide range of superpowers. He is also officially denied and has no human alter ego¬Ö he is always Hellboy. Director Guillermo del Toro does a great job bringing the story to the screen; not that I was too surprised as he seems to understand how to do monsters and other fantastical creatures. Ron Perlman is great in the role; he gives us a delightfully grumpy yet witty hero. The villains are suitable evil; Nazis are good go-tos when you want a nasty villain and Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is particularly menacing thanks to his mask and the fact that he appears to be less than human. If that weren't enough we have Rasputin; a menace from Tsarist Russia and the Sammaels which are impressive CGI creations. As well as Hellboy there are other impressive 'good guys'; Selma Blair is good, if a little underused, as Liz; Rupert Evans did a fine job as Agent Meyers and John Hurt brings a touch of class as the older Prof Broom. Doug Jones was also rather fun as Abe Sapien, an aquatic supernatural creature with some interesting powers. There is a good amount of varied action which features impressive special effects. Overall I enjoyed this more than I expected and would certainly recommend it to fans of the superhero genre especially if you want something a little different."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","2","2","15 December 2016"," Del Toro and Perlman make magic
","Guillermo Del Toro's two Hellboy films are a wildly different pair, both incredible thrill rides and well worth anyone's time, but I think I will always prefer the first. With the second he took the Pan's Labyrinth approach, presenting a fairy tale world and showcasing makeup effects that were very similar to that film, an esoteric and elemental vibe. There's just something about the Lovecraftian, steam punk WWII aesthetic of the first that works better for me, and seems to fit our red pigmented protagonist a little more. These films would be nothing without the essential and hard won casting of Ron Perlman, though. He brings a lively vitality, hulking physicality (he fits the part even before the prosthetics go on) and lovable sarcasm, and when you see him in action there is really no other actor you could envision bringing this character to life. It's laughable to think that Del Toro fought the studio for years to get Ron in the role, turning down the likes of Vin Diesel and Nic Cage (what oh what were they thinking), not compromising for a second, knowing the film he wanted to make. Well, Ron got cast in the end, as we now know, and he's not so much playing Hellboy, he just is Hellboy, he's that perfect for the role. When he's backed up by Del Toro's near godlike creativity and imagination (the two partner on projects frequently and it's genius every time), you get a piece of comic book escapism as exciting and adventurous as this. Hellboy was the result of a nazi experiment gone wrong, in which certifiable nut job Grigori Rasputin (freaky deaky Karel Roden) and his minions open a portal to a dark universe, in attempt to summon forth anything that could turn the tides of war (not the brightest idea, if you ask me), and instead out crawls infant Hellboy, a cranky crimson imp with a big stone appendage and an attitude to match. Kindly professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt) raises the creature to be a force of good and protection for our world, and soon enough he grows into eight foot tall, wise ass, cigar chomping, asss kicking Ron Perlman, now a valuable and formidable asset to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, an order that strives to keep the darkness at bay. Joined by his on and off flame Liz Sherman (pun intended, as she's literally a firestarter), Professor Broom, rookie agent Meyers (Rupert Evans) and humanoid swamp thing Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones, dubbed out with David Hyde Pierce), he sets out to shield New York, the planet and the universe from Rasputin, who has returned with notions of finishing the cataclysmic work he started decades ago. The action is propulsive and rousing, initially in NYC streets and subway tunnels, and then in a far off arctic locale where a gateway to some dark dimension opens once more and a suspiciously Cthlhu esque deity of destruction peers out. Del Toro has stated before that he prefers to think of his work as 'eye protein' rather than eye candy. Well, call it what you will, his films are nothing short of dazzling on all levels, and Hellboy is no exception. There's visual splendour in every frame, from the painstaking costumes, makeup and props (Perlman has a great big gun for that great big hand), to the production design and seamless computer wizardry, the world we see on screen is immersive and entertaining for the entire journey. Roden makes a frothing madman out of Rasputin, always nailing the villain when he shows up, and stopping said show here with his theatrical and baroque insanity. My favourite has to be Kroenen though, a sharply dressed, mute nazi assassin with a face only a mother could love and a set of knives you'd be foolish to get in the way of. He's an inspired and truly creepy villain that sets the apocalyptic dial on the highest setting when he shows up. Jeffrey Tambor provides additional comic relief as the long suffering suit who serves as the face of PR for the bureau, and props to Brian Steele as Sammael, a seriously pisssed off demon set loose by Rasputin in the city streets, leading to one blockbuster of an action sequence. As far as comic book films go, this is a gold standard of filmmaking, world building and good old fashioned storytelling, all of which Del Toro is a master at. It wouldn't have been the same without him, without Perlman and especially without the magic that happens when they work together."
"MaximumMadness","9","2","2","4 August 2016"," One of the most criminally underrated and under-recognized features of the past 20 years, ""Hellboy"" excels with its abundance of thrills, laughs and most of all... heart.
","The ""Hellboy"" film franchise is a story that could almost be called a tragedy. Mainly in that it so perfectly encapsulates one of the most troubling aspects of modern film-making and distribution.<br/><br/>That is, no matter how high a quality a production may be, it all comes down to the money. If a moderately-budgeted film isn't a runaway hit or doesn't attract a massive audience, chances are it won't be able to continue to completion no matter how much it clearly should. Which is most certainly the case for the beloved cult-favorite ""Hellboy.""<br/><br/>Whether it be the the highly entertaining and appealing ""Hellboy Animated"" series that ended at two entries despite audiences being promised a third that never came. Or this film and its similarly- singular follow-up. Despite their wild popularity amongst a more niche, cult audiences and general high critical praise... they just never quite brought in those big numbers that studio-suits salivate over.<br/><br/>It's this fact- this terrible, terrible fact- that lends both the live-action and the animated ""Hellboy"" features an almost poignant air when they are revisited as the years pass. Because you can see masterful artistry and top-notch production work on display that should have so much more recognition (and obviously so many more sequels and follow-ups), but just doesn't.<br/><br/>Directed and co-written by the poetic cinematic genius Guillermo del Toro and loosely inspired by the famous comics of mastermind Mike Mignola, ""Hellboy"" tells the tale of, well... Hellboy. (Ron Perlman) A demon summoned to Earth as an infant during World War II by the occult division of the Nazi's in a last-ditch attempt to sway the war in their favor. However, the kindly Professor Bruttenholm and a group of allied soldiers stop the ritual that summoned him in the nick-of-time, and he is taken in by the Professor. Brought up by a good man who taught him values and morals, Hellboy now works for a secret government division known as the ""Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense"" where he hunts monsters and other supernatural threats while being kept hidden from the view of the public.<br/><br/>Now, when the spirit of the infamous Rasputin (yes, THAT Rasputin, as portrayed by Karel Roden)- the man partially responsible for summoning Hellboy to Earth so many years ago- re-emerges with a plan to bring about the end of the world as we know it, Hellboy must confront this devious figure of his past. Along for the ride are a colorful cast of supporting characters, including:<br/><br/>-Liz Sherman (Selma Blair)- a beautiful but troubled pyrokinetic who Hellboy pines for <br/><br/>-Abe Sapien (Doug Jones)- an aquatic ""fish-man"" with psychic abilities <br/><br/>-John Myers (Rupert Evans)- the new-guy at the bureau who has been assigned to watch over Hellboy <br/><br/>-Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor)- the head of the bureau whose a bit of a jerk, though he just might have the smallest of soft-sides<br/><br/>The cast is just wonderful. Especially Perlman, who was born to play Hellboy and makes him as fun, relatable and complex as you could possibly imagine. Which is no small feat considering he's playing the role under heavy prosthetic make-up that gives him red skin, massive muscles and devil-horns. But he makes the character so lovable and oafish, you'll constantly find yourself forgetting about his looks.<br/><br/>Blair is also stunning in her role, adding a lot of pathos and heart to the film, especially as her love for Hellboy and his love for her plays a major role, despite them not being together. It gives the film such a great emotional core.<br/><br/>Hurt is a blast of fun as Bruttenholm. Jones (with voice-over work by David Hyde Pierce) brings the aquatic Abe to life with an absolutely magical physical performance. And supporting roles by Roden, Evans and Tambor are very well played, even if their roles are written somewhat flatter than our leads. (Though Tambor is given a lot more room to shine in the second film.)<br/><br/>But it could be argued that the real star here is the wonderful script and pitch-perfect direction courtesy the wickedly entertaining and talented del Toro. His work is always so poetic and complex but also never alienating. He much loves melodrama (something he admits), and it's used to perfection in much of his work- ""Hellboy"" being no exception. <br/><br/>His visual direction is smooth, slick and stylish. Always moving and writhing around the scenes like a beautiful serpent. Expertly painting the visual image before us. Combining this with the wonderful cinematography of DP Guillermo Navarro, and his work here is just plain stunning.<br/><br/>Then there's his wonderful handling of character and story, in both his actor-direction and writing. It's witty. Never dull. And oddly enough for a film about a big, red demon- frequently and consistently heartwarming. Yes, this film has perhaps the biggest heart of any superhero/comic film of the past 20 years. And that's what really drives home just how special it is.<br/><br/>And while I do have to dock a point from my score due to a few clich√©s and contrivances here and there, I really hope that doesn't indicate that I don't completely love and adore this film. Because I do. For it's wonderful performances. For it's gorgeous visuals. For it's fascinating design and phenomenal score courtesy the fantastic Marco Beltrami. And for it's great sense of humor and heart.<br/><br/>This is a near-perfect 9 out of 10. Please give it a shot if you're even somewhat interested. A hidden gem like this really deserves wider recognition. (As does its sequel, the quirky and fun animated spin- offs and of course the incredible comic that spawned them all.)"
"Leofwine_draca","9","2","2","26 July 2016"," Creative and colourful comic book romp
","Guillermo del Toro's follow-up to the successful BLADE II is another film in the same spirit: playful script, strong action and excellent set design. HELLBOY is another in the recent line of pretty decent comic book hero adaptations, and hey, what do you know, it's a pretty decent film. Perhaps not the masterpiece I had hoped it to be, but definitely as good as BLADE II and popular enough at the box office to warrant a sequel. After years of solid roles in support, Ron Perlman finally gets the lead role he so richly deserves, and he is brilliant as Hellboy, the wisecracking, bright red, half-human half-demon superhero who has a huge stone hand and files his horns away every morning. Perlman's make-up is excellent giving him that fine balance between dodgy realism and comic-book colourfulness and really, his character can't be faulted at all.<br/><br/>The plot is rather thin, linking together a series of impressive set-pieces. The opening sequence in Scotland, with a group of evil Nazis, is very well portrayed, as are the various battles with the PREDATOR-like tentacled dog monsters which are able to multiply themselves when killed ‚Äì kind of like the hydra. There is some great action involving trains and a scene with a huge demolishing pendulum kind of like the one in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Throw in some nods to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and some surprisingly graphic moments of gore and violence (at least for a PG-13 certificate) and you have a film that action film fans will find impossible to dismiss. Just check out some of the genuinely nasty villains too: from the aforementioned dog beasts to the martial arts-fighting zombie, who has had his eyelids surgically removed and who is powered by some kind of weird clockwork contraption, shades of CRONOS there too.<br/><br/>Supporting cast is great, from the relatively unknown Rupert Evans who helps introduce us to the bizarre Hellboy, to Selma Blair ‚Äì an actress I have never particularly liked before ‚Äì as an incendiary fire starter. John Hurt is almost unrecognisable as the kindly old professor and Doug Jones is great as amphibian-man Abe Sapien. Del Toro throws in some fine artistic moments, such as the scenes in snowy Moscow where Rasputin is raised from the dead, and although the film has a kiddie-friendly rating, it feels really adult in terms of the very violent death scenes and blood spattering everywhere. Okay, so the ending unfortunately does get very predictable, and even the appearance of a Lovecraftian Cthulhu-style monster doesn't bode very well, as the CGI effects aren't THAT good. But it's not bad, and generally passes the time very well. Keep your eyes peeled for more Lovecraftian references in the movie, which are always fun for a book lover like me to spot."
"tankace","8","2","2","17 March 2016"," Underrated
","Hellboy is one of the most unique movies in the superhero epoch we live in, because despite the mostly critical acclaim it gain ,like its sequel ,it wasn't a box office hit like Sam Raimi Spiderman or the X-men movies. That is sad because Hellboy is a really nice film ,full with good humour,elements of horror and awesome creatures designs,which you can't tell if it is computer generated or practical effects. Guillermo del Toro brought to life perfectly this world,within which paranormal creatures live beside us and the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation and Defense does its best to keep our world save and sound. If you love fantasy theme movies and have a soft spot for lovecraftian creatures coming to life ,give it a watch, I am pretty sure that you will at the very least like it."

","Hellboy is most certainly not everyone's cup of tea. I mean with a title like that it could instantly turn many people off. But once you get past that, inside is a well thought out, well shot and well put together motion picture. Guillermo Del Toro has always been one of my heroes in the directing field and this film is no exception. Ron Perlman as the role of Hellboy is possibly the best casting for a superhero since Kelsey Grammar as Beast from X-Men. He is an incredible actor, even under 4 hours of make-up, he delivers. The film has wonderful side characters as well. Doug Jones as the man/fish hybrid Abe Sapien, John Hurt as Professor Broom and Selma Blair as the brooding Liz Sherman. The designs are what I love most about this movie. The look of the main monster, Sammeal is truly terrifying, proving once again when it comes to creating monsters, Del Toro is the best. The one weakness the movie has is the villains. The characters of Grigori and Ilsa are pretty bland. Their Henchman, Agent Kroenen, however, is truly fun to watch. The fight scenes with him are always intense. If you haven't ever seen this movie, and want to experience a decent comic book flick from the early 2000's, I would give this a watch."
"mcshermansmithy","10","2","2","2 February 2014"," One of the best Non DC or Marvel superhero films ever
","DC and Marvel seem to dominate the superhero film industry nowadays. But they better watch out from another comic book company called Dark Horse Comics. Their movies include 300, Sin City, and Hellboy. In my opinion, Hellboy is their best project yet.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is Guillermo Del Toro's direction with the story, the characters, the cast, and the visuals. Hellboy, played by Ron Perlman, is very likable hero. He's got a tough sense of charisma to him but you can always see his soft side as well. The main villain, Rapsutin, is very despicable and is very cunning as a mastermind bad guy. Out of all the supporting characters in this movie, my favorite one is Liz, Hellboy's girlfriend, probably because of her very interesting background.<br/><br/>The story is very good in this movie. I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say that it is a good mix of action, horror, fantasy, and themes like identity, choice, and what it means to be human.<br/><br/>Even if you know very little about the source material, I think you'll still enjoy it. Hellboy is a fantastic film thanks to its actors and its very talented director, Guillermo Del Toro.<br/><br/>10/10"
"StevePulaski","8","2","2","22 August 2012"," A hero who plays like a villain
","Hellboy features visual effects on all different scales, all of which can be described as nothing short of spectacular. I wasn't so much attracted to the story as I was by Ron Perlman's wonderful performance and the uncanny amount of effects that were flooding the screen at record speeds.<br/><br/>If that's what you crave, than Hellboy is the recommended picture. Origins stories are hit or miss for me, but I found this particular one more believable in terms of performances and depth than Daredevil, yet not as polished and as moving as the recent Spider-Man films. But is it fair to compare Hellboy to the likes of a hero that is incredibly mainstream? That was for the masses. This is for the cultists.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" came out after the Nazis erected a portal off the coast of Scotland in 1944, hopefully summoning beasts from different worlds to help them win the war. The Nazis are soon defeated, the portal destroyed, but not before a blood-red infant emerges. The allies who discover him coin the name ""Hellboy"" for the little guy.<br/><br/>I'm sure you now know where this will lead; Hellboy's main gift to the world is assisting in attacking paranormal creatures that are attempting to wreak havoc on our planet Earth. Super simple stuff. Director Guillermo del Toro's livens up the seemingly disposable material with a bright light show, equipped with impressive pyrotechnics and a helluva lot of explosions to boot. For someone that, surprisingly, wasn't very moved or gripped by the storytelling, the effects served as the main course I was happy to feast on.<br/><br/>The key to Hellboy's success is Ron Perlman's amazingly gifted performance as the horned, red-skinned, quick-witted, loose-lipped, cigar-chomping demon that is Hellboy. Perlman's not only built for the role but incredibly capable in the shoes of the character, who possibly will never be portrayed as accurately again.<br/><br/>The direction by del Toro bleeds style and packs in enough substance as well. The character of Hellboy is closely followed throughout the course and it seems that even though many things are going on, we never lose sight of what is happening. Hellboy is a truly favorable superhero film, with a hero who looks and behaves sometimes more like a villain.<br/><br/>Starring: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, Karel Roden, Rupert Evans, and John Hurt. Directed by: Guillermo del Toro."

","Guillermo del Toro's first pass at Mike Mignola's quirkie indie comic book, about a baby demon brought up to be a kind of a policeman of the supernatural, succeeds on almost every level. The story is good, and redolent of Mignola's work (albeit filtered for a mass audience), the casting is first rate, as are their performances, and the visual realisation of everything in Hellboy's universe is terrific, from the Lovecraftian monsters to Abe Sapien and Hellboy himself (a masterly combination of Ron Perlman's natural architecture and huge prosthetics which do not seem to impede his movement at all).<br/><br/>The script, too is good, with strong characterisation (again, reflecting the comic well) and a good dose of very welcome humour. And you care for these characters: they are a lot more than ""mere"" comic characters.<br/><br/>I would comment that the visuals, while quite excellent, don't attempt to capture the high contrast quirky originality of Mignola's art, but this is clearly a production design choice (and, given Mignola's high degree of involvement with the production, taken with his approval and co-operation).<br/><br/>This film is hugely enjoyable."

There isn't much reference to heaven and hell as one or opposites, which would have created more depth and a greater understanding of Hellboy's home and instead, focuses upon the good nature of the hellish man, and it's interesting to see him portrayed as a man, with human emotions and beliefs rather than an animal, which is the view of the society in the plot, which creates emotional tension and entertainment, and a sort of controversy for current society.<br/><br/>Filled with action packed sequences, Hellboy dives into a horror and fantasy genre with its use of different creatures and appearances, giving the film a unique and approachable appeal, which is largely helped by Del Toro's stunning and gripping direction.<br/><br/>The Hellboy himself is interesting. Though funny, every phrase he utters feels like he knows he is a superhero, thinks himself cool, and adds way too much sophistication and daftness to his character. These phrases add up to unnecessary egotistical central protagonist, who despite being funny, can be very annoying and clich√©d.<br/><br/>The plot is consistent, delivering action and suspense on a consistent basis with a different approach to the superhero genre.

Their use in the action sequences and on the creature Sammael are spectacular, although I did notice that at some points Hellboy does look slightly cartoonish. The special effects are at their most impressive during the first fight between Hellboy and Sammael.<br/><br/>Hellboy's personality means that a lot of humour comes from him. Any film like this would definitely need some comic relief and this has plenty of bits to tickle your funny bone such as when a small tile falls on Hellboy's head whilst battling Sammael and he simply says ""Ow."" There was one thing about Hellboy that disappointed me: the villains. Sammael and Rasputin are both good and interesting in their first scenes, but their effectiveness wares off after a while. Also, Rasputin overall just isn't that great as a villain. The only enemy to stay interesting throughout is the blade-wielding Kronen who I think should have had more scenes.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Hellboy is one of the best comic-book films I've seen.

It also had such great scenes and dialog, with the child on the roof and when Hellboy says just how he feels about Liz in a sort of clumsy yet romantic way like us mortals would probably do. It's really a great film for everyone, If it weren't for some of the great basic NAZI scenes and the well done action sequences, this could be watched by all. Leave it to G. Del Toro to make a could've been crappy adaptation very memorable and sticking to his guns to get the perfectly cast Ron Perlman (The Studio wanted someone well know and more ""Bankable"") to create such a film. Can't wait for the sequel, and loved the fact that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" won Academy Awards, and got him even more well know/loved by others.

","The Joe Cool Review: Hellboy(2004) <br/><br/>Starring: Ron Perlman as Hellboy, John Hurt as Professor Broom, Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, Rupert Evans as John Myers & Doug Jones as Ape Sapien(voiced by David Hyde Pierce)<br/><br/>Plot: Towards the tail end of WW2, the Nazis decided to resort to the occult to try and open up a portal which will bring about the end of the world. The allies managed to stop them but a baby demon made it through the portal. It is raised by Professor Broom and becomes known as Hellboy. 60 years later they're back and it's up to Hellboy to kick ass and stop them.<br/><br/>Openers: What a great ride this movie is from start to finish. Hellboy has just about everything you want a movie to have, and yet it's not a typical movie in any sense of the term. It has action, comedy, horror elements and even some romance.<br/><br/>The Good: Hellboy is sort of a melting pot of many different genres and that's what makes this movie work so well. It doesn't conform to one type of movie and therefore blows the viewer away from start to finish. Another reason this movie works is Ron Perlman. Make no mistake about it, Guillermo del Toro was 100% right in choosing Perlman and only considering him for the role. I couldn't get enough of him playing Big Red and when the movie was over I still wanted more. And the movie clocked in close to 2 hrs and ten minutes! Some of the supporting cast I feel did their jobs well too. Selma Blair and John Hurt were just sort of there but they didn't detract from the film. Doug Jones can act like a fish freak and could emote without talking. And since he didn't provide Abe Sapien's voice, that's kind of what he had to do. David Hyde Pierce was a good choice to provide the voice of Abe and one of those things that just seem perfect after the fact as far as casting goes. Everything else works too. The action is great(Love the subway fight scene) and the comedy and romance work too, with a few jump scares and emotional scenes thrown in. Honorable mention goes to Jeffery Tambor who manages to be pretty funny in a role that I originally hated but grew to love.<br/><br/>The Bad: My main problem with this movie is the character of John Myers. I feel like he was forced onto the audience and really doesn't do much. He was just about as expendable as the other agents looking after HB in my view. Nevermind the fact he acts like a pansy throughout the whole thing. I get the fact he was placed into the movie to be an outside person learning about this new strange world of Hellboy but I still didn't care for his character like I did everyone else.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The final battle, although short, relies heavily on CGI and looks kind of fake looking. However it doesn't really take away from the movie and is not that noticeable unless you're trying to find flaws.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: I was pretty sure I'd like Hellboy but I didn't think it'd be as good as it turned out being. Now it's one of my favorite movies and I eagerly await the sequel to see HB kick ass once more.<br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 or *****"
"james_corck3","9","2","2","23 January 2006"," Fantastic adaptation of various Mignola comics
","With this movie, we know now that Guillermo del Toro is for Hellboy, like Peter Jackson for Lord of the Rings. A fan that translates the story from the book to the film, with a lot of respect and dedication.<br/><br/>Looking carefully, having a Hellboy comic next to you while you watch the movie, you see that every frame is an exact representation and reproduction of Mignola's work, done in the film-making media. This is not Sin City, we all have to know that, so our imagination has to fill those spaces.<br/><br/>The story of big monsters and evil societies trying to conquer the world is as old as the common cold, we all know it, but the power of this movie is not the screenplay, that has a couple of flat line dialogs, is the images. Huge rooms full of pendulums, impossible bridges hanging over the void, talking corpses, huge guns, demons that multiply if you kill them, blue fire, and in the middle of that, a red demon, with his heart split between his two fathers. The good one (Trevor Broom) and the evil one (Rasputin).<br/><br/>So many sub lectures to name them all. But interesting enough to keep watching and watching. Only one thing to complain about. Is impossible to believe that the movie is set in New York, but who cares about the city when a Red guy is chasing a weird demon with tentacles on the head?"
"MovieManiacX","10","2","2","11 August 2005"," Wild, Fun, & Very Entertaining
","I love Guillermo del Toro. The man makes great movies that are always fun and extremely entertaining. Cronos was good, Mimic was great, Blade II was the best movie of 2002, and now he gives us Hellboy, a great action movie that is funny and enjoyable, with all kinds of neat comic book touches, very original superheroes and lots of disgusting creatures.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman, who is one of my favorite actors (and obviously one of del Toro's too) is perfect as Hellboy. He IS Hellboy. No one could have played him better. His attitude, his personality, his physique and his voice are all dead on, making him ideal for the role. Perlman makes Hellboy very cool, but also extremely likable. Hellboy's wisecracks are hilarious and Perlman nails them with just the right amount of sarcasm and wit. Perlman also does a wonderful job portraying Hellboy's soft side when he's with Liz Sherman, played decently by Selma Blair. John Hurt is great as Professor Broom, Hellboy's 'father', displaying wisdom and kindness in his old age. The bad guy, Rasputin, is evil enough, but doesn't seem like too much of a threat. The real threat comes from his henchman, Kronen, a sword-welding badass whose mechanized body keeps him alive and makes him almost invincible. Meyers and Abe Sapien do a fine job too.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing, especially Hellboy's make-up. Rick Baker did a fantastic job turning Ron Perlman into the red-skinned, yellow-eyed Hellboy with a variety of prosthetics and make-up effects. Hellboy's stone arm is wild and devastatingly useful when it comes to beating the crap out of people. I enjoyed his horns and red tail, which in one scene pays homage to Indiana Jones. Abe Sapien's aquatic effects are done very nicely, as is Sammael, the hell-hound Hellboy fights multiple times. Hellboy's gun, 'The Samaritan', is also a nice touch. My only complaint is that the CGI was overused, as in most movies these days.<br/><br/>The action scenes, though short, are very cool. The scene in the museum that leads into an all-out chase between Sammael and Hellboy is pretty cool, with Hellboy punching the hood of an SUV, flipping it wildly into the air to save Meyers from being run over. Hellboy's fight with Kronen is fun and very original, as well as his demolishing brawl with Sammael in the subway. The giant tentacled creature at the end is very cool too.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's trademark visuals are in full effect here. His use of color, most notably amber, is excellent and gives the movie a very unique and interesting feel. His utilization of the elements is ever-present with lots of fog, smoke, and rain. The Gothic architecture and grimy locations are used very nicely with the Nazi island, the dark and dank subway system, and the Rasputin's temple. He also chooses some neat camera angles and movements, which give the movie a genuine comic book appearance. Good job, Guillermo! <br/><br/>Bottom Line: <br/><br/>Hellboy is a great popcorn movie. With a great director, excellent cast, fantastic special effects, and del Toro's unique visual style, Hellboy turns out to be a helluva lot of fun."

","everyone how hears that I am saying that I absolutely loved it thinks I am crazy. And all I say is HEY it is a free country and we all have a right to out opinions. Why did I love it? Because I feel that in the times we are living in, we all need heroes. And if he is a demon from hell!? Why not!! Maybe I saw something in the movie others didn't.... But I learned a lesson from this movie, a lesson I think we all can learn. I learned that you should not judge someone on there outer appearance but rather look deep into their souls. There will come a time in each of our lives when you will meet a Hellboy and then you have to look for ""The diamond in the rough"" {Aladin- movie} I also learned that everything and everyone has some good in them even if they are a demon from hell. With the right care and love anything is possible. I end this by saying that I wouldn't mind having a 'Hellboy' as a friend or close by. and I have a request, please make a sequel or maybe even a series. I know I'm not the only one who would love seeing Hellboy again!!"
"EvLauster","8","2","2","7 March 2005"," Guillermo gives fire and brimstone a new meaning
","Starring Ron Perlman, Rupert Evans, Doug Jones, John Hurt, Karel Roden, Selma Blair. Directed by Guillermo Del Toro.<br/><br/>Based on another marvel comic book Guillermo most likely directs the best movie he ever made. Since this was not his first comic book movie after doing Blade 2 with Wesley Snipes as the star, he must have some experience with comic book movies in this particular movie his true director identity was not only show but proved. Ron Perlman after doing Alien Resurrection (The worst of the four by the way) in which Sigourney is the eighth Ripely he stars as Hellboy a bad ass demon hunter traveling around in a garbage truck with Abe Sapien (Jones) a mermaid or fish of sorts with a high intellect. As soon as a new body guard or so Rupert Evans (Myers) joins the team to help Hellboy he at first is disliked but soon learns the ropes and finds the inner peace and sensuality of him along with fighting old dead Nazis and watching Hellboy beat up some giant monsters. Hellboy is most likely Guillermo's best film he ever did and maybe some pity him for that but I applaud him for making and giving the true identity of a marvel comic book hero. My final rating 8/10."
"fibreoptic","8","2","2","28 July 2004"," A nice dose of fun.
","Ron Perlman of course makes this movie great and the special effects are excellent but the ending is quite muddled. Perlman has always been good in every movie he has been in so i knew if this sucked it wouldn't be his fault. I found the main monsters in this looking like something out of Men In Black so i wasn't too impressed by their design but how the government can possibly cover-up Hellboy after the fight in the subway is beyond me. An out of focus picture is one thing but sheesh! That Nazi guy with the blades was cool and i liked that helpful zombie near the end, very funny. I did find Hellboy slightly similar to Spawn but i won't split hairs here. A nice fun film which doesn't disappoint. 8/10"
"bob the moo","Null","23","49","9 September 2004"," Had potential to be a really dark adult film and, despite being a bit entertaining, fails to deliver in most ways
","During WWII, Hitler turned to the dark arts to try and turn the tide, leading the Allies to create a paranormal unit to combat his attempts. An attempt by Rasputin to open a portal to another world is foiled by Bruttenholm and US solider ¬ñ but not before a strange devil creature has come through into our world. Decades later, Hellboy (as he was named) has aged slowly into his early twenties and, under the guidance of Bruttenholm, has become a secret force for the government in their fight against demons. A new agent starts as Hellboy's handler and is immediately thrown into the deep end with the arrival of a beast in a museum. However this is only the start of a bigger plot by Rasputin and his immortal Nazi allies in their attempts to destroy the world.<br/><br/>As most people seem to be at the moment, I quite like comic book films ¬ñ I like the potential for action but also the complex characters that the better adaptations will bring out. For this reason I was keen to see Hellboy even though the trailer was filled with CGI and bad kiss-off lines ¬ñ I should have trusted the trailer. The film starts well with the background for us uninitiated and then skips to the modern day. Using the standard 'new partner' idea as an 'in', the film then pretty much walks the usual tracks of romance, action, monsters and so on. The script never really allows the adult side to come through very well ¬ñ there is nothing complex here and the dark side that I had hoped for seems to only exist in the sets and costumes.<br/><br/>Without this I was left with just another summer comic book film and, sadly, not one of the better ones at that. The action looks OK but strangely failed to engage me ¬ñ partly down to the overuse of CGI but also due to the director not injecting enough pace and urgency into them. The effects look OK but it is telling that the CGI beasts are not as impacting as Kroenen who is a much better bad guy ¬ñ I think he should have been a bigger part and that that CGI been used more sparingly. Likewise, the characters are not as well developed or as interesting as I'd have liked. Hellboy himself is a fairly ordinary action hero ¬ñ aside from the red skin etc, he has a cigar, is muscle bound and makes wisecracks; hardly breaking the mould is it? Liz and Myers are not used well at all, with their supposed romance not working; meanwhile other characters are just bodies rather than anything else.<br/><br/>It is a shame because it was in the characters that I expected something more grown up to be delivered rather than just more effects and I did feel let down by the lack of this. It is still noisy and big enough to survive in the blockbuster world but I was surprised to see it already have a sequel planned. The cast will be happy with this, even if I was not entirely happy with them. Perlman is a good choice for HB and he does well in a rare leading role ¬ñ it is not his fault that he has little to work with for the most part. Evans and Blair are fairly bland and uninteresting ¬ñ partly the scripts fault but also a bit theirs too. Hurt's father figure is interesting, and Pierce delivers what is essentially an underwater Niles. Strangely he was not listed on the credits ¬ñ unsure why he wasn't. The support cast is less interesting ¬ñ the bad guys are no more than bad guys and only Beran is good value in his minor role. Tambor is not that well used but his presence is a good influence.<br/><br/>Overall, maybe worth seeing once but, for all its potential it doesn't really stand up against the couple of much better comic book adaptations that are around (Spiderman 2 for example). The action is noisy but uninvolving and unexciting while the adult themes and characters just fail to materialise. Unless it sorts out these pretty major problems in part 2 I would seriously doubt it will have another chance after that."
"nathanielhines","10","8","14","21 April 2006"," Great Story
","I love this flick. The movie has all the components that I enjoy, including love, violent interaction between adversaries and a unique storyline. <br/><br/>Hellboy is like most men these days. Confident yet vulnerable. Liz portrays the perfect girl, power that may not be able to be controlled. <br/><br/>One of the best scenes if the one on the roof with the surprised boy. Ultimately, he is advising Hellboy on what to do. Advice sometimes comes from the pure at heart. <br/><br/>I love the line about ""fishstick."" I'm still laughing about that one. I literally have to hit pause every time that scene comes across my screen. <br/><br/>In an act of full disclosure, this film was recommended by one of my best friends who understand cinema. I would have never even thought about viewing this without her advice."

","I went into this movie not expecting very much. Well, I didn't get very much. There were maybe thirty people in the theatre when I saw it and half of them walked out within an hour. The dialogue was laughably bad, every time someone made a joke it fell completely flat. Every time someone attempted to be serious it was hilarious.<br/><br/>Besides the cringe-worthy script, the acting was pretty mediocre. Selma Blair was fine, but Rupert Evans (as John Myers) and Karel Roden (as Grigori Rasputin) were pretty bad. I'm not going to go into pointless plot summary because you can find that everywhere, so I'll just say don't waste $9.00 on this movie!"
"marktaichen","1","7","12","25 May 2004"," absolutely the worst
","so bad I had to register on IMDb just to rip it. first of all, the story is tragic-ly bad. No chemistry of any kind between any of the characters. No emotions from hell boy for anyone who died. The final god gets killed in a minute, enough said. fish man stays in tank all day. I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. And that speaks a lot about the story/directing/characters considering this movie had some good effects.<br/><br/>plz don't encourage this kind of film-making by watching it.<br/><br/>I want my two hours back. and that's another thing why was it so painfully tedious?"
"ccthemovieman-1","6","12","24","29 June 2006"," Entertaining, If Nothing Else
","This is a pretty good cartoon-character movie. It's entertaining because of two main things: 1 - good dialog by the lead character, likeably portrayed by Ron Perlman and, 2 - the violence is not overdone, wearing you out and dominating the film.<br/><br/>It looked like the latter was going to be the case early on but the film calms down and the climactic scene is not overdone as it is on always every modern-day action film. <br/><br/>I was sorry to hear some blasphemes in here, no place for that in a comic-book hero film geared to attract a young audience. I'm not familiar with this comic book here, ""Hellboy,"" but I was surprised he looks like so many alien-type monsters of today on screen, nothing original. They could have made him look different, unless that's how he looks in print.<br/><br/>All in all, despite what may sound like a critical review, the movie was entertaining and even had some nice touches of humor. It's another example of good, mindless entertainment for two hours. I would like to see the extended version and see if that's better."
"rufi885","1","6","10","13 April 2004"," Horrible
","I can't describe how much this movie ticks me off. One thing<br/><br/>that ticks me off the most are the HORRIBLE one-liners. I haven't heard this many bad one-liners since Jack Frost (not the one with Michael Keaton). Another thing that angers my blood is the final monster at the end. They could have done a better job and not have used Sin from Final Fantasy X. Are we really supposed to believe that a giant squid looking creature is going to reign the apocalypse down on us and bring death and destruction to Earth? I am baffled at how this movie is a success. Movies now have to focus on special effects to get the point across instead of good writing. If you want to see a good movie, go rent The Shawshank Redemption, no special effects, great acting, great ending. That's all for my ranting, but if I can give anyone advice this year it is this: Don't see Hellboy, save your money and gas."

","I was pleasantly surprised by Hellboy.  It was smart and well directed and produced.  The acting and characterizations were great.  I particularly appreciated Hellboy's rye humor.<br/><br/>The back history of Hellboy's entrance to the Earth via a Nazi experiment gone bad was very engaging.  The use of mythic legends adds an extra dimension to this story.<br/><br/>Of course Armageddon is is tantalizing plot point and seeing a vision of the future with Hellboy commanding the demise of the Earth was great.  The arc of the story turns on Hellboy's human upbringing and this of course plays well with the Armageddon prophecy.  This is fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.  It is worth an hour 52 minutes of your time."

"Robert_duder","9","3","4","3 July 2008"," One of Marvel's more crowning achievements and shows why they can be great
","Marvel has provided us with some real stinkers...Ghost Rider, Daredevil, and the less than great Ang Lee's Hulk, Fantastic 4, and Spiderman 3 but for every dud they show why we should continue to allow them to bring their super heroes to life and Hellboy is the perfect example. I am a solid DC fan and I have been all my life but I won't deny that Marvel has the most impressive and unique dark characters in the comic book world and Hellboy is the pinnacle of it. This could have been a very hard film to create and would take some incredible talent and vision and imagination to properly bring something as unique and visually odd as Hellboy and they nailed this home!! This is one of the most visually stunning, well made action thrillers chock full of unique creatures and stunning special effects out there. It's action but it's sci-fi fantasy as it's very best and the action really never stops and yet it easily rolls out the characters and makes you feel them and care about them and that is kudos to not only the film makers and writers but the terrific cast as well. You might think Director Guillermo del Toro would be the first choice to direct an action super hero film and yet his vision and imagination were absolutely perfect for what Hellboy needed to be.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman has always been a great character actor but he scores a home run as the tough as nails, sensitive, wise cracking Hellboy. Underneath that enormous costume he creates Hellboy and makes it his own and he is amazing at it!! Hellboy couldn't be the same without him. Selma Blair, who I am not always a fan of, really is terrific as Firestarter Liz Sherman and the object of Hellboy's crush. They have amazing chemistry together for a monster and a woman (Beauty and The Beast anyone?) and she is a terrific character with a back story worthy of exploring in future installments and shows a lot of emotion. David Hyde Pierce as the voice and Doug Jones as Abe Sapien are brilliant. Pierce's voice is so ideal for the blue brilliant creature. He is the ideal sidekick to Hellboy. I hope we see more of him in the future installment. Karel Roden is downright disturbing as Hellboy's nemesis Rasputin and Ladislav Beran is one of the greatest villains in film history as the blade wheeling silent but deadly Nazi killer Kroenen. Rupert Evans and John Hurt round out the main supporting cast and both are very good in their smaller but pivotal roles.<br/><br/>If nothing else Hellboy is stunning to watch. The setting from the exotic looking library, to the dark, gritty underground tunnels to the white wastelands of Russia and the monsters they encounter are just amazingly done and perfectly written into the story. While I am sure a lot of special effects and CGI were used in the film you would hardly know it. The special effects are brilliantly used and even the most outlandish battles between Hellboy and the creatures look absolutely stunning. I would be surprised if they were able to replicate the real brilliance of this film in the new sequel being released next week although the original cast and the original director are returning and the creatures look almost as amazing. If you haven't seen this original film you must see it now especially if you love action flicks or fantasy or just want a really good time then you won't be disappointed with Hellboy. 9/10"
"MidnightWarrior","3","3","4","24 June 2008"," Terrible!!! A big mess - WHAT were they thinking?
","This film has NO story and no plot. And it's a shame too. The CGI work, directing and acting is all top notch. The film starts off with a small back story (which is fantastic and entertaining), then gets really slow in the middle of the film and then at the very end, becomes tripped, rushed and falls on its face.<br/><br/>Parts of the film just didn't make sense. Some examples: why was it important at the ending to acknowledge that Hellboy had a choice, when throughout the film, this concept was NEVER brought up? Why did HB go into a trance when, again, this was never brought up earlier? What were HB's redeeming characteristics? Too early in the film HB is joking around and making wisecracks like he knows us and we love him and will accept him and what he does. No!!! He needed to do something besides taking candy bars from the father and gobbling them up, to prove himself as likable.<br/><br/>Not everyone knows the Hellboy back story and not everyone read the comic (I didn't even know such a thing existed). As such, I NEEDED this information. Withholding it was detrimental to the story.<br/><br/>The hidden premise of the film is that Hellboy is needed to open a portal to release a bunch of demons into the world so that they can take it over. That's the only reason for the film. Everything else is vague and loosely tied in. Nothing, after the beginning flashback is congruent or makes any form of sense.<br/><br/>So after the initial action scenes in the beginning, the middle is filled with slow and boring scenes that really contribute nothing to the story, and then comes the climax. And then BOOM and the film is over.<br/><br/>Throw this film in the same bucket as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. This film sucked! Three stars for everyone in this project except the writers and their horrible script."
"jfcthejock","7","3","4","15 April 2007"," A Film That Was Overly Criticised!
","Now, let's get this straight. Just because Hellboy was an adaption of a D.C comic does not make it any less good, just because it ain't Marvel. This is a good enough representation of a comic series that in itself, is quite complicated to create. Were talking about a Devil like creature who is on the side of good, not bad. When you see Hellboy many of you automatically think... what a load of crap!<br/><br/>Just because Spiderman does not look like an ogre means crap, just because Wolverine has a loving side does not mean Hellboy does not. Batman Begins was a success, and it itself was a D.C comic creation, the present-day hype over Marvel films like Spiderman and X-Men have overshadowed over great comics that can and should be made into films. Don't get me wrong they are good movies, it's just they have kinda beaten the competition out of the game simply through the press coverage on the films and the comics. Can Stan Lee really handle rivalry in the world of Action/Fantasy, if not he may have done a few things to make this film less than a success. Hellboy also has some great music overlooked by the more well known Marvel films and their own music.<br/><br/>An overly criticised film that fell foul to the bigger and richer dogs of the film industry."
"Dan1863Sickles","3","6","11","7 November 2006"," Exciting Villains, Boring Hero
","HELLBOY is one of those frustrating movies where you can spot about 100 exciting ideas that they didn't follow up on -- but all you get is a muddled up mess instead.<br/><br/>The movie's prologue is explosive -- desperate Nazis summoning up hell itself to ward off total defeat in 1945. Right away you are introduced to eye-catching villains and chilling possibilities. There's Rasputin, the sex-mad Russian mystic, and Ilsa, a stunning blonde SS She Wolf. He's about to gamble his soul to break into the vortex of evil. She's his willing slave and they kiss good-bye in a way that scorches the screen. Your mind buzzes with questions. How did Rasputin survive all these years? Why is he working for the Nazis? What is Ilsa like in bed? How did Rasputin tame her? Right away, you get it all -- sex, sadism, Satan, excitement, evil, and sensuality.<br/><br/>Unfortunately . . . these are not the main characters of the film. The main character is Hellboy. Unlike Karel Roden (as Rasputin) and Biddy Hodson (as Ilsa) Ron Perlman as Hellboy just doesn't have the sexual charisma to draw you in. He's a big lug, that's all. A big lug painted red, smoking a cigar. The moment the prologue ends, and we switch focus to his personal problems, the movie begins to drag, slowly, to a halt.<br/><br/>Certainly it's possible to make audiences care deeply about a big, dumb lug. Like Rocky Balboa. But Rocky was an underdog, someone we liked because, big as he was, he got no respect and was picked on by the whole neighborhood. But Hellboy is the opposite. He sulks and mopes, but he's given every possible luxury and his government bosses treat him with kid gloves. And in the fight scenes, which drag on and on, he's invincible, and his enemies are generic and ugly. There's a fight scene with a giant squid thing that drags on for ten minutes, literally. Why do you care who wins when a red painted lug stands around punching a bunch of rubber and foam for ten minutes? What this movie needed was to follow up on much more of the background ideas -- more mysticism, Nazi sex, occult mysteries, and historical scandals. The scenes they hinted at in the back story were far more exciting than anything the Hellboy actually does."

","While this movie was more popcorn and cheese than I would have liked, Hellboy still presents us with some endearing character portrayals, outstanding effects, solid story line and good direction.<br/><br/>The premise is ... that after having conjured a demonic imp-like being, the Nazis are disturbed and their small faction defeated by the US. The paranormal adviser who is aboard the US mission lures the lil guy to his side with Baby Ruth candy bars, and he therefore adopts him as his ""son"" of sorts.<br/><br/>Once grown, the imp - who is now on the side of good having been raised sixty years by a good-hearted and wise human - fights evil in all its forms.<br/><br/>The imp is enamored with a firestarter who is also in the group, out of the group, back in the group, and so on. Good thing that the big red guy's flame retardant, or he could be singing the Doors from the other side. ""C'mon baby light my fire."" *chuckles* The meridian/merman was beautifully done, portrayed and executed. Great incarnation of a highly intelligent and sensitive race.<br/><br/>The one-liners and zingers flying about were more likely to put an eye out than make anyone laugh. In that area, this movie tried too hard to be witty and just came off seeming a bit anorexic. Unfortunate, as this could have been much more enjoyable, had they pulled it off. However, all that taken into account, I was still amused and entertained by the premise and the actual story. Some critics have accused this attempt of having no story whatsoever, but that just is not the case.<br/><br/>The story is of love, life, blind faith, imagination and intelligence, and ultimately loyalty both to family and friends. Even when delivered through a basely stereo-typical chauvinistic tough-guy personnae, these qualities do not fail to shine through.<br/><br/>The action sequences were fun, with a strong accent on those one-liners. Nevertheless, they were still entertaining. Importantly, the effects were excellent and did manage to carry the movie through a couple of tough spots. A good thing, too, as I never even noticed the score.<br/><br/>All in all, it still rates a 6.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","At best, ""Hellboy"" is somewhat, but not very, enjoyable; the creature designs, practical effects, make-up and visuals (minus the terrible CGI) are all impressive. The action sequences, however, are poorly orchestrated, and never implement a real sense of suspense or incite excitement, especially when they rely heavily on Perlman's delivery of one liners to a monster he fights over and over again, just in different settings.<br/><br/>Looking for a plot? Well, how about a monster fight instead? Would you like that?! The story we're meant to follow is extremely vague, so much so that the film just feels like a mish-mash of scenes, especially with the flawed pacing. Despite the painfully obvious exposition at times in the dialogue, there is actually little to no explanation behind the events of the movie, little motives behind characters and antagonists. Everything seems so underdeveloped that it is difficult to see what this film is getting at. It's like a 9 yr old trying to give advice, you know? Numerous moments require a great deal of suspension of disbelief and these moments are just too hard to overlook.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is quite varied too; just when the film quietens down and is serious, we think we may finally get to learn something about the characters and come to appreciate them but we are then thrown back into the extremely ambiguous plot or into another fight scene and too many of these moments come across as corny, largely due to the fact that we have no idea what is going on and what exactly to think of the characters as, as I have mentioned above, the lack of development makes it difficult to care for what is occurring on screen.<br/><br/>Perhaps back in 2004, when this film was first released, it was appreciated and I could just about see why but 11 years later and it really does not seem to hold up. I find the current rating on IMDb to be very misleading. The ratings for its sequel, which I have yet to view, are significantly higher but I hope the scores are more representative. I really wish I could get my 2 hours back watching this film.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" is undeniably as pointless as Hellboy's horns. Don't waste your time with this film."

","I have never seen a more ridiculous movie in my entire life. The acting was horrible and the plot summary was even worse. Was this just an outlet for the writers to show as many monsters and plot twists as possible?(no matter how far fetched each twist is), if it was then i assure you they achieved this goal. Rather than focusing on the character development of ""hellboy"" and his story it seemed to either fail at that or purposely shy away from it. The attempt to make this movie as action packed as possible was an epic failure the action scenes seemed forced at times and sometimes lasted longer than necessary.<br/><br/>In summary i am unaware as to why this movie firstly was released into cinemas and secondly was given the go ahead to make a second?

"Sisiutil","4","5","10","5 August 2004"," Disappointing
","Okay, I'll start with something nice: Hellboy has great special effects, and fine performances from Perlman, Hurt, Tambor, and Pierce/Jones.<br/><br/>
Okay, I ran out of nice things to say. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of comics and comic book movies, though the Hellboy comic has pretty much been off my radar. So I was looking forward to this movie. But I wound up disappointed for a lot of reasons. Let me list them...<br/><br/><ul><li>Villains: action movies need strong villains. This one gives us three (four if you count the monster)--and we don't really get to know any of them, though one does some nifty knife tricks. But what's their motivation? Hurt's character says they want to destroy the world. Why? Don't they get destroyed along with it? Sorry, but I could NOT understand WHY the bad guys are trying to do what they're trying to do. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Heroes: all the good guys seemed to be plucked straight out of the stock character catalog. We have the world-weary lone wolf cop (Hellboy) to kick @$$ and crack wise, the intellectual (Abe) to explain the plot devices, the sage old man (Hurt) to explain the backstory, and the cranky boss (Tabmor) to be a pain in the butt. They're dressed up differently, but we've seen these characters a hundred times before, and in much better versions.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lovers: if the casting director was trying to find two extremely bland actors to match the bloodless characters of John Myers and Liz Sherman in the screenplay, he/she succeeded wildly. Hurt says he picked Myers specifically; why? Hellboy asks him what he's good at. We're never told or shown satisfactory answers. And what HB or Myers see in the morose, wan, and seemingly eternally-sedated Liz is beyond me. Not only is Blair not a good actress, she isn't even attractive. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dialogue: Hellboy has a few good lines, yes, but when you're able to fit them all in the trailer, you know you're in trouble. And the lack of interesting dialogue only highlights the lacklustre...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Plot: Like many current action movies, Hellboy's creators make the mistake of assuming that action and effects are plot. They're not. The story shuffles along aimlessly; even the characters seem clueless about how to proceed. If Rasputin and his sidekicks are such a threat, why are they wasting time with the big hellhound-thingy? This isn't a plot, it's an excuse for a series of action set-pieces. </li></ul><br/><br/>When a movie can't come up with decent basic elements like the ones I just listed, all the special effects and whiz-bang action won't keep it afloat. It's too bad, because del Toro et al managed to show you can put together an effects-laden action flick at a much lower price than anyone would have thought."
"dreampolice","1","5","10","3 April 2004"," Waste of time
","Unfortunately I let good reviews influence my choice of movies. What ever happened to good scripts? Sorry, but it takes more than flashy special effects and jagged editing to excite me. Did I miss something? Was that fish guy the creature from the black lagoon or C3PO from Star Wars?<br/><br/>C'mon Hollywood........quit feeding us this sh*t and write something worthwhile. Thank God for Polanski's PIANO....a movie that actually was INTERESTING.<br/><br/>If this is what is considered good, I think I will just stick to my DVD player and watch films of the 50's-70's."

","Hellboy: 10/10: Hellboy is one of the three best comic book adaptations of the last ten years. Now considering the recent spate of mediocre comic book adaptations this is a bit like winning a beauty contest at a fat farm. Hellboy is simply head and shoulders above those. <br/><br/>It is on par with the recent Spiderman movies (Hellboy sports a better hero and better CGI effects while Spiderman takes the nod in the love interest and villains categories) better than the X-men films and simply puts other comic book adaptations to shame (League of Extraordinary Gentleman should be particularly embarrassed) <br/><br/>Hellboy starts with a rip-off of one of the last scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark and introduces such horrible clich√©d villains as Nazi babe and Rasputin. Yet the scene works. Director Guillermo del Toro nails a comic book style to the direction that keeps the action and humor going during the most implausible circumstances. Another kudos is in order for the special effects, both make-up (which is spot on) and CGI. Now I seem to hate most CGI effects. <br/><br/>Many a big-budget Hollywood film has come out recently with horrible special effects that stick out despite 50 million plus budgets. Hellboy's effects are simply seamless where one forgets that entire characters and locations are digitally generated. The acting is also seamless with lead Ron Perlman giving a scene stealing cigar chomping performance that rivals Daniel Day Lewis's turn in Gangs of New York and Jeffrey Tambor turning a stock clich√© (obstructionist bureaucrat who wants to shut everything down) into a humanistic sympathetic character. (This is also an example of very smart writing that makes even the clich√©d characters into three-dimensional figures.) <br/><br/>While all is not perfect (In addition to Nazi Chick and Rasputin we also have a Clock/Sand Nazi and a Space Cthulhu as an improbable villains) Hellboy is better than an action movie should be, much better than a comic book adaptation ought to be, and immeasurable better than a movie called Hellboy deserves to be."

","I hadn't ever read the comic and can't say that I was on the edge of my seat before watching it, but after getting the DVD-am glad I did. Hellboy is a really decent comicbook hero flick. You have seen the character types before, and to be honest at times I thought I was watching out-takes from either Ghostbusters or Scooby, but it Does work.<br/><br/>Best part-Ron Perlman. Great casting, good performance, it's written w/ him in mind clearly. The girl is a washout, Mr Bland as the potential Other Guy is dull, John Hurt in the Mr Miyagi role works quite well. I enjoyed the baddies though they're just rehashes from Raiders don't you think? Excellent, elaborate fights and nasty monsters, machines, etc, with the Yuck factor turned up kinda high whenever Sammael there shows up. I enjoyed the humorous touches--Hellboy getting run over by the subway and bumping his chin on the subway as it passes over, Ahnold-style one-liners, etc, all good.<br/><br/>The actual finale is lame-kissing in flames-and you kinda wonder about just why the Cthulu types would want to bother w/ earth, but never mind....it's not worth worrying about.<br/><br/>*** outta ****, def. worth a watch."
"TonysLittleFriend","8","3","5","19 October 2004"," Second date, no tongue!
","The movie begins in 1944 Scotland with American soldiers accompanied by a bookish, bespectacled Professor Broom, psychic adviser to President Roosevelt. There, they find a small contingent of Nazis, the most enduring of villains and a remarkably spry-looking Rasputin attempting to open a portal to another dimension. The occult interests of Adolph Hitler never got much attention at the time, but in recent years at least it's made for some new twists on the tired old villains. <br/><br/>Anyway, the good guys ruin the party for the Nazis, knocking Rasputin through the dimensional hole, but not before a demon baby comes through the portal. It's coaxed down with a Baby Ruth candy bar and, like a wolf pup adopted by humans, becomes tame. Fast forward a few years. The demon is now an adult has a fondness for cats and cigars has filed his horns down to almost nothing in an attempt to be a regular guy and works for elderly Professor Broom in the Bureau for Paranormal Research.<br/><br/>Broom is dying of cancer and knows it. He's brought in a replacement/successor, John Myers. Myers gets a tour of the place, where he meets Hellboy and Abe Sapien, a telepathic fish-man who likes to eat rotten eggs. While Broom is an old man, his old enemies haven't aged a day. Escaped Nazi Ilsa and a robotic character named Kroenen perform a ceremony to bring back Rasputin from the other side, looking none the worse for wear, and the fight is back on. <br/><br/>My nits are minor things. In the end, the film is carried to its fun but entirely predictable conclusion by the strength of Del Toro's excellent direction and Perlman's total embodiment of the character. It also seems like I've seen this movie so many times before. But seeing as though it is a comic book flick, what can you expect. Really? The movie is nothing special, but it's better than some comic movies out there today. Not great, but certainly not bad either.<br/><br/>***/*****"

","Hellboy is a conversion of a comic book, so it's supposed to be campy. But even a campy film, like the first Austin Powers flick, should have engaging characters and a plot that makes sense.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Hellboy was a total waste in all categories. The bad guys weren't scary. Hellboy seemed pretty invincible so it there wasn't much tension (similar to the film The Crow). There was zero chemistry in the love interest. The dialogue was cheesy, and the computer graphics didn't work for me. I mean, the X-Men was cheesy but still fun. Hellboy didn't engage me at all, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Fans of the comic book only.<br/><br/>I'll give Hellboy a disappointing 4 out of 10."
"Shabadoo-2","10","6","14","3 April 2004"," The Best Comic Book Movie Ever?
","I don't read comic books and have never even seen a ""Hellboy"" comic and I loved this movie. I had no expectations of high art--I just wanted to be entertained, but I ended up being a little bit surprised at the better-than-usual-in-a-comic-movie acting and dialog.<br/><br/>No one but Ron Perlman could ever play this role. It's not just his looks, but the way he can say the corniest dialog with utter sincerity and conviction. Selma Blair is also well-cast, with her perpetually depressed eyes and understated delivery.<br/><br/>The monster fights are great at first, but once you've seen one, you don't need to see it three more times, especially with the same monster. The plot is pretty standard heroes n' villains stuff, with the twist being that the main hero is an apocolyptic demon from hell who loved kittens and eats stacks of pancakes that would gag Louie Anderson.<br/><br/>Yes, it all sounds so corny, but I was drawn in because the actors and the script didn't take for granted that I was just another drooling fanboy. Guillermo Del Toro has made a great action movie, and I'm looking forward to the sequels."

","There are just some parts where i want to complain but for 2004, i mean this came out before i was even born so if anything i just have to give credit to this movie. I've never seen any of the Hellboy movies yet when i was a kid i always used to see him pop up on fx a lot, but ive always had these movies in the back on my mind yet i never had the urge to watch it and now the time has come to see it so im gonna review it. Its funny how its not a marvel or dc movie but its just there, not part of either of them. I thought some action sequences had good CGI but i definitely was not the best but for 2004 i just cant complain. There wasn't enough of the other heroes and it was like hellboy did all of the actual work. Some jokes were pretty cringey and i feel like this is really meant for kids and it should be rated r. One of the villains is so cool with the swords and blades but when he kills and slices people there isn't one drop of blood. The new one is rated r but damn this should have been too. Theres one part where someone is about to say son of a and then something happens before he can say it. Im not really complaining though and i really like the whole actin and comedy aspect of it. Im not really a fan of movies with all this dark magic and evil undertones, i like my superhero movies like avengers not to do with hell but this one gets a pass and hope the second one is way better, i should have saw this as a kid."

","Hellboy starts in 1944 off the coast of Scotland where some evil Nazi's are conducting experiments in the black arts to try & tip the war in the favour of Hitler, with the help of Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) who tries to open a portal way to hell in order to unleash demons from another dimension. However Professor Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) & allied forces manage to stop them but not before a small red boy like creature enters our world through the portal, this small red creature grows up to become Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) who now works for the US Government in a secret organisation called the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defense who monitor & combat supernatural & demonic threats to the Earth. Upon investigating a monster at a museum the team find out that Grigori is back & intends to destroy the world by reopening the portal & finishing what he started in 1944...<br/><br/>Written & directed by Guillermo del Toro one has to say I think Hellboy is easily one of the, if not the best comic book adaptation of the recent CGI computer effects stuffed years. First of all Hellboy is one of those frustrating films which is available in it's original theatrical version & a 'director's cut', now I know Hellboy wasn't the first & won't be the last but I am sick of Hollywood studios treating us film fans like idiots & trying to milk as much money out of us as possible. Why two different versions? The director's cut only adds 10 minutes to a film which lasts over two hours anyway so the differences aren't likely to be significant, it just annoys me that studios are so cynical in knowing that the fans want the best version & will probably end up buying both & the studio ends up making more money from us, true film fans. Anyway, rant over. The character of Hellboy originally appeared in a series of Dark Horse graphic novel books & was created by Mike Mingola, with the success of other comic book adaptations like Spider-Man (2002) in particular the powers that be decided to make a Hellboy film & a fine film it is too. Even though it lasts for two hours it didn't feel that long, it moves along at a really good pace & your never too far away from a monster, a fight, an explosion or some other action set-piece. Also another factor which makes Hellboy work so well is that it's fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously & it just wants to entertain you which as far as I'm concerned it did in style. The character's are surprisingly good, Hellboy himself is pretty likable although one has to say beyond all the flashy effects, the action & the unique central character there's not that much else here, there certainly isn't much of a story to get involved in. Keep watching after the end credits start, once the big orange ones finish we discover that the makers hadn't forget Manning after all, it doesn't really say what happens to him but at least he gets a mention.<br/><br/>Director del Toro made Hellboy straight after another comic book flick Balde II (2002) which is actually a better film than Hellboy because it's darker & has more of a story. Here del Toro was obviously under instruction to turn in a PG rated family film & therefore it's relatively restrained in the violence department. I will say that the film looks gorgeous though, the wonderful high tech sets of the bureau to the dark & dirty New York sewer system to the wonderful looking Gothic castles when the film switches to Russia to the costumes & in particular the Nazi assassin Kroenen with his sleek black metal mask & blades which shoot out of his sleeves. Hellboy looks fabulous in more ways than one because Hellboy the film looks great as does Hellboy the character brought to life by Rick Baker & his team as they applied the make-up to Pearlman which took fours hours everyday. The CGI computer effects also look brilliant, when done poorly CGI effects look awful but when done properly they are simply amazing & Hellboy is a good case in point, from monsters with swaying tentacles to explosions the CGI is top notch.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $66,000,000 Hellboy's budget was probably kept down due to the fact there weren't any really big stars in it demanding a $10,000,000 plus pay-cheque, I'd imagine most of that money actually ended up on screen & it shows because Hellboy does look the business. Surprisingly shot in Prague in the Czech Republic although actually set in America, Russia & Scotland. The acting is good but most of the human cast are given little to do, Pearlman steals the show here.<br/><br/>Hellboy is a really fun, action & CGI computer effects packed comic book hero adaptation which in my humble opinion is maybe the best of the recent superhero films & better than Spider-Man at any rate. A must for fantasy film fans & fans of the graphic novels, very enjoyable on a big dumb loud noisy fun type of level. Look out for the forthcoming sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008)."
"kasper-hjorth","10","2","3","13 January 2007"," My favorite
","This is my favorite movie, has taken the dark feeling of ""The Crow"" and mixed it with the humor of an old Trinity movie. I must confess that i have never red a Hellboy comic, but i believe that it is evident that it is a comic put to the screen. And whats really bothering me about ""The Crow"" is the flawed action scenes. In this the action scenes aren't very classic i would say. But filled with big guns and evil monsters as only cartoons can bee. And the idea of putting it in parallel with Hitlers experimenting in WW2 is remarkable and really makes you think, although you know its fiction. And another thing i really like is the relation ship between agent Myers and Hellboy, and how i develops trough the movie. And it really gives Hellboy a very human feel, and a sense of compassion that he is in love with a girl, but doesn't seem to have any chance over Myers, who suddenly becomes a rival for Hellboy. I can go on and on and on, but ill leave it to others."

","It is a very difficult thing to bring a comic book character to life on the big screen and do it justice. People tend to have some preconceived idea's about how close the movie should be to the comic book itself. Although there are many differences between the comic book and the movie I really feel that Guillermo del Toro, along with a superb cast, captured the true essence of Hellboy. It is not an easy thing to do but Guillermo succeeded with familiarizing the audience with who Hellboy is, where he came from, and what he does.<br/><br/>This movie is one of my all time favorites and I can't wait until ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army"" comes out next year, 2007."

There's an amazing depth to the characterization of Hellboy, no doubt in large part due to the superb talents of Ron Perlman in the lead role, and having John Hurt to play his adoptive father didn't hurt either. The story resonates on many levels, the love angle works brilliantly - the very passably mainstream girl he's in love with has her own issues to deal with.<br/><br/>AND the makeup and special effects are awesome, it really makes me wish I'd gone to see it on a big screen.

","Following on from the recent trend of turning comic books into movies is this offering - Hellboy. I've never read, or even heard of, the 'Hellboy' comic before seeing this movie but it doesn't matter as the film pretty much explains itself anyway. Hellboy tells the story of a demon that was brought into this world by way of a very silly sequence involving a portal to hell, Rasputin (yes, Rasputin) and some Nazi's (naturally). Instead of exterminating this demon, the American army decides to not only keep it, but raise it as a crime fighting superhero, whom they go on to use in the paranormal side of the FBI, which battles various monsters and stuff. Obviously. As you can probably tell, this isn't a film that takes itself seriously and should, therefore, just be taken for what it is - an enjoyable comic book movie. And when taken like that, it has to be said that Hellboy succeeds.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro is an obviously talented director. Cronos and The Devil's Backbone prove that without any further need for proof, but it's also worth noting both Blade 2 and Mimic, which weren't as great as the two films just mentioned, but were obviously helmed by a talented auteur. Hellboy fits in with the latter two films, unfortunately, and although Del Toro has no doubt made a good job of this movie, you can't help but think that his talents would be better served making more movies like Cronos and The Devil's Backbone. The CGI effects in the film are mostly rather good, and go some way to proving that CGI can work if done correctly. The film falls down when it comes to making the character of Hellboy into a well-rounded 'human being'. The word 'clich√©' springs to mind immediately, and does so again when it comes to the dialogue that Hellboy has been given. Still, Ron Perlman makes an excellent job of the role, and although I've never read any of the comics; his performance shows what I would expect the character of 'Hellboy' to be. The film is not great, but it's a fun ride; so the thumbs are more up than down."

","Firstly, I just have to comment on Ron Pearlman's performance as Hellboy, he breaths life into the character and makes him great fun to watch.<br/><br/>The basic story is kind of 'X-men meets Men in Black'.<br/><br/>Hellboy and sadly only a couple other mutant type characters are used to defend Earth from dark forces, intent of taking over the world. With very strong visuals, some fine characters and an action packed storyline, this movie is entertaining, amusing and great fun.<br/><br/>Kids will undoubtedly love it (I know my son does) although some scenes are not for young kids, and most people should think it is at least good entertainment, but don't expect too much as you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>Good fun for most 6/10"

It does, however, give you a fun packed value for money movie.<br/><br/>There are a good few laughs in it, and the special effects are excellent, sure there are a few moments when you see that Hellboy has suddenly become computer generated, but that's because we can still tell the difference, not because it was badly done. As for that, go spot when Abe is computer generated...no? Very good isn't it? Yes - well you cheated and searched on the Internet!<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is just superb in this, and his makeup is stunning. He really seems to play a perfect character, and from what I've read, just like the comic book - although that doesn't have to be the case in movie adaptations of comics.<br/><br/>*** The only thing I personally found slightly odd was the character of John Myers. Why was he there as he served no real purpose, and why were there a few references which hinted at him having some power but were left totally uninvestigated? Perhaps that's something for Hellboy 2! ***<br/><br/>So, very entertaining, great fun and some good laughs throughout. The majority of characters are actually interesting and fun too.

","Hellboy's a real pity: a strong cast and beautifully designed visual environment are wasted with a doofy script and lazy characterization. Ron Perlman's Hellboy -- and, in casting terms, Perlman's the perfect choice -- is unleashed upon the movie without depth, idiosyncrasy or soul, and forced to spend twenty minutes at a time pummelling large voiceless CGI dogs. It's a waste of the lovely work done by the visual designers, who beautifully render a steampunkish detective lair; sinister Nazi-era villains; and the delicately amphibious Abe Sapien. The greater shame is that the source material, Mike Mignola's comic, is a work of dry elegance and understated wit.

In the title role, Ron Perlman is great. Under all that make-up, he delivers a fine performance and spits out some great one-liners. Thankfully, the movie has a sense of humor and doesn't take itself completely serious, because it would become funny for the wrong reasons.

I think he used a cross, garlic holywater etc out of superstition more than anything. And who cares, it isnt cliche. That has been the myth for year and ages and years. You cant change it, its been handed down to us.<br/><br/>Also, how does the comic book ridicule such things? Obviously you have read something else, if you have even read it at all. You should take them seriously, its cool.<br/><br/>Dont compare it to Indiana Jones. Wow because their is nazis, and every movie that has anything to do with Nazis in WWII is Indiana Jones? Fact is, the Nazis in Indy were bull. How is this like Quake or Doom? Stupidest Comparison ever, next to Indiana Jones. Not to mention, this comic was out way before Quake or Doom. Also, im pretty sure the original copyright for the comic was 92', and DOOM came out in 93. A years difference.<br/><br/>
If people like this, because they like it, why are you telling them to track down tick? That is lame. Tick = Stupid funny, Hellboy = Sarcastic. Anything alike? And if you didnt like it because it was dark, then maybe you should stick to archies.<br/><br/>There was originality in this movie, a lot of it. And yes the guy that played Kroenen was real, how could it be CGI? I mean seriously.<br/><br/>
The tagline for you: Dont watch movies if you have no background info to support yourself.<br/><br/>
OWNED><br/><br/>Movie Review:<br/><br/>2 thumbs up, very very awesome. I recomend seeing it. FX were rad, story was good, music was good. Lots of action.<br/><br/>Neat ideas lots of orginality. Better than Indiana Jones, thats for sure.<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you havent already."

","Having been a Hellboy fan for years I've been looking forward to the movie since it was announced. Now that I've seen it I'm of mixed minds. First off its one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic ever put on the screen where everything looks and feels right. The trouble is that the term leadenly paced doesn't do it justice, despite action sequence after action sequence this movie fails to move at all. Yes, all of the inter-personal relationships are scenes are fine, but anything that has to do with action or the villains is motionless. After an hour I was fighting a desperate battle to remain awake and the person I saw this with had to keep being nudged because they were snoring. What a slow slow movie.

However, a baby demon comes out, one with red skin and a right hand made of stone, which Professor Broom, who was with the Allied Army that day, adopts. Fast forward to the present, and the demon, Hellboy, is a member of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, a top secret branch of the FBI dealing with monsters and demons.

Both movies of Mr. del Toro are superior to that new one directed by Neil Marshall in 2019 - even Milla Jovovich as the evil witch couldn't save that weak piece - just wondering why a company or producer bothered in making that one...

Hellboy 2 is just hot garbage, it literally takes almost everything Mignola created and threw it away, the story is not for me since it is not some actual myth that is in some folklore, it is just pure fantasy which ruins the thing for me I love the creepy, mythological, and lore friendly creatures/stories Mignola created."

","This is probably one of the most creative superhero franchises to hit the silver screen, and I will always lament the fact that we'll never get the third entry in Del Toro's trilogy. While I do really enjoy this film, there are a few minor issues with it. First, it is a little on the long side. Notably, I did watch the directors cut of the film, which is ten minutes longer. And, if I'm being honest, it's been so long since I've watched the theatrical cut I couldn't tell you if the pacing was a bit better in that version. For the most part, I feel like the film moved along at a very solid pace, but it's the first act that really suffers the most. After the first scene, where Hellboy is pulled into our world, we spend probably twenty minutes establishing Hellboy's world, and some of the scenes during that time are certainly slower than others. The third act also starts to go off the deep end. As I mentioned, for about 75% of this film, this movie feels like a police procedural- it's pretty grounded as far as stakes go. But then, as we ramp up to the climax, the stakes ramp up stupendously, to the point where everyone in the world is at risk. I know a lot of people like their superheroes to save the whole world in a big CGI explosion-fest, but honestly, I wish this film had kept its climax a little bit smaller, more grounded, at the end. The CGI near the end is easily the least polished looking part, and while the ending is pseudo-satisfying it doesn't, in my opinion, have nearly as much heart as the rest of the film. This is, however, a small bone to pick with an otherwise very good film."

This is a world full of freaks and monsters in which it's rather easy to spend two hours.

","Just for being different from typical action/monster/horror fare, this film is a 7/10. del Toro directed and scripted, and the film is very much with his themes (e.g. Nazis and demons in ""Labyrinth"") and yet quite unique in its look and story.<br/><br/>John Hurt as the professor who raises a demon captured from a Nazi experiment, and especially Ron Perlman as said demon (named ""Hellboy"" and affectionately called ""Red"" by his coworkers) deliver great performance. How nonchalant can a demon get? Well, Perlman will show you. Everyone on the cast, down to the German dominatrix, or Jeff Tambor playing the somewhat knuckle headed FBI agent who is not all bad, clearly enjoyed making this.<br/><br/>Through flashbacks envisioned by a fish-man-demon and plenty of action involving subway trains, the movie leads us through Perlman chasing egg-laying hellhounds to dispose of a dead Nazi brought to 'life' by a mechanical clockwork, to climax in a final confrontation with none other than Rasputin, who holds Perlman's would-be fiery girlfriend hostage in a sub-sepulcher labyrinth to get him ""Red"" destroy the Earth.<br/><br/>If this sounds a bit weird and complicated, it's weird, but not too complicated. The film is well written and the somewhat unusual action and characters are easy enough to follow and empathize with.<br/><br/>del Toro is a classic auteur like Terry Gilliam, with a touch more horror and a touch less social commentary, although films like Labyrinth and Hellboy clearly show del Toro's fascination with demons of the imagination, and demons of reality - such as Nazis.<br/><br/>A strong 7 and a clear cult winner, fun to watch again even when you know already how it plays out."

"paul_haakonsen","8","1","1","29 December 2018"," Lots of action and a good story...
","While not being familiar with the ""Hellboy"" comic books, I had very little idea of what to expect from this movie the first time I watched it, back when it was initially released. I took the time to sit down and watch the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie again, as part of getting geared up to the forthcoming new ""Hellboy"" movie in 2019.<br/><br/>I will be the first to admit that director and writer Guillermo del Toro definitely was the guy to have at the helm of this project, because he has a very unique knack for making these supernatural type of movies. And he did it marvelously at the helm of the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie.<br/><br/>The storyline told throughout the course of the movie was a good and interesting one. It had lots of flavor to it and there were lots of smaller subplots to the overall main storyline along the way. It all panned out quite nicely and Guillermo del Toro managed to get the movie to come full circle at the end.<br/><br/>Needless to say that the special effects in the movie were off the charts. The creature designs and costume designs were just magnificent. The CGI was so realistic and there was a very Lovecraftian touch to the creatures throughout the movie and the massive entities that were found in space and in the skies. Definitely an interesting thing going on there.<br/><br/>There is also an abundance of action throughout the movie, and it was executed quite nicely, coming to life on the screen in a very beautiful and pleasing visual way for the audience to enjoy.<br/><br/>Not to mention an impressive array of actors and actresses to portray the various characters and roles in the movie. Ron Perlman is actually quite good as Hellboy, and he is not normally an actor I am all that keen on watching. Karel Roden made for a good villain in the role of Grigori Rasputin, but he was so outstaged by Ladislav Beran playing Karl Ruprecht Kroenen - not only did he have a much cooler outfit, but his character was also way more interesting to me. Doug Jones did a marvelous job as Abe Sapien, though it was the voice acting of David Hyde-Pierce that really brought so much charm and wits to the character.<br/><br/>While the reanimated corpse Ivan only had a minor part in the movie, he brought so much humor to the scenes that he will be sorely missed. Half a man, but all laughs.<br/><br/>The 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie is definitely an entertaining movie from start to end, and if you haven't already seen it, then I can strongly recommend that you take the time and effort to do so."

"JaydoDre","6","1","1","7 March 2018"," A celebration of visuals with a layer of stupid
","This film is held up by pillars of style. It is a bag of cool camera shots and ideas for cool scenes (something its sequel would expand upon). On their own, these shots are great, containing a wonderful integration of color themes, shot composition, make up and interesting props. Even the outdated CGI doesn't look too bad, mostly because the digital effects are properly mixed in with practical effects. But the bindings that tie these cool shots together into an actual story are of poor quality and I found myself constantly trying to ignore the annoying nonsense in between the good stuff...in vain. <br/><br/>Here is an example. A monster jumps through the front of a moving subway train and out of the other end, as it tries to run away from Hellboy. Hellboy, however, gets dragged under the said train for a while and then gets left on the ground. However, in the next shot, the monster is standing directly above Hellboy, looking around. This kind of nonsense is non-stop, permeating the movie from beginning to end, and it is very distracting.<br/><br/>Hellboy is one of Ron Pearlman's better roles, despite the fact that his face is under a layer of make-up and his lines mostly consist of monotone gruffs. Jeffrey Tambor's and Doug Jones' characters provide a good colorful counterbalance to the said gruffness of the main character. However, everybody's lackluster dialogue complements the aforementioned flawed storytelling and together they keep this movie below its potential.<br/><br/>I am glad the makers fixed a lot of the problems in the sequel. This first film is still worth watching though, even if only for the charm."

","Fans of just about every comic book super-hero character dream of the day when their favorite makes it to the big screen. I read the Hellboy comics for a while and didn't think them anything special, and I was actually surprised that the character would get a movie treatment. Since it did, Ron Perlman seems the logical choice to portray the character, he has just the right size and look to translate Hellboy into an on screen action hero.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of a Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, sounds sort of like The X-Files, doesn't it? The idea that Hitler survived World War II and lived till 1958 sounded interesting too, but once we learn that, nothing ever comes of it. In the end though, the story goes the route of all big super hero films with an all out assault of over the top, mind blowing action and indestructible monsters for the good guys to defeat. It's a pretty standard formula that's not interrupted here.<br/><br/>The movie does pose one major question mark. It opens with a narration by one of the principal characters, Professor Broom (John Hurt). He adopts the infant demon Hellboy who comes through a time portal engineered by the Nazis, and brings FBI agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) aboard his team to battle present day forces of darkness. I always have to wonder how a picture with a principal character that doubles as the narrator winds up being killed in the story."

","Hellboy is a cool film. It has action, it has humour, it has heart, it has a truckload of kitties - now what's not to like!? It is a frankly a bad-ass movie, with a bad-ass song; Nick Cave's Red Right Hand, here performed by Pete Yorn. That scene alone is worth a couple of stars in the rating, that's how good it is. Hellboy is also a rather dark superhero film, featuring Nazi scientists where specially the gas mask clad Dr. Kroenen sticks out from the crowd as he suffers from severe body dysmorphic disorder. Another noteworthy beast is Sammael; the ""Hound of Resurrection"", kill one of these monsters and two shall rise. It is a funky bunch. And I have always found it peculiar that Hellboy 2 gets a higher rating here on IMDb. It is a much lighter story and honestly, If I want to watch disgruntled trolls, then I put on the 80s classic fairy-tale Labyrinth. In Hellboy 2 the grittiness that made the first movie is replaced by slapstick and creatures which seem aimed at a much younger audience. I rather watch Hellboy 1 twice in a row than bother with the sequel. H1 gets 8/10. H2 a mere 5/10 (and that's being quite generous.. it does feature a song by Eels)."

","Hellboy is a good movie with a well developed plot and a talented cast. It certainly stands out as being a much different superhero movie that what we are used to, it does not follow the same predictable elements, and Ron Perlman's stunning performance showcases a truly unique character. I felt the movie focused far too much on Rupert Evans, who really was the main character, the one who the audience follows and see how he reacts to the situation. His typical, clich√© role gets very tiresome when there are so many interesting, bizarre characters, such as Hellboy himself, who we would have preferred follow. I also found Hellboy and Liz's relationship to be poorly developed, they talk about the great memories they have, but we do not get to see a whole of them together first hand, as a result of this I did not particularly care about them ending up with each other or separated. While it has its imperfections, Hellboy mostly makes up for it with a unique story and a dedicated performance from Ron Perlman, worth the watch if you are looking for a good action or fantasy film. <br/><br/>A demon is raised by a secret US agency to battle forces of darkness. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Ron Perlman Worst Performance: Rupert Evans"

With direction and script by Guillermo del Toro's, it has a cast headed by Ron Perlman, John Hurt, Selma Blair, Karel Roden and Doug Jones.<br/><br/>I was never a fan of films made from comics as it's a kind of film full of graphics normally seen in this kind of literature. For me, film is film, and a comic is a comic. This movie positively surprised me as it moves away from the graphic look of the comic- books, bringing the story to a more realistic scenario. The theme of the story, hanging around the magical and occult, it's also interesting and appealing. An ancient philosopher, who I don't remember the name, said that hell was more appealing than the sky because it's more mysterious, and he had some reason. The script was well thought out, blending action, romance and adventure in perfect doses. The cast also fulfilled well it's role but it wasn't particularly surprising. The special, visual and sound effects are excellent and do a good job, as the scenarios. The soundtrack, despite the good performance, not surprised also. In fact, what is most lacking in this film is precisely the element of surprise. It's a constantly warm film, never robbing us that emotion or shock feeling. Maybe if the script had been thought differently... The highlight of the film, in the end, can be really touching, which is a positive, even though the best time of the entire film.<br/><br/>This film is full of interesting and favorable points, and it's of the few comics-based films that can break free of the stylized look of these magazines. Unfortunately, it lacks a certain amount of surprise, excitement and intensity that just don't pour the film to lose because, even then, is a film that looks good and is entertaining enough for a family audience, although is never hot enough to scald the most demanding audience."

","Hellboy (2004): Dir: Guillermo del Toro / Cast: Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, John Hurt, Rupert Evans, Doug Jones: So much potential wasted on what amounts to two hours of production values. Hellboy was born to be bad but propelled by good. Great back story involves the Nazis in 1944 trying to use sorcery to help them win the war. The result is total chaos and a Hellboy, which is a red demon-like creature. Professor Broom severs the horns and raises Hellboy for the good but dark forces are emerging. Fantastic production and tense directing by Guillermo del Toro who also made Mimic. Story is one action scene after another before concluding upon one climax too many. Ron Perlman steals the film as Hellboy who feels like an outcast but realizes his position as a hero. He approaches monsters like an inconvenience, which allows for humour and attitude. Selma Blair plays an insecure woman whose hands flame under emotional duress. She stays under confinement but Hellboy continuously seeks her out. Doug Jones plays Abe Sapien, another mutated character of the water. John Hurt as Broom is flat, and Rupert Evans as a new F.B.I is just like every other human character in this film, which is to say that he is completely useless. The mutants are wonderfully drawn but the cops serve no purpose other than to die. Big fans of the comic will enjoy it. Score: 6 ¬Ω / 10"

","If there is one Dark Horse comic book property that many people enjoy and respect, its this adaptation. It's obvious that a lot of work and effort went into this to make it as good as it is. Apparently this was also director Guillermo del Toro's dream project way back when he first started directing. But that's not the only reason why everything comes together here. Every element of the film has something to contribute.<br/><br/>Let's begin with what's the most easy to notice - the casting. It's spot on. Ron Perlman as Hellboy was the perfect choice and it's great that del Toro stuck with his gut instinct and ran with it. Perlman has the voice, he has the chops and has the wit to give Hellboy just the right amount of charm and machoness. The rest of the cast were accurate choices as well. John Hurt is an older actor so it's fits that he would play Dr. Broom. Selma Blair as Liz Sherman is beautiful in her own way because of her troubled past. And Abe Sapien physically played by Doug Jones and voiced by Daivd Hyde Pierce was a great mix. <br/><br/>Hyde Pierce was the same man who voiced Slim in A Bug's Life (1998), Drix in Osmosis Jones (2001) and Dr. Doppler from Treasure Planet (2002). Then there's the strangest villain of all, Karl Kroenen played by Ladislav Beran. What a creepy character! Beran's movements actually reminded me of a mix between Ray Park's Snake Eyes from the G.I. Joe franchise and Anis Cheurfa's Rinzler from Tron Legacy (2010). Then there's the special effects. Much of which look practical - solid or liquid elements. Certainly the creatures are practical because that is Guillermo del Toro's specialty.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like most superhero / blockbuster films, the protagonist is set to battle for all of humanity. It's clich√© but there's one part to the writing that tops that. Just like many other films, a key plot point involves a magic key to fulfill a prophecy. This kind of plot point is really overused. Thankfully this is covered up for most of the time until the third act. Plus there's one last element that helps this movie excel - Marco Beltrami's musical score. Beltrami's music hits the right note on all angles. His score has a main theme for our hero and also mixes horror tones with action cues and emotional motifs throughout the running time. A fun film piece.<br/><br/>Its writing contains the usual superhero clich√©s but every other aspect of the film hits as hard as Hellboy's rock hand. The actors represent their characters accurately, the action is great with lasting special effects and a memorable score."

Sixty years later, the demon, now known as Hellboy, is part of an elite secret defense team alongside Liz Sherman, a beautiful young woman who can create fire with her mind, and Abe Sapian,an aquatic humanoid with the power of telepathy. Despite his many years of fighting for right, Hellboy finds himself facing his greatest challenge when the powerful Rasputin returns, determined to bring the demon back to the forces of darkness so that evil may finally rule the world. <br/><br/>Hellboy has wit, humor and fantastic visuals that makes it the entertaining.The viewer will be delighted by the surprisingly smart, graphically faithful live-action adaptation of the comic book series.But nevertheless,del Toro's screenplay provides somewhat a humanistic story into it that makes the movie not an exercise of special effects.Ron Perlman plays Hellboy with grit, humor, and a depth of feeling that makes the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall,Hellboy transcends its genre through del Toro's creative imagination."

","I haven't read a single page of any of the comics. And I was not fond of del Toro from what I had seen by him before this, those being Mimic and Blade II. As of watching this, I am at least interested in his work. The trailer instantly sold me on this, and I was not disappointed. Plot is engaging and well-thought out. The characters are nicely developed, consistent and credible. Action is absolutely awesome and rather well-choreographed, and Kroenen rocks harder than I thought possible. This is also impeccably funny, garnering many laughs, and it never tries too hard. The pacing is spot-on, and you get to relax between the intense, exciting and scary sequences. Acting is excellent, Perlman is flawless, Hurt is beyond reproach as always, Blair lends her role the vulnerability that it needs without being overly frail, and Evans manages to make his part, which could easily have been anything but, quite tolerable, and even pleasant. Heck, the kid they use isn't terribly irritating, that in itself is noteworthy. The special effects are amazing, and there is a lot of imagination and creativity in this, and it's all up there on the screen. Writing is great throughout, and there is a nice amount of memorable and/or clever dialog. There is infrequent, mild language, watered-down gore and bloody violence, and potentially disturbing content in this. It's one of the more entertaining PG-13 movies, and one where it isn't as obvious and distracting that they censored it. I recommend this to any fan of the director, the main cast and/or the Hellboy. 8/10"

","hell boy tells the story of a demon who has crossed over from the ""otherside"" and has joined the ranks of mankind. he is raised by the kindly professor broom (played beautifully by the ever-brilliant John Hurt), who runs a bureau that specializes in dealing with the paranormal. when Rasputin is raised from his grave, it is up to hell boy and his team (which includes an amphibian called Abe sapien and the super hot Selma Blair playing pyromaniac Liz shermin) to track him down and kick his ass.<br/><br/>hell boy differs from other comic book fare in that it doesn't portray the protagonist as an immortal, all powerful being (such as batman and the x-men), but instead as a regular joe who enjoys beer and has a serious love of cats.<br/><br/>the performances are spectacular, particularly Ron perlman as the titular character. the special effects are amongst some of the best ever created. hats off to Guillermo del toro who, it seems, just doesn't have the ability to make a bad movie. keep 'em comin', Guillermo!"
"tburke85","7","1","1","7 June 2009"," Hellboy A Decent Comic Book Movie
","Hellboy is a decent comic book movie from director Guillermo del Toro who shows some real talent and skill with this film. It may not be a masterpiece or a classic but Hellboy is much better than some of the other comic books that have been made into movies lately. The cast are solid in their roles including Ron Perlman whose nearly unrecognizable as the title character, Selma Blair, Karel Roden, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, and John Hurt. The rest of the supporting cast are good in their small parts they have in the movie. The action/fight sequences are well executed and the special effects are impressive but nothing very memorable. The various creatures in it look cool but most of them only get brief cameo appearances and none of them really stand out. However with it's flaws aside Hellboy is still worth watching because of the story, the action, humor, and the exceptional performances by the cast especially Perlman who shows his talent in this movie. Well done. Hellboy may not be the greatest comic book movie ever made but it's certainly not the worst either."

","What I've experienced with most based-on-comic-book movies is that they either turn out to be fantastic (e.g. the first X-men movie, 'Sin City', 'The Crow' etc) or downright bad ('The Phantom'). Very few fall under the average category. Being a huge fan of the 'Hellboy' comics, Guillermo del Toro passionately makes the movie. Collaborating with the original creator Mike Mignola, del Toro tries to be as true to the source as possible yet, for cinematic purposes, some liberty has been taken and the result is an outstanding science-fiction, fantasy action film.<br/><br/>On the technical side, 'Hellboy' is a wonderful visual experience. The production value is high caliber and effectively used. The world of Hellboy is spectacular. The set designs, cinematography, robotics, light effects, visuals, colour and score are first rate. The special effects look real. del Toro tried to use little CGI on the characters and more robots which makes these characters look more authentic. Yet, the CGI is used sufficiently and is very well done.<br/><br/>I also liked the creative novel concept behind the story. del Toro brings plenty of humour through his dialogues. The characters are not only fascinating to look at but are intriguing personalities. The editing is superb as the story flows beautifully keeping the viewer in suspense and wanting to know more. Even though 'Hellboy' is an action film that tackles the nature versus nurture theme, the love triangle between Hellboy, Liz and John was brilliantly portrayed and adds a nice touch to the movie.<br/><br/>The cast features a host of talented but underrated actors. Ron Perlman is stupendous in the title role. What makes Hellboy so likable is his human-like traits, such as his sense of humour, his liking for music and cats. Selma Blair breathes fire as Liz Sherman. Rupert Evans is promising. Doug Jones is terrific as the funny and vivacious amphibian-like Abe Sapien. John Hurt is fabulous. Jeffrey Tambor is hilarious.<br/><br/>Coming back to the first point, 'Hellboy belongs to the category of great based-on-comic-book movies. It's got a good dose of action, comedy, adventure, fantasy, science fiction, romance and a magnificent story. What's not to like?"

Usually they go at a 4/10 for me with only a fex exceptions.<br/><br/>Anyway, I watched this film because the sequel is coming out this Thursday (Australia) and I thought I had better see the 1st before the second and I think I will end up going to it no doubt.<br/><br/>The film starts off well, with Nazi's trying to spawn a devil from hell, in the couple of minutes it is open, a Hellboy comes out, and he grows to be the secret weapon of the American Military.<br/><br/>The film is well written in parts but gets boring in others. You can definitely see at some parts the effort put into this to not make it as boring as other superheroes movies.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Ron Perlmon does a great job as Hellboy, just like the other characters (Myers and the love interest) do a good job in their role as well.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a good film, not great but worth a watch or 2, the sequel actually sounds better with anything so I will definitely recommend it to people reading this."
"The_Orenda","5","1","1","5 July 2008"," Monsters are the real treat here.
","I would have never expected Hellboy to make the silver screen. There's something about the comic that never brought me toward it. But Guillermo del Toro has seen something I haven't, because the transition from comic to silver screen is exceptional. The film is very plot-driven, one scene moving to another at a faster-than-usual pace, but the real gift of Hellboy is the ingenuity and effort used in creating the monsters. Sammael and Kroenen are crafted with much care and I found it an absolute shame there wasn't more monsters to work with in a limited time.<br/><br/>Much of Hellboy feels underused. Liz is not used as much as I hoped, and Abe Sapien is out of commission about halfway through. Dr. Manning's fate wasn't fully settled on either and abilities used by Hellboy, like reviving the dead, are kind of just left out there, like who knew? But for a comic book film, with no expectations at that, Hellboy is a pleasant surprise, save for the fact that there should have been more monsters! This is Guillermo del Toro we're talking about!"
"xredgarnetx","7","1","1","26 March 2008"," For comic fans only
","While HELLBOY will hold little appeal outside of the comic fan circle, nevertheless it is a reasonably entertaining movie, much like BLADE, also adapted from an existing comic character. Hellboy comes from another, infernal dimension opened by some Nazis, but is rescued and raised by Americans and grows up to be a crime fighter. Only the criminals he fights are demons and mystics. As he matures, Hellboy does his best to fit in, which is difficult considering he resembles our classic image of the Devil himself. He keeps his horns cut off -- until close to the end, when the legendary villain Rasputin tries to get Hellboy to use his arcane powers to open the gateway to that hellish dimension. You've seen the same premise and a similar device used in STARGATE, LARA CROFT and EVENT HORIZON. The CGI in HELLBOY is plentiful but after awhile it gets boring. Better are the real physical stunts and gags. Ron (""Beauty and the Beast"") Pearlman's flip attitude as the Big Red One and his apparent ease in the full-body makeup make the character come alive and the movie work. John Hurt and Selma Blair costar."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","1","13 May 2007"," Hellboy
","Essentially just one in a long line of comic book film adaptations, Hellboy is enlivened by the superb casting of Ron Perlman from the 'I-know-the-face-but-can't-remember-the-name' school of acting as the eponymous hero.<br/><br/>Hellboy is the infant product of some Nazis attempt to lure demons through a portal opened by Grigori Rasputin √Ç‚Äì yeah, that Rasputin. Taken under the wing of John Hurt's professor-of-something Bruttenholm, Hellboy grows into a hulking monster with red skin, forked tail and an impressive pair of horns which he grinds down in order to blend in.<br/><br/>Introduced as a Loch Ness Monster type focus of media speculation, writer/director Guillermo del Toro quickly discards this aspect of the tale to concentrate on a relatively straightforward supernatural demons type plot that offers nothing new to those familiar with a range of comic book heroes stories (this film is, in fact an amalgamation of three different Hellboy stories). A love story is unwisely shoehorned into the plot, providing a respite from the plethora of special effects, which might have been more welcome had it been of any interest.<br/><br/>Perlman is the best thing about this film. For a start, he looks the part, even though he was in his mid-fifties when this was shot. He breaths a little life into a lot of lame one-liners, but the foes with which he is provided are a little too bland at times: Biddy Hodson, the only villain whose character offered the suggestion of a little depth, is woefully underused and the film is all the weaker for it.<br/><br/>This one will please the pre-18 multiplex set, but will leave more mature audiences wanting something more substantial."

The special effects scenes are numerous and often very well done.<br/><br/>pace: pretty good pace, though all in all it is quite predictable.<br/><br/>some ideas directly lifted from elsewhere: - the final scene where the hero gets rid of the huge monster by burning it from insides, rings a bell? Yep, lifted directly from MIB! - when she gets angry, the girls can unleash very powerful flames, and even shock waves and explosions. That's right - lifted from X-Men<br/><br/>what about having a hero who is really from Hell, what about expanding on the theme of his developing a ""good guy"" personality just because of a better environment? Not enough time for that - basically the guy is just good for some reason, and he never wonders why, or wonders about Hell, all we know is that he prevents his horns from growing, and he is pretty much indestructible (at least bombs powerful enough to destroy a monster with the mass of several whales, leave him unharmed).<br/><br/>Bottom-line: average fantasy / sci-fi film, good special effects, funny at times. 6 out of 10."

Hellboy is a funny, very cynic and very close to human character ( even with his superhero ability) that makes this dark movie a little bit lighter and funnier.<br/><br/>Second is the direction.

","Not into comic books a great deal, Batman having always been the exception, I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie. Been a fan of Ron Perlman's since Beauty and the Beast days so more or less certain his performance would be at least entertaining. I was very much surprised by how much I really enjoyed this movie. The mix of Gothic mystery, action, tragedy, out of left field characters and irresistible humour, caught me completely the first time I saw it. Bought the DVD as soon as it came out and just keep watching it again and again. It's got something of everything. The cinematography and special effects are quite gorgeous and although it's not as big budget as some others in the genre, I think I prefer that. Huge amounts of money tend to shout a little after awhile and can distract from the human story. Make no mistake; this is a very human story. Everyone was so well cast and Ron Perlman just *is* Hellboy. He's what I tend to think of as a true hero: not perfect but then it depends on what you mean by perfect. He may be red, have horns and a tail and have come from a hell dimension but he's so human. His totally ineffectual attempt to toe out of sight the half-finished love notes to Liz when she enters the room, is perfect and is a great example of who Hellboy is. My hat has to go off to the guys who had to perform in the prosthetics in freezing, wet conditions. There's an awful lot of heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears gone into this movie and although it's so seamless it doesn't show, you can still feel it. Even if you're not into comic books, you really might want to consider giving this movie the once over."

","Hellboy is an entertaining comic book movie with plenty of action and its visually stunning. Based on Mike Mignola's cult comic book character, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a demon brought to earth by evil scientists and then put to use fighting the supernatural in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Along with his fellow agents, the man-fish Abe Sapien and fire-starter Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), Hellboy takes on an evil power that threatens a mankind that will always treat them like outcasts. I have never read the comic book but after watching the film I kind of want to. Guillermo Del Toro does a great job of directing and keeps the film moving at a nice pace. Even the non action scenes of Hellboy are nice because there's a lot of humor in the story. The action scenes itself are cool and are done well. The cast is pretty good with Ron Perlman playing Hellboy and I think he was perfectly casted for the role. Also there's Selma Blair and she does a decent job but she's not that good of an actress. The problem with Hellboy is that its hard to root for the main character because he isn't very nice. Also Hellboys enemies aren't very interesting and the movies running time of two hour plus starts to wear you down. However, the film should satisfy fans of the comic book and comic book fans in general. Rating 7/10, entertaining at most parts and its worth a look."

Always thought of them as of we'll-save-the-world boring and pathetic kind of heroes - they are too good-looking and clean-shaven to think seriously of them, although I can't say anything bad about the actors. When I see the characters, I get this strange feeling that these guys got the highest marks in school, never lied and you can't see them eating something that is unhealthy. Hellboy is different. For sure. A demon fighting for peace on Earth. Cutting his horns for them not to grow further. Playing ""lonely hero"", watching cartoons and trying to hide a cigar from his father (professor Broom - the guy who ""adopted"" him, actually, but... ahem... this is not the father who just gave birth, but the one who grew the baby up, right?). Demon, which has a thing for cats, shows an ironic outlook on everything including himself (""I can promise you that I will always look this good!"") and demonstrates a really STRONG love towards ONE girl. Unbelievable. Unbelievable, but who told you that real men are made in heaven? They only go there... afterwards... Special thanks to Ron Perlman who proved to be REALLY GOOD one more time."
"actionlad","7","1","1","26 January 2005"," Helluva Ride!
","To the uninitiated, Hellboy is a comic book that has been around for about ten years. I read comics during my teen years and then took the habit up again about four years. In all that time, I had only read one or two Hellboy comics, but even with that limited knowledge, the film is quite easy to follow.<br/><br/>Comparatively speaking, this film was much more engaging than some of the other comic book adaptations which have been done through the years (namely Hulk and Daredevil). The action and pacing is in all the right places. Unlike Hulk and Daredevil, Hellboy's script writers know that good humor isn't something you put in the story when there's a few slow moments or when the character isn't in his superhero guise. Instead, the humor comes out in the most unlikely places (especially in scenes with one of my favorites, Jeffery Tambor). Most of it is natural, even to the point that during one scene that has a humorous tone, there is a juxtaposition of another very tragic scene in Hellboy's life interspersed throughout.<br/><br/>I think that was one of the strengths of the film along with the special effects. The only real drawbacks were that some of the characters seemed to come off as two dimensional (namely Liz Sherman and John Meyer) in the initial part of the film. Even Hellboy is introduced in the modern day somewhat awkwardly, to the point that it takes a while to start liking him. The other drawback is the resolution seems anti-climactic with no explanation as to why certain things happen the way they do.<br/><br/>Still, with those drawbacks, it's definitely a cool film to rent. Speaking of rentals, it would have been cooler to have more features on the DVD explaining Hellboy's makeup process, effects and maybe some outtakes.<br/><br/>Overall, a fun film to watch and not take too seriously. 7/10"
"ariakos","6","1","1","11 January 2005"," Not even close to a masterpiece, but still...
","As a fan of the Hellboy comic series it's hard not to compare movie with the original comic although that doesn't do any justice to the movie itself: they are separate things and thus they should be taken too. But nevertheless I find the movie version of Hellboy a little hollow: lot of fun action, a little philosophical banter about nature of humanity and not-so-well-done relationship drama.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman IS Hellboy. When I first read Hellboy ages ago, it was Perlman and no other actor I only could imagine as the lead for Hellboy movie. Thank God he did too. Perlman shines in this one and brims of blunt and stoic charisma. His performance of Hellboy is great mixture of humor and seriousness, just like comic version. John Hurt (professor Broom) performed also well, as usually. Others were more or less OK.<br/><br/>Effects were nice, general atmosphere and sense of adventure was great and Perlman alone was well worth to see this. But what of the downsides? In truth, I disliked the romantic parts of the movie. Too shabby, too hollow. Obviously Hellboy is a man with hormones too, but in the movie his craving for tail (pun definitely intended) was way too dominating element and took a lot more screen time than necessary. In a way more than I could tolerate. Believe it or not, you CAN actually do good relationship drama withOUT any romance. Could someone *please* tell Del Toro this? Friendship, for instance, is what I would have liked the Hellboy movie to express rather than any faked romance. In the comic version almost entire B.P.R.D. was one big family, which made Liz, Abe, Hellboy and the other ""freaks"" of the Bureau more of siblings and true friends, rather than random romantic encounters. This family behavior gave a lot deeper meaning for their interactions in the comics. None of this was seen on the movie. Hellboy treated Abe as a neutral colleague although Abe claimed they were friends (quess Hellboy just didn't show it on-screen then, hmm?). And Liz was portrayed only as the love interest of the main character, not really a plausible person of her own or a qualified member of the Bureau.<br/><br/>But hey, some might have actually liked those romantic scenes. Good for them. For me the very romantic element itself was just a distraction and a lousy way to add forced romance in a movie that didn't even necessarily require that. It felt so fake. But enough of that. Now to the plot. If you have read the comics, you know the deal and can fill the holes the movie leaves. But without reading them? You might have a little harder time to understand everything than happens. It's OK though, as the plot is not that important, intelligent or even interesting anyway. Things just happen and you can focus on the way too cool Hellboy.<br/><br/>As a rental entertainment this has great value though: Cool main character, great action, funny but a little illogical plot. I've seen a lot worse comic hero movies.<br/><br/>6/10"

In comparison Hellboy at least get some jokes right which poor Will Smith didn't.<br/><br/>I think Guillermo del Toro was pretty low in budget because the monsters were always the same, no more money for that modeling and computer animation, so it was require that the storyline get stuck in a constant repetition of a fight scene with the same Hellboy and the same resurrected fella in different locations.<br/><br/>The characters were enjoyable, I think Ron Perlman is a wasted actor that actually has made something with The city of Lost Children and Cronos, the last one with Guillermo. Selma Blair and everyone else was plain good.<br/><br/>All the problems in this movie really reside in the plot holes, especially near the end, Hellboy thriumps in a way too absurd and too easy for us to care and applaud him, despite that I think anyone has a standart possibility to be entertain and not end angry and mislead like I felt with that I Robot turkey."

","Why is it lately the best films about who we are as men and women come from stories full of aliens, freaks and mutants?<br/><br/>`Hellboy', which has one of the weakest premises out of the Marvel Comic factory, is about a Devil child accidentally let loose to our world through a Nazi experiment gone awry. The United States raises him to take care of other evil going on in the world that we, of course, never hear about.<br/><br/>Hollywood is big on that: `Ghostbusters', `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', `Men in Black', `Harry Potter', `Stargate', `The X-Files', and `Stuart Little' come to mind. (I think talking mice can be verrrrry creepy.)<br/><br/>Nonetheless, `Hellboy', played by Ron Perlman, is the quintessential tough guy with a sensitive streak. This is not a new role for Perlman. Ever since he played the Beast in `Beauty and the Beast' in the late 1980's, (remember way back to the 1900's?), Perlman has shown that ugliness is only skin deep.<br/><br/>`Hellboy' is a wise cracking cigar smoking cross between George Peppard, Ted Danson and Jack Nicholson. He's Sgt. York with a John Wayne swagger. He's short on words and big on action and is more cocky than Han Solo and Ferris Bueller.<br/><br/>From the get go, the film has a Spielberg `Raiders of the Lost Ark' feel to it in both story and well blocked direction by `Blade II' and `Mimic' director Guillermo del Toro. (I wonder if William the Bull knows Benny (Benecio) the Bull.) The action never lets up with rare moments to let you grab your inhaler and when it does let up it's for some sappy scene that isn't even important plot points - except to show `Hellboy's' all too human inner calling.<br/><br/>The film is unrelenting, as was `Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom', and it shows that plot driven films has its choice of real stunt men for tools or computer graphics.<br/><br/>Those wacky, fun loving Nazi's are still hanging around waiting to take over the world! You know, when Hollywood tries to have something or someone take over the world it's so serious but when `Pinky and the Brain' do it it's funny though their diabolical plans are no less ponderous. OK, then - Nazis! Evil overactin' Nazis yet! Now that's diabolical! They come back to release some watch-a-ma-call-it really large and slimy thingy and `Hellboy' is called in to kill it. I mean, it's always `Kill it! Kill it! It's gotta' be killed! Make faces at it if you must, but kill it!!!' No one ever wants to capture anything. No, wait, there's always Daryl Hannah in `Splash.' They did want to capture her, but then again, New Yorkers aren't afraid of much.<br/><br/>The trouble with killing this 'moving-so-fast-creature-you-can't-get-a-good-look-at-it', is that for every one that dies, two of them are born! Sort of like mosquitoes and IRS forms! AIEEEE! Surely, there's more to this, I hear you ask yourself with soulful introspection. Unlike `The Hulk', undoubtedly one of the worst films ever to have been made and unfortunately distributed, the answer is yes - but it takes awhile to get there.<br/><br/>The film is 2 hours and 5 minutes long and you start to get antsy even in those plush `loveseat' style seats. (Personally, I think the whole purpose of those seats is to let someone know how you feel about them by either raising or lowering the armrest between you.) The film is well paced with two fairly weak subplots filled in with appropriately enough, fairly weak performances. Rupert Evans, who has been in about six projects, plays the wimpiest CIA Agent you'll ever run across, though he has an abundance of courage. `Hellboy's' girlfriend, who's got a gift with engulfing buildings in flames, (and that's OK if you know how to control it), is played by Selma Blair. (How come she can't control igniting things but she can see to it that her clothes don't even get scorched?) And John Hurt, of all people, likens himself to `Hellboy's' pop since he's the one who raised the little Devil. Hurt's performance is the biggest waste as he's hardly recognizable and could have been played by an unknown because you actually think the guy is an unknown. But the most interesting bit of second player acting, is the half-man/half-fish played by Doug Jones, but voiced by David Hyde Pierce from `Frasier.' And yes, the fish creature is better looking than Lillith.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a land chock full of Nazis, our villains await `Hellboy' and his combustible girlfriend to usher in Satan and his minions - which is pretty ironic since `The Passion' was playing down the hall.<br/><br/> Movie composer Robert Beltrami, veteran of 43 films, did a sensational job as did the hundreds of others who worked on the project. It's as if most of them have worked together before. Wait! They have! Namely the aforementioned `Blade II' and `Mimic.' Come to think of it, the five producers have worked on a plethora of films together and most of them were quite successful. Probably because there were no talking mice. Honestly, what makes this film tick is Perlman's performance.<br/><br/> By the way, the film was shot in Prague. I suppose the producers thought `Hellboy' and Prague was a Czech-mate."

","Great movie to go see for action and one liner laughs. This, like most movies adapted from books or comics, is not 100% accurate, but is still a lot of fun. This adaptation is far better than the big screen version of Spawn. The FX are not new but are well done. The movie has plenty of action and some good laughs. The movie was made for all audiences, so it is not as dark as is comic book origins.<br/><br/>The movie does not make direct biblical references but it does borrow some of the stereotyped devices (such as silver and holy water). Lets face it, Hellboy is a demon. There is has to be some reference to good and evil and it is done well so that it does not directly rely on a specific theology.<br/><br/>This movie is a fun romp and worth watching, and like all movies, should not be taken seriously."
"2blackcats","Null","1","1","4 April 2004"," One heck of a flick
","Based upon the Dark Horse comic by Mike Mignola, directed by Guillermo del Toro (Blade II, Cronos), and starring Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast), Hellboy is one heck of a movie.<br/><br/>The oddest of heroes - a reluctant demon who, despite a stone hand, is all heart - Hellboy fights monsters and resurrected Nazis as part of a covert operation for the US government. Sound silly? It is, and that's its charm. Under del Toro's capable direction, the action is swift, the monsters are scary, and the atmosphere is otherworldly. But it is character that drives Hellboy's plot. Much of the credit goes to the actors behind the masks. Ron Perlman delivers humor and humanity to a part that easily could have been little more than camp. And even supporting players, like the amphibian psychic Abe Sapien (voiced with aplomb by Frasier's David Hyde Pierce) are fully fleshed. <br/><br/>Highly original and immensely entertaining, Hellboy sets a new standard for comic-book adaptations."

","Its kinda hard for me to judge this movie because I am not familiar with the Hellboy comic book. I saw this show in a sneak peak on Friday. I enjoyed the movie but judged it as a regular movie. When I first saw X-Men, Spiderman, The Hulk, and Daredevil, I did not do this. I judged them as remakes as I did know the stories and was familiar with all those comics. Anyway, hellboy was an entertaining movie with good action sequences and a lot of comedy. All the Hellboy fans around me seemed to love the movie so it was probably better to them than to me. I give the movie a 7 out of 10 because it was too simple to me. I enjoyed it but would not add it to my DVD collection. One positive about the movie was that it made me want to go out and look for a hellboy comic to read. Maybe after I read the comic, I will be able to judge the movie completely."

"populationrob","Null","1","1","15 March 2004"," The best demonic superhero film ever made
","Hellboy is a lot of things: a superhero film, an H.P. Lovecraft story, a fish-out-of-water comedy, an action/adventure yarn, a monster movie, and proof that Ron Perlman is singularly the most underrated actor working today.<br/><br/>Hellboy is based on the comic book series of the same name by Mike Mignola. In it, he created a unique world of supernatural influences on our own based in part by Lovecraftian creatures and international folk tales.  These supernatural events are investigated by the B.P.R.D...the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.  Many odd characters along with straight-laced soldiers occupy this group, but the most interesting is Hellboy himself.  Fans of the comic know that even though there is a lush background of amazing stories and multidimensional characters, that the best thing about the comic is Hellboy fighting giant monsters.  And fight giant monsters is what Hellboy does well.<br/><br/>The film Hellboy is an incredible labor of Love by Guillermo del Toro (Blade II, The Devil's Backbone).  Del Toro was a fan of the series and pushed to have the film made.  He's not a director-for-hire here.  He is the driving force in this film's coming to life.  He was a fan first and that, as all comic book/movie geeks know is of ultimate importance.<br/><br/>The plot here revolves around Rasputin, the Russian monk who people with knowledge of history know was the crazy guy who the Russian government had a heck of a time killing.  Well, it turns out that they never did accomplish their task.  He's still alive in 1944 and working for the Nazis' occult division in a last ditch effort to keep the Nazi regime from falling at the hands of the Allies.  With the help of some American soldiers, their scheme to open a portal to another dimension fails but something slips though: Hellboy.  They raise him as their own and eventually Hellboy becomes part of the B.P.R.D.  And then we get to watch them address the supernatural in classic Hellboy nonchalance.<br/><br/>Let me say that Ron Perlman as Hellboy is just amazing.  Perlman, who stole many a woman's heart under the thick make-up as the Beast in the ""Beauty and the Beast"" television show in the 80s shows us that he still has the ability to exude charm from behind layers of latex.  Perlman puts more into this role than a superhero film has any right to have.  Perlman himself has a wide history of very different characters on his resume; his primitive caveman in Quest for Fire to his evil yet charming Hitleresque character in Last Supper to his Russian strongman character in The City of Lost Children. Perlman is an actor's actor.  When you watch Hellboy, you see Hellboy.<br/><br/>Hellboy will keep fans of the comic happy.  But it is very geared to the uninitiated.  This is a movie that everyone can enjoy.  And with it's PG-13 rating, it's reasonably family-friendly.  The violence in this film is more smart than offensive.  This isn't Blade II.  This is Hellboy, a story about a creature who is working against his origin to do good.  It's not where you come from, it's where you're going that counts.  Also, giant monsters were made to be beat up.<br/><br/>I saw this movie March 14th at a special screening in Austin.  Mike Mignola and Ron Perlman were seeing it for the first time there.  Mignola, the creator of Hellboy, was very pleased with how the movie ended up.  What better compliment is there than that?  See this film!  I guarantee that you will leave the theatre wanting more.  If enough people see this on opening weekend April 2nd then of course a sequel will get made.  And I assure you, that's exactly what you want."

","I don't have much to say about this movie. It was rather straightforward and had excellent CGI effects and fight sequences, and I liked the many Lovecraftian bits, but as far as story, plot development, acting, etc., it was a completely unremarkable movie. There wasn't much substance at all to it. I wonder why it was released outside of the summer blockbuster season. All things considered, Hellboy is very much in the same vein as the next X-men sequel or Star Wars installment. It's just eye candy. I enjoyed it on that level, but there was nothing about it -- good or bad -- that makes this film stand out in my mind. I think the description of it as ""a bit of fluff"" would be the most apt."
"erik-imdb","4","3","6","4 April 2004"," Poorly directed, insults viewer's intelligence
","This is an extremely promising concept, badly executed. The first third of the movie forces too many unexplained facts on us - the only character that's given any background is Hellboy (coincidentally - he's the only major character that ""works""). We have no clue as to the motivation of any of the other people, which makes it difficult to accept or understand their behavior later. And why the heck was the head of the military squad in the opening sequence being briefed during their last few steps through the rain on the way to their objective? I mean, it's a comic book movie, and we expect to suspend a dump truck-full of disbelief, but this is just flat-out stupid. Unfortunately, this sort of stupidity permeates the rest of the picture.<br/><br/>The middle third of the picture flows better - Hellboy is facing some monsters in various locations and continues to establish his character. The rest of the characters plod along through their actions with no obvious motivation, etc. The action sequences are garden-variety. Hellboy's one super-attribute, his ""fist of doom"", is underutilized (IMHO), but that's a minor quibble. A not-so-minor gripe is that during one sequence one of the monsters - which at that point had been resolutely quadrupedal (walking on four legs) - walks on his find legs for no reason whatsoever. This caused me a horrible flashback to cheezy 70's movies with people walking around in rubber suits. It looked completely ridiculous. There is also some glaring inconsistency in the amount of ""damage"" suffered by Hellboy in various circumstances - at one  point a moderate cut on his arm causes him to lose enough blood to cause him to eventually collapse, however his being impaled with dozens of pieces of glass later is shrugged off as inconsequential. He gets up slowly after being thrown against the wall, yet gets up easily later on after directly absorbing the blast of half a dozen grenades. At one point he is engulfed in a room full of fire (to which he is supposed to be impervious) and it's the only thing in the film that knocks him unconscious. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to suspend a lot of disbelief, but the director makes it extremely difficult.<br/><br/>Despite the glimmer of promise shown in the second act, the final third of the movie drags you back into the intellectual gutter. We have the caricatured head of the FBI leading this mission - how the hell did this guy lead the FBI? This moron couldn't lead cub scouts on a day hike. The pronunciation of Russian words is so bad that my girlfriend (who speaks Russian as her first language) couldn't understand their words without the subtitles. I don't want to spoil the climactic (or anticlimactic, as it was for me) confrontation, but it frankly made no sense whatsoever. The evil Rasputin is given so many powers ?(for no obvious reason) it reminds me of playing superheros as a small child where you had that one friend that kept making up new ""powers"" whenever it was convenient (or when he/she was in ""trouble"") that you wanted to pummel them into the dirt. And despite that Hellboy deals with him so easily at the end that it's almost a joke.<br/><br/>I can see that a lot of people liked this movie so maybe I was in a harsh mood or something when I saw it (I wanted to like it), but I just couldn't get over the inconsistencies, the lazy scriptwriting, and the ""beat you over the head with some information, then don't explain everything else"" direction. Aside from Ron Perlman, the acting was mediocre at best (of course, it's hard to act a role that's more or less undefined). My suggestion - don't waste your time or money on this one.<br/><br/>4/10"

When it comes down to terrible, Hellboy cuts right through all the crap and hits you up with even more crap. The #1 movie in America, more like the #1 movie in Alice in nobody gonna watch it land. I would have personally liked it better had it not directly contradicted Newton's Laws of physics, stating that no car in any circumstance, when traveling in the horizontal direction, may be punched vertically upwards.

This was the case for me in watching ""Hellboy."" I was totally impressed with Ron Perlman's dry as vermouth performance, and that alone elevates this film above your standard comic book to screen adaptation. Unfortunately, the story is so uninvolving that it never puts the characters in situations that really engage the viewer, so the acting talent much of the time feels wasted.<br/><br/>This film looks great, too, but come on, by now don't all Hollywood action films look pretty good, and shouldn't they, given the amount of money thrown at them. No, the makers of ""Hellboy"" have all the ingredients for a spicy, rich, delicious stew but only manage to muster up a mediocre broth that needs a lot of salt.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"OpheliaXX","4","3","7","14 August 2004"," Good Special Effects, but Limited Character and Story Development
","I'd been looking forward to seeing Hellboy, based on the publicity. I've enjoyed several graphic novels and/or books based upon them. The best of the movies, like Spiderman, the first Superman with Christopher Reeves, the first Batman, X-men, and even the Hulk, successfully capture the wonder and mood that made each comic popular. In the best comic films, newcomers to the story are drawn into the world of that hero and the particular themes that make him or her resonate. (Wonder Woman movie, please!) I didn't have that experience with the hellishly boring Hellboy, and perhaps that is due to its lesser fame. Many people have a basic knowledge of Superman, for example, and that familiarity can make identifying with the characters easier.<br/><br/>Unevenly paced and unbalanced in tone, Hellboy evokes a team of writers struggling to condense a potentially complicated story world into something brief and manageable. It's possible; Peter Jackson did it in Lord of the Rings. Hellboy just didn't work. The characters were sketches, identifiable by one sentence tags, and it was a shame, because it seems like they might have interesting stories from the comics---too bad you don't get that nuance in the actual film. Ron Perlman invests Hellboy with a lot of presence and charisma, but that's a tribute to the actor rather than the dialogue. Rupert Evans was likable, but under utilized. It would have been nice to see Selma Blair as something more than the obligatory love object. Though the FX looked fine, the action scenes seemed strangely boring and random, with major characters being disposed of in anti-climactic manner. Even the villains were disposable and easily dispatched. A very quick ""kill the boss-monster"" ending only increased the movie's feel of being something rushed and underdeveloped."

","About two weeks ago, I was at my local Best Buy. They were handing out preview DVDs for Hellboy. Unfortunately, I watched it. Hellboy has the worst costume I have ever seen. His horn nubs look like red Styrofoam and his chest looks like something you would buy at Target for Halloween. His big arm looks like a spray painted hockey glove. We made fun of this movie for 2 weeks before it came out. I had absolutely no intentions of going.. However, my friend really wanted to see this atrocity. So I decided to go. I expected a bad movie, but what I saw was beyond horrible. The plot made no sense. The cutesy red demon child was gay, that Nazi gas mask guy spins his knives like an idiot instead of killing Hellboy. Hellboy spews random horrible punch lines until the demon gets p***ed of and attacks him. All Hellboy has to do is PULL THE F*CK*NG trigger to his enormous gun and the demon would be dead. I think you all know the scene that I'm talking about. They didn't explain anything about the huge octopus demons that will destroy the world. They didn't explain the huge hand thing and how it is supposed to unlock dimensions. I'm just naming a few things that p***ed me off.

It's done in a way that permits humour to be used without breaking the tension when it's needed.<br/><br/>One of my all time favorites. If you think about it, it's incredible that you actually feel for a giant red guy with horns, a blue fish-man and some giant walking trees by the end of this movie, without having watched anything like it before-hand. This isn't part of some heavily set up universe like Marvel has done with its movies now. It's a completely standalone thing and it just works."
"Coventry","7","2","4","26 October 2004"," Red alert
","Hellboy joins the recent trend of popular comic book adaptations (X-Men, Spiderman) and unfortunately also the dire trend of movies that drown in computer engineered effects (like Underworld or Van Helsing). The good news is that it was directed and co-written by Guillermo Del Toro, who has a terrific sense of perspective. Hellboy doesn't take itself too serious and that's why it is a lot easier to digest than an overly pretentious film like Underworld, for example. I never read any of the Hellboy comics during my youth but that isn't a necessity in order to follow the film. Apparently, he's a demon awakened by the most stereotypical Nazi's you'll ever see and nursed by an American scientist (John Hurt). As a fully-grown demon, Hellboy serves the FBI as some sort of caretaker along with some other freaks of nature. There's an aqua-man that shows a lot of resemblance with the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Selma Blair who bursts into flames whenever she gets emotional. Blair's character seems to come right out of an X-Men comic. Hellboy features a few very cool gimmicks and ¬ñ surprisingly enough ¬ñ a couple of very atmospheric and eerie sequences like the one shot at the Russian cemetery when it's snowing. The plot is utterly thin but there's the outstanding performance by Ron Perlman as Hellboy to fill up the emptiness. Some of his one-liners are pathetically lame but his charisma and grimaces do the job. The big advantage about these comics-turned-into-films is that anything goes. Here you have Nazi's collaborating with Rasputin (?), Hellhounds in the subway and more of this cheerful crap. Hey, at least it was better than Daredevil."
"rosscinema","5","2","4","26 September 2004"," Fairly fun but Hellboy could use more of an edge
","No doubt that this is one of those overly silly films based on a comic book and while this is pretty entertaining it could have benefited from a more darker approach to the material. Story starts out in the later part of WWII where the Nazis and Rasputin (Karel Roden) have opened a time portal to summon the Seven Gods of Chaos which are mutant octopus lying dormant in space. American forces thwart their efforts but a small red creature has passed through the portal where it is adopted by the FBI.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Now it's the present day and Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is kept in a secret Government base where he helps the FBI battle monsters that threaten the U.S. and the world. Hellboy is raised by Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt) and he assigns a young FBI agent named John Myers (Rupert Evans) to aid Hellboy who scoffs at him. Hellboy is in love with another paranormal named Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) who's a pyrokineticist and can start fires when excited. Meanwhile, Rasputin's lover and aid Ilsa (Bridget Hodson) has resurrected him and they also summon a lizard like creature that can lay eggs quickly and this is all part of their plans to open another portal and once again try to summon the Seven Gods of Chaos.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Guillermo del Toro who's films are some of the darkest and visually exciting of the last 5 years but that seems to be whats lacking here. With ""Cronos"" and ""Mimic"" and ""Blade II"" this material seems tailored made for a dark visionist like del Toro but he plays it extremely safe here and the end result is just another tongue in cheek action film based on a comic book. Not that I disliked this film because I didn't and for the most part I was fairly entertained by what I saw. The big reason for it is the performance by Perlman who does a good job of giving Hellboy a distinct personality that is for the most part played in a comedic manner. Once again Perlman is buried underneath all sorts of make-up but he does allow the viewer to understand his true feelings and I was reminded of a Bruce Willis or Clint Eastwood attitude with Schwarzenegger muscles but painted completely red! The story is pretty convoluted and one can't help but think what would a bunch of mutant octopus do with this world if it had it? But the action scenes are plentiful and the actors seem to be having a good time but I do wish that del Toro could have used his brilliant dark vision to create something more distinct."
"robw_1206","Null","2","4","6 September 2004"," Very confusing if you haven't read the comics. (Potential spoilers)
","I Felt I had to make a comment on this film as I have difficulty in understanding the praise this film has received in the reviews I've read. To have an introduction that allows the Nazis to be in Scotland during the end of the second world war is sure to anger many citizens of the UK so this took me aback. Nevertheless, I was prepared to let this glaring historical inaccuracy go as it is a fantasy film and I was determined to enjoy myself for my ¬£6 pound entry. <br/><br/>I respected the fact that the film was trying to be a little different from the glut of superhero films out at the moment and Ron Perlman evidently was trying his best with a woeful script. However the only point in the film that me and the rest of the cinema audience even registered a mild chuckle was when Hellboy throws a stone at his love rival. The fight scenes were also poorly handled, Del Toro evidently letting some of the bad habits (such as the lack of motion capture in the ninja fight scene in Blade II) creep into this film. Why did Hellboy, when thrown into a wall appear to be on a zip line when flying distances that defy gravity through endless amounts of glass cabinets? <br/><br/>I also felt the need for the viewer to have read the comics thoroughly to have a chance at grasping the plot. Was Rasputin in league with Hitler? What was the spaceship at the start with the huge eye? Why wasn't Hellboy crushed to death in the subway when he screams 'ouch' at the sucker thing on his arm? It is these inaccuracies on the part of the director, which are a bit unprofessional. Why did the nazi assassin have to die to sneak in to John Hurt's lab when Rasputin could have killed him as he was in there anyway? Also, how bad were the snow effects? It seems like when Hellboy fell on the ground near the end that he was pushing aside bits of polystyrene. For this to be a mainstream Hollywood release it needs to be able to appeal to all and not just those who have read the comics. I could go on forever but I am getting as bored now as I was ten minutes into the film."
"rohitian","6","2","4","6 August 2004"," It's exactly what you think...
","This film hopes that its high production quality and charming wit will compensate for the fact that it lacks continuity and quite often defies the very rules it invents for the Hellboy world. One example can be found after Hellboy has been pushed off of the front of a train, only to keep knocking his shaved-down horns on the bottom of the cars that are passing over him. This resulted in a great deal of friction, heating his horns, and leading the leading man to say ""Ouch!"" after touching these horns, indicating to his viewers that they were hot. However, not 60 seconds later, Hellboy reveals one of his powers, by grabbing a rail and allowing the electricity to surge through his body and fry his opponent. How could his horns be too hot to touch, but yet he could sustain who-knows-how-many volts of electricity? Then, there was the Liz Sherman character, played by Selma Blair, whose fiery temper could set an entire asylum ablaze all the while leaving her clothing completely unscorched. Oh, how we long for the days when a man's rage might turn him big and green, but would also magically grow an appropriately placed pair of purple pants! Also, Rasputin looked like a pimp, for some reason. Ron Perlman, however, offers an even and sardonic delivery of an extra-worldly character, whose human upbringing shares the quintessential values of hope, love, and freewill. Although the writing at times desired something more, at many times, especially in scenes with Jeffrey Tambor, the film would surprise you with its happy-go attitude. And it should not be overlooked, the special effects were fun and engaging. Hellboy's a watch-it-once, maybe watch-it-once-more kind of movie that has you happy that you didn't take it too seriously and thankful that we still have Sam Raimi to show us how a comic book movie is really done."

","""Hellboy"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a demon who is rescued by the Nazis trying to fight and defend anyone who is in danger. He soon realizes that he has to fight the forces of darkness in order to bring peace and prosperity in the world.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had an interesting, funny plot combined with many action scenes. The interpretation of Ron Perlman who played as Hellboy was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Finally, the direction od the movie which was made by Guillermo del Toro who is also the writer of it, was simply exceptional and his amazing work was obvious through the whole duration of film."

","Much like the Punisher, Hellboy was created for the older comic book fans. The character was designed to be an anti-hero, less refined than Batman or Superman, someone who would hate being labeled a superhero. While the comics weren't as popular as others, the film gave life to the franchise and created a cult following. The story is meant to introduce us to the character of Hellboy, a cat loving, cigar smoking, red guy, with a bad attitude, who secretly works for the government protecting The United States from paranormal threats. Everyone knows by now that I hate superheroes, so the idea of the anti-hero really appealed to me. I could have easily become one of the cult followers and fallen for Hellboy, the way all the comic-con kids did, if it wasn't for the uncertain direction of the film. Guillermo Del Toro struggled back and fourth with whether or not this film should be geared for kids or adults, and went the PG-13 route. It worked in terms of getting a larger audience, but it also took away from the original intent of the character. Throughout the film we keep hearing about how tough and dangerous Hellboy is, but he's really wasn't that much of a bad ass. If Hellboy is so unlike any hero, why is he working for government instead of breaking the law, and why is it that he doesn't utter a single curse word? The character was far too toned down for my liking, but the flip-side to that was how nasty and creepy some of the bad guys were. Broom is one of the best comic villains I've ever seen and given his Nazi background, he most certainly was not intended for kids. Overall, I enjoyed parts of the film, I loved Ron Perlman, and as with any film by Guillermo Del Toro, the special effects were amazing. However, the lack of direction makes the film somewhat unfulfilling and anti-climatic. Hopefully that will all change when I get up to Hellboy II."

"TheFilmGuy1","7","0","0","13 September 2014"," Cheesy But Pretty Fun
","Guillermo del Toro is known for writing some pretty cheesy scripts when it comes to English speaking movies, and this movie is no exception. It is full of cheesy lines and clich√©s, but it's still a lot of fun. It's a comic book movie made before todays time of constant comic book movies. <br/><br/>The story is one that is one third original, one third clich√©, and one third stuff that del Toro loves. There's Nazi's that are involved with paranormal, weird creatures, creatures with tongue like things that shoot out, and all around odd things. Del Toro loves all this stuff (for more on that, watch The Strain) and it's kinda more funny than it is serious and dramatic, but it's still fun. It's self aware at times and a lot of humour is thrown in which works.<br/><br/>Now there's a good mix of CGI and practical effects. The practical stuff works for me, but a lot of the CGI doesn't. Granted it is 2004 and we have come a LONG way since then, but there are a few specific shots, such as Hellboy crushing a redbull can, that are absolutely terrible looking. They look incomplete at times. But I will say that for the most part it looks passable. Not amazing, but okay. <br/><br/>The movie shines in the department of design of sets and characters. The outfits and general appearances of the people in this movie are really top notch and feel fresh. It certainly makes them fun to look at. Even the general style of filming this movie goes for is kinda unique and fun. It feels like del Toro actually had a vision for this movie, like he does with most of his films. <br/><br/>Overall this is a movie that is pretty fun. It leans more to the popcorn flick side of things, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's part of the beginning of the comic book genre of movies we see today, which as a side note, i'm really damn sick of."

","In celebration of HELLBOY's 20th anniversary, our local comic shop (Fanboy Comics) arranged a screening of both HELLBOY movies at a post-production screening room and it was well worth the effort: the ONLY way to appreciate these kind of movies is to see them up on The Big Screen; even the new, larger format flatscreen televisions don't really do them justice. The production values of the two HELLBOY movies are mind-boggling, to say the least, and Ron Perlman was the perfect choice to play Mr. Boy. The introduction of a character not in the original comics was one of the sticking points I always had with the first movie (filmmakers always seem to need to have ""someone the audience can relate to"" in a fantasy film, but they're usually wrong about that- as they were with both THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE CROW, to mention but two of the fantasies that bog down in the ""Real World""). Still, the fx are stellar- and I can't wait to see what Del Toro does with THE HULK."

","Hellboy is a very well-crafted visual treat. It makes fantastic use of both CGI and practical makeup to create its illusions. Ron Perlman as Hellboy (or ""Red"") is particularly impressive, especially when you consider how much of a pain it would have been to prepare for that role with all of that makeup and prosthetic material every single day.<br/><br/>The plot is ""save the world"" type of stuff, but that's fine, because a movie as stylish as this has no time or need to dwell on complex subplots and dialogue; it's supposed to be fun.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of funny little quirks on top of the visual effects. Hellboy happens to be a very charming, funny character who lives up to his appearance with his personality.<br/><br/>Despite the richness of its effects, I found the movie to be surprisingly restrained. Not significantly so, but we have Hellboy, we Abe Sapien (also cool) and we have some scary looking ""hounds"" that have tentacles and long tongues. But it probably could have been more diverse. The movie is 130 minutes long, but it just doesn't feel like it makes the most of that running time.<br/><br/>Regardless, it's a unique and very entertaining comic book movie."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","5 March 2014"," Colourful yet grim fantasy tale
","Here's a fantasy film, a comic book adaptation actually, that isn't afraid to fully commit to its world. The world of Hellboy is a strange, multilayered and bizarre combination of influences from Christian mythology to Russian history to weird pulp science fiction. Yet under Guillermo del Toro's direction it all takes shapes and starts to make sense. The world is never explained in detail, like in some other superhero films. We never get to know where most of the weirdness comes from or what it really means in the grand scheme of things, but it all feels like it has a purpose. It feels real within the realm of the film.<br/><br/>So what's the story. There lives a demon, the eponymous Hellboy (Ron Perlman), who was brought to Earth during World War Two by Rasputin (Karel Roden), who was working for Hitler at the time - but of course he was - but who was taken in and raised by an American professor Trevor Broom (John Hurt) when his group of Alliance soldiers helped to stop Rasputin. But now Hellboy must face his original enemy and learn who he really is. It is an outlandish tale and the film is brave enough to not beat around the bush with it. It doesn't try to modernize the character, it doesn't try to make it more sleek and current. It's good, old-fashioned geeky story and damn proud of it.<br/><br/>The reason why I didn't rate the film any higher is that I think the central story would have been fine as it it. It would have been strong enough to work as a pure adventure film. Unfortunately the plot is diluted by needless side characters and their story arcs and the connections to Hellboy's own arc. Take for instance John Myers (Rupert Evans), who gets transferred to Hellboy's unit from FBI. He's the audience surrogate, there to allow other characters to explain things to him. Yet the thing is that the film doesn't really need an audience surrogate. It's a complex world, but as I said earlier, del Toro's directing is strong enough to explain the world through other means. Surprisingly little is explained through Myers, making him absolutely pointless. Then there's the director of the unit, the various agents, other ""freaks"" of the unit, various bad guys and so on. I get that most of them are from the original comic books. It makes sense that they wanted to include them in the film. It just pains me, because there's such a good adventure plot, which gets buried beneath all the establishing scenes when the film tries to cram in yet another character. Plus there's a romance subplot, because of course there is...<br/><br/>If I'm being completely honest with myself, I have to admit that my dislike for this film is more than little irrational. Objectively looking it's a fine film. The main leads are very strong in their roles, the film looks great even today and the mythos is especially intriguing. I just can't reconcile with myself about what I want this film to be and what it actually is. If you're a fan of gritty adventures, comic book movies or full and detailed fantasy worlds, then I'd give this one a watch."

He is brought up by a professor who believes that he can help fight crime. All goes well until the people who brought him through want to reopen the gate and bring through these creatures to destroy the planet.<br/><br/>The story is quite interesting and a lot of fun. There are some comedy moments in there, even a couple that made me laugh out loud. The action sequences were over the top, but for a fantasy film it is what is expected. The fighting was big and there was a lot of destruction. The make up and costumes was good... I liked the dark, but colourful look of the characters. You could tell this was made by Guillermo del Toro. It felt like one of his movies. He has a certain feel and look to his films, much like Tim Burton, but slightly darker. There were some scenes where the effects were not that great... but you can get past that.<br/><br/>The film stars Ron Pearlman as Hellboy, and you can tell it's him from the outset. I have been watching Ron ever since I was a little boy. He was in a TV show I loved as a kid called Beauty and the Beast. He played the beast. He has a really interesting face. He plays characters like the Beast and Hellboy brilliantly. Also in this film was John Hurt, Selma Blair & Rupert Evans. Selma is a bit hit and miss. She can be good in some roles and bad in others. There are some episodes of Anger Management where she is so bad that it is embarrassing... but other where she is really good. This is one of those roles... she is good in a lot of scenes, but not so good in others. John and Rupert did brilliantly.<br/><br/>A great fantasy action film with a lot going on.

In 1944 a portal was built by the Nazis with the guidance of Rasputin, in order to release entities to conquer the world. <br/><br/>Sixty years later, the FBI is sent to check out Hellboy, a humanoid creature who was released during Wotld War II. Ron Perlman is the lead, and he is very good, as he battles many different evil doers along the way. A sense of humor is also evident with excellent special effects. The plot is fairly detailed for the genre, and although far-fetched, is based on a comic book, after all. It's worth the ride for del Toro's vision and Perlman's work."

","Hellboy was such an interesting movie to see. It shreds clich√©s to pieces, has a fantastic story, hilarious one-liners, great CGI, but something in between made it feel empty. By no means is Hellboy a bad movie, but indescribably the movie falls short...<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good. Ron Pearlman shines as always, and I think he was a great choice for Hellboy. He delivers his lines one by one with no struggles at all, and leaves you hungry for more. The only character that was questionable was the FBI detective John Myers, played by Rupert Evans. He seemed to be walking through the film, but with a crippled leg and embarrassment.. The thing that blew me away was how the story moves along. It didn't need complex twists and turns, only a hint. It moves along with precision and thought, and wasn't hard to follow at all. The movie is stylized by the great director, but the style isn't overdone like most other films these days. He knows how to put the right amount of humor and action, never falling for slow-motion shots or far-fetched explosions.. The movie is also really faithful to it's source material. I remember reading the comics as a kid, and finding them really good, and the director knew how to put the thing on the big screen. He does it with the right amount of attention, and the right amount of differences..<br/><br/>Although I liked the film, there were some shortcomings. Hellboy was overdone with his jokes and humor albeit his few hilarious speedy one- liners. The movie has no tension whatsoever, but I'm not going to count that since the movie isn't serious. But whenever Hellboy is in a huge fight, you won't be cheering for anyone, because you'll know he'll come out the last one standing. Nevertheless, these things won't destroy the film for you. It delivers, maybe for a certain audience, but delivers albeit a little fall back. I recommend for people who can chose style over substance, but also get a little substance in between.<br/><br/>7/10."

This is far better than average comic book films because it looks more rich and has a lot of neat visuals that have more of an eye-popping appeal than most films like this. The comic relief and sarcasm are especially well-done by Perlman in a good performance. Few films deal with such a heavy weight subject like Satan and do it to such a good effect.

I just re-watch it and it definitely reassured the fact that this is infinitely better than the sequel, which lost all sense of gloom and simply repeated bad jokes and added non Hellboy related stuff (elves, etc). It's hard to see why people would consider Hellboy worse than Hellboy 2 but, then again, you just have to look at the world today to realize how messed up common sense and opinions are.

Guillermo Del Tore was an excellent choice to direct this movie. He fuels it with dark fantasy and imaginative visuals,creatures and plot devices. His style of film making makes this film a joy to watch as we soak up his dazzling vision. I must also give credit to Ron Perlman for his brilliant performance as Hellboy. He makes Hellboy sympathetic,likable,funny,witty and dynamic. He holds your attention whenever he is on screen and radiates confidence,power and also a bit of a sensitive side. Hellboy is very self aware and we can tell that he wishes he could fit in and be accepted and despite the fact that some people may fear him,he doesn't hate outside people. The other great performance in this movie is by John Hurt as Hellboys father. He is the wise confident leader who is also a great father figure for Hellboy. One other thing that I loved about this movie was the mythology used here. It is imaginative,frightening and some how very threatening in this film. This film is not without some flaws,some plot elements and characters aren't fully developed(villains mostly) and the film lacks some focus. But these flaws don't hold the movie back to much. this film is fun fast and entertaining but it is also thought full and somewhat touching.

","Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's third English language feature is an enjoyable comic book superhero romp starring the peerless Ron Perlman (as Hellboy himself). Big Red Ron wisecracks and chews cigars as he battles beautifully-realised CG hell-hounds in just the sort of impressive baroque sets we have come to expect from him; it seems del Toro can't get enough of letting the red stuff run through sewers and caverns - the danker the better.<br/><br/>While the script is occasionally aimless, it's also very witty. Perlman plays Hellboy like an indignant teenager, full of tantrums and sarcastic retorts. He's ably supported by John Hurt, Rupert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor, all hamming it up deliciously; Selma Blair seems somewhat vacant by comparison. The plot is ludicrous of course, but never boring. Del Toro is as bold as ever - not only in the casting of a decidedly non-stellar cult hero in the title role, but also in his wanton references to real historic villains to bolster the menace of his many menaces. But it is generally breezy stuff: silly, too violent for younger children, and yet sweet-natured and - Superman Returns and Spiderman 3 take note - FUN."

Perlman is very human behind his alarming makeup, and gets to wisecrack in a way that works far better than it has in other comic book-oriented films. He also is surrounded by a first-rate cast, including John Hurt as a kindly professor/mentor and Selma Blair as Hellboy's psy-powered love interest.

After seeing the flick I can tell you it's not my favourite comic book adaptation, but it is a decent one.<br/><br/>Never reading the Hellboy comics I did not know what I was getting myself into, but the film looked like it was going to do one thing and that was entertain me. The problem I had with it was that it wasn't entertaining enough. It had all the right ingredients, it just didn't mix well. What I got was a pretty average flick with a sub-plot that I did not really care for.<br/><br/>Perlman is in his zone with this character and even though he is under heavy make-up, I can't really see anyone else pulling this off the way he does. The right amount of comedic touch adds an odd layer to this demonic looking creature.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast didn't do much for me. I didn't care if the young agent died or not and Selma Blair was just too depressed for me to want to like her.<br/><br/>The special effects were good and interacted well with the characters. Even though most were over the top, this is a comic book film after all. So I let it slide.<br/><br/>Finally, it wasn't climatic enough. Remember when I told you how 'bad-ass' that end part of the trailer was with the giant squid. Well, I was prepped for an epic showdown and was let down by a 10 second fight.

","Strangely enough, Hellboy makes me think of Ron Perlman's performance in the slightly less impressive but underrated Alien Resurrection (oh shut up, it wasn't that bad). In both movies he plays a character that approaches his work with a casual confidence that comes from long years of general badassedness. In both movies he does hard work but has never really been challenged. He also does that cool thing where he lives unseen right here with us in modern American society, protecting oblivious humans from frightening dangers we don't even know are there. Oh, and he's massive and bright red but files down his enormous horns because he doesn't like to feel like an outcast. Can't be walking around looking like Satan, after all.<br/><br/>The movie opens in Scotland in 1944. The Nazis are falling from power and Hitler has employed a team to try to make use of supernatural forces to maintain his regime. I won't try to explain the intricacies of the process, but basically the efforts ultimately fail, but not before a portal is left open and a baby demon slips through. After the fall of the Nazis, the American military takes a liking to the little demon, taking him under their protection and, for some reason, nicknaming him Hellboy. He falls under the care of an American scientist named Professor Bruttenholm, who also cares for an aquatic mutant curiously named Abe Sapien, and the sporadic involvement of Liz Sherman, played by Selma Blair. Liz is a firestarter but is more human than Hellboy and Abe and has a tendency to be turned off by the work they have to do.<br/><br/>And what do they do? As Professor Bruttenholm explains, ""there are things that go bump in the night. We Are the ones who bump back."" Basically they protect the United States from otherworldly dangers. The latest danger comes in the form of none other than Rasputin, a Russian spiritualist back from the dead with plans to arrange a partnership with some evil gods which will endow him with great powers if he will open their path to earth.<br/><br/>If this all sounds confusing, don't worry, the story is not the most important thing about the movie. It's a comic book thrill ride and it works because the main characters are all performed well, particularly Ron Perlman as Hellboy and Doug Jones as Abe Sapien. The movie cleverly explains how Hellboy and his colleagues have remained secret for all of these years (something to do with an inability to get clear pictures of him, like the Loch Ness monster or Bigfoot), and even makes his existence into a legend, a bedtime story that entertains but is rarely believed to be true.<br/><br/>The characterization is not exactly the best thing about the movie. Selma Blair's character is almost completely uninteresting, Hellboy's sidekick is almost completely unnecessary, and, Hellboy himself is riddled with stereotypes, both human and as a movie character. He's definitely fun to watch, but other than his outstanding make-up, there's really nothing original or unique about him. He is an outcast with a deep love that seems hopeless to him, which is not to stop him from spying in one of the movie's most charming scenes when he thinks his affections are being challenged.<br/><br/>Hellboy was released around the same time as the disappointing Punisher, which represents a much lower quality film in the same genre. It is smart enough to laugh at itself, but not because we need comic relief. The movie is made with a much lighter tone than other similar films because they understand that you can't take a movie like this too seriously without making it unintentionally funny. When we watch comic book movies, we want a hero that we like but we still want to laugh and be entertained. The CGI and some of the special effects could definitely use some work, but this is a comic book movie that even my mom could enjoy. And trust me, that's a good thing."

Let alone some elements that really were higher than any of their likes in other similar movies.<br/><br/>When I listen to Marco Beltrami's engaging music score, I know so well that he loved the movie very much. Feel this dealing with the story by the music where you'll find: denying the hero's presence, the sense of expatriation, the delicate love (Hellboy's father, or girl), the pride of being different, so the greatness of that different hero despite his difference.<br/><br/>Very few times that a script based on comics managed to present the whole history of its main characters, their world's details, and one hot adventure as well, being that powerful and entertaining in the same time. I remember only (Superman - 1978), (X Men - 2000), and now I can add (Hellboy) with a script that was written by the director himself (Guillermo del Toro).<br/><br/>The directing didn't rely on being crazily showy, or roughly choppy. (del Toro) is a moviemaker who doesn't just know his instruments well, but also understands that making thrill isn't about CGI or special sound effects only, the man goes deep to show us humans not robots, pushes us to touch and smell more than to see, making great action however with scene of humor, and a bleeding hero not a video game with metallic characters and cases, so he succeeded eventually in creating a movie not comics.<br/><br/>I loved the way fantasy is made out of history, because it's smart, and because it shows a point of view in history. Believe it or not, anything other than what you already know by heart could be believable!, and take it from me as someone who studied history for 4 years of his life!<br/><br/>Since The Last Supper (1995), I knew that (Ron Perlman) was a good actor, despite how much he was misused in many Hollywood trite roles. So, here, he was distinct, reminding me of some action movies with old heroes. I love that, it's adorable for so many reasons: it makes you feel good about yourself if you're old, or not; as you feel that even being a 60 year old isn't scary at all! Also, it gives you something else the young charming princes of our time (the Affleck style!).<br/><br/>(John Hurt) pulled it off to the max, handling it with heavy understanding, not as any might do; considering it another commercial flick for kids anyway. He was more like the movie itself; serious despite the unserious nature of it. With honest performance like that, and elements as good as these, this kind of movies could be appropriate to be watchable for causes else the action or the imagination, giving it the magical touch to differ from any takeaway superhero!<br/><br/>About faults: I didn't feel at all that the lead was being seduced at the end, whereas his devilish side wasn't found in the first place, so that part of self- conflict or good / bad irony wasn't served at all. And what about an evil man, (Rasputin), who wants to destroy the world as it's just a worth destroying world?? I saw that this absolute-evil-for-evil is a weak motive. Another yet minor points: if Hellboy can make people revive from death, the way he did with the Russian annoying corpse, why he didn't do the same with his father?, or how all the people in the subway saw him indeed while his being was a national secret? Over and above, I hated the last 2 phrases: ""What makes a man? It's his choices. Not the way he starts things, but the way he ends them!!"" Actually, that was too far for the story and Shakespearian in the wrong place!<br/><br/>Save some of the most loyal sticky and ugly creatures, including (Blue), it's fun, as nothing like any easy Superhero movie where being merchandise is the point. At last, I recall one of my friends saying why he loved the movie: ""This super guy is something else, he gets beaten, suffers pain, and sneers at himself!"". Am I add ""he's a desperate lover, who has a noble sadness, and no handsomeness"". Simply, this is why I believe (Hellboy) will live long.<br/><br/>P.S: (David Hyde Pierce), who's better known as (Dr. Niles Crane) from the TV sitcom (Frasier), did the vocal performance of (Abe Sapien) or (Blue). So while the whole world recognized his voice easily, why his name was ""uncredited""?!"

","2004 was an interesting year for comic book movies: on quite opposing sides we had Spieder-Man 2, still the best superhero movie after Chris Nolan's vision of Batman, and Catwoman, a new low point for the genre seven years after Batman & Robin. There was also The Punisher, a fun but rather conventional flick which passed by rather unnoticed, and Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro's pet project, a film he'd been dying to make ever since he first read Mike Mignola's original comics. Now, this first crack at Dark Horse's antihero doesn't come off as a very personal piece of work (something Sam Raimi mastered to perfection with the second Spidey movie), but it's impressive nonetheless (plus, how often does one get the original author to contribute to the screenplay?).<br/><br/>Based largely on the classic story The Seed of Destruction, the film begins in 1944, when Nazi officer Kroenen and mad monk Rasputin try to summon the forces of Hell to defeat the Allies. The ritual goes awry, and out of Hell comes simply a scared little demon child. The little fella is adopted by Professor Broom (John Hurt), whose reassuring voice guides us through that introductory sequence.<br/><br/>Sixty years later, Broom is one of the fundamental elements of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), a covert organization that fights supernatural creatures. Or, as the Professor himself explains to the newly arrived Agent Myers (Rupert Evans): ""There are things that bump in the night, Agent Myers. And we are those who bump back."". The bumping in question is provided by an elite team supervised by Broom: Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, with the voice provided by David Hyde Pierce, aka Niles Crane), an amphibian with some kind of telepathic/empathetic gift linked to his ""hands""; Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a sweet-looking girl who has the ability to ""be on fire""; and of course Hellboy (Ron Perlman), the now grown-up demon whose disregard for rules or subtlety is a constant pain in the ass for Tom Manning (Jeffrey Tambor), the man in charge of keeping the BPRD hidden from the public. It won't prove that easy when a new disaster is about to happen, one that could have to do with Hellboy's oldest enemies.<br/><br/>The story is pretty basic, with the big exception of Hellboy being anything but your average ""superhero"": he's rude, smokes cigars, has a passion for kicking monster ass and greets most situations with the line ""Oh, crap!"". It's that uniqueness that got del Toro hooked in the first place, along with the imagery that accompanied such a character. As such, the film is extremely accomplished from a visual standpoint, although the director doesn't go all the way, probably because he is ""stuck"" with the duty of telling the classic origin story without taking things too far (it's easy to imagine studio executives saying: ""Let's save that for the sequels, shall we?""), which means his traditional iconography, linked to ancient myths, is practically absent the whole time.<br/><br/>Compensation comes in terms of characterization: Perlman, who was the director's (and Mignola's) first and only choice for the title role (everyone else objected), delivers the goods with a bad-ass performance that sets the old red one apart from other ""superheroes"" while still giving him a rough charm that makes it easy to like him. Jones and Pierce's joined effort is also an admirable achievement, not to mention proof of del Toro's wisdom in having the main characters achieved through classic makeup, not CGI. Hurt and Tambor are the usual quality gu arantee in the limited time given to them, and Blair isn't that bad either (her screen-time is a bit mistreated, though). Evans, however, is a problem, his role lacking any real substance (how many times has the new-guy's-point-of-view gimmick been used?), but the aforementioned actors, plus a really terrifying villain (that would be Kroenen), manage to make is presence less irritating than it already is.<br/><br/>So, not exactly the triumph del Toro or fans hoped for, but a solid enough promise of greater things to come, just like Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man."

","Hellboy is a freak from another dimension who works for the top-secret FBI-run Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defence, fighting other-worldly monsters and assorted evil forces. But when he comes up against a newly-resurrected Grigori Rasputin, who has a mad plan to bring about the apocalypse, the deck is stacked against our hero ...<br/><br/>Based on the Dark Horse comic strip by Mike Mignola, Hellboy, like all Del Toro's films, is a visually delicious picture, filled with exotic sets, imaginative photography and wild costumes. The story follows the classic Superman structure - we see the origins of Hellboy, learn a little of his formative life on Earth, his adoptive father dies and there's a big showdown with an arch-nemesis and his goons. That's not to say it isn't interesting though; it has a great Nazis-in-Scotland prologue, the villain is an inter-dimensional travelling mad monk, aided by an immortal assassin and a reincarnating hell-hound, and there's all sorts of wacky mythology going on, much of it nicked from Lovecraft's Cthulhu stories. The cast are good, particularly Del Toro regulars Perlman and Jones as the aptly-named Red and Blue, giving fine performances from beneath dazzling make-up jobs by Rick Baker. The only problem with the picture for me is my recurring gripe about atmosphere and tone; as soon as Hellboy gets into a series of fights with Sammael the demon, the movie turns into the usual Hollywood CGI effects festival. I don't mind CGI, but since Hellboy is essentially indestructible, seeing him getting smashed around a lot is a pretty pointless exercise after a while. At the end, there's a battle with an enormous Behemoth, which is rendered in amazing detail, but because we don't really know anything about it, and don't doubt for a second Hellboy will win, where is the punch ? There's a low-budget Cthulhu movie I really like, In The Mouth Of Madness, which couldn't dream of the wild visual effects here, but is far more effective because it takes the time to develop its myth and it's all spine-tingling scary stuff. This movie goes for the standard action/comedy/horror balance so many big-budget films go for and waters itself down as a consequence. It's a terrific ride though, and despite the material is pleasantly inoffensive - Hellboy's regular, ""Oh crap !"", exclamation at his predicaments is funnier than any profanity could be. Trivia - Abe Sapien is voiced by an uncredited David Hyde Pierce. Followed by a sequel - Hellboy II: The Golden Army - in 2008."

With the sequel getting such great reviews I thought the original would really be something. It had a lot going for it. There was great computer effects. Lots of them. Lots and lots of them. And the makeups were great. Love the gillman that occupied the first part of the picture. There was some great character acting too.

","""In the coldest regions of space, the monstrous entities Ogdru Jahad -the Seven Gods of Chaos- slumber in their crystal prison, waiting to reclaim Earth¬Öand burn the heavens."" <br/><br/>I wasn't and I'm not a follower of the comic book but back in 2004 I do had big desires to watch the Hellboy film so I invited my mom to the cinema since then nobody else had a big interest in the film of Guillermo del Toro (she liked it and for her was kind of cute to see the baby Hellboy). Since I found ""Hellboy"" as a very enjoyable, fast paced and terrific film, it doesn't took a lot time for me to get its DVD and just after I bought it I saw the film again, now with the entire family and since then I haven't seen it again, until today. The reason is obvious, you know getting in the mood and in the context before the sequel arrives but also to finally write a comment about it. Now I found the same terrific film that I remembered, practically because its release was just 4 years ago. Anyway, as I write I wasn't and I'm not a follower of the comic book and actually I have never read any complete comic of Hellboy so I'm going to write like I would have write in 2004, I mean as somebody who is realizing about all the mythology and knowing all the characters as the film goes.<br/><br/>The connections with our world this time are historical and involve the Nazis. The story begins in 1944 but Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) was in this ""business"" since long time ago and he has already been shoot, castrated, drowned, etc but there he was with the Nazis but there was also a small squad with the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt) that could stop those plans but they could not stop the arrival of a demon to our world, a red baby with a really big arm who found in the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm a father; here is when this action film really begins.<br/><br/>Now there is the classic secret team with Hellboy (Ron Perlman), Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) and Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones) leaded by the Professor Trevor Bruttenholm but also there is John Myers (Rupert Evans), the classic new one on the business without any experience but with a good heart. Practically Rasputin and his partners (including the terrific character Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, played by Ladislav Beran) are back with the same objective and with a vengeance; Hellboy looks great and during the film he will be fighting with this Sammael aka Sammy in some great action sequences to finally be face to face with Rasputin and with his -apparent- destiny.<br/><br/>Cast: Perlman was the greatest choice in the cast and I'm just glad that both Guillermo del Toro and Mignola really fight to make Perlman Hellboy since the studio wanted the assh*le of Vin Diesel (somewhere I read that they were giving more budget to the sequel if Nicolas Cage replace Perlman, f*ck you said Guillermo del Toro). The great John Hurt is terrific as usual, the beautiful Selma Blair is also quite good and Doug Jones is perfect too as he was latter as the Fauno.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Great action, terrific story, fun stuff (thanks to Hellboy's attitude, sometimes punk rocker sometimes jealous) and after all a terrific comic book film. I'm more than ready for more so let's go to the cinema friends!!<br/><br/>Region 4 DVD: the special edition with two discs is very complete with a lot of great material including a -fantastic- 2 hours documentary (see Del Toro crying in front of a beautiful model of Abraham Sapien because ""I'm ugly and fat"" and ""he's a f*cking god""), commentaries by Guillermo del Toro and Mignola, introduction to the film by Del Toro and to the disc 2 by Selma Blair and so many others to list them all.

Kroenen (the Nazi fellow with the blades) is one of the only competent foes ever to show up in a Hollywood film. (they later make him incompetent so that he doesn't defeat the protagonist,but that's beside the point) Watch the film for him, as the irritatingly angsty and awkward romance scenes with Hellboy leave me bored and irritated. The supposed two main characters were not well-developed and have very awkward lines. The new agent is in the film for about 20 minutes, almost all in scenes with Hellboy to the point where Hellboy's presence often cause the viewer to forget the new agent even exists... only when they shove him in there in a superfluous role do you remember how poorly his lines are written and how poorly he executes them (very fitting verb, by the way because the dialog actually kills the movie's momentum)."

","Del Toro's Hellboy, the enthralling lovechild of his previous blade films and Mignola's creative genius, is an eye-pleasing spectacle of sci-fi brawling like no film has accomplished yet. Yes, without doubt you will have to put up with the borderline painful one-liners and the simplistic overall message; ""what makes a man a man"". But despite its limited faults, Hellboy tops all others in the ever classic genre of sci-fi/thriller/action/comic-book. The transformation of Mignola's comic book world into a screen-worthy movie is impressive. Though the two-dimensional, shadow infested, caricature filled pages of Mignola could never truly be recreated for the screen the essence of them can. Perlman's portrayal is flawless, I find myself forgetting there's even a man underneath the countless layers of red makeup and plastic. In addition, the creepy Rasputin is done more than justice by Roden and Kroenen, though not even close to the comic book pencil pusher/doctor has risen to the status of top ten comic book villains of all time. John Hurt ties it all up nicely with his sincere performance as the gentle but steadfast professor. The plot is strong, (big thanks to Mignola again) a new and welcome change to the genre which typically leaves you oblivious to any such thing. Fans of Del Toro, get ready for the ride of your lives, fans of Mignola, overlook the creative liberties and enjoy the king of comic book sci-fi's."

","Let's face it, the 21st century is the year of movies based on famous comics, like Spiderman, The Hulk, X-Men, The Punisher and then there's Hellboy, which takes a different approach from what you may expect out of it. Hellboy's mood is darker than movies like Spiderman and The Hulk and attempts to be a bit more than just a typical action movie with a plot that's supposed to be interesting. While I appreciate and admire how the movie tried to be an interesting and different kind of movie there's one problem, the attempt backfires. The plot in the movie is good, but the movie presents it in a sloppy way, sometimes as if it were a sequel and most of the time the moments that try to let the audience develop a connection are screwed up by an awkward mood in those moments that make the movie seem as if it can't decide between certain ways to present itself. This is Hellboy's major downfall and makes it a less recommendable movie. But with that aside Hellboy is a pretty enjoyable movie and at times fun to watch. Ron Perlman makes a great Hellboy, he makes the big red demon-like creature that Hellboy is the most lovable character in the movie. The other performers in the movie don't do that great, with the exception of Hellboy's ""father"" and the main villain who looks similar to Rob Halford with a facelift. The action in this movie isn't used too much until the end but all of it is satisfying for the most part. As for the plot, while it is at least interesting, it just isn't as good as I'd have liked to be. All-in-all this is a good movie, but it's nothing special compared to what we've seen from other movies the past few years."

They're the kind of people who need they're movies to have masses of depth and accuracy, and never take one at face value. If you simply go and watch this movie without trying to see any hidden messages and not caring about continuity errors, you WILL have a good time.<br/><br/>Pearlman is wonderful as Hellboy, adding just the right spark to the character with some well-timed humour, and some incredible acting through the layers of make-up. Doug Jones and David Hyde Pearce bring to life Abe Sapien, and he is definitely one of the most interesting and exciting supporting characters in any comic book movie to date. John Hurt steps in to the role of father figure perfectly, and Selma Blair provides both eye candy, and some fantastic chemistry between Liz and HB.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro directs brilliantly, yet again, and his snappy script breathes life in to these wonderful comic book characters.<br/><br/>As I said, the movies is not without it's flaws, the story can be a little convoluted at times, and you have to stay awake to truly keep up, otherwise you may end up thinking 'how did we get here?'. Karel Roden is just a little over the top as Rasputin, but then again, when is being over the top TRULY a flaw with a villain trying to bring about the apocalypse. Occasionally the transition between real Hellboy and digital Hellboy is far too obvious, but this flaw didn't stop Spider-man from being a great movie now, did it? And there are so many continuity errors that if you hate them you'll probably run out of the room screaming.<br/><br/>So basically, if it's depth and accuracy you're looking for, look elsewhere, but if you just want to have some fun, this is definitely worth a look!"

","Based on the works of Mike Mignola, ""Hellboy,"" written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, is a better-than-average comic book adaptation that boasts a refreshing sense of humor amid all the customary action sequences and first-rate special effects. The story begins in 1944, near the end of World War II, with the Nazis attempting to open a portal between earth and a hell-like dimension where seven evil deities have been lying in wait for just such an opportunity to come in and take over the world. One creature from the other side makes it through before the Nazis' scheme is thwarted, a young ""boy"" who is adopted by an American expert in the paranormal and groomed to become a superhero who can do battle with all the supernatural creatures who apparently exist in an abundance undreamed of by the vast majority of the human race.<br/><br/>The makers of the film have wisely chosen to keep Hellboy life-sized and believable in both his physical and psychological dimensions. Despite his red skin, stone right hand and ability to leap from rooftop to rooftop with gravity-defying ease, Hellboy is really just an Average Joe-type, with a bit of an ego, a sardonic sense of humor, a strong sense of loyalty, and a really good heart. Heck, he even has problems in the romance department not much different from what all the rest of us go through at one time or another in our lives.<br/><br/>The movie is overlong and the screenplay probably includes one or two monsters more than it needs to in order to get the job done, but Ron Perlman, even under all the heavy makeup, makes Hellboy a three-dimensional, sympathetic character, while John Hurt brings warmth and authority to the role of Professor Bruttenholm, the ""father figure"" who raises him."

Ron Perlman was outstandingly charismatic as Hellboy. He proves that he can pull off the amiable and unlikely demon-turned-superhero just as well as he played the callous villain (he was Reinhardt in Blade II). David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapien contributed greatly to the movie. The character was both clever and lovable. The movie was fun, interesting and never had a dull moment. Many movies start to drag when they start to develop the characters, but this movie never did.

The good news is that I'll be less likely to forgive a bad movie just because it pushes my fanboy buttons.<br/><br/>More good news is that I didn't need any fanboy button-pushing to enjoy this movie. It's a high energy, special effects heavy, big action, comic book movie. I'm not usually won over by special effects heavy movies, because I feel they use them as a crutch to cover up the fact that they don't have much to say as a movie. But, when done right, special effects can enhance a movie, providing the audience with a visceral, visual experience that is unlike most of what they'll see in movies. Hellboy is one such a movie, a vibrant and unique experience that's as exciting as it is fun. It's probably for the best that Selma Blair is the biggest name star in the movie, because I'm sure most of the budget went to effects, as there are few scenes in the film without some.<br/><br/>Thankfully, one area they avoided using special effects is with the Hellboy character itself, instead choosing to outfit Ron Perlman with makeup and costume to inhabit the big red guy. This works fantastically, as Hellboy manages to feel real in the film, despite his other-worldly appearance. He interacts with his environments, be they gloomy subways, the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, or a snowy Russian cemetery. Perlman does an excellent job filling Hellboy out, creating a character with enough gruff charisma to carry the film throughout. It's tough not to like the big guy, who fills the film with both humour and pathos, which is feat I don't believe CGI is ready to accomplish (if it ever will).<br/><br/>The film feels like a blend of Indiana Jones, Men In Black, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Ghostbusters, while managing to stake out some original material for itself. It's a truly fun adventure film that's easy to like due to the nature of the character. But, the film isn't without its flaws. The villains of the piece are fairly second rate, the dramatic portions of the film, particularly the love angle with Blair's pyrokinetic character Liz Sherman, is merely adequate, and some of the sub-plots go unaddressed. But, what you should be looking for in such a movie is excitement and fun, and Hellboy provides both in excess."

","I've watched loads of superhero films, from Batman to Mystery Men, and I can say that HellBoy was one of the best that I have seen. To me, comic adaptations can't just stick rigidly to the comics themselves, they have to branch out and have at least a few hints of realism. That's why I enjoyed Batman Begins so much, and have never particularly liked the 1989 Batman film. The reason I like HellBoy is because it feels real, but you know it's about a big red demon. It's also funny, 'quirky' and at some points mesmerizing. And although the Cthulu mysteries in it are not fully explained, I think that it still works magnificently (Anyway, most people would hate the Cthulu, even if Lovecraft is a genius!).<br/><br/>The only reason it didn't get a 9 out of 10 is because it's impossible to have a 'perfect movie'. But this is damned close!<br/><br/>Score - 9/10. OK, Nine and a Half..."

","Before we start, this one is written by someone who has only seen the Director's cut, not the theatrical version.<br/><br/>As for comic book adaptations go Hellboy definitely is from the better end of the city: it's interesting, action is good and characters are really, really out of this world. How does this sound: Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a red skinned daemon, Abe Sapien (David Hyde Pierce (voice)) is some sort of fish-man mutant and the main villains are ageless, possessed Nazi's lead by Rasputin (Karel Roden). Yes, that legendary Rasputin from the court of Russian Tzars.<br/><br/>Original comic Hellboy has more of a cult following than anything else and as someone who isn't a huge fan of the original comic I felt that the movie was far better constructed. The comic was too loose with its stories, there was rarely anything that connected the adventures of Hellboy. Some stories were extremely good, but there are those which are just stuffing for empty space. It must be admitted here, that the plot of the movie isn't very complicated or even very original, but it works and it's full of nice dialog and good action scenes. Even the romance of Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair) is relatively nicely done.<br/><br/>All in all, this is worthy of a glance even for those, who are looking for good action movie. I would suppose, that if you take history very seriously and can't enjoy creative usage of world history then this movie might get you angry, but for everyone else, watch it."

Whatever, now is the turn for Mike Mignola's Hellboy to get into the cinemas. A demon which escaped from hell and brought up by a priest who will teach him to fight again all those evil creatures that break on through to our dimension from time to time.<br/><br/>Directed by Guillermo Del Toro (""Cronos"", ""Mimic""), ""Hellboy"" doesn't make the same mistakes that products such as ""Van Helsing"" do: I mean, the digital effects are at the service of the story and not on the contrary. Del Toro makes a good drawing of his characters, he avoids any up and downs, and achieves a nice and praiseworthy ""in crescendo"" effect. He didn't go mad neither choosing the actor: he recruited a cast of non-stars such as Ron Perlman (City Of The Lost Children), who performs a perfect Hellboy that it can be defined as a mixture of Hulk and Tom Waits. John Hurt plays the priest (Hellboy's godfather), Selma Blair plays the hero's beloved one, and a crew of nice guest starrings (mainly unknown, at least in Europe) do the rest.<br/><br/>Conclussion: nice escapist cinema, well conducted action, a very solid script and, above all, Ron Perlman in state of grace (he demonstrates he's one of the most versatile actor of the last 25 years). It's no surprise that directors such as Jeunet or Annaud love him.<br/><br/>*My rate: 7.5/10"

","I have been a fan of the Hellboy comics for a while now, and I own almost every graphic novel (I still need two). This movie is pretty close to the Hellboy main plot, but occasionally differs from the books. For instance, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, the black-suited assassin, is a masochistic assassin in the movie, but is a passive and calm scientist in the books. Ilsa, Rasputin's lover, is in love with Rasputin in the movie, but is in love with the vampire Vladimir Giurescu in the books. Two of Rasputin's Nazi followers are completely left out: Leopold Kurtz and Hermann Von Klempt. If a sequel to this movie is made, Von Klempt should be in it, along with BPRD agents Kate and Roger the Homonculus. All in all, though, Hellboy is an enjoyable and creative movie."

","SPOILERS Guillermo del Toro is a comic book fan's dream director. With a passion for the medium, del Toro tested his superhero feet with the decent ""Blade II"". In 2004 though, it was his favourite character of ""Hellboy"" that he was allowed to direct. Producing a rough, but solid adaptation, del Toro has created one of the finer comic book adaptations in recent years.<br/><br/>In 1944, Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) travels to a Scottish island with the American army to try to stop a Nazi plot. Finishing with a small creature from Hell, Bruttenholm raises 'HellBoy' (Ron Perlman) as his own. Skipping forward to present day though and the Nazis are back and are going to finish what they started all that time ago.<br/><br/>From the start, ""Hellboy"" is a daft, but fun film. Led by the amazing Ron Perlman, the film is well acted throughout. Even John Hurt, an often inconsistent actor is brilliant as the old and caring 'Broom'.<br/><br/>It is definitely true that the story doesn't flow quite as easily as alternative films like ""Spiderman 2"", but with some classic lines, it entertains for vast periods and produces some great belly laughs.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" might not be the finest superhero film ever, but it's not far off. With some superb performances and some exquisite directing, it entertains constantly. It might not be as finely polished as other recent comic book adaptations, but who cares. It's a fun jaunt through the world of the occult, and it's well worth a watch."

","After hearing rave reviews from America, and being a fan of Perlman I knew I had to see this movie. I have never read the comics, but as with comic book movies, they usually explain the basics. Hellboy is an above average comic adventure with some good effects and acting, but it is slightly too slow in places.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman stars as the adult Hellboy, a demon which the Nazis brought from some Nether Region as an infant. However, he was rescued and Rasputin-the man in charge of raising him was trapped with his minions for 60 years. Hellboy was given to Prof Broom and he becomes the creatures father. Hellboy grows like a normal human, and becomes part of an elite team of freaks who fight evil. He joins Abe Sapian, an amphibious creature, and Liz a pyrotechnic woman who he falls for. However, she cannot control her powers and is locked away. When Rasputin and his evil forces return, it is up to the team to stop him, taking rookie agent John along. The two form an unlikely duo, and plan to bring down the bad guys once and for all.<br/><br/>Perlman is excellent in the role, creating much of the film's humour. Blair and Pierce are also good in differing roles, Hurt is strong as the Prof, and Evans is OK as John. The action is good in parts, but the effects are very impressive, as is the make-up and sets etc. The story is a little wavy at times and can sometimes detach itself from the audience. However, there are enough exciting moments to keep us happy, and even as a comic book movie it is different and refreshing. Hopefully the sequel will be an improvement.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","When I first heard of Hellboy, it sounded like a movie I really needed to miss. I expected a cheap horror film. However, I happened to see a few minutes of it on cable TV and was immediately entertained and caught up in the story. I had to have the DVD right away and watch it end to end.<br/><br/>I never read Hellboy comic books. However, I thought that the movie was quite well done with a great story, very good acting, nice scenery, and good creativity. I tend to like creativity in a movie. Something that tickles the imagination is far better than running the same old plots.<br/><br/>While the movie has some of the comic book fun of Batman or Spiderman, it also uniquely has its own direction. Hellboy is clearly his own person, or monster, or whatever.<br/><br/>Of course like many adventures, such as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or Spiderman, a realist is likely to be dismayed and ask ""is this based on a true story?"" or would normal people act that way. No. But that is exactly what makes this movie fun for many of us. Hellboy is a good bet I think for many of us who are seeking entertainment."

","Ron Perlman has long been an undersung master of the craft, starting with his big-time debut Quest for Fire. Unfortunately, he's been saddled more than his fir share of lemons (ie Alient: Ressurrection, Blade II). As the sardonic protagonist Hell Boy -- a baby demon raised as a human -- Perlman puts his portrayal over the top with a world of skilled understatement. And John Hurt (Midnight Express, Alien) is in fine form as the supporting lead. Director Guillermo del Toro has razor sharp instincts for both action and pathos. The problem is that horror/sci-fi/supernatural/fantasy is seldom appreciated as a legitimate genre. Hence, this film wasn't nearly as big a hit as it should have been in theaters. It is, nonetheless, a reasonably well scripted tour de force showcase for Ron Perlman, who deserves such an opportunity if anyone does."

","I have not seen this movie until months after it was released on video. It was one of those snowy nights where you just wanted to stay in and see a movie. After a coin toss, the favor fell with Hellboy. Turns out fate was pointing me in the right direction. This movie was a real thriller and served as great entertainment for its entire running time. The cast consists of relatively unknown actors to the average viewer. However this does not hinder the outcome of the film. When it comes right down to it, the budget would probably not allow for such a big name cast anyways because of the CGI and expensive sets. The movie moves at a great pace, and contains large doses of humor, mystery and violence. The last thing the viewer should do is criticize the film for being unrealistic. First off its a movie based on a comic book, second its not meant to tug at any heart strings and win any awards. This reasons compile to suggest that critics bite there tongues before talking crap about the movie."

","Stories involving the devil have always terrified movie audiences but the best ones are the ones involving genuine thrills and not a Gothic build up of visuals. Sometimes what you see is less important than what you know psychologically in a movie. 'Hellboy' has too much obvious fan fare and not enough left to the imagination. How many comic book films do we need to see shoved in our faces with enough computer effects to fill a dozen movies. While film makers have to remain loyal to the comic book source from which they draw, they still have a responsibility to inject their own form of vision and why does that always have to have such a high decibel level?"

Ron Perlman is the perfect actor for this role and DelToro directs the movie with a very special sense of humor. The script is excellent, because it is funny, romantic and pure action and the most important thing is that Hellboy does not pretend to be absolutely serious, it is made with a constant eye-blink.

","Seeing the trailers for the film, I decided that - while I am a big fan of comic book movies - HELLBOY looked like a bore.  Boy, was I wrong.  When I popped in the DVD of HELLBOY, from the first few minutes of the film, I loved it.<br/><br/>Hellboy is a demon who was brought out of a hell dimension by the Nazis in 1944.  He was taken in by a paranormal specialist, who nicknamed him ""Hellboy"" and taught him the basics of demon life.  I guess.  How the hell he potty-trained him, I don't know.  Cut to sixty years later - Hellboy is the FBI's top-secret tool to kick demon ass.<br/><br/>First of all, let's get down to the acting.  Ron Perlman is a very gifted actor, and he has never been better than as the title character in this film.  His portrayal of the cocky, sometimes reckless good-guy demon is absolutely flawless.  The rest of the cast performs well, but Perlman completely and utterly steals the show.<br/><br/>The story of the film is what attracted me to it at first.  The whole idea with the Nazis and such I find to be very interesting.  The screenplay is absorbing, action-packed, and frequently funny, but I must admit that it lags a little towards the end.<br/><br/>Another fun part of the film is its atmosphere.  It feels like it comes straight out of a comic book, with its dark subway stations and nighttime scenes with an orange haze.  <br/><br/>The special effects are terrific.  Abe Sapien is Hellboy's sometime companion, a sort of fishy character with psychic abilities; and then we have Liz, Hellboy's dream girl who just happens to have a little fire in her.  That's a pun, by the way.  <br/><br/>Just watch the movie.<br/><br/>What can I say to get you to watch it?  It's one of the funnest films I've seen recently, and it completely and totally surpassed my expectations.

He has a whale of a time in the title role, though you can't help but wonder how hot it got under his massive body suit and prosthetics. The rest of the cast are really along for the ride and don't have a great deal to do, though Hellboy's Man-from-Atlantis side-kick, Aqua Sapiens (or some-such) has a few good lines and at least one good underwater scene.<br/><br/>There is also more than a touch of the Lovecraftian genre about the nature of the beasties that Hellboy has to face. Vast entities slumbering in the void, just waiting to be awakened etc. And lots of tentacles and slime. It all adds up to good fun, no matter how much plagiarism and borrowing there has been.<br/><br/>It's pleasant to see that Hollywood can chuck out a decent comic conversion after the awful Hulk and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen fiascos.

Although the film is close to two hours, you never get to know the characters enough. Like the Harry Potter films, it feels like you have to read the source material in order to understand everything that's going on.<br/><br/>Even more devastating is that there's no plot either. People show up and disappear without explanation, and nothing much happens (except for a couple of pretty uninspired action scenes). When something does happen, it's often marred by major plot holes that doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Overall, it's barely worth the watch.

The script, then, is good, with much wit and surprisingly little of the OTT melodrama that characterises the genre ¬ñ the eponymous Hellboy's amusingly down-to-earth attitude punctures a lot of that.<br/><br/>The actors almost all perform extremely well and the visuals are always interesting and often astounding; the effects are exemplary, but then that's expected these days. Some diverting scenes (a chat on the roof and a moment of temper; how to light a cigar) come as a pleasing surprise; you can tell it's not a mainstream Hollywood director.<br/><br/>The film's faults are to do with editing and pace. All too often in action movies, it's clear where cuts have been made (possibly late in the day) ¬ñ presumably for overall timing reasons and in order to get onto the next big visual moment, but at the expense of much-needed exposition and pacing. **SPOILERS** Particularly jarring are the lack of an aftermath to the destruction of the mental hospital (hundreds must have died, but this wasn't even mentioned, never mind lamented) and the subsequent bringing back into the fold of Liz ¬ñ one line about a taxi and this major plot point is suddenly dealt with. Similarly, at the end, Hellboy and Liz do the fire thing and burn up the monsters and their eggs, then suddenly she's 'dead' on an altar and our heroes are chained up.<br/><br/>Eh? When did the villains even confront them? Did all three just pass out or something? Once again, audiences are left short-changed and wondering if there might be an extended DVD release¬Ö Grrr!<br/><br/>Quibbles aside, I really enjoyed this film and can recommend it to fans of sci-fi/fantasy action epics"

","Looking for a fast-paced, comic book action movie consisting of the good guy beating up a wide variety of super cool bad guys? Weeeeeell, you better just keep on lookin'. ""Hellboy"" doesn't provide any of that. Oh, Hellboy does beat up a predator-looking creature called Sammael about 7 times, but surprisingly there is a severe lack of monsters in this movie. And you know a movie is in trouble when the main hero looks like a sunburned Ted Danson with table legs sticking out of his head.<br/><br/>Prior to seeing the movie, I assumed it would be pretty cheesy, but I at least thought it was going to be fast-paced and action-packed. Thought wrong. The movie's first hour is pretty slow. There are a couple of good action scenes, but after about an hour I was still waiting for it to kick things into high gear. I just knew that the second hour was gonna be non-stop action and monster fighting mayhem! Nope. Things just get even slower. At that point I started checking my watch frequently and was fighting really hard to stay awake.<br/><br/>The insertion of a love story into the proceedings didn't help matters either. I'll admit that it was funny when Hellboy got a little jealous of Liz and Agent Myers, but at the end of the movie when Hellboy and Liz are surrounded in blue fire and sharing a ""Dawson's Creek"" moment was just bad.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman as Hellboy is the highlight of the movie. He does a good job, and although the character is silly looking, he's still charming. He had some funny lines, but he also had some really cheesy ones that you'd expect to come from Van Damme's mouth.<br/><br/>If you're hoping ""Hellboy"" is a comic book adaptation in the same vein as X-Men, then you have truly misplaced your hope. What we have here is a comic book adaptation that somehow manages to move at a much slower pace than ""Daredevil"" and actually gives ""Spawn"" a run for its money in it's ability to not meet expectations. And folks, my expectations weren't that high in the first place.<br/><br/>THE GIST  <br/><br/>If you like slow-paced comic book movies that lack any sort of depth, action, or character development, then ""Hellboy"" might be the movie for you. I'm sure the fanboys will find something to like in the movie, but those unfamiliar with the comic book (i.e. most everybody) should save their money for something else. If you insist on going, then take a pillow and I dare you to get the image of ""Ted Danson as Hellboy"" out of your head.<br/><br/>Rating: 2 (out of 5)"

","Opening on the Isle of Skye off the coast of Scotland in 1944, we observe along with GIs crouched behind a wall the machinations of a bizarrely evil Nazi force as they attempt to open a portal to the dark side. In the aftermath of a vicious firefight a small creature is found (Hellboy), the only testament to the success of the aborted experiment.<br/><br/>We flash forward in time and find this same grown (to some type of adulthood) being living in a techno-junkyard apartment of sorts. There he whiles away the hours waiting for calls to attend to evildoers as is the proper role of all superheroes. From this point forward he is summoned to dispatch, throughout the entire course of the film, all manner of threats to mankind.<br/><br/>The cartoonish Hellboy (he is cut exactly from the Hulk creature mold) is a cigar-chomping and patently ugly fellow, but nonetheless is smitten with a never-can-have beautiful girl (Liz, voice of Selma Blair) and follows the direction of Professor Bruttenholm (voice of John Hurt) in what seems to be a pretty miserable existence.<br/><br/>As with all superheroes, one marvels at the resilience of wise-cracking Hellboy (voice of Ron Perlman); suffering an untold number of ostensibly lethal blows, he is never slowed by any of them but later dresses superficial lacerations with great care, perhaps to show us a touch of humanity.<br/><br/>As diversion Hellboy holds up pretty well, primarily because the visual computer-enhanced visions (fairly murky much of the time, to give us a sense of gloom and doom) are first-rate. But if there is a message here it escapes us, and like the Hulk film storyline we are left in the final analysis with an unlovable being and we have no interest in whether he finds happiness or not."

","Since I'm not a huge comic book fan (gasp! yes, I know comic books are ultra-cool for trendy kids) I wasn't sure I would like it.  The trailers looked kind of interesting, but with a name like Hell Boy, I thought it might be the equivalent of an 80s heavy-metal hair band in movie form.<br/><br/>A friend finally convinced me to go see it and I enjoyed it.  It delivers what it promises--a fun action movie with enough plot and character development so that it's not completely brainless (just mostly).  I thought this movie was similar in quality with X-Men and a little better than X2 (which I didn't like as well).  It has similar themes of misfit, outcast mutants, er, supernatural creatures trying to save mankind from disaster and destruction. You get some love, redemption and Hell Boy has some good lines.<br/><br/>While you're there, do a guessing game to see if you can figure out which character John Hurt plays (don't look at the credits here until you've watched it).  I was a little surprised to see his name on the credits. Maybe I'm just dopey but I really didn't know he was in it until I looked.<br/><br/>A lot is predictable, but the makers put in some elements that weren't complete formula. For example, I kept expecting the obnoxious boss (played by Jeffrey Tambor) to ""get his"" since these types of characters usually turn into monster food pretty fast (just like the unnamed minor characters that always get killed on Star Trek away missions). Stay through most of the credits and you'll get a little clip of him as a comic reward.  He was funny and contemptible, but in the end he wasn't so bad.  This is just a minor example, but the movie felt fresher than a lot of things that have been trying to recycle formulas lately.<br/><br/>I can't help comparing this movie to Van Helsing since they're both in the theaters at the same time and vaguely in the same genre.  Skip Van Helsing and see Hell Boy instead.  It is by far a more effective movie than Van Helsing was and on a much smaller budget.  I hope someone in Hollywood is paying attention and notices that bigger, faster, and more expensive is not always better.  You notice that this movie bothered to create at least a minimal plot and some character definition?<br/><br/>Just wait 10 years when everyone can do high-quality special effects for even cheaper and special effects will stop being able to sell a movie on their own.<br/><br/>In all an entertaining movie.  Not profound, but one of the best sci-fi/action movies this year."

","This movie is much better than any of the ""professional reviewers"" would have you think.  Performances are excellent all around.  The special effects are integrated into the storyline nicely (as opposed to so many other movies where storyline is used to tie together special effects).  The story is interesting and, who knew(?), it ends with a moral.  It doesn't stray from its comic book origins. However, it does retain a dark comic mood. The story was plausible in a comic book sense.  The characters enjoyable. I had no idea what it was about going in and walked up completed satisfied. Considering it is still in the theaters as ""Van Helsing"" makes its debut, if you are faced with a choice - see Hellboy."
"epalladino-1","10","0","0","8 May 2004"," The Gospel According to Hellboy
","Ron Perlman is so perfectly cast as the title character in this film that I have to give it 10 stars. The way he manages to toss off what could be corny one-liners and make it all seem completely natural and in character is fascinating. It is also mind-boggling to see how he can emote from under all of that make-up and be menacing, sexy, and goofily romantic all at the same time. And even though the plotting is at times lacking in continuity, it is not too confusing for someone like me who had never even heard of the comic strip it is based on.<br/><br/>
I liked the other actors, especially John Hurt as the older Prof. Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm. His character's deep affection for the creature he calls 'son' and Hellboy's return of this paternal affection is apparent. So it's too bad that for reasons of the plot Hurt and Perlman don't spend much time on screen together. There is also good interaction between Perlman and most of the other cast members. However, for some reason the interesting character of Abe Sapien is not made enough use of. Unfortunately, the evil characters are much less developed. They are the most 'comic-book' of the characters in the movie if you take that term to mean superficial and under-developed.<br/><br/>
The only real problem I had with the film is the virtual lack of monsters for Hellboy to defeat. The trailer, which was what attracted me to this film in the first place, made me expect ""things that go bump in the night"". These ""things"" essentially end up being only one thing and a surprise related to Hellboy's last fight was already given away in the trailer. Frankly, there are more monsters to be had in the 1984 film ""Ghostbusters"" which certain plot elements in Hellboy reminded me of.<br/><br/>
Despite this quibble with the plot, what makes me love this film is that the character of Hellboy actually has some depth to him that takes him far beyond recent comic-book based films like the 2003 films ""Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"". Perlman's Hellboy, similar to Tobey Maquire in the 2002 film ""Spider-man"", actually develops and changes. There is also something in this film, whether deriving from Del Toro's script alone or from Mike Mignola's original ""Hellboy"" comic strip as well, that moves beyond the superficial use of relics, Crucifixes, and Holy Water to make a point that to my mind is essential to my understanding of the Catholic faith. It is a person's choices that determine who they become and not who they are born.<br/><br/>
I ended up leaving the theater being much more impressed with the heart and soul of Ron Perlman's Hellboy than with his huge punch. I am now planning to read Mignola's original ""Hellboy"" comics to get more of an idea of how his creation differs from this film adaptation. I can't wait for the DVD and hope that any sequels improve the script without, at the same time, taking away the wonderful freshness of Perlman's performance."

","This is truly one of the best comic-to-movie adaptations I've ever seen, as in up there with X2 and the original Batman. After X2 amazed us it seemed hopeless, ""The Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"" were both awful, and it seemed like there would be nothing good to ever again come of comic movies. But this one reminded us that there is hope. To start with, we have Ron Perlman (Enemy at the Gates, anyone? This guy's awesome.) The only good acting performance in the entirety of ""Alien: Resurrection"", and when I think of it the only actor who could really pull this role off. Hellboy's a simple guy, he'd enjoy saving Earth from apocalyptic beasts just as much as a beer and some nachos, definitely not the average superhero, and Perlman did a good job with the character, his dislike of being a ""freak"", his love for Liz, all of it was well-done. Then we've got Liz played by Selma Blair. Amazing, truly amazing. Selma Blair's a really great actress, even in that ""Cruel Intentions"" movie, and here she really captures Liz's actual level of fear of her powers.<br/><br/>In addition David Hyde Pierce did an amazing job as the voice of Abe Sapien, and the body actor (can't remember his name) also did a great job adapting the character to screen. And as with any action movie we have to talk about stunts and graphics: the CGI was incredible, the action sequences were mind-blowing and captivating (I couldn't turn away once!), and with all this it clearly has to be del Toro's greatest film, even better than ""The Devil's Backbone""."

","I had low expectations when I heard they were making a live action movie based on artist/writer Mike Mignola's comic book ""Hellboy"". Hollywood has a history of turning great comics into lousy movies (i.e. ""Howard the Duck"", ""Swamp Thing"", and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""). However, I was pleasantly surprised that director Guillermo del Toro stuck to the original vision of Mignola, who also served as an executive producer and designer for the film.<br/><br/>For those unfamiliar with the title character, he's an otherdimensional demon brought to Earth as an infant by the undead Russian mystic Rasputin (Karl Roden) and Nazi occultists near the end of World War II. Hellboy, as the baby demon is named by the American soldiers who found him, is raised to adulthood by the fatherly Professor Broom (John Hurt) and becomes a covert government monster-fighter for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. The adult Hellboy (Ron Perlman, under a ton of make-up) is aided by his pyrokinetic former flame Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), the mentally-advanced fish-man Abe Sapien (voice of David Hyde-Pierce), and ordinary human Agent Myers (Rupert Evans) as they fight to stop a monstrous demon freed by the resurrected Rasputin and his Nazi cohorts and a grander scheme to unleash the Seven Gods of Chaos.<br/><br/>Does that all make sense? Not really, but ""Hellboy"" is a joyous grab-bag of the horror, adventure, super-hero, and - yes - romantic-comedy genres that riffs on the familiar to create its own weird groove. It's like H.P. Lovecraft, Jack Kirby, George Lucas, Nora Ephron, and Matt Groening got together and wrote a script. This is the kind of movie that builds a cult following while leaving other viewers scratching their heads.<br/><br/>I admire that del Toro cast a group of actors that may not be expensive A-list stars, but are right for their roles. Leading the pack is Perlman, who seems to know this is his chance to shine and gives it his all. Perlman's Hellboy is a wisecracking tough guy on the outside and sweetly vulnerable on the inside. He smokes cigars, writes love letters, grinds down his horns so he can ""fit in"", and likes cats. Thank goodness they used an actor in make-up to play Hellboy, as opposed to the computer-generated cartoon we got in ""Hulk"".<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" has its faults. Some of the stunts and special effects look fake, the mystical mumbo-jumbo gets confusing, and the film might be too scary, silly, or just plain strange for some audiences. However, like all good films of this type, I was able to suspend my disbelief, sit back, and enjoy the ride. ""Hellboy"" doesn't take its offbeat premise too seriously, but doesn't descend into camp either. How could I not like a movie that features a crimson-hued demon with a big stone fist as the leading man, and then manages to work Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' ""Red Right Hand"" into the soundtrack?<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

(Or each other, considering the dialogue). Thankfully, it does get better. And Broom gets older in the form of John Hurt, who turns in an entertaining, though stock ""eccentric professor"" performance. Hellboy really begins after the title sequence. Ron Perlman is ideally suited to the title role. His dry sense of humor and grumpy cigar-toting character is the glue that holds the film together. And of course he brings the weight of years of character work to the role. but the supporting cast are an odd assortment of mismatched actors.<br/><br/>
Selma Blair has a moment or two, but is massively under-utilized. Jeffrey Tambor is amusing, but too light for the role. Hellboy's ""handler"", Rupert Evans, is a real let down. Writer/director Del Toro sets up a connection between him and Blair in their first meeting, with a look held that moment too long. Selma and HB have a long time thing, but Evans supposedly offers everything the monster can't - normalcy, good looks and an even temper. Yet nothing ever comes of it. There's zero chemistry. Unsurprising when Evans is so squeeky clean and doe-eyed, he looks like he's been castrated.<br/><br/>
Sadly, the effects aren't great either. Apocalyptic visions pale in comparison to those of The Matrix, the portal looks like a low budget Stargate, and the ever-duplicating monsters look suspiciously like actors in suits with stilts on their forearms.<br/><br/>All in all, Hellboy is a good effort, let down by poor dialogue, mediocre SFX and some questionable casting.

There is some silliness in between when Hellboy jealously stalks Liz (Blair) because he thinks she might be interested in the young agent-dude but it doesn't detract from this flick. Hats off to the special effects people as well, who pulled off some nice eye-popping work here. See it."

","""Hellboy"" isn't just another comic book movie.  The main character, the demonic Hellboy, played by Ron Perlman, isn't so much a superhero.  One might call him more of an anti-hero.  Hellboy, as an infant devil, was drawn out of Hell by an immortal Rasputin in 1944.  Today he works for a secret government agency that deals with the paranormal.  Think ""Men In Black"" with kind of a spiritual slant.  Anyway, the visuals are amazing, and the imagery is also eye-catching, but shocking at times.  The story is quite good. Maybe a bit far-fetched, but there have been worse along these lines.  This is a good movie to see to get the full spectrum of comic book movies."

","I know this film suffered an enourmous amount of slaying from the original fans, as they call themselves. Granted, for myself, I never heard of the comics until I heard of the film, and so far I have yet to read the comics, so I cannot judge on whether or not the film is true to the comic..<br/><br/>BUT - this I must say, I sat through the film, and was enourmously entertained. A lot of cheesy dialogue, this is true - but it is not done without a winking eye. The effects are pretty cool and well carried out and in many ways it was easy to see that this was the same director who did ""Blade II""....and that meant in a positive way as I rather liked that flick aswell - opposite of many, I'm told, but reluctant to understand why.<br/><br/>I love Spawn aswell, and the universe in particular, which might be why I was driven to this film. I didn't expect Brando-like acting or art in the way and I didn't get it - what I expected was violent action, and I definately got my share of that.<br/><br/>7/10"

","As usual, positively LOVED Perlman (ESPECIALLY in heavy make-up, he's too hot!).  This was a totally fun flick, wonderful dialogue, characterization by actors is top-notch.  For comic book becoming movie, this is one of the best MOVIES yet.  Favorite scene(s) Hellboy with kid on the rooftop and Hellboy and Sparkie's first kiss at the end of the movie.  This is one of those movies that, if budget allows, I'm likely to re-see in the theaters (I do this MAYBE once a year since I'm tight with my movie funds) and left agreeing with whole family (spouse & I at opposite ends of the 40's, daughter 20 and son 16) that owning the DVD is an absolute must!"

The other actors are good too; John Hurt, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, and Jeffrey Tambor. The action was superb. The special effects were neat too. Especially the makeup and creature effects. All in all, this is 2 hours of solid film. Good acting, a sharp script, and awesome effects. I do have one question. Why couldn't we have seen more of Abe-Sapien? He was a cool character. Well, I can't wait for the sequel. Here's hoping there even is a sequel to this wonderful movie. All in all, four stars!"

I am hoping that there will be a sequel and that the relationship between Lizz Sherman and Hellboy will be explored, as well as how she got her powers and how Abe Sapien was found.

","""Hellboy"" may not be hell, or even purgatory, to sit through, but neither is it particularly spectacular.  Stories about a team of (frequently misfit) heroes who save the world from unthinkable evil are a dime a dozen, and Guillermo del Toro's comic-book based movie never really distinguishes itself from the crowd.<br/><br/>But if the ride is a forgettable one, at least the driver is interesting. Hellboy (Ron Perlman) comes to our world in the closing months of World War II, thanks to an aborted attempt by the Nazis to open a portal allowing Ancient and Terrible Evil to arrive and bring about Armageddon.  He gets taken in by the Allies, and eventually grows into a hulking creature that sort of looks like a cross between Wolverine and the villian in ""Legend."" Sixty years later, he's part of a secret government organization helping stamp out paranormal fires, and a bit of an urban legend on the side. Perlman, despite being hidden behind heavy (and pretty good) makeup, does a good job striking a balance between Hellboy's destructive, demonic nature, and the tenderer emotions nurtured by his upbringing on the side of light. He is, for lack of a better term, the film's most human presence.<br/><br/>The balance of the plot involves the machinations of Rasputin (Karel Rodin)--yes, that Rasputin.  He was in charge of the Nazi portal sixty years ago, and is looking to finish the job.  His henchmen consist of a creepy blade-wielding assassin, and a femme fatale who seems to be in the film because directors love seeing an Aryan woman walking around in stormtrooper chic.  Hellboy's allies include surrogate father Professor Broom (John Hurt) aquatic intellectual and empath Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, voice by an uncredited David Hyde Pierce), sad-eyed pyrokinetic Liz (Selma Blair), and token normal guy John (Rupert Evans).  Unfortunately, none of these come close to matching the title character for depth and personality, and so the film tends to drag when Hellboy isn't around.  Abe and Liz, in particular, are promising characters who could easily be expanded on (the latter is Hellboy's love interest, convenient as he's fireproof and she has a tendency to burst into flame when excited).  But they are given short shrift by a script that sometimes feels like a loose string of fight scenes, many of which involve nearly-indestructible creatures that look like the offspring of Alien and Predator.  These scenes are generally well-constructed and occasionally contain some impressive moments (I liked the battle in the subway station).  But when you've seen one huge, tentacled evil, you've seen them all.  And `Hellboy' would have been a lot more fun to watch if he'd had some opponents-or even some friends, for that matter-who could hold the screen as well as he does."
"say_hi","8","0","0","15 April 2004"," Great movie, but too long *SPOILERS*
","I really liked this movie. Ron Perlman did a great job acting as Hellboy and the story was very good, even if a little too long. The great thing was that it was a very cool action movie, but with a ton of humor to make the movie great. The ending was a little weird, but I thought it was very good still. I mean like, Hellboy could've just killed the Nazi dude as soon as he broke out of the chains but instead he didn't and nearly started the apocalypse of Earth. Still, I loved Hellboy and I hope they make a sequel to follow Hellboy's cool adventures. Some other great Dark Horse movies are Mystery Men and the Mask. Enjoy this great film and look out for it's sequel if this is a big enough hit, which I think it will be."

"without_eyelids","Null","0","0","13 April 2004"," Would love to love it but honestly, it's weak kiddie-fare
","As I am going to trash Hellboy, I feel very sorry, sorrier than I was when I left the theater contemplating all the potential squandered on that film.<br/><br/>
I love Ron Perlman. He shines even in his cameo performances. Blade II was fast, fun, and violent, so del Toro should have had no trouble delivering something along those lines. I love comics. I never read Hellboy admittedly but it's safe to say I was willing to give Hellboy all the chances I could possibly given it.<br/><br/>But ugh. The script is awful, cheesy, full of cliches and a kiddie morality/philosophy towards life. ""Just tell her how you feel"" - I nearly puked over that line. Selma Blair portrays a one-dimensional introvert/emotionally distraught pyrokinetic, Rupert Evans is the most unimposing CIA agent you ever saw, Ron Perlman can't save his character from horrifically bad one-liners, and the short-list of minor characters is composed of the most incompetent government agents ever seen in the big screen. It's painfully obvious no one recruited any technical advisors from the CIA or FBI to instruct how an actual paranormal agency might work (Especially when it's staffed by idiots like the director who whines the audience to the death about how HE'S IN CHARGE, NOT HELLBOY *yawn*).<br/><br/>
My attitude towards the characters was totally unsympathetic. Too little character development and what little of it is there comes through their (not-so-)witty repartee and jests about death, combat, anonymity.<br/><br/>
The action is sub-standard. Blade II pumped adrenaline through my veins (thanks in part to Donnie Yen's choreography) but also Perlman's excellent facial expressions and physical tics in his Reinhart character. Hellboy is watered-down action and one hell of a CGI light show. Most tiring are the lazy and gaping plotholes (traffic rushes past a pedestrian in the center divider as if he's not there), while del Toro pulls the typical the old ""hero-says-something-witty-while-monster-sneaks-up-behind-him-in-the-dark"" trick a half-dozen times too many.<br/><br/>It's a messy plot no one can understand, about nazis and the occult and little demon children who look like the mascots on plague remover commercials.<br/><br/>I left that theater smashed with disappointment. Most of the budget was obviously spent on special effects, while no thought was given to the characters or the plot (EX: Supersecret paranormal agency allows director to operate on a paranormal corpse without supervision or adequate security [since paranormal corpses have a habit of jumping to kill people at tension-building points in the movie]). It had all the ingredients of a winning movie but someone got out of control with the special effects, and it's pretty obvious no one cared about the rest of the film.<br/><br/>If you're 14 or younger, you may like this film, otherwise you may find yourself wishing you'd waited for something better. Hellboy is a PG-13 film treading on PG ground, subject matter elementary enough to be suitable only for children, not for people hungering for more than just a lame story about a life-and-death struggle between the forces of the costume department (hellboy) and the computer animated flunkies."

","Title: Hellboy (2004)<br/><br/>Cast: Ron Perman, John Hurt, Selma Blair,<br/><br/>Tagline: Here to Protect<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>Well after much anticipation (tell me about it!) I finally got to see Hellboy. Guillermo del Toros love child, Hellboy has been a project del Toro has been wanting to make since his Mimic days, so needles to say his love for Mike Mignolas comic book creation is preatty evident when you see the movie.<br/><br/>The story is about Hellboy. A demon from hell who was summoned here by a warlock called Rasputin. You see, old Rasputin wants to use Hellboys powers to bring forth these giant lovecraftian creatures from another dimension to bring destruction upon earth. Hellboy is not really willing to participate in this little escaped and therefore tries to stop Rasputin from achieving his goal.<br/><br/>Let me make this clear, first and foremost this movie is a monster movie. Its main thing is to showcase monsters and monsters fighting each other off. Its also a very very straight forward comic book movie so you can throw your credibility out the window when you see this one. Its got magic, monsters and talking dead corpses, so be ready for that. Now, does it succeed in what it set out to do? Heck yeah! Many times over.<br/><br/>The creatures on Hellboy are amazing...starting with the good guys. Hellboy himself is incredibly cool looking, I myself found that I could not turn away and stop looking at the screen. Hellboy was like a magnet to my eyes...I was glued to the screen!<br/><br/>Same thing when ever Abe Sapiens shows up...Dr. Brotenholm was talking but all I could do was check out how cool Abe looked. Very well achieved make up effects. Then theres the bad guys....the Sammael creatures...damn cool as hell. Those tentacles..those eyes! Those jaws! That whole scene in the subway! I was just salivating at how realistic the Sammeal creatures looked. This movie helped me realize how much I prefer live action prosthetics and monsters to cgi. Speaking of wich...the cgi was done well for the most part, but there where some scenes in there that I didnt love, but those where very few. For the most part the CG was excellent.<br/><br/>The action is non stop! Lots of chases, lots of fights! Hey this is a comicbook flick, we need our heroes and villains to duke it out a couple of times, and trust me my friends this happens a lot through out the flick.<br/><br/>
Id heard a lot about the warmth and level of emotion that the movie puts across, and I agree theres a couple of moments that are really emotional. Like Hellboy and Liz's romantic sequences that little speach that Hellboy tells Liz is awesome! Ron Perlman succesfully managed to put a lot emotion into that performance even though he was under tons of make up. It was sort of like a flashback to his Beauty and the Beast days.<br/><br/>The bad, well there very few things I didnt like about this here flick...but there defenetly were a few hiccups along the way. The movie aint perfect. First off, Rasputin came off as weak. The way the script was written, theres no real conflict between the villain and the hero. Theres no actual physical conflict between them...therefore he comes of as weak. In the comic hes a more menacing and scary. Here it looked like Hellboy could defenetly kick his ass at any given moment. The character has the potential to be a great villain...but just not in this movie.<br/><br/>I was expecting a slightly more spectacular ending. It felt rushed, I liked the fx, and the creatures but the final final confrontation between hellboy and ""the old gods"" well it was just too fast...heck I wanted that bad monster to destroy the building, I wanted a bigger fight..but no. Listen up del Toro! For your next flick, pay attention to the importance of conflict between heroe and villain! I guess we can blame del Toro for letting that one slip since he did write the screenplay...so next time Guillermo: we want the major villain to sweat evil out of his every pore!<br/><br/>Well del Toro was wearing a lot of hats while making this movie, so I guess the film had to suffer somewhere. Speaking of del Toros direction. The man is a visual genius. He knows how to make the scenes  look like works of art. Its all about the beautiful colors and textures! My hat goes off for making a truly beatiful comic book flick. It felt like I was seeing Mignolas drawings coming to life in many instances. Even the sets looked almost identical to the drawings found in Mignolas comics. In this visual sense and in many other ways this movie was incredibly faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>Theres a lot of winks for those comic fans out there...like those scenes with the corpse and even in one scene the humonculus shows up in a hallway of the BPRD, so be on the look out for little winks from del Toro all through out.<br/><br/>Ok putting those minor problems that I mentioned aside, the film rocked my ass to kingdom come. It was an amazing special effects/action/monster ride that had my fan boy ass drooling like a little kid waiting for the comics shop to open. Heck this movie put a smile in my geeky heart. Thanx del Toro, keep em coming dude!<br/><br/>Rating: 4 out of 5"
"wmnews","8","0","0","14 April 2004"," Hell-acious
","Why is it lately the best films about who we are as men and women come from stories full of aliens, freaks and mutants? `Hellboy', which has one of the weakest premises out of the Marvel Comic factory, is about a Devil child accidentally let loose to our world through a Nazi experiment gone awry. The United States raises him to take care of other evil going on in the world that we, of course, never hear about. Hollywood is big on that: `Ghostbusters', `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', `Men in Black', `Harry Potter', `Stargate', `The X-Files', and `Stuart Little' come to mind. (I think talking mice can be verrrrry creepy.) Nonetheless, `Hellboy', played by Ron Perlman, is the quintessential tough guy with a sensitive streak. This is not a new role for Perlman. Ever since he played the Beast in `Beauty and the Beast' in the late 1980's, (remember way back to the 1900's?), Perlman has shown that ugliness is only skin deep. `Hellboy' is a wise cracking cigar smoking cross between George Peppard, Ted Danson and Jack Nicholson. He's Sgt. York with a John Wayne swagger. He's short on words and big on action and is more cocky than Han Solo and Ferris Bueller. From the get go, the film has a Spielberg `Raiders of the Lost Ark' feel to it in both story and well blocked direction by `Blade II' and `Mimic' director Guillermo del Toro. (I wonder if William the Bull knows Benny (Benecio) the Bull.) The action never lets up with rare moments to let you grab your inhaler and when it does let up it's for some sappy scene that isn't even important plot points - except to show `Hellboy's' all too human inner calling. The film is unrelenting, as was `Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom', and it shows that plot driven films has its choice of real stunt men for tools or computer graphics. Those wacky, fun loving Nazi's are still hanging around waiting to take over the world! You know, when Hollywood tries to have something or someone take over the world it's so serious but when `Pinky and the Brain' do it it's funny though their diabolical plans are no less ponderous. OK, then - Nazis! Evil overactin' Nazis yet! Now that's diabolical! They come back to release some watch-a-ma-call-it really large and slimy thingy and `Hellboy' is called in to kill it. I mean, it's always `Kill it! Kill it! It's gotta' be killed! Make faces at it if you must, but kill it!!!' No one ever wants to capture anything. No, wait, there's always Daryl Hannah in `Splash.' They did want to capture her, but then again, New Yorkers aren't afraid of much. The trouble with killing this 'moving-so-fast-creature-you-can't-get-a-good-look-at-it', is that for every one that dies, two of them are born! Sort of like mosquitoes and IRS forms! AIEEEE! Surely, there's more to this, I hear you ask yourself with soulful introspection. Unlike `The Hulk', undoubtedly one of the worst films ever to have been made and unfortunately distributed, the answer is yes - but it takes awhile to get there. The film is 2 hours and 5 minutes long and you start to get antsy even in those plush `loveseat' style seats. (Personally, I think the whole purpose of those seats is to let someone know how you feel about them by either raising or lowering the armrest between you.) The film is well paced with two fairly weak subplots filled in with appropriately enough, fairly weak performances. Rupert Evans, who has been in about six projects, plays the wimpiest CIA Agent you'll ever run across, though he has an abundance of courage. `Hellboy's' girlfriend, who's got a gift with engulfing buildings in flames, (and that's OK if you know how to control it), is played by Selma Blair. (How come she can't control igniting things but she can see to it that her clothes don't even get scorched?) And John Hurt, of all people, likens himself to `Hellboy's' pop since he's the one who raised the little Devil. Hurt's performance is the biggest waste as he's hardly recognizable and could have been played by an unknown because you actually think the guy is an unknown. But the most interesting bit of second player acting, is the half-man/half-fish played by Doug Jones, but voiced by David Hyde Pierce from `Frasier.' And yes, the fish creature is better looking than Lillith. Meanwhile, in a land chock full of Nazis, our villains await `Hellboy' and his combustible girlfriend to usher in Satan and his minions - which is pretty ironic since `The Passion' was playing down the hall.<br/><br/>Movie composer Robert Beltrami, veteran of 43 films, did a sensational job as did the hundreds of others who worked on the project. It's as if most of them have worked together before. Wait! They have! Namely the aforementioned `Blade II' and `Mimic.' Come to think of it, the five producers have worked on a plethora of films together and most of them were quite successful. Probably because there were no talking mice. Honestly, what makes this film tick is Perlman's performance.<br/><br/>By the way, the film was shot in Prague. I suppose the producers thought `Hellboy' and Prague was a Czech-mate."

","Lets get the good out of the way first: The special effects are for the most part good, the acting is very, very good, and the story is good enough to act as a delivery system for the action. Yet, there are some problems:<br/><br/>1: Hellboy's tail shows up very rarely, and when its actually being used for something its done very well. However, sometimes, particularly the closing shot, it looks like its just been taped on there.<br/><br/>2: There's a very major plot hole: When Abe Sapien and the Professor are in the Museum, and using the bladed-truncheon to find out what happened that night to let the monster loose, they hear the ritual used to resurrect the evil beast thing. They especiallly hear the part about how when it dies, two more will be brought forth. Did they forget this seemingly crucial aspect of the monster, cause Hellboy found out about this much later on, en route to the final battle ground, and everyone is suprised when two of them show up in the sewers. This is the kind of plot hole that can really sour a film.<br/><br/>3: A lot of elements are thrown into the film, like the uber-evil-fighter guy being a puppet (which we find out in an absurd fashion), or Firestarter's powers being activated by pain, or Hellboy's immense love for kittens, that is seems like we're supposed to know all that already.<br/><br/>There are some other things, which border on the nitpicky side, so I'll just leave by giving it a 3/5."
"angelynx-2","8","0","0","11 April 2004"," most of these comments seem far off the mark to me...
","I'm seeing far too much use of the words ""corny"" and ""cheesy"" to suit me here. There was VERY little cheese in this flick as I understand the word (and I am a devotee of MST3K, so I think I know cinema du fromage when I see it).  OK, so maybe we've seen enough movies with Nazis as occultist villains: still, Mignola wrote it that way, and I am happy to see a movie follow its source material so closely (points for including a Spear of Destiny that looked just like the bloody real thing!).  I have seldom seen Lovecraftian monsters done so effectively--only LOTR's Watcher in the Water comes close. (And as a lifelong Creature from the Black Lagoon fan, I was personally delighted to see old Blacky updated as a bookish recluse with a Threepio accent.) I thought Perlman's world-weary, stoic workingman attitude was *far* from the melodramatic, ""tortured lone hero"" pose that some are accusing him of--he's just a hardworking guy who's unlucky in love and tired of watching TV alone with his kittycats. (Nowhere near the stock, pasted-on torment of a cardboard character like Blade, IMHO.) I suppose one *could* say that having him fight off monsters with one hand while saving a box of kittens with the other was corny, but (a) we already knew he loves cats, and (b) it was sweet, darn it!  C'mon! Show me where it says big red bruisers can't do the sweet thing sometimes. =) I'll even admit that the last five minutes had me scratching my head--I get really tired of the ""Vast Enormous Evil Universe-Destroying Ritual Foiled At The Last Instant"" plot--but, well...<br/><br/>Overall I just loved this movie.  It is so good-natured and well-intended (all Hellboy's important motivations spring from love for someone), its humor is so gentle, and it just doesn't have that cold hard internal edge that I am so weary of in big SFX action movies (Blade, Blade II, Underworld, ad nauseam..) . Like its hero, it's a big powerhouse with a soft heart."

Although the story line of Nazis occult practices and HP Lovecraft type monsters has been over done many times.  In this film it worked. The final battle seemed a little short, but at least they did not drag it out so long you got bored watching it. And the best part:  Hellboy, not the cute FBI agent, gets the girl.

","""Hellboy"" is the newest film by director Guillermo del Toro, who not only directed the film, but wrote it as well. And it was a good thing he did. Del Toro does a wonderful job of capturing the escence of the comic and bring it to life on the big screen.<br/><br/>The Concept: In the final days of World War II, the Nazis attempt to use black magic to aid their dying cause. The Allies raid the camp where the ceremony is taking place, but not before a demon - Hellboy - has already been conjured. Joining the Allied forces, Hellboy eventually grows to adulthood, serving the cause of good rather than evil. As an agent of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, Hellboy finds the things that go bump in the night - and bumps back!<br/><br/>Hellboy is played well by Ron Perlman. He gives the character (and I know this may sound strange) a sexy appeal about him that you can't help but love.<br/><br/>Helping Hellboy along the way is the aquatic-humanoid Abe Sapien, played by Doug Jones. Doug does well in giving his character, who I thought would be the most likely to fail, the same mystic that made his character so great in the comics. But the stand out preformance in ""Hellboy"" is Selma Blair as Pyrokinetic agent Liz Sherman. If ever there was a great comic book adapted character, Liz would be it all in thanks to Selma's pitch-perfect preformance.<br/><br/>On the human side of things, helping Hellboy is Agent John Myers, played wonderfully by Rupert Evans. Play Hellboy's adoptive father Professor Broom is film legend John Hurt. His presence in the film is great, and it would not have been the same without him.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" is bound to be a box-office hit, and for good reason. The action is unbelieveable. The relationships between the characters, and character development never weakens through the special effects and fights. In The end, Guillermo del Toro was fathful in every way to the comic. He not only created a fun action film, but he very well might have made the best comic book adapted movies ever.<br/><br/>I give it **** out of ****"

","Let me tell you this: HELLBOY was awesome! Maybe I'm a bit biased, seeing how I've been reading the comic for about 10 years now, but then again that in itself would make me more critical. Not saying that the movie went 100% by the book, but it was close enough and the production value was off the charts, I just sat there like a little kid in the candy store. So if you want to see the big red son of Satan, who's right hand is the litterally the key to destroying our world, smoke cigars, eat pancakes, cookies and milk, play with kittens, smash Nazis, insane Russian monks, and the giant primordial gods of chaos, it is a 10 in my book!"

","Anyone who expects a comic book movie to not be cheesy, full of computer animations and a sometimes non-detailed plot has to be a moron. Comic book movies are supposed to be cheesy over-the-top fun. This movie is no exception. Bottom line: this movie is fun to watch, just like Spiderman, the Batman Movies, Superman, and X-men (notice I left out the HULK! ha!). If you like super hero or action movies you'll like this one. If you like chick flicks where everyone is full of angst and sorrow about complex dating rituals, etc. then this isn't your movie. For a comic book genre movie, I would give HELLBOY 8 out of ten stars. It's a fairly clean movie too so 12 year-olds should be able to watch it."

","I Recently saw Hellboy not because of the previews, but because my boyfriend wanted to. Seeing the previews, I assumed that Hellboy would be a wanna-be X-Men. But it was definitley a lot better than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>For one thing, the characters were so neat and definitley creative. I also thought the intellect and history in the story was a significant part. The settings were really exciting as well. Although, I think the movie would have been a ten if they had capitalized more on some of the characters and relationships. For example, Myers was 'chosen'. But his character still didn't bring much drama or substance as the audience would assume from the beginning of the movie. Gaps like that left out a lot of quality, leaving the audience with unanswered questions. At the end, the scene where Hellboy fought the leader wasn't all that dramatic, but it was supposed to be an important part in the story. It was the final fight and there was absolutely no substance in the scene.<br/><br/>Overall I would say it was a good movie, but had potential to be much better."

Hellboy is portrayed perfectly as a being of dark nature raised in a mildly good environment. His attitude and actions reflect this marvelously. I felt that the climax could have been given more focus, but it's nature fits well with Hellboy's combination of heroism and nonchalant attitude.

He can be funny, charming, sweet, tough, rough, and always excellent.  Hellboy showcases his talent yet again, and this time he's in a number one box office hit. Bravo for Guillermo Del Toro's choice of Ron for this movie.  We have seen a great deal of comic books made into movies, and for the most part, they have been pretty good.  However in my opinion, this one is by far the best.  It stays true to the storyline, the characters are played beautifully and the interaction between them sparks with real chemistry, the violence is background instead of in-your-face guts and gore, and the special effects spectacular. Mike Mignola has to be really proud of this comic book to movie creation. It was fun, exciting, and I really enjoyed watching Ron puff on his stogie, a part of Ron the man. There were some deja vu moments BATB fans would notice, but the ending is something we always wanted, but never got.

","""Hellboy"" is based on the underground comic book about a demon called from Hell by Nazis in the 40s, but then ""rescued"" by American soldiers and raised to become an investigator of paranormal activity, and, well, a super-hero. It is now the present day, and Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his ""father"" (John Hurt), the scientist who rescued him, are joined by a colorful group of avengers in their crime fighting activities.  The list includes pyrokinetic Liz (Selma Blair), fish-man Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), and FBI agent Myers (Rupert Evans).<br/><br/>When the Nazis who took Hellboy from Hell - led by Rasputin (Karel Roden) - resurface...well, all Hell breaks loose (no pun intended).  Characters you like die, questions arise, and there are lots and lots of fight scenes.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie.  The characters are cool and fun to watch, the style is great, there are some awesomely cool lines and its just on a different level from other comic book movies.  Ron Perlman is great as the red hero, very cool and collected, speaking dry, witty lines while fighting devilish monsters.  The other actors all put forth, John Hurt and Selma Blair playing the most interesting characters, and Jeffrey Tambor giving a funny touch to his no-nonsense director of the Bureau.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, `Hellboy' is not a perfect film.  The action is at times hard to watch, the climax and last five minutes are ¬ñ I have to say ¬ñ pathetic, and many questions are left unanswered.  I guess if I read the comics I would have a better understanding, of it, but the best super-hero movies make sense to readers of the comics and to new fans.  Some stuff in this movie just didn't make any sense.  For instance, the Nazi woman is young and blonde in the forties at the beginning of the film, and still young and blonde sixty years later when the rest takes place.  Same with Kroenen (Ladislav Beran), a villain who's been shot, stabbed, castrated, and had is eyelids and bottom and upper lip torn off, his blood is dust, and he still manages to live.  How this happens is not explained.<br/><br/>But, you really don't care; it's obviously not a movie to be taken seriously.  In the end it's nothing more than a fun, exciting super-hero flick, 7.5/10."

","Hellboy is a terrific action, science fiction, and horror-laced film, featuring amazing performances, incredible special effects, and masterly make-up work.<br/><br/>Mike Mignola's signature character, the titular Hellboy, is brought to life as only Ron Perlman and as only monster make-up maestro Rick Baker can. Perlman and Baker's Hellboy looks as if he stepped right off one of Mignola's signature abstract-like comic art panels.  Perlman portrays Hellboy as an everyman who stomps out evil much like a plumber unclogs a drain.  Perlman's Hellboy is an awe-inspiring presence who gets as good as he gives, and always has a smart quip no matter what obstacle he faces.  I commend Perlman for his performance as Hellboy, because it appears incredibly difficult to play a part in such intricate make-up and costume, and still put forth a more than worthy perforamce.<br/><br/>Doug Jones is Abraham Sapien, the aquatic telepath who appears to be an amalgam of man, salamander, and sundry fish parts.  His voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce, who is perfect in providing Sapien with intelligence, aloofness, and humanity.  Once again, Rick Baker does a perfect job with adapting Sapien's comic book appearance for the silver screen.<br/><br/>Selma Blair is fine as pyrokinetic Liz Sherman, and gives a measured, yet tortured performance.  Her best scenes are with Perlman's Hellboy, and we see that these two are, literally, made for each other.<br/><br/>John Hurt's Professor Trevor Bruttenholm is a sheer delight, and is a spot on homage to Mignola's character in appearance and performance.  His fatherly relationship to Hellboy is expanded upon and very touching.<br/><br/>The villains of Hellboy are frightening, to say the least.  Karl Roden's seemingly immortal Rasputin is deliciously sinister, but reverent to the powers that he serves.  Biddy Hodson's Ilsa Haupstein is vile, yet sexy, but Ladislav Beran's Kroenen is a disturbing, violent creature that goes well beyond the appropriately stereotypical Nazi villain portrayal.<br/><br/>Hellboy is a rare film that can please a wide variety of audiences and filmgoers.  It truly is a movie that has it all.  And I think that Mr. Mignola will be pleased how Guillermo del Toro's opus turned out.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","I'm not a fan of comic books (or most comic book movies), so I wasn't too interested in seeing ""Hellboy"" until I heard that Guillermo del Toro was directing it. When it comes to dark and intense films about creepy-crawly things, he's one of the best (""The Devil's Backbone"", ""Cronos"", ""Mimic"" and especially the awesome ""Blade II"").<br/><br/>The hero of this story was a baby demon who slipped through a portal to hell that was opened by Satan-worshipping Nazis at the end of WWII. Under the tutelage of the kindly human professor (John Hurt) who raised him, he became a crusader against evil. It's a ridiculous story, but no more ridiculous than most movies based on comic books, and the well-developed characters make it seem almost believable.<br/><br/>Hellboy himself (played to perfection by Ron Perlman) is quite a fascinating character. Raised by humans, he struggles to be normal despite his gigantic muscles, red skin, and huge horns (that he sands down every morning). He also has a wickedly sarcastic sense of humor (after putting down one monster he says ""I'm fireproof. You're not.""), and his pining for a fellow freak named Liz (a melancholy human firestarter played with the right dark-eyed loneliness by Selma Blair) is touching.<br/><br/>Even though the characters are the best thing about this movie, I found the story pretty compelling as well, as it seems far more influenced by the gothic horror of H.P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker than those cheesy Marvel comic stories.<br/><br/>Lovecraft's influence in particular is present here, his indescribably creepy, gigantic, tentacled monsters waiting in some dark dimension for their chance to take over the world. Barker's work is felt in the sprawling hellscapes, satanic machinery, and a grisly reanimated corpse used as a puppet.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, if you like lots of action mixed with the dark and grotesque (basically if you liked ""Blade II""), ""Hellboy"" will probably do it for you. ""Spiderman"" it ain't."

The bad guys were real bad and the good guys were there to battle the bad guys. The movie included Nazis, demons from Hell and an evil Blonde Nazi in love with a reincarnated Rasputin.  What more could you ask for.  Hellboy himself was played very well by Ron Perlman who gave him a vulnerability and cockiness that you wish to see in a lead monster.  The story was fast paced and slightly ridiculous but it held your attention and entertained.  It is well worth seeing  if you wish to entertained and not challenged.   The movie does not take itself too seriously but is more of a live action (or live through CGI) cartoon.  Too many action movies, like the Matrix stuff, take themselves far too seriously.

","Hellboy the latest work by director Guillermo del Toro is also another comic book adaptation.  This is also not the first time del Toro has directed a movie based on comic book characters.  His first being the sequel to Blade, Blade 2.  Ron Perlman who plays the title role of Hellboy is no stranger to the comic book world or del Toro.  Perlman first worked with Del Toro when he played the leader of The Bloodpack in Blade 2.  Hellboy is the story of a demon summoned by the Nazis during World War II in order to help win the war.  Unfortunately for them, the Allied Forces thwart their plans and raise Hellboy as one of their own.  40 years later, Hellboy works for the U.S. government investigating and fighting the paranormal alongside his psychic, alien partner Abraham Sapien.  Now, the man who first summoned Hellboy has returned with plans to dominate the world.<br/><br/>Perlman's performance as Hellboy is very reminiscent of Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine from the X-men movies.  The character is full of snappy one-liners and is constantly smoking a cigar.  The difference, though, is Hellboy has the mentality of someone in their twenties and Perlman is able to present this well.  Selma Blair plays the role of Liz Sherman, Hellboy's pyrokinetic, love interest.  Blair's character is first introduced as a patient at mental hospital, and as such Blair seems to act as if though she'd been sedated before every take.  John Hurt who plays Professor Broom is the father figure to Hellboy.  For this role, Hurt tacks on more than 20 years to his actual age through prosthetics and carries it off very well.  As for Rupert Evans who plays John Myers and Doug Jones who dons a rubber suit to play `Abe' Sapien, their performances aren't stellar but are certainly believable and are more bearable to watch than Selma Blair.<br/><br/>Again like Blade 2, del Toro's Hellboy is very dark when it comes to the ambient tones.  This is due to most of the movie occurs during the night, because Hellboy is a demon and needs to conceal his identity, and because of the subject matter with which the movie deals with.  The dominant colors in the movie do change.  Where as a movie like The Matrix could be catergorized as just being green and black throughout, Hellboy never really sticks to a certain color scheme.  Underground sequences, though, tend to lean toward being dominated by the blue, dark blue, and black.  There is something del Toro has done with this movie that doesn't follow the trend that most comic movies take during production.  He uses more physical effects than CGI. The character's of Hellboy, Abe, and the Sammael are all represented mostly by guy's in rubber suits, and they even do some stunts in these rubber suits. Some of the more impossible effects are done with CGI, but they don't come off as completely hokey, unlike some of the effects featured in Ang Lee's Hulk.  Del Toro also uses some CGI to expand the environments that the movie occurs in, but again to those unknowledgeable in the ways of movie magic, it will not be very noticeable.<br/><br/>The subtext to the movie is one that can speak to a lot of people.  It's mainly a movie about fitting in and remaining true to yourself and the people around you.  Hellboy is an automatic outcast just because of his appearance.  Hellboy evens tries to mask his true nature by sanding down his horns.  As the movie progresses, those who have encounters with Hellboy learn that he's really more of a man than a demon.  A theme that Professor Broom continues to preach throughout the film.  Hellboy and those around him who try to protect him from the public learn that although society as a whole might not accept Hellboy right away, those who meet him on a one-on-one basis do.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot even though I've never read a Hellboy comic myself.  It carried a good bit of heart and humor to complement the action. I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  For the geeks and those who like action, it's a definite must see in theaters."

","With his Clint Eastwood stogie, Incredible Hulk build, Thing hand, samurai pony tail and oversized gun - Hellboy is certainly an amalgam of all that makes a hero a hero.  This is one of several points the thinking man's critics will cite to slam this movie.  That being said - it for the same reasons they hate this film that I love it.  Sure the idea of a machine that conjures demons is silly.  It's supposed to be silly - it's adapted from a comic book.  Sure there's some direct co-opting (with the juvenile inclusion of the Rasputin character) -- just wait until Van Helsing rears its ugly head - don't worry, these aren't Van Helsing spoilers, it's just a prediction.  Sure Ron Perlman isn't a great actor.  Sure he can ONLY play it cool and therefore the small trench of emotional depth del Toro attempts to dig for him is squandered.  Sure Selma Blair's character is an X-Men reject. Sure Abe Sapien is sort of like a gay C3PO.  Sure John Hurt is the only decent actor here, and it's the laughable how serious he is.  Sure this film has the symptoms of Razzie material.  Sure it was released by Revolution Studios.  But it is an exciting, entertaining and endearing film.  A film where a character's intentions are ""explained and not conveyed""  through the dialogue of other characters.  As in Mimic, Hellboy's protagani are facing humanoid demons that don't seem to follow any particular trend in Darwin's bioevolution.  The dialogue, on the other hand, is funny.  It is flawed - but it's pure mental comic book masturbation of the highest order.  It may not have that whole ""cinema"" thing going on for it, as exhibited in late comic book adapts. of the highest order like X-Men and the ever-popular [that's about IT] series.  As I said before - this is the sort of film that will be easily torn apart by bloodthirsty critics.  Some may view del Toro's choice of presenting the idea of a Hellboy comic book existing within the world of the Hellboy comic book adapt. as corny and grounds for a cheap laugh or three (hint, hint) but I see it as another staple in a film which is trying to be bad.  I don't mean it's trying to be boring or overly derivative or stupid - it's just trying to be silly, offering its characters just little enough emotional depth to accept.  As exhibited best in the first few minutes of the film, del Toro has the gift of making stuff look cool.  Whereas Blade II was stupid, and Mimic was also pretty stupid, Hellboy is witty, visually vibrant, exciting, thrilling, chilling, skilling and illing.  Word.  There are many happy returns to mediocrity, plot holes and character flaws.  Selma Blair feels tacked on - an excuse for a female character.  Hellboy is a bit one note.  The ""new guy"" character is sort of broadly drawn.  The guy from Frasier.  The story is sort of difficult to follow - namely, WHY Rasputin needs Hellboy to destroy the world, what that thing in space is (what the hell is it?  I honestly don't know!  Do you? No, no you don't!) why that guy in the gas-mask seems to be living forever as well.  All in all, this is one of those films you'll love or hate depending on your intelligence, and sense of humor.  Also, it's shocking how much time is wasted in this film - but at the same time, it's also shocking how short and long it is at the same time.  And Abe Sapien vanishes without a trace for the entire third act.  Why do I like this movie?  Somebody please tell me.  I know I didn't dislike it.  But there's so much wrong with it."

","Personally, I feel that the producers of this missed out on a great marketing campaign when they didn't get the clash to let them use their song for the commercials.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie itself was quite good. You definitely see why it wasn't set up to be a huge summer blockbuster. But for a transition from the crappy pablum of the beginning of the year to the summer stuff. Ron Pearlman is not what I would consider a leading man, but he's good enough to warrant a movie like Hellboy. It definitely would have been nice to see different monsters than Samael 3 different times, but at least it looked cool. The corpse was funny though and Selma Blair is always hot. 8 of 10"

","Just like many of you out there, I've seen many movies.  Some have been good others have been ok and then you have the category of what was i thinking by coming to watch this junk, well after seeing the previews I began to think the same way, this movie is going to stink just as much as Dare Devil.   I was hooked from the hoaky start up to the last 5 minutes of the movie which wasnt rushed and had ok acting considering it was an action/sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>Hellboys is the kind of movie you want to root for because it doesnt have the big name action heroes or big time nude scenes that alway entice men to the big screen, intead Del Toro decided to go with lesser known actor with great acting abilities.   Ron Perlman was excellent and I was glad that he got the part it was a stroke of genius because Ron deserves it he is truely a great actor.   I wish they had involved characters of abe and Liz more into the movie where they could have shown their superpowers more but it was not to be in this film, but maybe in the sequal if their is enough public interest in the film and I do believe there is.<br/><br/>My greatest grip (spoiler alert) is with the quick ending that sort of feels like an unsatisfied woman after sex.  The money must have been running out because that was the shortest ending fight sceen that I have seen since Mike Tysons last fight.   It was a great dissappointment to see an ending so horrible.   The movie has some great funny sceens that gives this film the edge it needs to make it a good movie, Not a Great movie, but just a good movie.  I rate this movie a 6.5 because of the bad ending but if you take out the last 3-5 minutes of the movie Id give this move a solid 7.5.<br/><br/>
If you like to get away from reality and see a superhero kick but then this is your movie.   Good movie go see it and enjoy.<br/><br/>PS.  I may not be a great critic but I do know what I like and I dont often enjoy to many new movies because there just arent that many out there but i Did enjoy this one.   Go big red."

","Hellboy was an entertaining movie with some added humor and great visual displays.  First off, I'm a fan of Guillermo Del Toro after seeing Blade II.  It's too bad this couldn't have been rated R for some of the death scenes. for example, being slashed with a knife 80 times, there is no blood or anything, but either way, this movie was much darker and more visually captivating than most of the other comic movies I've seen.  ::semi spoiler::  The image of the apocolypse was frightning, but I wish they could have elaborated more, instead of just seeing one monster hanging from the sky. Again, an R rating could have enabled them to show more disturbing images on this.  ::end spoiler::<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, it was a good job all around.  I pretty much liked all the characters, and Ron Perlman was a great Hellboy, badassed but with a kind heart.  The only problem was some of the dialogue wasn't very well written, especially the bad one liners that Perlman and others had to deal with.  I always liked Perlman, and this is the first leading role I've ever seen him in since City of the Lost Children, and that was all in French : \  He was great as Reinhardt in Blade II, playing a trash talking badassed Vampire.  I actually found Selma Blair's character semi annoying, along with the agent myers guy, they were a little too generic.  I did like the fishman guy and the professor, they just had a lot more character in them.  The bad guys in the movie were well done too, the ninja like clockwinder with the knives was especially cool.<br/><br/>The special effects were great, as with most movies today, and the monsters were quite frightening.  I only wish there was more of a variety of them, instead of the same multiplying one.<br/><br/>The plot was quite interetsing only there were a few holes. Basically the Nazis open the portal to hell and hellboy pops through, and the professor takes him under his wing.  Then later the same people are back trying to do the same and Hellboy works with the FBI to stop them.  I wish there was more background on the badguys, and who they really were and what was their connection to hell etc.  And why they can be reborn etc.  I would have gladly sacrificed some action sequences for more information on the characters.  Also, Agent Myers question of when Hitler actually died...what was that all about ? Again the plot had holes in certain areas.<br/><br/>Overall I'd give Hellboy a 7\10.  It's much better than the almighty badness of Daredevil.  It doesn't really compete with the X-men films but it's still a good one to watch.  Though I can't really help but compare it to other comic book movies, because when I watch it I can only keep thinking that it is based on a comic.  But aside from that it's one worth watching for an entertaining evening, and I'd probably rent it when it comes out on video.  If you liked this movie, and maybe a little more Gore, you should check out Blade II, another one by Guillermo and with Perlman.  You'll notice he loves to put in the autopsy room scare."

","Some people take themselves so seriously they could never even bring themselves to like a film like Hellboy. Pull the stick out of your butt and enjoy this unabashed comic book movie. If you don't this is a work of a genius while check out this director's third film the devil's backbone. Knowing that Del Toro has masterpieces like that in his catalog helps me to relax and realize that this film is meant to be fun.<br/><br/>As a blockbuster action movie it is a step above. Del Toro brings his unique visual style and ability to direct actors. He brings also a patient ability to pace the story to involve many of the complex elements of the comic.<br/><br/>
 Del Toro is a hidden talent on the verge of being noticed for the genius that he is. I knew it watching Blade 2 seeing that under all the studio/silly blade stuff was a stylish director who has a amazing sense of visual style. Del Toro look weird but beautiful at the same time. His style is what Clive barker calls grotesque glamour. I respect the fact that he can also make blockbusting ass kickers like Blade 2 and Hellboy and come down to earth and make fantastic works of art like Cronos and the Devil's backbone.<br/><br/>Any hoo√Ç‚Ä¶Pearlman is great and delivers lines like he went to the Bruce Campbell school of B-movie acting, which of course is a great thing. At the same time he brings a incredible humanity to playing a demon with a heart of almost gold. I was not sure the love story of hellboy would work but with pitch perfect acting and lines stolen from Del Toro's real-life courtship of his wife it worked. The action and horror are done well but do not dominate the film. A great piece of popcorn movie art.  Thumbs up."

","After watching ""Hellboy"" at my local cinema, I left the theater feeling that though I had enjoyed myself, something was inevitably missing.  It wasn't till a few hours later that I began to reminisce about the movie. Nothing was missing, other than maybe a great script, but this comic to film adaptation was great fun and the acting and makeup and special effects were awesome.  The bad guy in the film sucked but that was the only problem.  Ron Perlman is the man, and so wasn't the crazy guy with the black mask on. Guillermo del Toro obviously loves the horror/action genre, as do I, and I hope he remains forever a horror director.  This film is definitely worth the price of a matinee admission, and it should be a cool DVD!  Now I'm waiting for del Toro's H.P.

","If you know Guillermo del Toro's other films, you'll get an added kick out of Hellboy. For some reason, he has a thing about subway systems and insects. Mimic - a great film - takes place in abandoned tunnels and features cockroach hybrids that get out of control. Cronos has a mechanical ""insect"" and Hellboy has a great scene in which Hellboy picks up a manhole and all of these cockroaches scatter.<br/><br/>Also, I had a great time picking out other film references. There's a bit of Star Wars, Men in Black, Matrix, Blade, etc in there.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is the best choice for Hellboy and I can't imagine anyone else playing this role. Who did the studios want Brad Pitt? Ridiculous. Only the Europeans appreciate what a wonderful talent Perlman is. Jean-Pierce Jeunet has given him a LEAD in a film. No makeup, no latex foam. Just his muscularly wonderful self in City of Lost Children. And then of course he cast him in Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>Del Toro has worked with Perlman thrice, in Cronos, Blade II and now Hellboy.<br/><br/>Another Frenchman (Jean-Jacques Annaud) gave Perlman his breakout role in Quest for Fire and then gave him a great cameo in Enemy at the Gates.<br/><br/>I just hope that this film makes Hollywood appreciate this talented actor."

","When I first saw this movie, I got a kind of Spawn vibe. Any one remember that movie? It was a comic book flick that came a few years ago before comic book movies were a fad. It's about a normal guy who works for the mob or something. He didn't do a mission write or wanted to quit, it's been a couple of years and I don't really remember. The mob people kill him and one of enemies marries his wife and becomes a Surrogate father for his daughter. The rage and anger within him cause the big bad guy in Hell to take notice of him and made him into an assassin. And in this, he becomes the Spawn of Hell.<br/><br/>Spawn was creepy, but it wasn't creepy *while* I was watching it. It was afterwards that I felt a bit iffed out by it. But it was that same creepiness that made me love the movie that much more.<br/><br/>
It was the same way with Hellboy. Okay, I admit some of the acting wasn't exactly immaculate. The guy who played Broom when he was in his twenties springs to mind. However, throughout the movie I had an intense sense of awareness that we were in fact dealing with a creature from Hell.<br/><br/>
I consider myself a Christian, which is that major reason it surprised me that loved this movie so much. Honestly, I only saw Hellboy because I promised my little sister I would take her to any movie she wanted and I really, REALLY had no interest what so ever of seeing the stupid movie. I had never ever heard of the damn thing before the movie posters. And yet I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>From what I read of the other reviews it seems that this is one those movies that you either completely love or absolutely hate. Personally, I'm in the former category. If you don't like, then hey, you know, every one's entitled to their own opinion. But you should at least give it a chance. Every one I told that I was going to see this movie, *every one* thought it would be total crap. And I am one of those people. But I saw and thought it was great.<br/><br/>But can I say? I'm a sucker for unconventional heroes."

","I have been a fan of the Hellboy comics for years and just wanted to let someone know that the movie held true to them as far as a film can.  It was a good action flick with some nice explosions and a few descent moves.  The CG  was a little off, but the make-up was awesome and did the character of Hellboy justice.  There is a little too much romance contained in the film, and I, as a woman, refuse to believe the film would have been complete without it.  Romance is overrated, especially when it involves the classic tough guy.  Red, in my opinion, would have been a perfectly wonderful character and completed his role in the film without the mushy stuff.  I like fantasy, action, and gore; this rash of romance in films where it doesn't belong is extremely annoying.  Please, if any film guys read this, let the tough guy be a tough guy without all the gushy stuff...Hellboy is a man, we get it, he doesn't have to fall in love to prove it!"

","I've been on here, scrolling through reviews of people saying Hellboy is god-awful, disappointing or the greatest thing to hit movie screens. Frankly, it wasn't either.<br/><br/>As a comic fan, yeah, it was true to the comic, for the most part. There's no real need to pick it apart there.<br/><br/>As a film fan, yeah, there's a rough patches. But there's rough patches in a lot of good movies. For example, some of the Indiana Jones movies had plot holes, but nobody cared because it was an exiting movie. So, naturally people who want everyone to think they're Harvard educated will tear it apart because of minor glitches.<br/><br/>The fact is, Del Toro makes this movie predictable, but if you come in with an open mind, you won't care. It's got one of the better preformances I've seen in a while by Ron Perlman as a flawed man-child of a superhero. He spits Bruce Campbell-esque one liners that you know you shouldn't laugh at, but you do anyway. He has childish jealousies, crushes, and mannerisms, but he lights up the screen during the action scenes.<br/><br/>Selma Blair is a bit underused, but still haunting and realistic. Rupert Evans, in the first actual role I've seen him in, was amazing.<br/><br/>John Hurt was, well, John Hurt. One of the better actors of his time.<br/><br/>

","This movie was amazing. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. I'm sure that if you're a Hellboy fan, you were relatively pleased and if you're just a fan of superhero movies or just movie in general, you were also pleased.<br/><br/>The images were beautful, the characters beleivable, and the story well done. Many people don't know much about the Hellboy comic (unlike say Batman or Superman) but the reluctant hero of Hellboy, is masterfully pulled off by the Director Guillermo Del Toro. And the fact that Mike Mignola (creator of Hellboy) approved and helped helm this film makes it all the better.<br/><br/>fore those of you who do not know the comic, it stays as true as possible (for a movie) to the story and it's images. The hellboy costume is right on, and the dialogue fits right in with the style Mignola wrote for years. Also, the lighting in the comic books (hyper-realistic lighting; lots of solid blacks obscuring views and showing very heavy shadows)is reproduced with astoiunding accuracy in this movie.<br/><br/>WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER IN THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH!<br/><br/>Notice I say movie and not film, as we all know that there is a considerable difference between the two. One is done for the art, the other is done for the fun of it (more or less, yet again, my opinion). This is definetly a movie, and not one without some flaws. Such as some subpar acting from lesser characters, underplayed scenes, and muffled dialogue( Hellboy, take the damn cigar out of your mouth!). But if you look at it, it is a relatively realistic fantasy movie. I mean it's more likely you'll just have an intense conversation, rather than fire and brimstone rising everywhere making each bit of dialogue like the last words of god (i.e. Rasputins ""No listen to me!"" before the coming of the Ogdru Jahad god).<br/><br/>If I have one complaint, it's that Marco beltrami really copped out on the score for this film. He did such a wonderful job making the soundtrack for other Action hits like Blade II, I really felt that he didn't punch it up to the grandiose and dark scale Hellboy was reminiscent of. Shame on you Marco, try harder next time!<br/><br/>So all in all (and cheating a bit because I'm a Hellboy fan) I'd give this one an 8 out of 10 as a good film, but a 10 out of 10 for staying true to the original. I mean how many times can you say that about Batman, superman, or any of the other millions of Superhero flicks out there? The Hulk? Give me Hellboy anyday."

This is exibited when Hellboy shaves his horns to fit in and the love affair between him and Selma Blair, which shows us that even a creature of his kind could have feelings of that sort. Hellboy is exciting when he kills many villans such as the fish creatures throughout the movie.  He does this using his oversized gun and bullets and his enormous powerful hand that he is born with.  This movie is pretty well rounded and very well casted. I think the movie would be better if they would have concentrated more on the upbringing of Hellboy.

","There's a new trend in Hollywood where low-key directors are making personal statements.  'Hellboy' is the third I've noticed this year.  Mel led with his Renaissance-inspired 'Passion' and del Toro actually follows in similar footsteps.<br/><br/>The plot is silly, we knew that, and follows the prerequisite path of explaining the hero's origins.  Despite his failings in other areas, at least Burton didn't start off that way.  Since no comic book adaptation is neither good acting nor good scripting, this doesn't have to worry about competing in that perspective.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these rely on the visual realm.  After all, they're based on comic books, not novels.  The best example so far is 'Hulk' since (unlike recent adaptations) the eye becomes the most important element.  So we have elaborate framing and layering of static images just like a comic book.  I respect that revolutionary attitude by Ang Lee.<br/><br/>While 'Hellboy' doesn't have the same visual energy (the music and art direction are bankrupt of ideas), I do like the use of colors.  Hellboy is constantly in environments that work with his skin tone, but I was surprised by scarcity of efficient dark coloring.  'Crow' hit upon the idea, but this tries to make up for it with a darker script.  In that subtext, 'Batman Returns' is still king by retaining the original tone of comic books--pessimism--the best<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I must state that there is a difference between being a passionate filmmaker and an artist.  This tries the 'Elephant Man' makeup philosophy, but doesn't come close.  That's was what got me disappointed.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Midrange Material"

The bits of humor interspersed with action reached just the right levels to provide an overall entertaining master piece. Granted there are a few pieces that dont quite seem to come together, but the overall product is worth the ticket. Hurt's performance is great as well.

The movie was awesome! What a treat and a breath of fresh air. Ron Perlman was the perfect choice as he had Hellboy's attitude down to a T, and had the craggy looks and sonorous voice to match. No one else could have done a better job and I'm glad that Del Toro held out for him to make the movie. Just remember Ben Affleck (whom I do like as an actor) and the travesty of Dare Devil.<br/><br/>The movie had the dark, woodcut appeal of Mike M.'s (the author/artist of the books) style and that was so important to fans. Mike's drawings have an austere and simple Lovecraft beauty and they brought that across on the screen so well.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Abe Sapien. He almost stole the show for me. The work they did to bring such a difficult special effects character to life was clearly evident. Abe's innocent and childlike beauty of nature was right there, along with an amazing makeup job. I can't wait to see the extras when the DVD comes out, for both he and Hellboy were works of art in their costume and makeup.<br/><br/>The story was true Hellboy with all the major characters right there, larger than life. You got a feel for Hellboy and his friends, what it must be like to be the clean up crew, often used, but rarely appreciated. Liz, the pyro's character, was well done. Her horror in herself and her abilities made her very real. She doesn't revel in her abilities like an X-Men character would. Hellboy does, but only because it's the only thing he *can* revel in, being 'closeted away' as they all are. The part with the talking cadaver was VINTAGE Hellboy, right from the comic books and I laughed my butt off when we got to that part in the movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. Some may not 'get it', those who aren't fans of the work, but I think that there are many who will enjoy this extremely well adapted comic book to movie piece.<br/><br/>And as I said to my boyfriend...

With the help of Rasputin they summon forth a demon who is the personification of evil, and the key to destroying all of mankind, so that evil may rule all.  Fortunately, allied forces and a paranormal scientist intercept the demon baby and dub him ""Hellboy.""  In the present day, Hellboy is a tough, wisecracking superhero who goes around fighting evil and monsters of all types.  He is aided by his adopted scientist father, the FBI, and two other mutant-like characters.  Those responsible for summoning Hellboy, return to finish their attempt to conquer mankind. Only Hellboy possesses the tools to save us.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of balancing the doom and gloom with light-hearted humor and wit. The story unfolds evenly giving the audience enough information to understand what's going on, but keeping the suspense growing at the same time. The action is exciting, and the effects both audio and visual serve to underscore the feel of the comic book setting. You don't get very much back story on Hellboy, much the same as the comic, but that adds to the intrigue of the character. If you are a fan of comic books, and/or unconventional superheros, you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Writer/director Guillermo del Toro has quite affectionately adapted Mike Mignola's very original comic book.  The story, simply put, is about faith, love and the battle between good vs. evil.  Or, in this case, evil vs. evil-er.  It is the humanity of the main character that makes him heroic. We all have flaws, but it is the choices we make, and how we treat each other that truly define us."

Broom raises Hellboy as the G.I.s name him as his son teaching him right from wrong and to be a force of good. Hellboy is joined by fellow freaks, Abe Sapien a telepathic fish man and Selma Blair as the pyrocinetic Liz Sherman. They along with several FBI agents and Professor Broom keep the world safe for the rest of us by working for the Bureau of Paranormal research & Defense. `There are things that go bump in the night and we are the ones that bump back.'<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro tells a great story you actually care about these characters and what they go through. I find this rare in B movies. I was expecting Blade 2 all over again great visuals but bad story line. Ron Pearlman was kind of playing Vincent (Beauty & The Beast) again but with a sense of humor seemed to really enjoy playing the great red ape who uses an angle grinder to keep his horns trimmed to fit in. He has a lot of great one liners and banter during combat that I would have liked to have seen in Spider Man. Doug Jones who plays Abe Sapien who was also voiced by David Hyde Pierce, did a wonderful job of being a fish man who craves rotten eggs. Selma Blair as Liz Sherman was also great as the troubled fire starter, don't call her that she doesn't like it. She is the love of Hellboy's life. I think what makes these characters stand out is that they have real problems and lives beyond the fact they have bizarre powers. Watching the big red guy trying to write love letters to her is quite funny. They have become a family of freaks that kick ass to save the world.<br/><br/>The CGI was actually fairly believable the sets really captured the darkness of the mood and the action was unbelievably fun. There wasn't a boring minute in this action packed romp. However there were a few things that bugged me a bit but they were not bad enough to keep me from enjoying the film. Mainly I just couldn't buy the pyrocinetic flames. It was the only CGI I found to be a off. I wanted to know why her clothes didn't burn when everything else around her did as well as Hellboy's clothes. Hell boy being a demon is of course immune to fire so he doesn't get burned. Although I'm kind of glad that his clothes didn't burn as I did not want to see a naked Hellboy.<br/><br/>It is not the comic exactly but Guillermo del Toro does capture the mood and feel of Hellboy so that it just doesn't matter."

","I went to see Hellboy on a whim. I have seen several of the comic book movies and have started getting tired of them. Maybe I went in with low expectations but this movie delivered. I like Ron Perlman and he did a good job. The special effects were top rate and the story stayed on coarse. I can not think of any weaknesses in the whole movie. Even though I am not familiar with any of the Hellboy characters, I felt each one was well establish by the end of the movie except for John Myers. Something seems to be hidden about him which I assume we will learn in the sequel. The movie is a little longer than usual (a little over 2 hours) but you will not get bored. There also is a little surprise if you wait through the credits."

","I've just returned from seeing Hellboy, and although I have minor criticisms, it was a fun movie.  I didn't expect the ammount of romance. I mean, I knew before hand that Hellboy had a thing for Liz, but I didn't think the movie was going to develop it as much as it did.  I'm not complaining, I thought it added to both characters. The best part of the entire movie was the character of Hellboy. I mean...c'mon. He's so hot he's cool (ooooh lame joke, but it had to be said). I've only read one comic featuring Hellboy, and now I'm pretty close to buying some because of how funny/cool he is. and I think this movie made fire-powers look even cooler than X-Men 2 made them look."
"willden21","10","0","0","3 April 2004"," Finally a comic film high on ""Comic"" aspects not soap opera dramatics
","Hellboy is a comic book film!!  It is based on a comic book, and realizes such.  This being said, unlike many other comic book films, this film lays on the cheese, but knows it is doing it.  This film realizes it is a comic book, and that it's plot is very ""OUT THERE.""  That is what makes it so much fun to watch.  Unlike Daredevil and League of Extraordinary Gentleman, which were ridiculous soap operas compared to the likes of TV's, Passion, Hellboy is more one-liners and fun, and takes its self less serious.  It is a comic book people, lets have fun with it!!!<br/><br/>That being said, there is still excellent characterization and drama as well, especially with Ron Perlman pulling out one of the best performances if not the best of his cult career.  The special effects are phenomenal, especially for the 60 mill budget compared to the 100 mill of most pictures likened to it, that don't look nearly this good.  The film also is high on style and wit, of course expected coming from Del Toro who improved on the Blade franchise with Blade 2 which was overly agreed as being way better than the original.<br/><br/>This film does have its plot holes and unexplained happenings, especially with the slime god's, but that is all excused by the wit and style of the film, which pulls the film through with flying colors.  Unlike other comic book films, Hellboy does not rely on plot and story to unveil it's characters, but instead uses characterization and symbolism to lead the film, which may leave many disappointed.  For me, that was a plus, I was expecting, going into this film to see a pure popcorn movie based on action and plot events, when instead, I got a popcorn film led by heart, wit, and humor.  A surprisingly fun time at the movies for anyone, not just Hellboy comic book fans which i am not. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of great action scenes, and out of this world effects, but there is more to the film, which makes it so rewarding to watch."
"WOLLFFEEY","7","0","0","2 April 2004"," Movie was good, Perlman was great!
","I thought that this movie was actually pretty good.  From the way it looked in the previews, I thought it would be just another crappy superhero flick but it was more than that.  This movie had heart.  Whether it was the interaction between Abe and Broom or the romance with Hellboy and Liz you could definitely feel the emotion.  But that's only in the scenes between the fights, which were not bad but they weren't the best as special effects these days go (they're still 100 times better than anything you would've seen a decade ago with the comic book movies made back then).  As far as Ron Perlman's make-up goes, yeah it looks fake and a little cheesy but it keeps with the look of the comic.  Besides, 30 minutes into it I forgot all about the make-up and focused on the character which Perlman played perfectly as both rough and macho as well as sweet and vulnerable.  All in all, I give Perlman's performance a 10 out of 10 with the rest of the movie being a six. I will definitely see this movie again just to see if only to see Red and his dynamite personality."
"mwright2182","7","0","0","3 April 2004"," **1/2 (out of ****)
","Guillermo del Toro always has a role in store for Ron Perlman in movies like Blade II and Cronos. The Mexican born director is really trying to put him on the screen more than anyone else would. Perlman never seems to find the right role that will put him in the spotlight and hopefully help him become a bigger star. Finally we see him in a leading role in a movie called ?Hellboy?.  Perlman is Hellboy, a demon who was sheltered by Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). He raised him to do good instead of evil. Perlman seems to have fun with his role. His enthusiasm as Hellboy makes the character likeable and fun to watch instead of unpleasant and ugly as it could have been in the hands of another actor, and director.<br/><br/>Instantly there is an explanation of how this demon came about. It is WWII at the start of the movie, and the Nazi?s try to open up a portal to the dark side. They have failed their cause. What came out of the portal was a<br/><br/>red baby demon who Professor Bruttenholm named Hellboy. Cut to the present time where Hellboy is now all grown up, and he is fighting everyday to protect human kind. His appearance is very human like. He has two arms, two legs, and a body. He has horns, which he had filed down to a very low length to fit in with the human crowd. Lastly he speaks fluent English.<br/><br/>Hellboy is not just some tough demon that wants to do nothing but kill every monster that crosses him; he has quite a bit of tenderness in him. He is in love with a paranormal named Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). He also has a since of humor. His one-liners are cheesy and laughable, but it?s fun and appealing. Also, there are some other interesting characters in the movie such as Abe Sapien played by Doug Jones, and voice by David Hyde Pierce. This human like creature is able to swim and breathe in the water. He?s able to breath out of the water with a device that helps him. There is also one character that can do some cool moves with sharp objects. There is a lot to like about this movie. The special effects are top notch. The images jump right off the screen. The monsters look amazing. The Hellboy character looks great. The action scenes are well made. The laughs are right on point. The story line just isn?t easy to follow. I was scratching my head at some points. Why would the Nazi?s want the apocalypse? It just didn?t make since to me. Maybe I?m just slow, and closed-minded. I can?t find it in my heart to recommend this movie. Even though I had mostly good things to say about it. The implausible story line just took away from everything that was good about it. I definitely would like to see a sequel. Hellboy is an interesting character, and I want to see more of him."

","I am a fan of the Hellboy comic books and was long awaiting the opening of the movie. And from the very beginning I was pleased. The director accuratley portrayed Hellboy and the story in a way that is magnificent. Hellboy is the awesome action hero with a cynical sense of humour and a roughness that makes him unique. I loved the movie for all the reasons a movie is entertaining. The action and special effects were great. The actors seemed very natural considering there was a giant red man with horns. I think the movie correctly displayed Mignola's vision and contained all the aspects that the comic book fans love. This movie is wonderful and is a true milestone in the comic book movie genre and could be the introduction to a great character on film. See this movie!"

It wasn't distracting to the enjoyment of the movie, but I would have loved to see what another $5-10 million budget could have done for the finished product.<br/><br/>It is not important that there are no ""big names"" in the movie.

"Xanthochroid","8","0","0","3 April 2004"," Hellboy: A review
","As all of us nerds know, Hellboy is adapted from the Dark Horse comic that's been around ever since I was a kid. I've never picked up an issue, but after seeing the movie I really wish I had. And here I am, thinking I was cool for spotting one of the hockey-imps in `Dogma' wearing a Hellboy shirt. Guillermo Del Toro was a shoe-in for this film, picking a fine cast and getting them to act well! So many times have I seen good actors fall prey to poor directors, but Guillermo is rather gifted at his craft (just pretend Mimic didn't happen). After sitting down and watching several cool previews (Van Helsing is gonna be kickass!), I was thrust into World War II and into the mind of Professor Broom. Professor Broom, played by decades-worn actor John Hurt, was sent in from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense to sweep up the Nazis! Get it? 'Cause his name is Broom! Anyway, after a small soliloquy detailing the life and times of Prof. Broom, we encounter him and the soldiers he's assigned with trying to foil the schemes of the science and witchcraft-wielding Nazis. We're introduced to the main evildoer, the legendary immortal Grigori Rasputin, played by Karel Roden (you may know him better from his role in Blade II), his cronies, Rasputin's somehow un-aging love, Ilsa, and the missing Mushroomhead member, Kroenen, and his plot to awaken the seven Gods of Chaos. After some cool action, we are introduced to the `red ape' they decided to name Hellboy. Baby Hellboy was extremely cute, even with the abnormally large Fisto-esque right hand. We're then treated to a tabloid-laden opening credit sequence whereupon we learn that Hellboy is none-other than an alternate-universe Bigfoot.<br/><br/>As the plot thickens, we meet John T. Myers (Rupert Evans), FBI Agent and Hellboy's new nanny. Shocked after meeting Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by none other than Niles himself, David Hyde Pierce), the merman with the `unique frontal lobe', John is amazed after meeting Hellboy. Extremely well played by Ron Perlman (also known for his roles as Deathstroke the Terminator in the horrible anime gyp-off `Teen Titans' cartoon and One from City of Lost Children), Hellboy would be quite the frightening site to bump into in the darkness of a back alley. Despite his attempt to look `normal' by sanding his horns down, the red skin and spaded tail give him away completely, no Clark Kent/Prince Adam mind-trickery here, no sir! This wise-cracking, cigar smoking, trench-coat wearing devil is very much a tragic character; a facet they don't utilize enough. But far too many reviewers bash and bash and bash the film until it's a soft, pulpy mess that has seen better days at the bottom of a garbage disposal. Sure there were negative qualities about Hellboy, but what movie is devoid of them? The fact is we go to the movies to be entertained, and Hellboy is a thoroughly entertaining film.<br/><br/>There is a very healthy mix of plot-rich drama (the origin story and return to BPRD of Selma Blair's character Liz Sherman), comic relief (Hellboy's refusal to take love advice from a nine-year-old while spying on Liz and John), action (Hellboy's battling of the `Hound of Resurrection' Sammael), creepiness (beasties from space that would make Lovecraft proud) and of course, bigotry (Jeffrey Tambor's portrayal of the Hellboy-hating Cochise of the FBI, Dr. Manning). The CGI-rendered hellhound is creepy, but its often sick regeneration ability is even creepier (think limb relocation complete with bone-snapping action). All in all, from start to finish, it's a definite teaser to what the summer season will bring in terms of action and the fall season will bring in terms of horror. I'm sure those Hellboy fanboys will be more than pleased with the film.<br/><br/>Yet again, we can thank cinematic wizardry to give us lessons on how not to judge a book by its cover and more reasons to hate Nazis. I give Hellboy three out of four stars and anxiously await a movie starring the extremely bizarre Kroenin. C'mon, you all know he's the coolest character in the movie (and the comic I'm sure) the moment you see him, who're you fooling!?"

","Hellboy is so tough, I believe he can teach Mr.T a thing or too. Comic books have gone quite bonanza on the big screen, with Blade, X-Men SpiderMan, Blade 2, Daredevil, X-Men 2, The Hulk, and the soon to released The Punisher, and SpiderMan 2. It seems like comicbooks will live on forever in movies . Ron Perlman seems perfectly cast has Hellboy, who was born a demon, but raised by a government to be a good guy. He also has amazing powers, he has a Snake Pliskin like attitude. But an ancient evil wants Hellboy to create hell on earth. And what happens next will be the exciting part that I won't give away, you'll half to see the movie. Ron Perlman just became Hellboy when the cameras started rolling. I could'nt think of no one else who could be has good. And director Guillermo Del Toro(Blade 2) knows how to excite the audience. Please I hope there will be a sequel?"
"wgeddings","8","0","0","2 April 2004"," It entertained and what more can you ask
","I knew nothing of Hellboy, let me say that first.  I like comic books and used to collect them.  I love movies.  So when a comic book is made into a movie, I get excited and can't wait to see it and then usually end up with something like the first Punisher movie (Dolph Lundgren) or other movies where the director/writer/actor ""reinvent"" the character and such to the point that it is really not like the comic at all and they forget to add some action.<br/><br/>Even knowing nothing of Hellboy, my son wanted to see it so we went.  I understood what was going on and the characters right away.  I would like to have had more info about Hellboy's powers, so to speak, but it was not a problem.  Just as in a good comic, you understand the character's motivation and desire, who is good and who is evil (thankfully use of the Nazi's helps that a bit) and how it will likely end (after all, you always knew they were not going to kill Superman or Spiderman but that did not make the story any less fun).  No boring backstory, unneeded love stories or special effects for the sake of special effects.<br/><br/>My 12 year old son really enjoyed the movie and thought it was great. Although we had the usual group of rude/loud people in the theater, I cannot hold that against the film and I have no problems recommending it.  To me, Spiderman (the movie) is a 10.  Daredevil was about a 5.  X-men 2 was an 8. Hopefully that gives you an idea of how I see things so you can make your own decision."

","hellboy, the character pretty much explains itself. he's a great presence on screen that you immediately get attached to. although, all the other characters introduced dont quite develop as deeply as hellboy,which is one of my peeves about the movie.<br/><br/>the villian, grigori rasputin, never really had much of an impact as being the main evil bad guy, he was more of just a subsided character who was never really given a chance to show how evil he could be. kroenen, on the otherhand, was well done. his ruthlessness and persistance gave him a greater presence than rasputin.<br/><br/>ive never read the comics and i was never a fan of hellboy before this film came out, but after watching this movie, im assuming the comics are just as fun. i am hoping that they will flesh out more details that were missing from the movie when i read them. i expected more from the film, more character development, more creatures for hellboy to smash, but mostly, more well-thought out fights. they just seemed to drag on and on.<br/><br/>
if something i can truly comment with great feeling on is ron perlman's performance as hellboy. perfect, in my opinion. even though i hadnt read the comics to get a glimpse of hellboy's personality, perlman is seemed so perfect, the sterotypical 'tough' guy with that take no questions type of personality. his one-liners and humerous comments is what makes hellboy so great. he just looks cool also.<br/><br/>so, this movie was fun and enjoyable, i just came in with high expectations that were left to be built upon in sequels im hoping. guillermo del torro, nice job, youve got a milestone approaching from this film. 7/10"

","I saw Hellboy last night (opening night in my city) and I thought it was quite good and strangely beautiful.<br/><br/>I read a few comments from others and I am amazed at the closed-minds with which people approach fantasy material. Obviously, no one has to like the movie - but to assume all kinds of nonsense about the characters just because a) it's based on a comic book, b) is a story about a demon, c) has elements of humor, and d) develops the character from the point of infancy is really and truly idiotic. What you do is watch the movie, decide if it was internally consistent in its portrayal of the characters, and then decide if it was something you liked. That's pretty much it. Coming at anything because it isn't developed in the precise way you would have done it pretty much just explains to everyone else why you are unlikely to ever be involved in the creative process of making a movie.<br/><br/>Logic? It's a comic book fantasy - it has it's own logic. If you don't like, don't like it - just don't complain that it's not a comic book logic done your way. When you write a freaking movie you'll be glad if people give you a fair chance too.<br/><br/>Anyway, the strangely beautiful part is at the end and I can't tell you stuff about the end at least for a few more weeks (to be fair).

","Going into Hellboy, I was thinking probably like anyone in the audience who wasn't familiar with he comic book: it's going to weird for the sake of weird with plenty of multicolored goo. And you know what, Hellboy didn't disappoint. I got all the goo I could ask for as well enough weird to make me forget exactly where I was.<br/><br/>It's definitely a new approach to the comic book superhero, HB smokes, drinks and curses and I wouldn't have it any other way. I mean seriously, it would be just plain wrong to have a demon who always plays nice with others. He's straight out of Hell, from a Nazi vortex straight to the big screen for your viewing pleasure. Plus he's not without wit some great sarcastic and cynical wit. I laughed aloud when he wasn't quite able to ""Superman"" from one building to the next only to end up getting love advice from a nine year old.<br/><br/>Story: demon is sucked out of Hell (or outer space, whatever) to be used by Nazis for world destruction, allies recover him and Professor Broom brings him up as a semi-good-guy with a craving for Baby Ruths. John Myers, our cute and innocent FBI agent, has the honor of becoming Hellboy's new escort. They get to work quickly, some museum has been broken into and the security has been devoured. Blah blah blah blah blah, fight in subway, funny line here, witty line there, it's all good.<br/><br/>However, there is no real doubt that Hellboy can pull off the save the world thing, and he makes the BIG choice in about a 30 second argument and a yawning conclusion that is visually disgusting (or beautiful, whatever).<br/><br/>7/10"

","Granted, I could see how some scenes of this movie could be considered derivative (Alien, Deep Rising). Know what? Dont care. Lots of weirdness in this film. It has no real mythology to latch onto. Thats ok though, Hellboy makes its own, and it does a decent job. Hellboy is a good movie because while every character has his strengths, both physically and emotionally, they also have their weaknesses, both physically and emotionally. The characters are not driven by a single visual or biochemical motif, which I believe to be a plus for the movie. It shows that such a group does not simply evolve through normal circumstance and that each character is a true rarity and thus a system based on such rarity cannot function as normal teams would. Each player comes from an entirely different background; they each do their job and do it well enough that the group, regardless of personal shortcomings, are able to succeed more often than not.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is decent. The only problem that I had with it is the initial release of the monsters upon the city. Maybe I missed the reason, but I saw no real effect towards the ultimate goals of the main antagonists. I will have to wait until the DVD comes out so I can buy it and watch it again.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: Solid 8"

","This was a very enjoyable film and should spawn a sequel or two.  The only question is, since this is one of those ""save the world"" films, what do you do for an encore?<br/><br/>Ron Perlman was excellent as the blue collar hero.  But rather than be a simple caricature, we saw Hellboy's deep feelings emerge for one of his fellow teammates, whose powers resemble those of an X-Men 2 mutant.  The scene with him spying on her from a rooftop while she was on a date was really funny and somewhat tender at the same time.<br/><br/>The mysterious Nazi in the ""gas mask"" is revealed eventually and he slices and dices his way through the film like a martial arts expect with truncheon-like steel blades.  The CGI monster looks like a cross between a squid, a warthog and a wolf.  There's proof that this film doesn't try to take itself too seriously when Hellboy battles one of these creatures with one hand while holding onto a box of kittens in the other.  The comment he makes will crack you up.<br/><br/>At times, the story is a bit convoluted and would require a second viewing to follow closely.<br/><br/>Hellboy is a new cinema icon and so long as Perlman is able to play the role with humour and human feelings, much like Tobey McGuire's Spiderman, we have the makings of a franchise.  It's not as superb as the last X-Men film but Hellboy the character is much more charismatic that the Hulk, Daredevil or any of the cast from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<br/><br/>Review by Triniman"
"edipisreks","8","0","0","2 April 2004"," Quite good, but needed something more.
","I saw this film at a preview screening in a house full of movie geeks such as myself, and unlike the Matrix Sequels, Hellboy lived up to the pent up excitement that was in the air.  The film exhibits a depth that most comic book movies don't, and frankly would stand on its own merits whether or not it had a built in fan base. hopefully the sequel features more from Abe Sapien, who stole all the scenes he was included in. Ron Perlman is great as Hellboy himself, and the rest of the cast does not let the film down. the only low point to the film, in my opinion, is the score, which swells melodramatically and is more fitting for a video game than a feature film. visually stunning and with an interesting plot, fine acting and adequate directing, the film is a spring must see."

","From the opening gambit to the faultless and romantic close this is one amazing movie.  If I did the ol' it's sort of like these two movies I'd vote for Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ghostbusters.  Irreverent, silly and just plain child-like at times, the director sucks you into the story (I have never read the comic books so I have no comment about the faithfulness to the source) and he never lets go.<br/><br/>More, and more clearly presented plot than you'd find in half a dozen other comic-to-screen flicks.  It is a testament to how stuff like this works best with great performances.<br/><br/>John Hurt is unrecognizable as Professor Bruttenholm (the older).  David Hyde Pierce gives voice (while Doug Jones give form) to Abe Sapien and Selma Blair (whose charms have always eluded me) is appropriately world-weary and flawed.<br/><br/>But it is Ron Perlman's Hellboy that grounds the picture.  He's a giant child in the body of a huge daemon.  That he's surprised when someone helps him, that he takes relationship tips from a 9-year-old, that he is a contradiction and unsettled, and all through a boat-load of makeup and prosthetics -- amazing.<br/><br/>If I have a quibble, and I usually do, it is that the baddies don't get enough screen time.  Not the creatures, the villains.  There seems to be so much going on in Karl Roden's performance, but it is light and heat with nothing to stand upon.<br/><br/>Go for the laughs.  Go for the special effects.  Go for the camp factor. Stay and enjoy the human drama.  Be blown away by the geek romance.<br/><br/>
Great film."

","If you read comic books, you need to see this movie!  The story line was a typical Good vs. Evil with the evil coming from the past.  Overall, the movie struck me as a pleasant blend of Spawn for action, Bulletproof Monk for Nazi-occult plot, and Men-in-Black for creatures.  The antagonist opening a portal to bring back ancient evil and who's first attempt brings forth Hellboy.  The special effects were spectacular!  Especially the flame sequences and both of the portal scenes.  John Hurt's performance of Professor Bruttenholm was brilliant if disappointingly brief.  The action was almost non-stop broken up by Ron Perlman's masterful and sardonically funny portrayal of Hellboy as exemplified by his line at the end of the movie ""I'm gonna be sore in the morning.""  I wish we had been able to see more of Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, her smoldering and conflicted character was a nice compliment to the in-your-face Hellboy.  The movie left me satisfied as a complete entity, yet wanting to see ""Hellboy 2"" very soon."

","I was unfamiliar with the Hellboy story going into the movie, so I did not have any expectations of the film.  I thought the commercials looked cool and I was looking to be entertained.  I am, however, a big wrestling fan and I chose to see Hellboy over the Rock's new movie Walking Tall, so I was at least expecting to have a good time.  In that sense, this movie did satisfy me.  I had a good time and found myself really into it.  There were no real eye-popping moments, but there was plenty of humor and the crowd in the theatre laughed heartily on many occasions.  Ron Perlman does a great job, as he normally does, and he really made me root for Hellboy.  He connected the audience to the screen with a very human element and many humorous elements that made you feel the human, emotional side of this character. <br/><br/>
I thought the effects were good and close to seamless, but they were nothing we have not seen before.  The pace is a little slow at first, but picks up. I did get the sense that they were trying to introduce a franchise rather than a single complete story because you do not get any sense that anything was really completed in this film.  My other complaint would be that Hellboy does not face a wide array of enemies in the film.  He fights the same type of monster throughout the film and the main bad guys seem to be an afterthought that he catches up to at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend the film.  It is fun and smart and never seemed to be contrived.  It actually made me want to go and read the Hellboy comics and peeked my interest in the storyline.  I will definitely go to see a sequel if they make it."

","I definitely have to put this movie up with the top comic movies that have been made lately.  That list, in no particular order is: Batman (ONLY the first one), X-men(1&2), Superman (1&2), Spiderman, and Hell Boy. <br/><br/>
In no way shape or form does this film fall into the dregs of comic mishaps such as DareDevil, Hulk, the rest of the Batman movies, Captain America, Judge Dredd, the first Punisher Movie, and the rest of the Superman movies.<br/><br/>
The plot isn't all that great, but that isn't what drives this movie.  The special effects are also good (especially the fish guy), but they don't make your jaw drop in a Return of the King way.  What really drives this movie is HellBoy himself.  The wit and machoness of the character (evenly tempered by his green feelings towards Selma Blair), make HellBoy a pleasure to watch. Perlman does this character perfectly!  The only thing knockin the movie is the lack of a significant villain.  The zombie Nazi and Rasputin were creative, but they don't really strike you as memorable villains (example: The Joker).<br/><br/>
Unlike Stallone or Vin Diesel, Perlman delivers his witty lines perfectly unlike the previously mentioned actors where you roll your eyes every time a ""catch phrase"" is uttered.  This is a great flick, definitely worth the time to see.<br/><br/>

","Hellboy is one of the best, if not THE BEST adaptations of a comic book I have seen.  If you rate your movies by genre, like I do, Hellboy is right up there at the top of the ""Comic book turned to movie"" list, IMHO.  I am not ashamed to admit (ok, a bit ashamed) :)  that I collected comic books as a child and young adult.  There is a 'feeling' to a comic book when you read it and I got this feeling while watching Hellboy - it had all the classic elements:  completely unbelievable characters, story line, villains and plot twists.  The suspension of logic and reality are key, here, but any good comic collector has ground those elements of their psyche into dust, long ago.  :)<br/><br/>For those non-collectors - Hellboy is still a well-acted (especially Perlman and Hurt) movie with good special effects and a marginally simple-enough story line to follow (notice I said marginally - go with a comic nerd, like my wife did, if you can - she enjoyed it!).<br/><br/>Bottom line for comic fans:  9.5 out 10 Bottom line for everyone else: 7.5 out of 10"

"jdesando","Null","0","0","2 April 2004"," An existential comic book made into a movie!
","Hell hath no fury like an `X-Files' type of film faithfully adapting a revered comic book with the darkly existential theme of  `choices.' Director Guillermo del Toro's `Hellboy' playfully brings to life the story of a demon from hell conjured by WWII Nazis occultists under the supervision of the legendary Rasputin and freed by US troops to fight ghosts and monsters for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.<br/><br/>
Mike Mignola created the hero after characters he loved in the works of Clark Ashton Smith and H.P. Lovecraft (among others) with a geeky devotion that includes quirky characters and pow-crash violence in the spirit of Jack Kirby's classics. The screenplay by del Toro is based largely on the first trade paperback collection of `Seed of Destruction' and its subsequent `Wake of the Devil' and `Right Hand of Doom.'<br/><br/>I love the ironic world-weariness Ron Perlman brings to the titular hero his frustrating pursuit of pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  In between are the usual monstrous battles, wacky professor, and historical villain-just about every comic book clich√© wrapped up in an energetic, visually rich experience. Covering the whole experience is a theme about choices: A man proves who he is not by heredity or chance but by the choices he makes.  An existential comic book made into a movie!<br/><br/>How good is it?  The director said, `We're finally seeing movies made for geeks, by geeks.' As Coleridge described, `And Fire from Hell reared his gigantic shape,' I could say the same about `Hellboy.'"

","Hellboy was another movie based off of a comic book, and like all protects seem to be doing, it tried to stray from the normal fare.  Well, I think in some ways it did and some it didn't, but if you look at the material it's hard to not do it like that and stay true to the original story and characters.  I enjoyed Hellboy, for it's characterization.  Hellboy and Abe and Liz were all unique and very interesting.  Just casting a smaller actor like Ron Perlman makes this movie intriguing because it's a new face and he brought a lot of warmth and dulled down humor that made this movie stand out.  The action was good and all the heroes were highlighted, but not as gods or unbeatable people which makes them more personable.  The father-son conflict was another good twist and the romance between Hellboy and Liz helps a movie that has a good story and good effects not become a cliched comic book movie.  There was also that theme we saw in X-Men, with outcasts of society and how there's that unity even between people who may be excluded or live in loneliness.  And the relationship with Hellboy and his father brought it back to every man, woman and child's level again, because it's a concept anyone can relate to."

","""Hellboy"" is an outrageous cut-and-paste of ideas that shoehorns Nazis, Rasputin, a fish man, hell-hounds, and a Lovecraftian tentacle monster into the familiar ""X-Files"" setup involving a government agency in pursuit of supernatural forces.  <br/><br/>Unlike ""X-Files,"" however, ""Hellboy"" is not a complete snoozer.  There's action and spectacle aplenty, and the film's look actually far exceeds the expectations I had based on its modest budget (CGI must be getting rather good - and cheaper!).<br/><br/>Lord knows why Ebert thinks this is a 3 1/2 star movie, however.  Frankly there's too much action, and it gets repetitive; Hellboy fights the same monster three times, for example.  I wasn't too fond of the villains, either; Rasputin in particular is a bore who exhibits none of the charisma attributed to his real life counterpart.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the good guys pick up most of the slack.  David Hyde Pierce's fish man voice is hilarious, and it's always great to see John Hurt (why is the old guy always the coolest part of these movies?).

"ilovedolby","8","0","0","4 April 2004"," A unique hero rises to the challenge!!!
","Many think that comic-book hero adapted films have become a dime-a-dozen what with `Spider-Man,' `The Hulk,' and `Daredevil.' However, it is not like these movies have been all that bad-the best being `The Hulk' which portrayed a tormented man born with abilities that he cannot control. Now we have `Hellboy.' Hellboy himself is hardly a super-human; he is more of a super Satan. With a unique look of red skin, broken horns, and a right hand made of armor, we find a friendly and heroic character willing to save the world from the clutches of his own kind-ultimate evil. The end result is a familiar, yet exceptional tale of good verses evil. 	`Hellboy' tells the story of the son of Satan, taken from hell by a ritual in which Nazis tried to take over the world. The good-old boys of the American army botched the attempt and the creature taken from hell was adopted by the United States government and appropriately named Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Raised by Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt), a scientist who works for a secret U.S. Government agency, Hellboy learns the ways of good and fights to protect the world from `things that go bump in the night.'<br/><br/>	Now, in the present, Hellboy is faced with the resurrected Grigori Rasputin and Nazis, as they attempt to once again take over the world by bringing hell down on earth. Hellboy is aided in his fight by another strange creature named Abraham 'Abe' Sapien (Doug Jones), a fish-like man with great knowledge; Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a beautiful young woman who can manipulate fire; and a new recruit to the agency named John Myers, a future replacement for the ailing Professor Bruttenholm. Their adventure to save the world will force Hellboy to face his very identity and require him to make a choice between the world of which he physically is, and the world that he was brought up to fight for. 	Although the film is conventional and we can expect to see an unusual hero rise, we also find a one-of-a-kind hero that will not back down from what he knows to be right. The unconventional aspect of `Hellboy' rests in its awesome characters that are not only colorful, but also personified by their human qualities. For example, Hellboy himself is deeply in love with Liz Sherman and would do anything to protect her. There is a funny scene in which Liz enters Hellboy's room and finds him writing one love letter after another to her. As for the character of Abraham Sapien, he offers words of wisdom for Liz when Hellboy is distraught over his ailing adopted father, Professor Bruttenholm. Sapien says, `If there's trouble, then all of us freaks has is each other.' 	Identity and choice are the keys to these super-hero flicks. Hellboy has to make a choice between fighting for good or evil. Choice is imperative and it is what separates these characters from other people around them. The same is true for the characters of `Spider-Man,' and `The Hulk.' They acknowledge that they are cursed soles-but they do not have to live a cursed life. They are both normal and abnormal. It is their choice to live in a world where they can protect mankind so that people will not have to feel the same pain that they do. As for `Hellboy,' it latches on to that quality, will not let go and becomes a movie where an unlikely creature becomes a hero. ***"

","I just saw ""Hellboy"" earlier tonight and although I'm not familiar with the comic, I was quite pleased with genre helmer Guillermo Del Toro's (""Blade II"") effort into bringing this material to the screen. His over-the-top, quirky, visual style is imaginative to say the least; it seems to be a cross between Tim Burton's (""Batman"") and Sam Raimi's (""Spider-Man"").<br/><br/>  Unlike their respective comic book movie franchises, ""Hellboy"" is an ensemble superhero piece like ""X-Men"" and ""The League of Extrordinary Gentlemen"". Like those films, ""Hellboy"" takes a band of outcasts with strange powers whose sole purpose is to dispose the world from the bad guys who want to rule it. <br/><br/>  This time it's the Nazis (who else?) who are delving into a space portal in order to unleash a group of gods whose power will crush anyone who gets in their way. I know, the story is about as old as sand, but at least it isn't as bad as last year's ""Bulletproof Monk"", which only redeeming quality was the beautiful Jaime King.<br/><br/>  Anyway, Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) is the key to turning the Nazis' dream for world domination into a reality (those damn Nazis, they'll never learn, will they?) and its up to him and a few others to stop this from happening. Of course they do, but it's the way they do that makes the movie a bit different from its contemporaries.<br/><br/>  One of the pleasures of the film is watching the romance between Hellboy and his love interest played by Selma Blair. Its nothing huge, but it's the little things that count in these kinds of pictures and I liked these scenes that played out with geniune emotion and care. I like the social point it makes, it's the person inside, not the outside that makes all the difference. Granted its a bit overstated, but it's a nice one that helps make the picture shine a little more.<br/><br/>  Pearlman, Blair, John Hurt, Jeffery Tambor and David Hyde Pierce (in a voice-over job) turn in terrific performances, they embody the characters magnificently. I only wish the cliched story was told a little bit more clearer, there are some elements that just don't add up. Still, ""Hellboy"" is terrific entertainment, it may not be innovative or original, but it's an enjoyable film that may achieve a cult classic status, though I hope it earns more than that. I loved it.<br/><br/>I'd give it a rating of ***1/2 out of **** (Good)."

","To start, I don't want to explain the exposition, because the origin of Hellboy and the villians is part of the movie's fun.  Suffice it to say, Hellboy is a demon raised as a human, who works for a secret organization fighting monsters (think Men in Black).  Certain mythical beasts are let loose, and it starts hitting the fan in about 3 minutes.  Hellboy (Ron Perlman) works alongside aquatic creature Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce) and pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).  Along with a team of slightly inept humans, our heroes set out to find and destroy the source of the monsters.  What follows is one of the best comic book adaptations in recent memory.  Great action sequences, superb special effects (the opening sequence is a killer!), and a wonderful sense of humor makes Hellboy a very enjoyable experience.  Despite his horns and tail, Ron Perlman plays Hellboy as though he were as normal as the rest of us.  In effect, the audience sympathizes with Hellboy as he clashes with his emotional troubles.  Though the plot degenerates in the last few minutes, the nearly 2 hours leading up to it are a lot of fun.  Even if you're unfamiliar with the source material (guilty), give this movie a chance.  It's worth it.  3 stars."

","For director - and comic book connoisseur - Guillermo del Toro, bringing Hellboy to life on celluloid was a labor of love and his passion for the material is evident in every frame, from first to last. This much anticipated film, adapted from the Mike Mignola - penned comic books, has finally arrived in theaters and was well worth the wait.<br/><br/>In a recent interview published in a nationally known film publication, del Toro states that the only actor he ever considered for Hellboy was Perlman. At one point, Universal wanted to develop the film with Vin Diesel or The Rock in the role but del Toro balked at the idea and the project remained in limbo until it was picked up by Revolution. It turns out del Toro's instincts were right on the mark. Perlman is an excellent Hellboy, hardened and tough one minute, weak and vulnerable the next. Perlman not only has the right physical look for the character but he understands the inner workings of the character, the very human side underneath the bulky red exterior. Hellboy is a super hero, no doubt, but he's also a guy who loves to drink beer, smoke cigars, and chew on a Baby Ruth and it's in the moments when Hellboy is just a regular Joe that Perlman really shines. The supporting cast is also very good, but Perlman is the real star of this show and he more than rises to the challenge.<br/><br/>Del Toro's vision has been realized right down to the smallest detail and the film is visually stunning. Del Toro shot every inch of it himself and his mastery of the camera is evident in even the smallest of scenes. The set pieces, costumes, makeup, and special effects are all achievements of skill that bring to life the world in which the story takes place in a way that even the most casual film-goer can appreciate. As you would expect, the action sequences are bigger than life: a chase through the city, Hellboy battling the Samarrea in a subway station, and the final showdown in Rasputin's stronghold are amazingly staged. But, what makes the film really special are the little moments: H.B visiting Liz at the psychiatric hospital, Hellboy surrounded by wads of crumpled paper as he tries to express his feelings for Liz in a note, Hellboy sitting on a rooftop with a young boy as he jealously critiques Myer's attempts to woo Liz, the way in which Abe convinces Liz to stay ¬ñ all wonderful, and often humorous, scenes that tie the film together and make the characters likeable.<br/><br/>I just can't say enough about Hellboy. In terms of pure entertainment value, it is second to none, but it is also a very good film ¬ñ if not surpassing at least on par with The X-Men or Spiderman in terms of brilliantly bringing a comic book hero to life on the big screen.  <br/><br/>There are more stories to tell and, in the hands of del Toro and Perlman, Hellboy could very well be the auspicious beginnings of a spectacular franchise. We can only hope to be so lucky!"

I would have also liked to have seen more monsters rather than the same one they had through the whole picture.  Still though this movie was good as it had great action, the effects were good and there was good humor in it as well.  And as I said before Pearlman was great.

"JAKastner","7","0","0","3 April 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Hellboy
","Here's come another one ¬Ö another feature film adaptation of a classic comic book series. Ever since the comic book genre was revitalized by X-Men in 2000 and elevated to escalating popularity thanks to Spider-Man in 2003, it has been the top priority of every major movie studio in Hollywood to jump on the latest band wagon and grab a comic book franchise in which to roll several features, if at all possible. Granted that most of the major comic book series have been picked up and the only ones left are the less well-known franchises, but aren't the filmmakers that choose these projects all the more braver then those with the so-called `sure-fire' hits? Guillermo del Toro hasn't clearly shown that after taking the directing reins in the already hot Blade film franchise for Blade II, which managed successful to out-gross the original, but now he really gets to show how brave of a filmmaker he is with a project he's been working on for nearly six years. After shopping the experimental project around for quite some time, del Toro will now have the shot to bring the cult-classic to life but whether or not his hard work will pay off is still in the air.<br/><br/>The story follows a young devil brought to Earth through a pagan ritual and saved by the United States Army on his journey to grow up and become a man. Nearly sixty years ago, the Nazis, in a last ditch effort to win the war against the Allied Powers, stage a cult experiment to unleash the seven gods of Chaos and destroy the world, all being led by the mysterious Grigori Rasputin. But when the United States Army intervenes, the lurid experiment goes awry and, as a result, tares the child of Satan, later named Hellboy, from his home. After he is adopted by Professor Bruttenholm, Hellboy is brought up as a force of good, rather then evil, working for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, protecting the world from all supernatural forces that may threaten it. His latest mission brings him in touch with the Nazi cult followers that brought him into the world sixty years ago, only this time they are adamantly determined to finish the job they started, which includes using Hellboy to fulfill his true purpose ¬Ö unleashing the seven gods of Chaos and bringing about the end of the world. The story for Hellboy, as confusing and outlandish as it may seem, was surprisingly quite interesting but is definitely one that requires not necessarily a true understanding of the comic book series it is based on but an awareness of historical figures that the feature presents, as well as the legends surrounding those characters. If you go into this film without at least a reasonable sense of what is going on, you're not going to understand one solitary thing within this film. In that case, don't bother going at all ¬Ö you're just going to waste your money.<br/><br/>Unlike other comic book adaptations, Hellboy does not feature a whole lot of A-list talent but none-the-less features one of the most impressive casts this year, despite several flaws that become evident as the feature progresses. Ron Perlman is Hellboy, no ifs, ands, or buts about it! Perlman was apparently the major requirement by Guillermo del Toro when he shopped around the project and was one of the major setbacks for the project as well with the studios wanting someone more famous to play the red hero. Fortunately for movie-goers, del Toro stuck to his guns and showcases a real eye for talent with Perlman's marvelous performance. John Hurt, who portrays Professor Bruttenholm, gives a delightful performance of a character that cares dearly for his adopted son but knows clearly that his time on Earth is running out. You can't help but have a tear in your eye during his final scene in the film. There were few problems with the cast but the ones that were contrary to the rest were quite evident, this included Jeffrey Tambor and Karel Roden. It wasn't necessarily their performances but the characters themselves. Tambor plays some-what of an adversary to Hellboy in the course but you never exactly get an idea why this is. Perhaps he's the typical `uptight governmental agent who fears people different from him and therefore looks unkindly toward ¬ëfreaks' like Hellboy' ¬Ö in that case, this just makes the character rather a lame addition to the overall story. And Roden as Rasputin? You just don't see enough of him to care or clearly grasp what he's doing in the film or trying to achieve.<br/><br/>Overall, Hellboy lands up in purgatory, it is neither a hit nor a miss, not necessarily leaving you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you. What it does leave you with is the feeling of wanting to know what the Hell (no pun intended) was going on and how it all makes sense, one way or another ¬Ö a thing del Toro never clearly demonstrates in this film. First off, the feature, though only lasting a little over two hours, feels a lot longer then it actually is especially with several seemingly endless chase scenes. Secondly, it felt as though too much was being crammed into one film and might have been better split up but with enough problems getting this first one made it is understandable why del Toro might have getting a sequel. Third, there were several prominent instances where it felt as though the over-the-topness of the film was too much, including the scenes with Kroenen waving his swords around like that guy from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Many were expecting someone to pull a gun out, shoot the Nazi SOB, and move on from there but that never came about. And finally, concerning Kroenan, how does that work out? The man (figuring he is even human) is mostly dust but continues to do the things he does over a nearly sixty year time span ¬Ö how is that possible? What keeps him, supposedly, alive? And what makes the last scene with him seem like the end of his character? Guess that's asking too much. Hellboy, in the end, becomes a comic-book fanatic's dream but the for the rest it leaves them confused.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** ¬Ω out of 5 (Grade: C+)"

","I never noticed it before, but Guillermo del Toro is one of THOSE directors.<br/><br/>You know, the one who has a phenomenal visual sense, but has no idea what to do with those bothersome things called ""actors."" To see this problem at its worst, make note of the awful ""Bulletproof Monk,"" but del Toro is several shades better in that he hides it very, very well. In fact, so well I never noticed until now.<br/><br/>The average movie-goer doesn't care. If you've seen this movie, you probably didn't even notice that the actors just kind of stand around, and when they do move (in any scene where they're not replaced by CGI-effects), it's without much thought to it (walking down a hall; walking down a street).<br/><br/>The action sequences are very creative, I really did like this movie. Thumbs up. But I can't give it any better than a B. Great effects, great acting, but the storytelling was only so/so, and so was the dialogue. I felt like I was watching the 2nd season premiere of some HBO series, or worse, 3 or 4 episodes from the middle of season 2 just kinda crunched together. There was no arc to it-- this happened, then that happened, the end. Characters came back from the dead so easily, it's like, what's the importance of even killing them in the first place? The bad guys are just gonna get up again in 5 minutes. Where's the rest of the story?<br/><br/>Despite ALL this, I didn't hate it. Ron Perlman and Selma Blair are way too charismatic, even when they're given lines that are MEANT to sound cool but were actually written by a 40-year-old filmmaker who thinks he has the same taste in one-liners as a 20-year-old. Granted, yes, I liked this better than Del Toro's ""Blade 2,"" but there's still major room for improvement here. Any word on when the world will get ""Hellboy Returns,"" or better yet ""Hellboy Forever?""<br/><br/>If they're better than the first one, the way ""X-2"" was light years better than ""X-Men,"" then those are the films I want to see. 8/10."

","""Hellboy"" is a cute entertainment with expensive special effects, including elaborate underground bunkers on several continents, as befits the attention of a writer/director, Guillermo del Toro, who started his career in the make-up/effects departments.  <br/><br/>Though stuck in a complicated Nazi-creation myth out of  ""Indiana Jones,"" the funny and snappy dialogue seems to take a lot of its attitude from the Joss Whedon universe of ""Buffy the Vampire Killer"" and particularly from ""Angel, "" but lacks the depth and poignancy of both<br/><br/>The romance ironically recalls ""Beauty and the Beast,"" as the titular tormented hero of both is played by Ron Perlman.  <br/><br/>Selma Blair, usually the goody goody, is surprisingly effective as a Goth-like freak who seems to be guesting from the ""X Men"" series.  In a twist, the ingenue here is a guy, Rupert Evans, who the empathic freak, speaking in David Hyde Pierce's voice, identifies as truly ""pure of heart."" <br/><br/>
While I liked the conceit that each time the monster is killed it replicates from the ashes, it looks recycled from ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" but down in the subway instead of outer space. <br/><br/>The score matches the action and the snatches of songs are atypical for the genre, including Tom Waits."

Referred throughout the film as either 'HB' or 'Red', Perlman's performance, while relying on the 'Ben Grimm' school of droll one-liners, is also surprisingly human for an entity from the 'other side'. Whether HB is power-sanding down his twin 'horn' stubs, slicing and dicing infernal creatures with a Conan-like frenzy, or making out with his fire-brand of a lady, Perlman allows his character to remain strong and likeable throughout many surreal and violent action sequences.<br/><br/>Other entertaining performances include dependable John Hurt as HB's mentor 'father', Selma Blair as the waifish 'Liz' (who has the emotional capacity to take charge of almost any situation) and Doug Jones as the scaled-down CGI 'Abe Sapien', a chatty C3PO fish out of water.<br/><br/>If you have a burning desire to see the latest comic book movie, then you should go straight to ""HELLBOY"" ...______________________________________________________"
"Nerdboy1423","Null","0","0","30 March 2004"," Hellboy, the definitive Superhero movie, not without flaws
","I have to start out with the one bad thing before I can get to the good. In the beginning of the movie, there was not an even exposition for all the characters, Broom and Hellboy and Rasuptin and the baddies got the biggest exposition, while Liz Sherman's was satisfying but the human in the film, the audience's POV, Agent Myers was given almost nothing!  I read all this Bio material on the Hellboy site for him, that del Toro wrote, but none of that was in the movie at all, so his character felt weak.  Also, his short-lived romance with Liz started off way to fast with them just going out, no character interaction barely at all.  Anyway, although these things weaken the film, overall it was brilliant.  The actors gave great performances, with Perlman disappearing into the Hellboy character, and everyone else giving remarkably subtle, not over-the-top performances that fit their characters.  Also, the movie was not Villain-centric, a la the Batman films, very centered on Hellboy and his team at the BPRD, which gave the film a unique strength, seperating it from other films in this genre. Also, great humor given in zingy one-liners by Perlman delivered perfectly, and fight scenes that don't distract, but are adventurous and inventive, with barely noticeable Visual effects, that don't pull you out of the Hellboy world.  The monsters were fantastic looking and so was all of Liz's fire emanating from her body.  I think this film really stuck to the source material all the way, although I don't remember Liz being in Seed of Destruction at all, and she did feel a little tacked on in the ending. Anyway, Perlman really is the show stealer here, followed by Abe Sapien's character voiced by David Hyde Pierce and performed by a really talented stunt man/mime(really fantastic looking, perhaps the most beautiful creature committed to film).Conceptually beautiful and obviously a milestone for Guillermo del Toro, Hellboy won't soon be forgotten as it is a true testament in Superhero cinema."

","Ron Perlman said at the sneak preview I saw last night that Del Toro's movie is a ""love letter"" to Hellboy and Mike Mignola.  I completely agree and I've even come to think now that Mike must have always had Perlman in mind when he<br/><br/>was creating the character of Hellboy.  Perlman realizes Del Toro's vision<br/><br/>fantastically, truely embodying Hellboy as Mignola designed the character AND giving him some of his own personality.  That's one of the best things about this film - it stays incredibly true to the comic book, but also allows the actors (and plot/story) to breathe a bit: David Hyde Pierce as the voice of Abe Sapien seems a bit odd at first, making the character a bit effeminate, but it does work as Pierce (and Doug Jones in the costume) is able to flesh out and humanize such an odd being in the relatively short time he is onscreen.<br/><br/>This is accomplished through what is one of the keys to this film's great success: humor.  Not comedy per se, but the humor the characters have in their lives.<br/><br/>This is right from Mignola's comic, as Hellboy is confronted with all manner of mind-twisting monsters, that would threaten anyone's sanity, and evil beings like Rasputin spouting fantastic prose on the Apocalypse...and all Hellboy says is ""Aw, crap.""  Mignola's genius is creating fabulous heroic characters who are<br/><br/>incredibly down to earth and all they really want after a day beating back<br/><br/>Cthullu, is a cold brewski.  Del Toro gets all of that and more up on the screen.<br/><br/>All I can say is I AM SO HAPPY THIS MOVIE CAME OUT SO GREAT!<br/><br/>YA-FREAKIN-HOO!

","I'll make this quick; I'm a big Hellboy fan.  This movie delivers on most fronts, and doesn't deviate as much as one would assume.  The action is top notch, ergo, Hellboy does not use kung fu, bullet time, or a gun so large a normal man couldn't hold it (but it's close). Del Tormo shows his directorial skill much better than in Blade II, even bringing a decent feel from the comic to the screen.  The world is dark and ominous, though no ware near as dark or as ominous as the book.  Hellboy is a bit more sarcastic and a bit less foul then usual, but the rest of the characters are spot on.<br/><br/>I don't know how exactly this story and Seed of Destruction are linked (it's been a while since I read that one), but I doubt it's all that close.<br/><br/>The baddies were real off, the movie needed some Lobster Johnson, and the love story can go.

","Ever since I was a tiny, wee kid I have loved me some monsters. The way other kids immersed themselves in baseball statistics or worship of the Bay City Rollers I spent innumerable hours poring over mythology, folklore, horror comics and monster movies; anything, so long as it contained my beloved monsters (well, maybe not Frankenberry, Count Chocula and the now-forgotten Fruit Brute). In fact, my earliest memory of a movie is that infamous celluloid horse turd The Giant Gila Monster, and shortly after that during my fifth year I got hooked on the West coast's version of Creature Features, hosted by that friend and mentor to all of us monster kids, the late Bob Wilkins. In that magical year I was exposed to Son of Godzilla, The Killer Shrews and The Navy Versus the Night Monsters, not great cinema perhaps, but they all delivered the goods to my eagerly waiting mind. Bottom line: if a movie can hand me a healthy dose of improbable critters on the loose, I'm there. So off I went to see an advance screening of the movie adaptation of Mike Mignola's Hellboy comics, secure in the knowledge that the screen would soon be flush with fantastic beasties both opposing and defending us weak, soft humans.<br/><br/>The rather faithful film version begins in Scotland, 1944 as those pesky Nazis and a seemingly unkillable Russian sorcerer attempt to open a portal into our dimension, through which they hope to summon Lovecraftian elder gods who will destroy the world and lead to some sort of new Eden with the bad guys in control. A group of Allied soldiers and a British expert on the paranormal thwart the summoning, but soon come to realize that something made it through the doorway before it closed. That something is a cute little red demon that is quickly named Hellboy and raised to fight on the side of the angels.<br/><br/>Hellboy grows up to be one seriously ass-kicking BMF (played well by Ron Perlman of TV's Beauty and the Beast), surrounded by fellow paranormal heroes in the employ of the secret Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, so when the unkillable sorcerer and his seig heiling cronies show up again in the present day the Earth has champions who are at the ready, highly trained, armed to the teeth with both technology and superhuman powers, and a fearlessness that enters into territory best described as suicidal. Throw in major throwdowns with tenacious man eating demons, a crazed clockwork cyborg, an irascible talking corpse, a jealousy-fueled romantic subplot and an impending apocalypse frought with Cthulhuoid wigglies and you have a recipe for a monster fan's Nirvana at the cinema, no?<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>HELLBOY brings a lot to the plate and if taken as simply a cornucopia of monsters and neat stuff to look at it succeeds in spades; in fact there are a lot of good character bits to found here as well. However, the sum total is yet another overlong origin movie that has a certain sense of detachment from both its audience and its own material. For the most part the film comes to a dead halt when monsters aren't kicking each other's asses in an orgy of special effects and that's a real stumbling block for the first installment of a potential franchise. I'm predicting a strong opening weekend, but much like THE HULK word of mouth could prove to be lethal. But then again, special effects have become such a crowd pleaser over the years that some films have been able to rake in megabucks despite having nothing else to offer the filmgoer, with the current run of misbegotten Star Wars movies as a tragic case in point.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we get to see what an insecure guy Hellboy is when not out kicking ass as evidenced by his contentious relationship with his adoptive father (John Hurt) and his concerns about whether the sultry pyrokinetic whom he deeply loves (Selma Blair) is falling for the new kid from the FBI (Rupert Evans). And resident psychic gill man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, voiced by Frasier's David Hyde Pierce) is a joy to behold in all of his amphibian glory, all huge black eyes and sweet, erudite voice. But hey, give me a gill man and you have a very happy viewer.<br/><br/>So my bottom line on HELLBOY is that while not bad it's not as involving as it could have been. It's worth seeing on the big screen for the abundant eye candy, but that's about it. And at two hours and twelve minutes in length it's a bit of a long haul without a few bong hits in you."

","Having seen this movie in advance, I admit that it was fantastic! - and I'll need to see it a few more times before I'm satisfied. A number of us were invited to LA over spring break to preview 'Hellboy' and visit with Director Del Toro in the meantime. As many doubts as I had about this movie, I was stunned to finally see it in its entirety. Del Toro has done an incredible job in piecing together Mike Mignola's works in their unique imagery, and actor Ron Perlman's commanding performance is everything you would expect from a veteran actor, famed for his roles in the past sitcom 'Beauty and The Beast', 'Alien Ressurection', 'City of Lost Children', and countless others. I would say he carries the film, but for the invaluable contributions of actors Selma Blair, Doug Jones, Jefferey Tambor, and Karel Roden, to name a few. With an dauntingly small budget, Del Toro has worked a miracle - the effects in 'Hellboy' rival Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, Spiderman, more believable in many respects.<br/><br/>If nothing else, add this to your Must See list.

Not being a comic-book fan to begin with, I really had no pre-conceived ideas about the film, but boy ... it blew me away.

Ron Perlman IS Hellboy ... a gruff, bad-ass, cigar-smoking demon with a big heart and the gauchness of a teenager when it comes to Liz Sherman, the pyrokinetic young lady he adores from afar. No one else could have played him, and thank God - THANK GOD - Guillermo del Toro held out and stubbornly determined to use Perlman as his lead. Inspired casting indeed.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also bang-on ... John Hurt is uncanny as Professor Bruttenholm (pronounced 'Broom'), and Jeffrey Tambor and Rupert Evans are both a delight. Doug Jones is the 'fish-guy', Abe Sapien, and his fluid, balletic grace and quirky performance brings Abe to the big screen brilliantly. Let's have more of Abe in the sequel, if we get one?

He stays true to the tone and atmosphere of the comic while imbuing it with his own cinematic sensibilities.  Hellboy is a genuinely FUN movie with great action and atmosphere, but also with great CHARACTERS.  In Hellboy, del Toro combines his skills as an action director displayed in Blade 2 with the artful characterizations he gave us in The Devil's Backbone and Cronos.  Ron Perlman is note-perfect as the title character, a demon summoned to bring about the Apocalypse who believes he can escape his destiny and instead fight for the forces of good.

Every time you think you're about to get to know a charater better, the movie cuts away to a different character.  The fight scenes had absolutely no tension - I was rooting for the bad guys most of the time even though they were pretty lame too.  (I'm still not really sure what their evil plan was - open up hell and destroy the earth or somesuch nonsense - they never really said why they wanted to - of course, they never really said anything at all!)  There was some nice eye candy but mostly just bad CG.  Aquadude looked really cool but he never really did anything.  Selma Blair was hot as always but the love triangle thing was utterly boring.

At first, you weren't sure if you'd like the character, but by the end of the film, Perlman had made him pretty endearing, I thought. The villains were pure evil - as you'd expect from this kind of film, but they were also very interesting, with their own set of weapons and abilities.<br/><br/>The special effects were done well, and much more seamlessly than we've seen in other FX films recently.

For years when the subject of awful movies (based on comic-books or not) would come up I would say HELLBOY is the worst of them all, Del Toro will never be Bryan Singer or Sam Raimi. There are very few films I have absolutely hated; Daredevil and The Punisher were two of them, but I rank them higher than HELLBOY. Do yourself a favour and don't go see it. Save your money. Really."

","In 1944, an allied troop rescues a baby-demon from the nazis. The demon, called Hellboy (Ron Perlman), is raised by a secret department of FBI to fight against evil forces. The opening screening of `Hellboy' in the movie theaters of Rio de Janeiro was on last 30 July 2004, but I rented an imported DVD. This is another hero from American comics completely unknown in Brazil brought to the screen. However, `Hellboy' is a great adventure, with lots of special effects and many funny situations. An excellent entertainment for the whole family. The character of Liz (Selma Blair) recalls the X-Men. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `Hellboy'"

Until now, that is.  Geeze, a 7.0 overall average score?  Comments that suggest this is Spiderman-like quality? Ugh.<br/><br/>Look folks.  This is a bad film.  Is Hollywood churning out such utter garbage that when something even marginally mediocre comes out, it gets praise?  Stop and think for a minute!  Was the zombie/skeleton that Hellboy pulled out of a grave what you would call quality special effects?  That had to be the worst, most retro, ghetto special effects I've seen in years. And did you honestly care about any of these characters?  They each get 20 lines to speak before they're killed off.  I felt sorry for none of them -- they were so obviously props for an action film that it was like watching a Star Trek episode populated almost exclusively by red shirts.<br/><br/>And did you really feel that the ending was tension-filled or even difficult for Hellboy?  It lasted, what, maybe 2 minutes?  He detonates some grenades and it's over?  That's it?  And the dialogue!  Hellboy's last few lines were so hokey that half the theater burst out laughing.

","I couldn't take my eyes off of ""Hellboy"" throughout the entire movie. The visual effects are just so striking. The plot is another throwaway good-vs-evil thing with one cast of misfits saving the world (or, in this case, ""The Universe"") from another. I think it's also trying to be say something about fate vs. free will or something along those lines, but anything it has to say in this regard wouldn't even rate a ""C"" in a freshman college writing or philosophy class. At core, it's story-telling as it's been done since the beginning of time-- good guys fighting bad guys. Why do bad guys exist? What's the nature of good? What's the nature of evil? So on and so forth. None of this matters for this film.It's pure popcorn entertainment with unusual, flawless, and spectacular special effects. ""Hellboy"" is intended to fully arouse your limbic system, while your pre-frontal cortex slumbers. Don't watch it if this isn't your kind of thing, because it's no more than exactly what it promises to be. As long as you know go in with the proper expectations (simply watch the trailer), you shouldn't be disappointed."

","Hellboy (2004) Original DVD Release<br/><br/>If only digging out an old standard DVD was as nostalgic and as warming as putting on an old vinyl record.
There's something special about an LP. The sound is distinctive and charismatic unlike the digital cleanliness of a Compact disc.
So what about Hellboy on original region 2 DVD release?
Having heard the news that Hellboy has gotten a reboot and not to too many positive reviews I decided to save my hard earned cash and skip a visit to my local multiplex.
Instead I dug out my dusty old copy of Guillermo del Toro's 2004 adaptation of the comic book hero.
Starring Ron Pearlman in the lead role as a demon raised from infancy by humans to help fight the supernatural.
Del Toro's film like those LP's is full of charisma and warmth.
It's a splendid comic book adaptation brimming with fantastic performances, stellar special effects and a script packed with charm and wit.
Ron Pearlman is fantastic as Hellboy, he brings both a heartfelt performance of a person who can't fit in with the world he so gallantly protects. At the same time he brings cocksure humour. Almost Dirty Harry like in his persona.
John Hurt is as magnificent as ever as is Doug Jones as aquatic creature Abe Sapien.
Selma Blair provides a believable relationship with Hellboy and the audience will root for their romance due to the chemistry between the two actors.
This is movie making done right. All elements coming together to deliver a quality final product.
Special effects particularly practical are exemplary.
Creature design and puppetry are very believable.
The corpse Hellboy carries around in the graveyard being an hilarious example.
All in all for a film made fifteen years ago the new Hellboy (2019) looks to be lacking in comparison.
The SFX in the trailers looked rather shoddy but I'm yet to see the actual movie so I'll reserve judgment.<br/><br/>I have never taken the chance to upgrade Hellboy (2004) to Blu-ray and to be honest until the news of the reboot I'd completely forgotten how excellent this movie is!
If ever a film deserved the 4K treatment then this is it.
High Dynamic Range would do this film justice and allow Del Toro's style of film making to burst from the screen.
He is a director known for using a bold colour palette.
Hellboy is no exception.
Wanting to experience this movie the best that standard 576p could offer I adjusted my TV to fake HDR and was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.
Colours popped in most scenes. Inside Bruttenholm's study was a real stand out. Amber glow and the cool blue hues of Abe Sapiens tank were quite impressive.
Ok I was never going to replicate true HDR
but my point is that Del Toro's film was a splendid transfer even on this basic format. The modern technology of a 4K
television can help do wonders for this old DVD.
The graveyard scene in the snow demonstrated excellent contrast and vibrancy. This even by today's UHD standards is a good looking movie.
Please please please release a 4K transfer!
But in comparison to vinyl that I made earlier this old DVD copy has its own charm.
The now slightly dated effects are helped by the softer resolution.
In some scenes the CGI, particularly Hellboy's stone hand looked a little suspect. 4K would only accentuate the flaws.
I think it is HDR where this film will benefit the most. We need a redder Hellboy!
All the wonderful colours and tones that Del Toro paints across the screen would be given added vigour.<br/><br/>What about sound quality I here you ask?
Hellboy (2004) has an impressive sound mix.
I fondly remember purchasing this DVD and being bowled over by the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix.
This was one of my demo discs that I would use to tweak my old system.
Now a standard Home Cinema sound format the 5.1 mix still has punch.
The chapter in the library where Hellboy tries to take out the monster he likes to call Stinky.
This was a scene I would use to tinker with my Subwoofer.
Even now there's a delicious thud to the bass and this mix bravely tries to stand up against more impressive formats such as Atmos and the likes.
There's an impressive sound stage and a good use of sound placement.
Those rear speakers have plenty to do. Upmixing the 5.1 mix to DTS Neural X gave good atmospherics but there was never any real placement up top.
Yet again a 4K Blu-ray would no doubt come with an Atmos track and we'd hear this movie like never before.<br/><br/>So in reflection Hellboy (2004) is a magnificent film and one of the best standard DVD transfers of its time.
Bring out that 4K HDR BLU-RAY! Pretty please!"

","I actually saw the sequel The Golden Army first and remember the sequel to be the best thing ever happened at the time and watch it again...and again so now I'm still think the sequel is better but the original HellBoy is also very good.Ron Perlman no doubt the best actor for the role of HellBoy when he bring so much charisma to a character at first I think just a force of destruction much like The Hulk and in many way he is but he so likable and fun when he express his jealousy over his new caretaker or how despite how big and old he is he still calm down when people pull out a Baby Ruth bar.Guillermo del Toro definitely got a clear visionary when he making HellBoy cause not only the character,the monster and the scenery designs look cool but the movie obviously not trying to play safe cause it a PG-13 movie alright but it very dark with the story and villian like Karl Ruprecht Kroenen feel like he belong to a hard R horror movie"
"neazy","5","1","2","21 March 2018"," Fails to deliver
","Hellboy's initial act sets you up for a wild ride, and promises much in its first half. The characters are interesting, the story has potential, and the concept of the film is engaging. Unfortunately, it loses its impetus more and more the further it goes, and while it remains visually interesting, it becomes hammy, lumbering and predictable.
I think it suffers from the lack of a really fine villain. Kroenen simply isn't menacing enough - he is a curiosity, but his lack of humanity actually lets him down as an antagonistic presence, and his death is a bit underwhelming considering his previous resurrections. Rasputin is well played, but he is a little too much in the background. We know he's there, but the fact of that almost makes it uninteresting, since there is no relationship between him and Hellboy of Broom - things which might have been interesting to explore - and so he can almost be forgotten until his inevitable return. The Lovecraftian gods, similarly, are not given enough mythical weight to act as anything other than a vaguely unpleasant looking threat. You feel the man himself would have conveyed the horror far better.
It is a shame - whilst Hellboy never gives any indication of being a masterpiece, it could have been a solidly enjoyable film, but the way the story wraps up feels somehow hurried, or, as it certainly doesn't feel too short, perhaps simply clumsy, as if the writers got tired of it. There are also a number of irritating loose ends. The action set pieces are pretty good, although nothing new really emerges as the film goes on, meaning that by the climax it has lost some of its edge. The film's best feature is certainly its lead, who looks, sounds, and absolutely acts the part, though all the performances - particularly John Hurt and Doug Jones - are excellent. It's a shame the story ultimately leaves them fighting a losing battle."
"g-bodyl","9","1","2","16 October 2008"," A Good Fantasy Film!
","Hellboy is a good fantasy film. I like this for various reasons. One of my reasons is that Guillermo Del Toro blends history/reality with fantasy really well. When the movie was focused on the Nazis, they had the correct facts plus magic elements added in the storyline. Basically, the story is about a character on Earth from another dimension facing two battles: evil creatures from his dimension and love. I liked the character's personalities. Hellboy is laidback and tell jokes while fighting and Liz is just calm and collected except when in immediate danger. The acting is fairly good. I enjoyed the characters. The visuals are exceptional as it is usually with Del Toro's film. The music is better, different than usual superhero movies. The only thing negative is that it may be confusing at some points. Overall, a great action/fantasy movie. I rate this movie 9/10."
"mrusty5","10","1","2","11 September 2008"," One of the best films I've seen.
","I've watched a lot of films based on comics - the X-Men trilogy, the Spider-Man trilogy, Fantastic Four and its sequel, Iron Man, Hulk, Daredevil, the Batman films and Superman Returns. I had heard of Hellboy and watched the trailer, however, I wasn't sure on watching it. However, my sister bought it and I watched the DVD - and I loved it to pieces.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story starts off with a bunch of American troops in Scotland during the final years of World War II. Among them is Professor Bruttenholm (pronouched as ""Broom""), a paranormalist and adviser to President Roosevelt. The soldiers come across a bunch of Nazis who are using a machine to open a portal to another dimension and unleash the Seven Gods of Chaos to win the war and conquer the world. However, the soldiers interfere and stop the Nazis, their leader Rasputin (the Russian nutcase who helped kill the Zsar of Russia and his family) being sucked into the portal and vanishing. However, a small red monkey-like child with a large hand made of rock comes out and becomes the ""son"" of Bruttenholm, named Hellboy.<br/><br/>Many years on Hellboy is the protector of mankind, battling monsters and supernatural things (like a cross between Batman and Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Hellboy lives in the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defence, sort of a Men in Black-like sercet organization except they fight monsters instead of aliens. Hellboy lives with Abe Sapien, a blue-skinned aquatic fish guy who likes eating rotten eggs. Hellboy is also infatuated with a pyrokinetic woman named Liz Shaw who has trouble controlling her flames, often causing explosive infernos. Bruttenholm is in charge of the BPRD, covered up by FBI director Tom Manning who dislikes the weird team members. The BPRD is joined by John Myers, the most boring and unemotional drip in existence.<br/><br/>Anyway, Hellboy, Abe, Myers and Liz find themselves fighting against Rasputin, still alive but now a lot more demonic (his veins squirm about in his head and hands), his girlfriend who wields a sledgehammer, and Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, a kickass villain who wears a gas mask and fights with a pair of spinning blades. The three intend on using Hellboy to open some sort of gate and allowing a monstrous tentacled demon to take over Earth. They also unleash Samiel the Desolate One, a demonic reptile with dreadlocks who can reproduce once he is killed. The BPRD fight against the villains with amazing CGI effects (although sometimes everything is done physically without a single sign of computer graphics), cool fight scenes and Hellboy making jokes at every opportunity.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film mainly because it is the first real dark comic book film I've seen. Hellboy is a different kind of superhero. Heroes like Spider-Man, Superman and the X-Men do not mess about with an enemy and are a bit more concerned just trying to defeat an enemy as quick as possible. Hellboy instead takes his time, cracking jokes and being rather laidback. Plus he has a big gun, which adds to his awesomeness. The characters of Liz and Abe are very entertaining, plus Bruttenholm and Manning's presence adds an extra touch of greatness to the film. However, I dislike the presence of Myers. He doesn't really do much in the film, stands around looking miserable and blank-minded and has too much screen time looking blank and miserable.<br/><br/>As for the villains, I find Rasputin to be creepy but really interesting. I prefer the animated version from Anastasia. His sledgehammer-wielding girlfriend doesn't really do much either. But the person to steals the show is perhaps the coolest villain ever to appear on the big screen (except possibly Darth Vader): Kroenen. Kroenen is a silent Nazi officer who wears a gas mask over his head, wields a pair of spinning blades, can do impossible things, and has a severe mental issue in which he has surgically removed his eyelids and lips, making him look quite a fright when he is seen without his armour in one seen. Everything about him is brilliant and he has become one of my favourite antagonists of all time.<br/><br/>Seriously, I recommend this film to anyone who likes superhero films, dark films or anything made by Guillermo de Toro. Hellboy is a masterpiece."
"thefinisher_23","8","1","2","26 July 2008"," A good, solid start
","I found Hellboy to be a worthy first entry in its' ever-growing series. The commercial success of this film led director Guillermo Del Toro to make Pan's Labyrinth so it also serves as kind of coming out party for such a stellar film-maker. The film runs kind of like a moody, dark, and disarming tale of MIB only were dealing with monsters as opposed to aliens. The real reason this film works is because of its' cast. Ron Perlman is utterly awesome as Hellboy as a someone is truly angered and dealing with a never-ending identity crisis. Selma Blair is kind of simple, but shows her character as one who knows she's vulnerable and scarred and confused as to how she can help the team and Hellboy the man...yes he ACTS like a man...she cares so much for. The action is solid and you can clearly see Del Toro's visuals in almost every scene. I found the scenes in Russia to be breathtaking. The storytelling is thin but the fact that the villains are Nazi's helps because no matter what you always hate them. The plot also seems a predictable bore at times but you don't really notice which is a testament to the cast and Del Toro. All in all this a good movie and a stellar comic-book movie with fantastic driven performances, stunning visuals, solid action and a disarming sense of humor. This mildly-flawed but superbly entertaining picture means a lot to its' genre it's director and it's own ever-improving series. Like I said a good start."
"jaredmobarak","7","1","2","10 July 2008"," She took his picture ¬Ö Hellboy
","You gotta love Guillermo del Toro. The man knows how to play the system, staggering his Spanish language tales of wonderment with the oft-Hollywood big-budget action flick. The beauty of it is, however, that del Toro never compromises his vision when tackling a comic book adaptation. Looking at a film like Blade II shows that he carries his style with him wherever he goes, improving on a pretty solid first installment and showing that he can handle the work. That film helped land him the duties of helming Hellboy¬óI'm sure¬óa film with flair, humor, action, and style. Anyone else could have phoned a film like this in for the paycheck, biding time until his next passion project came down the pipeline, but with del Toro, this adaptation was just as important in his oeuvre as any other, and it shows.<br/><br/>With an almost perfect mix of exposition, character development, and plot, this tale of a demon coming to Earth from a portal to Hell, only to be raised by a scientist into the ultimate fighter against evil, fires on all cylinders. Concise in its origin¬ónot quite a flashback since it's the first thing we see¬ówe learn where the titular character comes from, who brings him here, and for what purpose. This is the all-encompassing larger plot line that will inevitably be carried on throughout the series, a demon fighting for good against the powers that spawned him. The ultimate cautionary tale of nature vs. nurture, Hellboy may be sarcastic, cranky, and abrasive, but he knows his role and revels in the fact that he saves lives on a daily basis. I always seem to connect more with the heroes that don't necessarily have powers. True he does, but only those abilities common to his kind. He is a demon and thus does demon things, much like Superman who is Kryptonian, (he doesn't have superhuman abilities, he isn't human), and Batman, who uses inventions and skill to battle villainy. These heroes use what God gave them and nothing else; no mutations or radiations make them different, life does, and they are doing the best they can, attempting to assimilate and be seen as normal.<br/><br/>What really works here is the way that character relationships are developed as the plot continues on. Rather than everyone have a set bond that we must become privy to, they all kind of start apart from one another. Hellboy and his father Prof. Broom are at odds, he and his friend Liz are separated by a sanitarium, Abe Sapien is detached by his glass water tank, and newcomer John Myers has only just met them all. Connections are repaired and newly created before our eyes while the fights rage on. It is the fieldwork by this secretive government group against evil that brings them all together. Unfortunately, as a result, this also means that the plot to save Earth is a tad undercooked. Sure the action scenes are great, especially involving our Nazi timeclock, knife-welding friend, but the overall story really just shows whether Hellboy will stay good or go to the dark side. The only true peril Earth faces is in the off-chance he decides to follow his destiny as ruler of our dimension, a simple no could pretty much quash all the trouble faced here. But this was always to be the first of at least a trilogy, setting up motivations and tone, and for that you can't fault the film one iota.<br/><br/>To complement it all is some fine acting from the large cast. John Hurt has made a living in his later life playing the sage mentors and he does so again here; Selma Blair stays true to her filmography as well playing the troubled youth trying to find herself while also helping her friends discover themselves; and Jeffrey Tambor adds wonderful jabs of wit and humor every time he graces the screen. Even Karel Roden as the evil Rasputin continues in the type of villainy he is recognized for. A stalwart at playing the stone-faced maniac, he is truly terrifying as he just carries on, back from the dead after 50 years, as though it's the next day and another opportunity to make Herr Hitler proud. The true star, though, is unquestionably Ron Perlman as our red hero. He excels at the sardonic rhetoric, chomping on his cigar as he cuts down those around him with words. A truly troubled soul, Perlman has full range of his facial features under the massive amount of makeup and portrays every emotion needed to realize the role. Credit the filmmakers for utilizing costumes that never hindered any performances.<br/><br/>And one couldn't end without talking of del Toro's vision. Straight off we are graced with a vortex opening out into space and the Seven Gods of Hell awaiting their rebirth. The Sammael creatures are well-fleshed out, and the multitudes of squid-like monsters also. The art direction is superb with only a couple blemishes of illusion showing through, (Hellboy's crunching of a Red Bull can and numerous instances of bodies being thrown about, among others). It is with the fire from Blair's character that I was most impressed with. The blue flames encompassing her entire body and all that surrounds her was very realistic and cool to boot. Just viewing the trailers for the sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army shows that del Toro has upped the ante on fantastical beings. I can't wait to see what happens now that we can delve into the story from start to finish and check out whether the world can be saved from outside forces rather than the fragile psyche of our hero, although I'm sure that will play into it as well."

","Hellboy is about a demon who works for the FBI. The plot is generic, bad guys want to unleash Armageddon, good guys must stop them. But what this movie lacks in originality it makes up for in every other department..<br/><br/>Hellboy is genuinely fun and Guillermo Del Toro's eye for good composition makes a movie about a hideous brute, actually very beautiful. The action is well paced; the characters are shallow yet eccentric and interesting. One of my main problems with similar comic book movies is how the makers swamp the screen with enough CGI to sink the Titanic, and throw action sequences at the audience in the hope that some may stick in the mind of Joe Cinema-goer for longer than half a minute. Hellboy didn't have the uber-budget of a Spiderman (a franchise that bores me beyond belief) but Del Toro spent his pennies wisely and all the CGI effects are effective, seamless and limitedly spectacular.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is excellent as Hellboy; his presence enriches the hero with a sense and genuine power and subtle, childlike wit. There are not many layers to the characters for the viewer to slowly unravel, each character plays to type (the scientist, love interest, annoying boss and so on) but the supporting cast all perform admirably. John Hurt helps the story progress with a fair amount of exposition and Jeffery Tambor is funny-bordering-on-hilarious as Hellboy's insecure and incompetent boss. Also David Hyde Pierce of 'Frasier' fame is perfectly cast as a clairvoyant talking fish.<br/><br/>The bad guys are a sight to behold; Rasputin is menacing but underutilised, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen (aka the gas mask wearing, knife wielding, gimp) is a grotesque creation and perfectly re-created from the rich source material of the comics.<br/><br/>Overall, Hellboy is a smaller movie than its peers, and it's all the better for it"

","From director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth), this is another not too bad comic book based hero brought to the screen. The film begins in 1944, during World War II, and the Nazi Germans are researching the occult, and the villain Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) has spent 5 years building an huge portal machine which he intends to use to bring out a monstrous God of Chaos. When Rasputin eventually dies from using too much of his power, the machine (activated) shoots out a creature of the world intended, a red devil looking creature, and researcher Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm (John Hurt) is determined to raise ""Hellboy"" to do good. Sixty years later, Broom is dying of old age, and FBI agent John Myers (Rupert Evans) is sent to pretty much help him, and his two legendary friends, obviously Hellboy (Alien: Resurrection's Ron Perlman) and aquatic creature Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). They are defending the city, battling crooks through alleys, streets and subways, while trying also to protect friends, including Hellboy's love interest Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), who is learning to control her power of making fire from her body. Eventually, Rasputin returns from his grave, and threatens the city with his many ugly and almost indestructible creatures. Also starring Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning.

","When I first heard that Hellboy was coming out, I had also heard it was being made by the same guy who made Blade 2. I was a little less than enthused about seeing Hellboy. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>After seeing the previews and hearing about how this was a comic book based movie from one of my co-workers, I was a little more interested. Unfortunately, I had never heard of this particular comic, but I am always up for seeing a new comic book based movie. Then it probably helped that it had a few ""names"" in the cast list too.<br/><br/>Then I saw the actual movie. The story was a little weird at first, but keeping in mind it was a comic book, it was easy to maintain that sense of the story. The story was entertaining, the action scenes were good, the occasional comic relief mainly in one scene in particular was cute too. Overall, it was really good. My only complaint would be that he special effects were decent, but not spectacular.<br/><br/>Since I have never read the comic for this series, I don;t know how true to the story it was, but as a movie, I thought it was pretty good. I'd recommend this movie if you have already seen the bigger budget Spiderman, X-Men and Superman movies and you are looking for something fresh."

","First off, Ron Perlman is Hellboy. It's like he was born for this role. Heck, if Hellboy were real, he'd look like Ron! Notable performances by John Hurt, and the characters of Abe Sapien and Rasputin, also contribute to the pleasure of watching this flick. Biggest disappointment? Selma Blair. I thought this would be her chance to show that she can play a character with depth, but she blew it. Whenever she's in a scene, it gets boring. Especially her scenes with Myers.<br/><br/>The action sequences are great, and the script is superb. I mean, there was never a feel of cheese in the lines, which usually happens in comic books movies. Another cool factor is Rasputin's assassin, the Nazi freak. I just wish they would have explored his character more, given him a little more background in form of flashbacks. But it wouldn't have been too significant anyway.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" makes you wanna see more. Luckily for us fans, the sequel will be out by next year. I give ""Hellboy"" a hell yeah!"

","I am not one for the comic book hero movies and I caught Hellboy by accident on HBO. But this movie is superbly stylized, rich in character and Ron Perlman is totally flawless as Hellboy.<br/><br/>it's an offbeat movie from a comic book I had never heard of but it worked well. The sets work well as does the CGI but it is Ron Perlmans delivery of the dialog that makes his character convincing. Alas it did not do that well at the box office, but I think it might do well on DVD for the collector's or connoisseurs. The only thing I can say what would most of the movie and literary industry do if there hadn't been any Nazis!"

","Now, i had my concerns with this movie. Basically, it was because Guillermo Dell Torro was directing. It's not like i don't like his films or anything like that, but 'Mimic' was average at best, in my honest opinion. My friend, however, was raving about this film. I couldn't actually understand the reasons for his thrill, because i thought this movie would also be a 'so so' flick, like 'Mimic'. After seeing the trailer, my expectations for this movie grew just a little bit, but i still had my doubts. When it came out, me and my friend went to the premiere. To be honest, this movie lived beyond my expectations. Ron Pearlman does an amazing job carrying the heavy look of Hellboy, although in some scenes he looks pretty clumsy, if you ask me. But overall, he couldn't have done it better. I'm always happy to see John Hurt in a movie, no matter what movie it is. And this one was no exception. Love his strong British accent, his solid actor play and the way he manages to it in any role given to him. But what really amazes me is Del Torro's determination to have Pearlman for the role of Hellboy. I heard the studio wanted actors like The Rock or Vin Deasel(actor?). But Del Torro remained strong with his choice. This led to decrease in the films budget - from 80 000 000$ to 60 000 000$. And Del Torro didn't even care as long as he got Mr. Pearlman for the leading role. This kind of determination is what i would like to see in every Hollywood director. And i think the budget slip didn't even effect the films quality. I don't think those 20 000 000$ would have made a difference. All in all, this is an amazing film. At least for comic book adaptation."

The thing is that if they had made this more dark it could have been really awesome, but now it just missed something. Furtermore there was a part in the movie that really irritated me cause of the bad stunt. There is a point where Hellboy first encounters one of the monsters and chases it across town. Just when it enters the city you see Hellboy jumping over falling rocks. Here you can see him being lifted up so well that it really messed up the shot.<br/><br/>I didn't have high expectations for this movie and they lived up to them..."

","I was totally unknown to this comic book character. When I saw this movie I was swept away by it's tone. It remembered those 90's when I first saw Batman.<br/><br/>Hellboy (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>Based on the comic book series by Mike Mignola, legendary director Guillermo del Toro brings the tale of an usual demon named Hellboy. Del Toro who was famous for his movies like Mimic, Blade 2 takes a new turn in his carrier by following the supernatural adventures of Hellboy (Ron Perlman), a cigar-chomping, horn-filing demonic hero who enlisted to fight evil under the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. It's an undercover government organization where freaks with special powers are raised to fight for good causes.<br/><br/>One such freakish character is Hellboy, a mammoth with horns who was bred by Nazis to unleash evil upon the planet. But under the care of the father-like leader Trevor Bruttenholm, Hellboy is resists attempts to lure him back to the dark side and fights on the behalf of an oblivious society.<br/><br/>But the question is how long? A great movie from the Revolution studios. Scripted by Guillermo del Toro for the story of Peter Briggs and himself, makes the most successful transformation from pulp page to big screen since Tim Burton's Batman in 1989. The story was well written and the way it was treated in the cinematic means was excellent. All credits goes to Guillermo del Toro. It is the best movie from him.<br/><br/>Emotions, narrations, actions, the creativity all are in the perfect balance. Ron Perlman as Hellboy might be the best casting ever of a superhero...he's cooler than the movie. I recall when I found that he was playing Hellboy I thought, what the hell an aged Grandpa doing a superhero action role..it SUCKS! But my thoughts were blown away by his Performance. Wow a great work.<br/><br/>He was born to play Hellboy. He makes me to say he is the Mega, excellent actor than a superstar. His grittiness, rough humor, attitudes, sadness make that character unique. Also I was moved by the mannerisms of Doug Jones as Abe Sapien, also his voiced actor Mr. David Hyde Pierce. It was a stunning visual when Abe was under water.<br/><br/>Both the principal photography and post production teams done a great work in this movie. The creatures, explosions, sceneries were so real in both fast cutting and in close up shots. They build the perfect tone for this movie.<br/><br/>Also the soul of the movie was created masterfully by Marco Beltrami. He injects the mood with his largely orchestral and choral cues that builds up the substantial base. No questions with out that score Hellboy could be a lame chapter. Guillermo del Toro makes the right decision by reuniting with Marco Beltrami. It was his greatest score compared to his early works.<br/><br/>All in all it is a great movie with some touching scenes. My favorite scenes are Hellboy's last look on his father's funeral in the rain, were it's difficult to see whether it was his tears or the rain drops from his eyes. Also the marvelous ending scene with the narration and the eye popping opening credit (""Mr.Karin Fong I loved that opening title, you are the best in title designing"").<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10!<br/><br/>Hellboy=OH, BOY!"

","With all the hype of turning comic book heroes into big screen heroes, one would assume that the majority of these movies would be, at the very least, decent. However, this is not the case. In fact, other than X-Men and LXG, I can't think of any other spectacular comic book movies. Spiderman and Hulk were total letdowns, as were the sequels to Blade and The Matrix. Daredevil was decent, but Ben Affleck really gave that one its suck factor. Well, movie goers, never fear because Hellboy is here. From Guillermo del Toro, the director of the terrible Blade II, comes the greatest comic book movie since X2. This movie has the one thing that the majority of the other comic book movies lack -- action! It also has another element missing from most comic book movies -- a storyline. The first fifteen minutes or so tell you the story of how Hellboy came to exist. That's it...fifteen minutes. Not thirty or forty like other comic book movies have done -- Spiderman, Hulk, Matrix. Fifteen minutes and you know all you need to know about how Hellboy came to be. After that, it's all action. Ron Perlman does a spectacular job portraying the lead role, and the supporting cast does a wonderful job of backing him up. This is a great movie. <br/><br/>9*"

","The trailer for Hellboy didn't set my pulse raising. I rejected it as rubbish before I'd even given it a chance. But when I went out with some friends and ended up seeing the film, I got a rather pleasant surprise: Hellboy actually has something to it. Red is quite a character, and in a weird, simple way he's very charming - more so, at least, than some of the dire action heroes we see around. The plot has drive, if it does occasionally stagger, and there is a supporting cast strong enough to be at least vaguely memorable. I've heard a lot of people moan about the dialogue, and true, it is often uninspired, but it certainly beats the Matrix Reloaded: 'No.' 'Why?' 'The problem is the choice.' That is to say, I didn't expect much more from this, but from The Matrix Reloaded I expected far more.<br/><br/>If for no other reason, you should see Hellboy because it's damned exciting! With this kind of film, that's what matters. Hellboy fits the bill and if you've ever liked this sort of thing, you'll like Hellboy too. 7 out of 10."

"supertom-3","8","1","2","16 September 2004"," Great comic book movie, Ron Perlman is the man!!
","The latest comic book to be transferred on to the big screen is Mike Mignola's cult series, Hellboy. Hellboy is the son of Satan who found his way to earth in 1944, when Nazi's by the order of Adolf, decided they would try and win the war by opening the gateway to hell. Hellboy slipped through and was taken into care by the Allied army's paranormal specialist played by John Hurt. With the Nazi's having been foiled in a brilliant opening scene set in wartime Scotland, we flash forward to present times and Hellboy is now a fully grown beast working for the FBI in a special unit that battles all manner of devilish demons. Hellboy is the main government assassin against these freaks of nature. Alongside him is his father (Hurt) and mer-man Abe Sapien, a strange creature who can read minds and see into the past and future. There is also Hellboys love interest played by Selma Blair, who has the distinct gift of bursting into flames whenever she gets angry or upset (thank god all women don't do that otherwise that time of the month would be hell). <br/><br/>The films source material is much like that of the Crow, and the Blade series. It is real cult material and few will have an assumed knowledge of it and the few that do will probably know it inside and out. It is probably the sort of comic that doesn't have casual readers like many of Marvels favourite heroes. It is far darker material. Despite a dark theme and dark material this film isn't excessively dark like the Crow was and Blade. They have done it out so that visually it is fantastic and dark but this was only a pg-13 in America and a 12A in the UK and as such it isn't massively violent and they have lightened the tone a fair bit with plenty of humour. In some ways I would have enjoyed more grit and edge, an R rated version but it still works very well. What helps here is that director Guillermo Del Toro is probably the biggest Hellboy geek on the planet by his own admission and his passion ensures that fans will be satisfied. I don't know how faithful it is personally but I have seen artwork and visually the have got Hellboy spot on. By all accounts though, the geek-boys loved it. Del Toro is a great visual director as he proved in Cronos and also Blade 2 but this film looks amazing. From dark and grimy rain soaked locales, to snow covered, to a fiery hot, burning post apocalyptic vision of the future. All the sets are great as are the effects. <br/><br/>Del Torro is no stranger to cult movies as I mentioned before with Cronos and the second Blade film and in each of those films and this too, there is a recurring element, Ron Perlman. He's a master of cult movies having worked with Del Torro several times and also appearing in cult French fantasy City Of The Lost Children. Perlman is one of those recognisable faces you see in a lot of movies and it's a shame is not more well known. He has a strange cult following who like the guy. Perlman is certainly capable as an action man, he has the build and is very tall but what has held him back is his looks. He doesn't look like hero material, he's not particularly photogenic and that is proved by the very fact that his full 4 hour Hellboy make up is actually a marked improvement. The part that is tragic is that he is a good character actor, he has charisma and is cool. I think that Hellboy gives him a potential long series of films to turn him into a star and make him more popular but the fact of the matter is, he will never sell a movie by his name. He has gone from big budget Hellboy and his next movie is a $2 million, more than likely DTV, action film. Hellboy wasn't a massive box office hit, due to it being very cult material and having no star name, but it was a critical success and has done well on the video shelves so hopefully a sequel will come, by all sources involved it seems possible, and the appeal can only increase for another film. Let's face who imagined it would be a really good movie, not many. I would have been satisfied if it had matched the Blade films but it beats them. Perlman is superb in this film, he rocks. He has come form nowhere really to the majority of the general movie going public and has been a revelation, it is his most high profile role and film. John Hurt is also good in a brief role and also Selma Blair is good too.<br/><br/>The action kicks bum. Del Torro crafts some wonderful set pieces and the film has good effects, particularly for a film with a fairly modest budget for a summer action movie. The whole look of the film is striking and there is a great attention to detail. Marco Beltrami also provides a marvelous score. The only minor quibbles are that certain elements are not fully explained. How the Nazi characters don't age for example and also the backgrounds to some of the supporting characters. For a summer movie that has such a brisk pace the plot-holes don't affect it too much. Overall this is a very good and entertaining summer movie with some character. Perlman is superb and Del Torro's stubbornness in holding out for Perlman and agreeing with the studio to drop the budget to have him in, was inspired. It was certainly a risk but you cannot put a price on good casting. The studio wanted the then, flavour of the month Vin Diesel and although I like him he would not have nailed the role as perfectly as Ron Perlman. ****"

Well, OK, it's been done already -- that was LXG, which has a lot in common with Hellboy --  semi-supernatural characters loosely dragged out of literature who haven't died for a very long time, but do at the end of this film if they're bad; an ancient professor played by a British actor; highly capable mechanical contraptions run by highly antiquated clockwork ... you get the idea. The ""unique"" feature of this film is that the characters are lifted from vaguely religious literary sources, but that's only slightly relevant to the plot. [end spoilers] It's really a bunch of special-effects-filled nonsense, but I just sat back and enjoyed the effects and the visual imagery, which was occasionally impressive -- I liked the overhead umbrellas shot. <br/><br/>And as for cross-breeding films -- how about ""Hellboy meets Tomb Raider"" for a sequel?"

John Hurt too is fittingly OTT as Hellboy's mentor.<br/><br/>There is also an amusing romantic subplot which will keep you entertained although it's hardly Casablanca. An action movie sharp in dialogue but decidedly blunt in story is nevertheless an enjoyable ride, just so long as you don't expect too much."

He also successfully humanizes him which is an incredible feat considering the character's appearance.  The chemistry between Selma Blair and Perlman was surprisingly very convincing. This may get a little scary for a smaller child but it is rated PG-13. The movie can tend to make you feel like it is wondering a little bit b/c the premise is so bizarre but del Toro ties up all the loose ends with a rewarding ending and makes you wonder when Hellboy 2 will come out.

No subplots besides the love story between Hellboy and Liz. It was a decent subplot, besides Ron Pearlman, and some really cool looking characters, the movie does not remind me of anything other than Men in Black 2. Just plain and corny looking Monsters, and a boring Plot. Great visuals...I loved the Character Hellboy, there is a very human side to him, almost like an ordinary Joe. He was cool and down to earth, and even though the movie was corny at times (only Marvel comic book movies are realistic, in the sense that they make you believe ...(for example)that a science experiment can change you can't it? but as far as Nazi's opening up Portholes and bringing in Demonic creatures from hell? Thats a little too campy. So I guess the unique cool looking characters and their personalities allow the movie to get the well deserving high 6's rating. but anything over a 7 would not be right...its a little above average, and it entertained me for 2 hours, but it's no where on the same level as the x-men films, or even spiderman. **1/2 stars out of ****"

Given my druthers, I'd like this review to be a simple five word sentence: ""It put me to sleep."", but IMDB guidelines force me to go on.

If I'd never seen one before, Hellboy would probably be a favorite. But, as I've seen many, there wasn't a single thing in Hellboy to keep my interest. Not in the plot, not in the dialogue, and not in the details (except for one of the villains, who had a cool ability, that the film makers than ruinned by completely circumventing it). If you've seen both Men In Black movies, then you already know the full plot arch of this film, as well as many of the details.

"pyromega879","Null","1","2","8 April 2004"," Hellboy fun to look at, but not a lot else
","Guillermo del Toro has made good films before.  He helmed Blade II, an exhilarating, gothic, action-packed sequel to the surprisingly stylish original, and showed that he had a flare for directing `comic book' movies. Some of this flare can be seen in certain frames of Hellboy, where we get the feeling that we could freeze any particular frame and insert it directly into one of the original comics and it would blend right in with the rest of the images.  Unfortunately, this visual aspect is really the only noteworthy aspect of Hellboy.<br/><br/>Based on a comic, the movie follows the fairly cheesy activities of Hellboy, a demon brought into the world through a portal constructed by Rasputin and the Nazis to wreak havoc on the Earth, who was taken and raised for good by the Department for Paranormal Research and Defense after the Nazi's plan was foiled by US troops.  Right..<br/><br/>Anyway, surprisingly this kind of ridiculous camp quality is not necessarily where the movie has its downfall.  There's a lot of fun to be had if del Toro could just find a happy medium between Men in Black type intentional cheesiness, and some of the style he harnessed with Blade II. True, the movie recognizes its own goofiness and tries to use that to its full effect, making us roll our eyes and laugh quite often, but there's no control behind it.  Del Toro seems to have just told everybody to go hog-wild on the cheesy fun and forgotten that he was making a movie in the process.<br/><br/>The result is that after about a half-hour we get tired of the intentionally lame one-liners, the over-the-top monsters, and the annoying, scholarly fish-man (aptly named Abraham Sapien), and our concentration drifts to all the things to not like in the film.<br/><br/>Allow me to illustrate.  Selma Blair plays Hellboy's troubled love interest, a girl who is able to start fires with her mind, but is unable to control exactly when this happens.  Luckily, Hellboy happens to be immune to fire.<br/><br/>But then Hellboy really seems to be a movie full of immunities.  Like when a monster he fights repeatedly (to the point where we are begging to see something different) begins laying eggs in the sewers and spawning more of itself at random for no real apparent reason other than to provide us with another sewer scene reminiscent of Blade II, without any of the tension, visual ferocity, or stylization.  Apparently Hellboy is also immune to gaping plot holes.<br/><br/>Then there's when the Nazis come back onto the scene with a resurrected Rasputin in tow and attempt to pass themselves off as characters in the final acts, desperately trying to rush out some sort of a plotting conflict involving Hellboy opening up a portal to the netherworld.by this point I was crying.  However, it's when a portal opens up, seemingly from the moon, and a giant squid-like creature comes down to Earth (maybe to save us from the rest of this movie?) that we finally see Hellboy's true fighting capabilities as he straps explosives onto his body, allows the uber-squid to eat him, and detonates the explosives from inside the squid's stomach, propelling him unscathed amid a scatter-storm of tentacles and special effects.  So among other things, Hellboy must also be immune to monsters' digestive systems, earth-shattering explosions, and the schemes of one-dimensional villains.<br/><br/>Now I'm ripping on this movie pretty hard, maybe harder than it deserves.  After all, the preposterousness is the point, and there are plenty of entertaining moments throughout (like Hellboy's love for baby kittens, or his rooftop conversation with a 12 year old about love), but the absurdity is taken too far at times, resulting in a movie where the battles are so over-the-top that they all feel the same, where the hero can't be hurt in any way, shape, or form, and where we've had most of the fun we're going to have within the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>After this it's all just too much and there are more scenes and lines that elicit eye-roles than those that get laughs.  I had a stupid grin on my face for a lot of Hellboy, and it is very much a comic book on screen. Now del Toro just needs to refine things a little bit and ration the cheesy humor.  And I wouldn't be surprised, with the way Hollywood is today, if in the near future we find out that the one thing Hellboy isn't immune to is a sequel.<br/><br/>**(out of ****)"

"theskulI42","4","1","3","5 September 2008"," More forgettable del Toro blather.
","I think it is well-established that if you enjoy comic books and comic book movies, my reviews are probably not the ones you want to peruse. Spider-Man 2 and X2 delivered, but pretty much every other contemporary superhero movie completely underwhelmed me with their extended runs of uninspiration. Most comic book movies (and I can only speak of the ones that are supposedly good; if I don't like Iron Man, how the hell am I going to enjoy Daredevil?) contain an intriguing premise buoyed by a distinctive main character, and then descend into complacency: extensive chases, EXTENSIVE CGI-based fight scenes, and perhaps a bit of dull political intrigue.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy is pretty low on the political intrigue, instead choosing to utilize one of the three Just Add Water villain sects, the Nazis (in case you don't know, the other two varieties are ""Commies"" and ""Terrorists"", collect them all!). Nothing ever really comes of this, and that's really the problem with the film in general. It takes so much time setting up everything that when it finally gets around to DOING anything, it falls right in the rut of comic book banality. In fact, now that I think about it, it has a LOT of similarities to this year's Iron Man: The film's main selling point is a sarcastic wiseacre character essayed by a distinctive and talented actor, but in both situations, that is pretty much the film's ONLY selling point. For Iron Man, plot and story are a very distant second. For Hellboy, a distant third.<br/><br/>Del Toro, as exhibited in other disjointed underwhelmers like The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth, has a vivid, beautiful visual style, a striking color palette and an occasionally wonderful, evocative atmosphere (the scenes set in the cold, cold night outside especially vibe like a cityscape). But, like his other films, that's pretty much all they do. The characters aren't interesting, the stories don't go anywhere worthwhile, and the film goes on far too long. This is a film that takes fifteen minutes to set up its opening credits. Other than Hellboy, a blander set of heroes you will never see. John Hurt has fun getting to set up the trailer (""We are the ones that bump...back""), but doesn't do much else (and then gets bumped off No Country for Old Men-style) Rupert Evans has been in very little else, and with good reason. He has no presence, no charisma, and gets a lame character to boot. As for Selma Blair, there's a reason most people only know her as ""that chick that made out with Sarah Michelle Gellar"". Hellboy even loses interest after a while. He's introduced as a giant red John McClane, but where Downey's insistent cynicism wearied me of Iron Man, Hellboy goes the opposite way, making him a big red pussy underneath, and by the halfway point, he's writing poetry and brooding on a rooftop while his partner woos his girl, and I'm rolling my eyes and metaphorically crossing my arms and sighing.<br/><br/>I would have recapped the plot, but as of this writing, it has been a whopping four minutes since the film's credits began, and I have already been forced to utilize several internet websites to remind me of the characters and occurrences herein. I've heard great things about the sequel, The Golden Army, but I obviously can't trust any of those things, because a lot of people (including critics I usually read and respect like J.Hoberman and Ed Gonzalez) thought Hellboy was awesome, and you see how this turned out for me. Oh, looking at the IMDb page, I totally forgot about Karel Roden as Griori Rasputin. I don't know if it's THAT Rasputin, because he's only present for about three scenes in the entire film, but he's supposed to be the villain. Other than having some sort of blonde woman with him (I would assume she has a name, but I'm failing this quiz), I don't remember him really doing...much of anything. I guess he fits the ""Commies"" thing considering he's a Russian, and it's a bit odd to have an extended setup about Nazis, then have the villain be a forgettable Russki. Or a forgettable anything. What? That forgettable feeling pervades Hellboy as a whole, and I'm really in awe at Guillermo del Toro's plentiful ""talent"" for making such ornately beautiful but mindbogglingly forgettable films. It's like every one of his films ends with a flash from a Men in Black Neutralizer. Ah, Men in Black. What a great film that was. Hell, boy, during Hellboy, I even found myself pining for Iron Man, and considering that film's 5/10 score, I can't possibly give this non-entity anything approaching that score, so I'll go one step down and hope for the best for the sequel.<br/><br/>{Grade: 4/10 (C-) / #62 (of 65) of 2004}"

","I saw this movie because I always sort of intended to see it, and I wanted to watch it while I still had a chance to see ""Hellboy 2"" in the theater if I enjoyed it. At this point I'm doubting whether the sequel would be worth it, and really wondering why they bothered to make it at all since this first film didn't really set the world on fire. Seems like ""Pan's Labrynth"" was a big enough hit I guess the director can do whatever he wants to now. But that was a far better movie than ""Hellboy."" The only thing that I really enjoyed in ""Hellboy"" was the way that Ron Perlman played the character. I like his attitude and his style.<br/><br/>The movie itself is pretty bad. The villains are so generic and so poorly performed by Biddy Hodson and Karel Roden that I felt they belonged in a direct to video movie. The monster they have summoned or whatever is just a sort of typical CGI thing with a lot of tentacles. Hellboy fights this monster once and it's pretty interesting, but he just kept fighting that same monster through the entire film which got pretty boring, and even the big final creature looked like just a larger version of the same thing. The story is extremely predictable and nothing interesting ever happens between Hellboy and the federal agent (Rupert Evans). I didn't feel compelled by the romantic angle either, it was like watching a high school soap opera.<br/><br/>Some good action scenes and a nice performance by Perlman but otherwise a waste of time."
"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","28 September 2007"," Watching this is like a cross between an X-Men film and watching a true expert play a 'beat 'em up' computer game against a feeble, first timer opponent.
","At a time when the majority of films are comic book, action adventure adaptation films; I doubt we needed another CGI laden superhero film that had villains after world domination and a seemingly indestructible protagonist who is clearly the only match for whatever villainy the film can cook up. Hellboy is a nice to look at action film that never takes itself too seriously yet embodies several tired and familiar routines to keep it running. These include the old anti-hero persona that Hellboy (Perlman) carries with him throughout, the way the characters in the film are practically non-existent except for Hellboy and the main enemy and the fact the film sometimes contradicts itself regarding its ideas.<br/><br/>In essence; Hellboy feels like a poor man's 'Men in Black'. It carries all the action and humour of the first Men in Black film, it copies Men in Black's use of a 'fish out of water' technique but the character of John Myers (Evans) is the character here and he's partnered up with Hellboy just like Agent Jay was with Agent Kay. The difference here is that Myers is sort of assigned to 'baby-sit' Hellboy because Hellboy needs his meals and needs to be kept out of public view but by half way through the film, Hellboy has had so much public exposure that his secret is out and nobody seems to care; rendering Myers useless after about forty minutes of the film whereas Agent Jay was Kay's partner throughout and was dealing with aliens and clearing up the mess wherever needed. I thought that Hellboy should've taken the approach Men in Black did and have these two people get into their own adventures but Myers is built up at the beginning as someone important and as someone who will have an impact on the film and Hellboy's adventures ¬ñ in the end, he was just unnecessary.<br/><br/>I was not moved by Hellboy and was not impressed with any deeper, more technical things. The film is shallow and rather poorly structured with the supporting characters consisting of human beings wielding machine guns and wearing suits (another 'should-be' Men in Black reference?). They are supposed to defeat the other type of character: CGI created fish-like monsters who are clearly no match for the human beings yet it is decided they do battle anyway. Other than this, there is just no conflict in the film. Everyone is weak except for Hellboy and a Nazi demon-like character who for some reason knows a mixture of kung-fu and how to use knifes and daggers like a Samurai ¬ñ not particularly accurate. The reason there's no conflict is because whenever an enemy goes up against a human being, we know who will win; like-wise whenever Hellboy goes up against anything, we know who will win. There are also too many one-on-one fights that are too one-sided - meaning they play out like a fox battling an injured chicken.<br/><br/>I'd say that Hellboy is perhaps a 'fun' film but maybe I watched it with my brain turned on a little too much. There is enough material to structure something clever: A Nazi experiment goes wrong, a demon enters our world and there are numerous other monsters it can do battle with. I felt that if Hellboy and the allies had another character who was equally as strong as Hellboy was, it might have been interesting. The character of Liz Sherman (Blair) is introduced and fits this character but she comes in far too late. The fish-like character of Abe Sapien (Jones) was there from the beginning but he was perceived as quite weak. Also, there are too many one sided duels throughout the film that just make it another CGI, comic book film that goes through the motions, has the showdown at the temple/castle or whatever and then kills itself off with a twist of fate or an individual act of genius from the hero. Hellboy is not a particularly good film but will entertain on a basic level although there are better films that do this; namely Men in Black."

","Hellboy is one of DC Comics' less widely spread, but just as popular, franchises (they also do AvP, amongst others). It has a strong cult following, but is not as universally recognised as other comic book series like Spider-Man or X-men. This is what is wrong with this film, which was widely released to a mostly Hellboy-na√Øve public.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I have not seen many of the Hellboy comics, but from what I have seen, the film seems to stick to its source material admirably. The problem is that it sticks a little too well ¬ñ fans of the comics will probably love it, but the rest of us might feel a little left behind, as if the film wasn't made for us. It is also fairly surreal in its visuals, so that non-fans might be thinking ""what the hell¬Ö?"" for much of the film, what with its references to other dimensions and strange magic. Other comic books, whilst not really way up there in the plausibility stakes, still take place in our universe and make them seem that much more real. Hellboy does take place in our world, but the introduction of other dimension and more surreal goings-on makes it feel too different from what we're used to. Normally I'd praise a little originality and going against the norm - God knows that Hollywood needs a good dose of that, but with this it makes the whole experience lose something, maybe a bit of the audiences' respect. However, I fully understand that writer/director Guillermo Del Toro couldn't deviate too much from the comics without upsetting the fans, and it was for them that the film was made. <br/><br/>Anyway, to the film itself. The plot revolves around the demon Hellboy, who was conjured by the Nazis but rescued and brought up by the Americans. Now he works/fights for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, led by his rescuer Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). They discover a plot by Rasputin to allow a squid-like monster to enter our dimension and destroy the world. Hellboy and his gang of mutants (including an amphibian and a pyro-kenetic) must go on a mission to stop him. Ron Perlman is fantastic in the role of Hellboy, and the other cast are good enough, but the problem stems from a dodgy script and lacklustre action scenes. The heavy use of CGI does not help matters as it is clearly not up to the standards that other films have reached, and the film is too heavy on the editing side that is ends up being a mess. This is a real shame as the director was also responsible for the much better Blade II, which handled all its action scenes very well. <br/><br/>The film does start out quite promisingly, with an entertaining sequence of the stopping of Rasputin and the discovery of Hellboy. From there the film keeps its momentum until about half-way through, at which point it all starts going downhill. The potential for the film was good, but it just could not keep its head above the water. This results in the audience not really caring about what happens in the end, and it is only because of the loud noises that we are prevented from falling asleep. There is, however, one excellent scene in which Hellboy is talking to a young boy about his feelings towards Liz (Selma Blair), which perfectly sums up Hellboy's character and wise-cracking humour. But it is not enough to save the film, and with Hellboy 2 already green-lit, hopes are not high for a redemption of this comic-book franchise. <br/><br/>Rated: 5.5/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Hellboy, directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a lousy comic adaptation that retains none of the original spirit or atmosphere of the comic. Instead it is a show-off of digital effects and a parade of various clich√©s: digital hyper action a la ""Matrix"", ""Aliens"" monster-chase claustrophobia, ""Indiana Jones"" lost-civilizations feelgood adventure, ""Batman"" Gothic fantasy and so on. It even incorporates some boring romantic melodrama.<br/><br/>Add some vague pseudo-philosophy and moral preaching about what is it that defines humanity, and you have one of the most overrated movies of 2004.

Instead of this he's taken in by a friendly scientist who takes is powers and tries to put them toward good and not evil.<br/><br/>Hellboy was again a Hollywood flop with bad acting and one of the dumbest stories thought up by Guillermo del Toro. It's filled with mindless action and conventional story twists. Also a bad job was done by John Hurt as he tried to play the handsome and inexperienced cop who gets caught up in the supernatural mess.<br/><br/>From beginning to end Hellboy was filled with stupid humor and uninteresting directing. The only thing that I enjoyed was the actual character Hellboy played by Ron Perlman. It was somewhat refreshing to have a unconventional type of hero as Hellboy is a cigar smoking, back talking thug, lost in the world.<br/><br/>All in all Hellboy was bad but not horrible as there were a few bright spots but not many.

","As with many of my fellow viewers here at IMDb, I at first had no interest in seeing this obscure comic book figure's cinematic debut, but preliminary favorable reviews and commentary found me pushing my $6.50 across the counter for the Sunday matinee viewing of ""Hellboy"".  It was not $6.50 well spent.<br/><br/> Arcane as the character and story of ""Hellboy"" are, the film itself is disturbingly reminiscent of at least a dozen other (and better) movies.  It isn't that the idea of an oversized, wisecracking demon, adopted and raised from infancy by the OSS in 1944, battling evil on the side of Righteousness is not without originality or merit, but we have pretty much seen everything before; a sinister Nazi plot to use supernatural powers to aid their nefarious cause (""Raiders of the Lost Ark""); top secret government offices and agencies to deal with phenomena kept hidden from the populace, yet operating under our very noses (""Men in Black""); special groups of creatures, i.e. misfits,  with outlandish powers in hidden academies, led by benevolent elderly gentlemen (""The X-Men"", ""League of Extraordinary Men""); battles with slimy monsters living in abandoned tunnels in New York City (""Ghost Busters"", among others); a girl with pyrokinetic powers (""Firestarter"") and so on, and on and on...<br/><br/>It begins promisingly enough, but soon bogs down under its own weight with recondite references to biblical demonology, and increasingly bizarre (and apparently immortal) enemies.  The fight scenes are violent, but dark and difficult to follow, as is the climax, which is held in a huge and elaborate underground vault looming beneath a cemetery near Moscow and outfitted with giant hammers with no other apparent purpose than to smash a bridge (don't ask).  Perhaps the comic book saga explains these things in greater detail, but in an hour an a half, the uninitiated general viewer just gets lost (and bored).<br/><br/> The new government agent selected to chaparone Hellboy brings remarkably little to the film.  This is a role which might have been played by Keanu Reeves or even Matthew Broderick with some greater success, but here just plods along as the script directs.<br/><br/> There is a fellow made of sand who winds himself up like a watch, an esp accoutered aquatic being with the voice of Niles Crane named for Abraham Lincoln, a beautiful Nazi woman named Ilsa who does not age after 60 years, and of course the Czarist priest Rasptutin plays a major role in the proceedings.

","Hellboy kind of sleepwalks through a thousand old comic-book cliches, and doesn't really introduce anything new or refreshing to the genre.  The story skips over 60 years of the title character's life, and makes no effort at all to explain what may have happened in that period to shape a demon into U.S. government agent.  Needless to say, the World War II origin scene was the most inspired, and a better movie may have been lurking in the years that shaped Hellboy, not the end product.  What we are left with is Ron Perlman as a semi-ticked off, cigar chomping brute who non-chalantly dispatches his opponents and shows little to no concern about any danger that awaits him or others.  If you read comics as a kid (or now), you know this covers roughly a quarter of the Marvel roster. Hellboy's cohorts are nothing special either, Liz Sherman (Selma Blair) is almost a direct knock-off of Charlie McGee in Firestarter (we get no background on their romance), and John Myers (Rupert Evans) just sort of reacts to his partner's destructive tendencies.  The only interesting characters to me were Professor Broom (John Hurt) as Hellboy's ""father"", and undead Nazi assassin Kroenen (Karel Roden).  The action scenes were pretty standard, typical CGI stuff.  I did like the fact that an actor portrayed Hellboy, and he wasn't computer-generated.  That makes the movie much more watchable.  Just don't be surprised if you've completely forgotten about this movie 2 hours after you've left the theatre."

","Stop me if this sounds familiar: a wise-cracking hero combats baddies who are occult Nazis, which leads the hero and his pals into a booby-trapped tomb. Or how about a baddie who seemingly twirls daggers merely for the generic swoosh-and-whoosh sound effects--even Indian Jones couldn't be bothered to put up with that nonsense. (By the way, does anyone else feel that the unlocking of Hellboy's chamber looks and sounds a bit too much like that motif in the X-Men movies for unlocking Cerebro?) Then, there's the typical superhero-action-movie squishy monsters that incinerate instead of bleed, and, to further ensure that PG-13 rating, clothes hardly burn up in fire, either. If all of this weren't predictable enough, there's also the repetitiveness of the fight scenes, whereupon Hellboy fights the same sort of squishy monster three times, each with their own mini-cliffhangers, lots of punching sounds and such, and a combination of wire-work practical effects and loads of villainous CGI. Plus, he also fights another--even bigger--squishy monster in yet another scene. Hellboy even eavesdrops on his paramour with another guy twice. Soap-opera love triangle screenwriting for a superhero movie, c'mon.<br/><br/>Along with the nominal romance, most of the characters here are bland. The baddies sure are, and even the merman is more interesting as comparison to the similar Creature from the Black Lagoon that Guillermo del Toro developed more fully later on in his Best-Picture-Oscar-winning ""The Shape of Water"" (2017) than he is as an actual character in ""Hellboy."" Perhaps, the most apt character in this one is that dagger-twirling Nazi, because he runs on clockwork--much like the movie does. Mechanical, predictable and repetitive. ""Hellboy"" doesn't even manage to do anything interesting with its meta comic-book within the comic-book movie. Years later, ""Logan"" (2017) would. Neither does del Toro do anything compelling with all of his stylish characters and cinematic imitations. At least, in ""The Shape of Water,"" he played some with expectations by reversing the colonialist message of ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954). ""Hellboy,"" on the other hand, is probably what you'd expect it to be because you've likely seen many other movies that are just the same. It's like clockwork."

","The Nazis are up to their old occult tricks again, using magick to try and open a portal and unleash ancient gods upon the Earth. When the allied forces intervene, all the Nazis manage to release from their inter-dimensional gateway is a red skinned, demon-child, who grows up to become Hellboy, an indestructible, cigar-chomping hero fighting the forces of evil for the FBI.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro directed this adaptation of the Dark Horse comic-book, meaning that it's perfect for those who enjoy an excess of the following in their movies: the dark, clockwork creations, leather, rusty stuff, water, steam-punk, cogs (running the gamut from teeny-tiny to f***ing enormous), Nazis, CGI Lovecraftian monsters, magick, and jokey one-liners. Unfortunately, Del Toro seems so intent on getting the basic ingredients and aesthetic style for Hellboy precisely how he wants that he forgets all about telling a decent story: his film suffers from a leaden pace, a weak plot full of clich√©s (one of those story lines that feels like it's being made up on the fly), and zero chemistry between dull characters.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the makeup used to transform Ron Perlman into Hellboy is impressive, and although the use of old school animatronic effects stick out like a sore thumb amidst all of the CGI, I enjoyed the resurrected Russian corpse with the noose around its neck.

","OK, if I'm going to root for any being coming from HELL, he better be damned special and spectacular. That, Hellboy was not. I've never read the comic Hellboy, so everything I was to learn or know about Hellboy was coming directly from the movie. Quickly, I realized that Hellboy had no particular talents besides super strength, a long tail, and a hand made of some hard substance. On the laundry list of superheros, Hellboy ranks down towards the bottom as far as his power, skills, and intelligence. The entire movie I was waiting for him to unleash some hidden and untapped power that really distinguished him. After an entire movie, all I found out is that he can bring people back to life if he whispers something intimidating in their ear... as it so happened when he whispered into the fire girl's ear.<br/><br/>The action was moderate and acceptable. The CGI and effects were also acceptable, but what wasn't acceptable were some of the scenes and some of the God awful lines. <br/><br/>Example #1: <br/><br/>Hellboy faces the car and says, ""Red means stop!"" <br/><br/>Note: That was the scene when John Myers falls down in the street, and as everyone knows, in Hollywood cars never stop because the driver can never see that someone is clearly in the middle of the road. A Jeep Cherokee is barreling towards John while only honking and not hitting the brakes or making the slightest attempt to avoid the obviously injured person. Hellboy then proceeds to punch the front of the SUV, thereby making it flip in the air up and over him and John. Not only was that scene wholly absurd, it was unnecessary. I guess it was a display of Hellboy's awesome strength. --end note.<br/><br/>Example #2<br/><br/>Fire girl: ""Hit me."" <br/><br/>John: ""Why?"" <br/><br/>Fire girl: ""Just hit me"" <br/><br/>John: *Smack* <br/><br/>Fire girl: ""Why aren't you running?"" <br/><br/>Note: WHAT? John's answer should have been: ""if you had told me that you are a looney b**** that needs being slapped so that she can get angry and burn up everything, then I woulda ran. But thanks for telling me that now because I was thinking of slapping you earlier."" Are you kidding me? ""Why aren't you running?"" that was the best line they could come up with. Lame.---end note.<br/><br/>Example #3<br/><br/>Hellboy: ""I said, 'hey you on the other side. If you don't let her go, I'll have to come over there and get her'."" <br/><br/>Note: That's when Hellboy revived fire girl. I guess he supposedly scared the crap out of the Angel of Death to make him release the girls soul. God forbid someone would use CPR or a defibrillator to bring her back to life. But then again, why use that when you have Hellboy to intimidate Death and/or God to let someone live. Hellboy should get an honorary medical license just to revive dying patients.--end note.<br/><br/>This movie had just enough action to keep me interested and make me ignore the absurd plot and even more absurd dialogue. In the end, I didn't like Hellboy, he is just a brash, cocky, devil-child. But, I had to thank him for saving mankind from the devil. I pray they don't make a sequel to this as they so often do with big budget comic hero films. They should chalk this one up as a failed experiment, cut their losses, and focus on the successes such as Spiderman and X-Men."

","""Hellboy"" is another in the recent series of comic book superheros turned movie superheros. Although I am not a reader of 'Hellboy' comics, it appears that the movie is very faithful to the comic book, and joins other such movies a ""Spiderman 1 and 2"" and 'X-Men 1 and 2"" as excellent, action-filled entertainment. Ron Perlman has been a superb choice for the role of Hellboy, and as the DVD 'extras' show, it took about 4 hours each shooting day to apply the makeup. In fact, the 2.5 hour 'making of' feature, which is delivered in 40 chapters, is one of the more comprehensive I have seen, and will be greatly appreciated by all 'Hellboy' fans. The great British actor John Hurt becomes Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm, who raises Hellboy and becomes his father. The other character of note is Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair. Hellboy has affection for Liz, and this sets up a key scene near the end. Good movie, mostly well-done special effects.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW, be warned if you continue reading. The story starts in 1944 in Scotland, the evil guys are trying to destroy the Earth, create a portal which is quickly destroyed by Dr. Bruttenholm and gang, but not before something travels from the 'darkside.' It is a red baby with a tail which they lure with a candy bar, and eventually raise to be Hellboy, fighter of evil in present time, for the secret agency that 'bumps back' to those which go bump in the night. Hellboy is super strong, from his heritage is not harmed by fire or electrical shock, and appears to be indestructible. The evil guys are back to try again to destroy the Earth, Hellboy must stop them. Lots of action in many different places, in the climax Hellboy has to make a choice to save Liz, he begins to go over to the dark side, his horns grow to full length, but his pal reminds him, ""You have a choice, your father gave it to you"", which could also be interpreted as the choice God gives us. Hellboy snaps off his horns, destroys the evil guys, the movie ends with Hellboy and Liz together."

This big good-natured bad ass has the whole show to himself and it's just not enough to fill a movie. I've never read any hell boy comics, so maybe I'm just missing the allure of a big red painted man with a toilet roll for a right hand prancing around and hitting stuff...<br/><br/>I did like the Nazi-Voodoo stuff. Reminded me of all-night games of Return to Castle Wolvenstein and that robot dude had (for me anyway) some cool references to BloodRayne.<br/><br/>As for the plot, nothing there you didn't see coming from the line at the ticket booth.<br/><br/>So, basically if you liked League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and/or are an avid player of RtCW you can probably suffer through this movie.

","I know some Hellboy-Comic books, I like Ron Perlman, so what better than to watch this movie, I thought. Well, I was wrong - after I got some hope after the opening scene somehow the story developed boring beyond belief, the Characters were more than linear, I would like to call them punctual (only highlight of the movie was the scene where hellboy observes his girlfriend and the new agent with a kid on the roof of a house, which was the only scene in the whole film that caught the spirit of the comic-books). The cast was awful (have no better word for it)- all actors seemed to have taken sleeping pills, Ron Perlman's acting was buried under ten pounds of Latex on the face (only highlight was Jeffrey Tambor, who played I think for his tenth film the same spleenish but likable character), the bad guys were even more boring than the good guys. I think the whole film suffered tremendously from a too short character introduction and development (good examples for character developing scenes are spiderman 2 and the coffee break with Ocatavius and his wife, or the scene with Magneto as a kid in the concentration camps).<br/><br/>To summarise: this film could have been better if someone would have taken the time to write a solid script, it isn't enough for comic-book-based films to hasten through the character introduction and background story, just to be able to show some special effects and come to a somehow wrong timed and wrong placed happy end.<br/><br/>so: 3 out of 10 tubs of red latex for this film"

","I don't seem to understand all the positive comments and high rating this film has achieved. I have watched it twice at home and the second time it sucked even more than the first time. The story is so stupid that only a 9-year old could take it seriously. The dialogue is plain ridiculous, packed with clich√©s, lame one-liners, and some characters always seemed to know everything with or without explanation. When John says he is not pure-hearted, and the fishy guy instantly replies with his C3PO voice, ""Yes you are"", I couldn't help from laughing. With such a complete mock of a plot, most of the actors are doing okay trying to save the film from being a complete disaster. But in addition to the lack of story, the actors are also clearly miscast, with the exception of Linda Blair, who should be playing in the next adaptation of Stephen King's ""Firestarter"". A good actor like John Hurt is wasted, Karel Roden was a great villain in ""15 minutes"" but here he just looks awkward and ridiculous. Rupert Evans - completely miscast, I did not believe he was an FBI agent for one second. No negative words on Ron Perlman though, he coped with his part in the best possible way. I cannot imagine any of the top Hollywood stars handling a role of a big, ugly, red guy with cut-out horns on his forehead... Really, if the story, dialogue and effects were good (like Spider-man 1,2 and even X-Men 2), or if the movie did not take itself so seriously, this could be fun to watch. I hope they give the sequel to another writer and director who could do something better with this material...<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10"

The director shows a total lack of skill in linking even the simplest of scenes together and the script reads like every other page has been removed. The characters are totally one dimensional and the casting could not have been any worse. Hellboy though was well acted but let down by a terrible script which turned his character into an uninteresting bore. The action scenes had all the fluidity of a brick. The movie had a wild swing at humour but missed by a mile. And as for the bad guys.... lets just say, Ming from Flash Gordon and a costume left over from Blade 2 doesn't make fantastic viewing.

","There are guys with faces just made for Hollywood. I speak not of the Tom Cruises, Paul Newmans, and Cary Grants. I'm talking about the Marty Feldmans, Michael Berrymans, Edna May Olivers, and Rondo Hattons. People so goofy looking, they could only get a job in the movies. Actors like this are handy because they require almost no makeup. Their face is its own special effect. So you gotta wonder why the filmmakers of Hellboy would cast Ron Perlman - a pretty damn beastly looking guy on his own - for the title role, then bury him under a ton of makeup and red paint. They could have got just any large actor and it wouldn't have made for any extra trouble. Not putting anything against Ron Perlman, who's a fine enough actor, but he's not exactly the first guy that comes to mind when you think 'starring role'. Come to think of it, they did the same thing with Perlman in that TV show he had way back when.<br/><br/>Anyway, Ron plays the adult Hellboy, a sort of orphaned demon who gets adopted as a toddler by a British paranormal officer during WWII. As already stated, he's all red, plus he has a huge left forearm that looks like one of those things attack-dog trainers wear, and has two humongous horns that protrude from his forehead. He keeps these filed down because he wants to fit in better with humans. Red humans with tails and elephantiasis of the left arm, apparently. Personally, I think he keeps them filed down because they look like cool aviator goggles pulled up above his eyes.<br/><br/>Together, Hellboy and his aging British foster parent (John Hurt) fight crime along with a Fishman that apparently was also adopted along the way. Fishman looks a little like a cross between the aliens in Close Encounters and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. He lives in a giant fish tank, but can survive outside with a special collar. Fishman is more of an intellectual non-violent sort and provides all the case research and background info for Hellboy to gruffly dismiss as he breaks out the hardware. Into the fold comes a regular 20-something human who is recruited as a partner/servant for Hellboy, as well as the future head of the paranormal crimefighting division once John Hurt kicks the bucket, which looks to be any day now. Hellboy and Fishman have codenames in this underground organization: ""Red"" and ""Blue"". You can probably guess which one is which. These are needed because you're pushing the envelope of the PG-13 rating if you're saying 'Hell'Boy all the time.<br/><br/>Hellboy is supposedly based on a comicbook, though to be perfectly candid, I've never heard of it. Then again, I haven't heard of half of the comicbooks they make movies from nowadays, including the X-Men. Yes, I live in a cave, and the last time I cracked a comicbook, Shazam was the hot new thing. Is that guy still around? I suppose not, since there isn't a movie about him out there. Hellboy the movie seems to draw from lots of other comicbook movies, though. There's the strained father-son relationship that Hulk apparently didn't cover sufficiently. There's the whole superheroes-are-persecuted-because-they're-different angle that X-Men always tries to sell. Speaking of X-Men, there's also a character here (that I call FireGirl) who causes things to catch fire. In the first half of the film, she can do this at will, but in the second half, she needs to be slapped in the face first. I'm not sure what that's all about. She always appears to be upset, supposedly because she doesn't like being called ""FireStarter"" by the kids in her school, especially when Drew Barrymore beat her to it.<br/><br/>Hellboy's first assignment is to take care of the Keymaster of Gozer, who has grown some reptilian dreads and a second pair of eyeballs since his Ghostbuster days. This encounter leads to a big fight in a subway station. Director Guillermo Del Toro sure does like those subway stations. The most notable thing about this fight scene is that right smack in the middle of it, a woman asks Hellboy to save her kittens, which have been left in a wooden box on the floor of the subway station. My first thought at this point was, ""What would anyone be doing on a subway with a box of kittens?"" But, I've never been on a subway, so I can't really judge. However, I have seen people bring stranger things on an airplane - or at least I did before the FAA decided that things like toenail clippers, laser pointers, and bookmarks were deemed as the tools of hijackers. I bring this scene up, because I think this movie is kind of poking fun at comicbook movies in general, where, as this scene references, someone always has a baby they left in a burning building that needs rescuing. There are other examples in the movie of this tongue-in-cheek approach. The vehicle our crimefighting heroes arrive in is a garbage truck, Hellboy's favorite meal is a monster stack of pancakes, and in one scene he confesses his crush for FireGirl from afar on a rooftop to a 10 year old boy as they share milk and cookies. It's just that kind of film.<br/><br/>Eventually, Hellboy will fight more keymasters, some Nazis, a zombie/robot that wields swords like they were nightsticks, and some giant space squids. To be honest, I got a little lost by that point.<br/><br/>Hellboy is an OK movie if you're into this sort of thing, I guess. I'm not, however, and found the film to be about a half-hour too long. The attempts at humor could've been a nice foil for the typical comicbook-movie shenanigans, but they were never really all that funny, though I'll give it marks for trying."

First of all, it looks terrible, when they hit Hellboy, and he slowly flies horizontally across the room. The physics are missing here, which isn't VERY important, but when it looks strange (and flat out ugly), it just doesn't work. Second, he kills a monster (which isn't easy to kill), but he doesn't really learn from it. He kicks the other (similar) monsters' butts for the rest of the movie instead of just killing them, and when he does kill them, it seems like a coincidence. That results in fighting just for fighting's sake. Third, the movie seems to go on forever and ever. The movie simply has too few scenes. There's lots of action all along, but the movie dwells in the wrong places. And finally, WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS THAT!?!? Seriously! A jealous demon is funny, and it works, but to see Hellboy getting emotional is simply too much: HE'S A DEMON FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! And he should behave more like one.

So this is a review *without* those messages.<br/><br/>The conclusion first - this movie's in the same class as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was painful - a B-movie that wasn't quite bad enough to laugh at.  But grossly overdone.  You could feel the cost of your ticket being put into the special effects, which the director used because nothing else in the scene was working.<br/><br/>After the opening, an awkward introduction of all of the characters was made.  The dialogue reeked of exposition.   Which means it wasn't natural - it was all about explaining the backstory.  (But not all of it.  Only some parts of it!)<br/><br/>The real problem with this movie, ripped right off the comic book pages, was that it was all too arbitrary.  The world was dull, and it seemed like the writer kept throwing things in - oooh, there's a three headed frog!  Now it's snowing!  Look - Hellboy needs glasses!  And eats shampoo!  (I'm making all of these up, but the movie was really THAT arbitrary.)  You never, ever once started to care about anyone (the villains, the heroes, the danger), and it wasn't *fun*.  Movies like this need to be fun, and Hellboy wasn't.<br/><br/>The director, del Toro, is VERY good at having goal-oriented, single-minded characters. Blade II (his movie) was schlock, but it was entertaining schlock.  Hellboy was a literal adaptation of the comic book, and it needed a director who knows how to set the mood.  del Toro has no idea how to set mood.<br/><br/>So, in short, Hellboy's in the same class as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

","After being subjected to a tirade of putrescent superhero movies such as THE HULK, DAREDEVIL, THE PUNISHER, CATWOMAN and SPIDER-MAN 2, I have understandably become extremely cynical about such films. So when I went to see Hellboy out of sheer boredom one fine Saturday, I was expecting a load of rubbish. What I got was a fast-paced, humorous, and surprisingly well-made comic adaption, that strides head and shoulders above the aforementioned swill. While it's far from perfect, it's certainly good enough to restore one's hope that another good superhero movie, worthy of the first installment of SPIDER-MAN, will eventually be made.<br/><br/>The plot comes across as unashamed, but diverting and well-thought-out cinematic kitsch. It manages to incorporate demons, Nazis, resurrection, Rasputin, and the end of the world into a gaudy but coherent whole, with excellent characterisations all-round from the likes of Selma Blair, Karel Roden, Rupert Evans, John Hurt, Jeffrey Tambor and Ron Perlman, who steals the show in the lead role. The script is superbly entertaining and extremely witty, with a number of truly memorable scenes and one-liners. The special effects are brilliant, but thankfully not overdone, and they are more than justified by the excellent cinematography.<br/><br/>No matter how corny the trailer looks, and no matter how much you hated DAREDEVIL, you will be thoroughly entertained by this film. Believe me, nobody was more cynical about this movie than I was before I saw it, and yet, I loved it. (If you actually liked DAREDEVIl, well... that's a different, and very sad, story!) Have patience with HELLBOY, and you'll be rewarded with a decent film, and hopefully, a portent for superhero films to come. 8/10."

","This supernatural action-adventure is based on a dark creature in Mike Mignola's acclaimed comic book series Hellboy. Hellboy(Ron Perlman)is a red colored demon in the form of a man with a giant armored gloved hand and two circles(where ram-like horns are shaved down)on his head. Complete with a tail, superpowers and an appetite for Baby Ruth candy bars. As an infant Hellboy is rescued from the Nazis and raised as a force of good by Allied Force agent 'Broom' Bruttenholm(John Hurt). As an adult Hellboy is an investigator of the paranormal and while on an assignment comes face to face with George Rasputin(Karel Roden)who uses monsters and powers-that-be to convince Hellboy he is better off with the dark side. Aiding our demon hero is the telepathic 'Mer-Man'(Doug Jones)and a pyro-kinetic looker named Liz(Selma Blair). Undercurrents of deadpan humor add texture to the full blown battle between the demonic superhero and slimy monsters from the bowels of who knows where. Also in the cast are: Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, Bridget Hodson and Kevin Trainor. Kudos to director Guillermo del Toro for his distinctive all-be-it loose adaptation of the comic book hero."

","This movie is a cinematic masterpiece from that opening scene in world war 2 to the ending scene in that epic battle. This is a great sci fi flick but some the scenes can be pretty dark like when the man hellboy father is operating on comes back alive and murders him.

","There was a lot of talk about Hellboy when the movie came out. A demon who fights with rosary on the good side. And while it's weird, having finally seen the movie, I think it's far less wrong than things like ""Lucifer"". It works in it's comic book world and it works well. Del Toro does know how to make a fun movie and Ron Perlman is great in his role. Sadly, the movie does suffer from pacing issues and feeling that the characters are constantly doing something not very relevant to the main plot. To use a gaming dictionary, it feels they are constantly doing side quests. That is a shame, because when it comes to action, characters, or anything else for that matter, Hellboy delivers. It even has a good message. And while there are a few last decade cringe scenes, even that is cool in retrospective. It's just sad that it couldn't be much more than just a good movie. But, oh well, be happy with what you have, they say. I give it 7.5 and I recommend it!"
"TheGreatMarkukini","5","0","2","13 May 2019"," Despite a cool look, the non-symmetry talks by itself
","I have never heard of Hellboy before the movie, so was not expecting anything except supernatural action of the undiscovered source. Got pretty much it, with tons of clich√©s and lame jokes, but let's dig a little bit deeper than that.<br/><br/>Without any doubts the eternal theme of Nazis searching for mystical artifacts will be used if the scenario kicks off during the WWII, I am just glad that it was not the main storyline for the creators. Don't expect much of a background for the unique super creature as you will be propelled into his full-fledged years when he deals with all kinds of monsters. Loved this approach that helped to avoid the routine training montage and inept attempts of becoming a professional.<br/><br/>The main plot doesn't bring you any new kicks and at some point might raise a few questions of ""why"" type. The usual approach of adding a few romantic or self-discovering turns actually doesn't catch your attention and for me just caused an unsuspected yawning. Maybe the reason was that we didn't get to know the characters closer, so all the dramatic moments passed by like a train of a full speed.<br/><br/>The action also didn't catch the starts from the sky. Even long fight sequences weren't showing some outstanding chorographical achievements - simple smash, shoot and destroy. And some wannabe epic moments just followed a wet firecracker principle - some smoke and no explosion.<br/><br/>The fun bits have tried to bring some juice into all this meal but unfortunately many of them also qualified for a cringe awards. The awkward and stupid jokes prevail over fairly laughable situations, which actually makes me sad.<br/><br/>As much as I loved Ron Perlman's Hellboy by his unique look and behavior, Guillermo del Toro actually applied the physical description of a demonic creature onto the picture and we got the hornless and weirdly shaped action that has failed to deliver a pretty cool concept of a supernatural defender of humanity."

","Hellboy is a bit of light fun, nothing more.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman has had a vast multitude of roles and all those films entertain in different ways. I'm not a comic book movie person, so I had no high expectations. It's alright though, the last quarter or so of the film's disappointing."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","1","10 April 2019"," Hellboy portrays its impossible titular character with blazing fire and childish charm.
","A superhero blockbuster shrouded in Del Toro's signature darkness, bringing a relatively unknown graphic novel into the spotlight. This accessibly entertaining flick has just enough mindless action to appeal to general audiences whilst offering a dynamic range of genre transitions allowing Hellboy himself to develop as a character. Sure the central plot is extinguished right from the start, but it's all about Hellboy. And, in my opinion, it works. Just. Hellboy, a demonic beast pulled from a dimensional portal, works with other supernatural individuals to keep the world safe from paranormal threats. This time, he must stop a Russian mystic from summoning inter-dimensional colossal creatures.<br/><br/>Part superhero fantasy, part romance and part horror. A mish-mash of dark genres that suit Del Toro's signature style. Whether it be Hellboy traversing damp sewers or prowling the streets at night, Del Toro maintains the overburdening sense of darkness that looms over Hellboy as he struggles to mature. As a character study, Del Toro's screenplay manages to fully flesh out Hellboy's loneliness and, accompanied by Perlman's transformative performance, makes the character instantly memorable. Abe, an amphibious humanoid, and Liz, a pyrokinetic, are introduced in a way that suits Hellboy. They never become central to the story, but represent his adoration for his peers/friends. Bestowing human qualities upon him. The romance is nuanced but effective, the paranormal imagery exhumes imagination and the action is watchable.<br/><br/>Just a shame that the main story has no development whatsoever as the antagonist (and his disciples) are instantly forgettable. The lore of the Ogdru Jahad and the Thule Society felt dense yet never truly explored, ultimately feeling rushed just to relate to the source material. The visual effects were satisfactory for the most part. However due to Del Toro's natural insistence on practical effects (phew...), it does make the CGI more noticeable during fight sequences, ultimately taking you out of the experience. The third act, especially the final fifteen minutes, crumbles into dust. The screen suddenly fills with tentacled behemoths, fiery horns and last minute revivals. It all happens instantly and pretty much has no effect, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Fortunately we were graced with a sequel, as I find this introductory film reminiscent to a seed. A ""Seed of Destruction"" if you will. Del Toro plants the characters firmly into the ground and presents their origins and destiny defying arcs well. Now it's time to let these characters grow and focus on an involving central story, as this film was absent of that entirely. Still, Del Toro's fantastical style bursts through the screen in what is an often overlooked superhero flick."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","6","0","1","22 March 2019"," He's fireproof; you're not.
","The prevailing problem with 'Hellboy (2004)' is that it feels the need to over-explain everything that happens. Whenever something even remotely strange - or, indeed, story-related - occurs, someone will surely say something expository to 'take its edge off'. This, of course, becomes grating after just a short while, especially when most of what's explained is shown on-screen as plain as day and doesn't really need any further analysis. It's a mentality that leads to the piece's other main problem: John Myers. He's the audience's surrogate, supposedly used to ease us into this supernatural world, but he's not really the protagonist that the picture really wants him to be. That's because most of the movie is torn between him and Hellboy, leading to an odd 'back-and-forth' pacing that makes sure neither of them get the screen-time or development they deserve. On top of this, he doesn't really serve his purpose, anyway; his rookie status affords the film a 'free pass' when it comes to blatant exposition, but most of it isn't even delivered via this method. It's weird that he was felt to be necessary as the incredibly long prologue does a decent job of introducing you to the narrative's supernatural elements, as well as its overall tone and, even, Hellboy himself (who's then strangely hidden in his adult form for quite some time). Myers isn't a bad character but he doesn't do anything, really, other than take time away from the more interesting ones. Despite the picture's generally messy nature, it's still a solid effort. One of the main positives that pops out straight away is its special effects prowess. The make-up on both Perlman and (a criminally underused) Jones truly is terrific. Apparently the only parts of the former that are actually visible are his eyelids (even his eyes are covered by demonically yellow contact lenses) and the latter is pretty much completely lost under a layer of impressive prosthetics. In both cases, however, the performances shine through. The piece's practical effects are matched pretty much perfectly with their computer-created counterparts. Of course, some of the completely CGI stuff looks a little rusty on retrospection - especially when the remotely-controlled and quite cumbersome 'right hand of doom' gets a more dexterous digital double - but a lot of it - most of it, even - holds up surprisingly well. The completely digital doubles often look good, which is especially rare, but the flick finds a brilliant balance between the 'real' and the rendered, to the point where the two are difficult to differentiate during some select shots. Another of the movie's highlights, in usual Del Toro fashion, is the way in which the monsters are brought to life with such care and attention. They're treated like proper characters rather than side-shows. Hellboy is, for all intents and purposes, a human, a flawed individual trying to do right by those he loves and deal with his unfair, essentially race-based ostracism. If that isn't relatable, I don't know what is. At its heart, it's a story about a group of outcasts sticking together, relenting against their unfair judgement and - in some cases - initially destructive nature. That's the most interesting stuff but it isn't capitalised on all that well. The feature is messy, as I mentioned, and has about five climaxes but no real denouement. Every line of dialogue also sounds 'monumental', if you will, in that early 2000s way where everything has to sound 'cool'. I wish that someone would say something 'normal', as that would help normalise the strange situations (most of) our characters are supposed to find ordinary and add to a sense of 'realism' - or, at least, help ground the story in a more tangible world. In the end, I feel that the movie manages to overcome most of its issues, even if they definitely impact its overall effect. It's enjoyable but not always as engaging as you'd expect. Still, as I said, it's a solid effort. 6/10"

","Hellboy seems like a cool hero, and he deserves a better film than the one he gets here, which is too full of leaps in logic and extraordinarily inconsistent in tone. Like Superman, he seems to care enough for our world in order to save it from some pretty nefarious people when the time comes - perhaps chiefly because, like Superman, he doesn't actually have a home world of his own to go back to. He's cocky; confident and a little rebellious, although remains faithful to those who have taken care of him up to this point in his life. <br/><br/>The film's beginning sets an odd, fantastical tone which does not really dissipate for the rest of its runtime. It's 1944, and despite the fact the Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles the Germans ever conquered during The Second World War, the Nazis are in Scotland. There, they are looking to end the war quickly; sensing, I suppose, defeat, what with their failing campaigns in North Africa and on the Eastern Front, and so turn to opening up portals to dimensions beyond our observable world in order to call upon higher powers to help them. But, how do they know if this unknown entity will be sympathetic to their aims? The imagery of the opening is also too reminiscent of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", which culminated in such a show - we are at a stage now in blockbuster cinema whereby a film like ""Hellboy"" decides to BEGIN with it.<br/><br/>Alas, for the Nazis, something goes wrong in their experiment when the American (not British) soldiers, who have been tracking them all this way, launch an ambush to quash the mission. With them is a young professor named Trevor Bruttenholm, who is eventually played in his old age by John Hurt. In the ensuing chaos, something does indeed pop out of what was a gateway to Hell - the aforementioned and eponymous Hellboy: a small, red demon who is eventually played in his 'old' age by Ron Perlman, by which point he is a conspiracy theory amongst modern New Yorkers despite there being photographic evidence of him posing in a picture with the soldiers. <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro uses this set up to tell a tale which is mostly interested in set direction and costume, which makes a change to having to sit through a film of this stock which is mostly interested in action, although there is quite a bit of action... In the twenty-first century, Hellboy is kept in an FBI lockup with a variety of other quirky occultist stuff from non-history - he's at an age in his life now whereby he is bored, and craves action and adventure and quite likes the idea of having a girlfriend. Whatever it is they groom young demons to do in Hell, Hellboy isn't getting it here.<br/><br/>Away from this, something is brewing - the Nazis who failed to win The War the first time around are gunning for another shot. In true ""The Mummy"" style, two of these Nazis, played by Karel Roden and Bridget Hodson, are able to live forever in a cursed state and set out with the intent to bring about the apocalypse anyway. On their side is an odd, machine-like tin-made ninja decked out in Nazi garb and a bizarre fish-like creature whose raw brawn they use to buttress their offensive.<br/><br/>The thinking and the energy behind ""Hellboy"" is a lot more interesting than the finished product itself, which finds comfort in telling a tale of heroes fighting villains with the world at stake. More interesting are the characters, particularly the supporting ones who are all at once beautiful; terrifying; fascinating and ugly to look at - we sense they each have their own worlds, complete with complicated biological ecosystem to slot into, somewhere in the universe, just nowhere that we can imagine. <br/><br/>The film seems to lose its focus too often, coming off as very wayward in tone as scenes of brutal violence involving villainous sword-play are intercut with sardonic putdowns from the protagonist. It also seemed as if there was a love story in an earlier draft, or cut altogether, involving a character who could not control the fire she could produce from the palms of her hands. The film ends up in deepest of snowy Russia and Hellboy being carted around in a box, but why bother hiding him if his identity is out by this point? And what do the Russian authorities think of an FBI entourage in their country anyway? Irrespective, ""Hellboy"" is a lot of good, harmless fun which fans of the genres of action, horror and science fiction should devour."

","This is indeed Guillermo del Toro's masterwork, far exceeding even Pan's Labyrinth and actually the last good film he has produced. Ron Perlman gives nothing less than the performance of a lifetime, giving the title character true depth and poignancy. John Hurt is superb as usual and all the supporting cast does supremely well in their respective parts. Also featured is Biddy Hodson in a star making turn that is both sensual, eye catching, and unforgettable. This is story telling at its most powerful. When cinema can be so artistically utilized to entertain yet illuminate simultaneously, it is fortuitous in the extreme. This is one of those occasions when everything comes together to make a wondrous cinematic statement. Del Toro has the potential to become one of the great motion picture directors of all time if he could always be as imaginative, artistic, and magnificent as he was with Hellboy, Hellboy II, and we pray, Hellboy III."
"Prismark10","5","0","1","27 December 2014"," Hell let loose
","In Hellboy you enter the world of Guillermo Del Toro as he brings the comic book adaptation to life with his brand of visuals. But to put it bluntly despite the praise Ron Perlman gets for his wisecracking performance he was too old to playing Hellboy because despite his earth years he is supposed to look young and Perlman looks old despite the heavy prosthetic make up.<br/><br/>The plot regarding Nazis using the power of the dark arts and a portal to hell harks back to Raiders of the Lost Ark. The government agency with a menagerie of alien species working for them reminds you of the Men in Black franchise.<br/><br/>The story is rather so-so, it drags at the beginning and really just takes you from A to B to C. It relies too much on the one liners from Hellboy and despite good support from Doug Jones as Abe Sapien, John Hurt, Jeffrey Tambor and some dastardly Nazi baddies it is fairly entertaining without much depth."

","Having no previous knowledge about Hellboy, i was open for everything when i went to the theater. The result was halfway good.<br/><br/>The movie opens brilliantly, the story develops well, fusing fact and fiction. Then roughly in the middle of it, it all becomes just another Hollywood action flick with special effects. If i remember right, the precise moment is entering the cemetery in Moscow while searching for Rasputin.<br/><br/>Not sure why this was the case, but it seems as if the producers wanted to showcase all CGI available at the time. Surely they wanted to impress the audience, they probably needed to top some other movie of the era and market research told them they needed bigger and better special effects to do that.<br/><br/>The result is good fun, but also makes you forget Hellboy at the moment the end credits start rolling."

","First, this is not science-fiction, it's blatantly fantasy. I am not a comic-book reader, so I had no experience with this universe prior to the film.<br/><br/>As a film, it was pretty good. When I say ""as a film"", I'm addressing it as nothing more than a piece of entertaining cinema, like the Back to the Future series, anything Hellraiser, or Fantasia. As entertainment, I'm not looking for anything metaphorical or metaphysical. The presence of deep-seated questions doesn't ruin a film, but they shouldn't distract me from it. Cases in point: Event Horizon, Robots.<br/><br/>For Hellboy, I suspended judgement of the film based on the title because superstitious terminology and imagery are ubiquitous and unavoidable throughout most of the world and literary history. Besides, Hellraiser, even using such a fantastic and superstitious title, doesn't bring excessive religious ideology into the film.<br/><br/>I'll spare appeals to the idea of this film being religiously alienating because of the main character, as the ideas of ""devil"" and ""hell"" are concepts that have been propagated through literature for thousands of years. What angers me most is the devotion to the idea that one can only be ""human"" through Christianity. This is outrageous, insulting, belittling... there aren't words sufficient to describe how offensive it is to discriminate against someone based on their superstitions. Racism is low, sexism is low, classism is low, implied discrimination based purely on religious views is truly despicable.<br/><br/>I had no interest in this film until I noticed it on Guillermo del Toro's IMDb page. Maybe I missed something in his other work, or maybe I'm expecting too much from him, but I won't be jumping at his other films with the kind of zeal that I did before."
"rick_7","Null","0","1","11 June 2010"," Interesting superhero flick undone by confusing plotting
","Hellboy (Guillermo del Toro, 2004) is an offbeat comic book film that boasts strong characterisation and an impressive aesthetic, but suffers from some incomprehensible plotting. The title character, very well-played by Ron Perlman, is the son of Satan, brought to earth in 1944 by Nazis (who've invaded Scotland), only to be adopted and reared for good by kind-hearted FBI scientist John Hurt. Returning in the present day, the fascists - who include an ageless woman, bald wizard Rasputin (I have no idea), and a man made of sand - unleash a heap of monsters and a can of high-grade whup-ass on the US. Their ultimate aim, as becomes sort-of-clear, is to lure Hellboy to Rasputin's tomb on the outskirts of Moscow, where they'll force him to open a portal to his Dad's place. Or something. The hero is a fine creation, impressively realised by Perlman and make-up maestro Rick Baker, while there's commendable support from Hurt, Doug Jones and love interest Selma Blair. The scene in which Selma's Liz replies to Hellboy's pledge of everlasting faith by murmuring ""I like that"" is really something. And though the action sequences are inconsistent, with tedious, by-the-numbers scraps included alongside some tense, thrilling set-pieces, del Toro taps into the mythology of the conceited but self-aware cigar-chomping hero and his singular world, the nature-versus-nature debate cast into the centre of that murky universe, shown through the eyes of its brooding outsiders. Sadly those praiseworthy elements are hamstrung by an often baffling narrative that goes seriously awry in the final reels. It's hard to care about what you're watching if you've only a faint notion of what's going on. In addition, the idea that Perlman is able to put the smackdown on supernatural baddies via his big stony fist doesn't really make sense. Hellboy remains an interesting movie, but the iffy, tacky plotting and unimaginative climax keep it firmly in the lower reaches of the superhero canon. It still wipes the floor with Spider-Man."

","So, Hellboy, another comic book I never heard of, figured I would never get into it if I didn't know the story, so I stayed clear of the film, but I was renting movies and came across it and figured to just see what it was about. I watched Hellboy yesterday and this was definitely a fun film, it's so rare that we get the dark comic book story like Batman, except we have Hellboy, supernatural and dark, nice combo. Hellboy packs plenty of action and cool effects with an awesome story and a new anti hero to root for. It's so cool and ironic that we are rooting for a half man and half devil to save the world, right? Hellboy is an awesome hero with the super strength, great fighting skills, and best of all, gotta love the last cool pun lines when he saves the day.<br/><br/>In 1944, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm goes to Germany to stop a Nazi troop who are ready to open the gates of Hell. The Americans are able to stop the troop, but Trevor finds a creature, half man, half devil, he calls him Hellboy. Years later Hellboy is being used by the government to help the city out with super natural forces. But when Grigori Rasputin wishes to open the gate once more, he needs Hellboy to do so. In the mean time, Hellboy is fighting for the city and the woman he loves, Liz, and will not fall for Grigori Rasputin's tricks.<br/><br/>Hellboy is definitely a fun film to watch and it's a great comic book film. The only complaint I have about the film is just that the effects, as great as they were, there was still some very CGI moments and they were not believable. But I loved Abe Sapien, the special effects on him were beautiful and looked very real. I would recommend Hellboy for the comic book fans or even if you're looking for a dark super hero film other than Batman or The Crow. This is a fun movie and I'm looking forward to the sequel.<br/><br/>7/10"
"doctorsmoothlove","5","0","2","12 February 2008"," Too confusing and illogical to be memorable
","Well, the first of many problems with this film is its historical inaccuracy. The Germans were not in Scotland in 1941, hell they never even ""invaded"" England during World War II. Anyway and why did the film mention that Hitler died after World War II? Oh well, I'm sure that the comics explained this, but how is the audience supposed to accept all of this nonsense without some explanation? I was confused as to what was happening (with regard to the plot) that I couldn't follow characters very well. Something else that bothered me was why Del Toro didn't explain the monsters' origins. Yes, at the beginning, we are made aware of how some monsters were there, but not all of them. For example, why was Liz released to the insane asylum? These are some of the problems with the plot. Now, at least the rest of the film is decent, but unfortunately it's rather one-sided. Hellboy is the only hero who actually fights. Abe Sapien is nothing more than a supporting character. Nothing he does is irreplaceable. I know that he may not have had any fighting roles in the comics but his lack of fighting here made the film very boring. However, the one saving grace of this film was Hellboy's cynicism. His quotes such as ""You killed my father, your ass is mine"" were very amusing and refreshing. Also, the special effects were effective. It appeared as if Hellboy was fighting actual creatures instead of CGI creatures. Something that I found interesting was how the film portrayed American Cold War sentiments. The primary antagonist was Russian and the characters had to go to Russia to destroy the evil. So, if nothing else, the film is a cultural icon. I just wish del Toro had made it easier for non-comic book readers to understand."

A good choice first off. As we begin, we get a good back story and some character development. We also get some stylish and fun action to boot. So far, so good. Hellboy reeks of attitude. He is the very confident hero. Takes it easy and keeps it cool. Hellboy comes off as the slick hero and very likable. The CGI and FX deliver and are well done. This is a fantastic start.<br/><br/>So far, so good. Then we get a really unnecessary subplot. This hurts the movie badly. It reminds me of beauty and the beast. That's all about that. Another problem is after this, the movie gets increasingly bad. Hellboy winds up being rather sappy and far too over-dramatic. Hellboy starts taking itself too seriously. This is bad for the fact that this is all so very boring.<br/><br/>So what do we get? The first half of Hellboy was a fun action movie with a likable hero. The second half on the other hand suffers from a bad subplot and becomes far to dull. The thing is that Hellboy had the potential to be something special.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Hellboy isn't a bad movie, it is more like a tale of two movies. Overall in my book ranks as mediocre.<br/><br/>The Last Word: After a awesome take off, Hellboy hits a crash landing."

","It's a well known fact that comic book movies have become gigantic business in Hollywood right now. Big budgets, incredible CGI and star power rules in today's culture, and sometimes it can be for better or for worse. In the case of a certain 2004 film called Hellboy, directed by the visionary Guillermo del Toro and based on the cult-hit comic book created by Mike Mignola, It uses a combination of both minor stars and small-scale actors looking for a break to great effect. And I really, really hope that this movie shoots Ron Perlman into the big leagues.<br/><br/>For those who don't know the film as far as plot goes, the movie tells the story of a red-skinned demon with a tail, sawed-off horns, and a super powerful stone right hand named Hellboy...and he works as the Worlds Greatest Paranormal Investigator for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. He has brought to this world by the evil monk Rasputin (working for Nazis) and his sidekicks, the beautiful bitch Illsa and the zombie cyborg Kroenen. He was originally meant to be the one who would create the Apocalypse, but he denied his destiny and became a force for good. I will say nothing more about plot, so you can see the movie with relatively fresh eyes. I'm so clever.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Mignola's Hellboy character, and i just watched this an hour ago. del Toro has completely done what i have dreamed of: a kick-arse version of the comic that retains all of my favorite aspects, and adds a few more! Kudos, my good Mexican friend,, and look forward to seeing you for the sequel! Ron Perlman...hmm, what to say about the one man who is only rivaled by Ian McKellan and Andy Serkis being cast for their characters in Lord of the Rings in terms of the BEST CASE OF PERFECT CASTING!!! Ron totally embodies Hellboy, the way he speaks his one-liners, turns his head, and just about everything else completely blew me away. He was born to play the Red Guy, and he is gonna shine once again next year in 'The Golden Army.' Abe Sapien is played by both Doug Jones (body) and David Hyde Pierce (voice) and both are completely right choices. I will never forget Pierce's intelligent, gentle, and mesmerizing voice which gives a true 3-D personality to the fish-man. I wanna work with this guy someday.<br/><br/>There are many other things i wish to say, but i have to finish here soon. I'll say them quickly: a super-kick-ass cool villain in Kroenen, Karl Rodan being stellar as Rasputin, Selma Blair bringing pathos and humanity to Liz Sherman (a girl who controls fire) and John Hurt as the great Prof. Trevor Bruttenholm (pronounced Broom) In the end Hellboy is a truly great film. I must go now, but i totally recommend it! 9/10!!!!"

","After seeing this movie during its initial release I remember leaving the theatre feeling that I had gotten my money's worth of entertainment for the day but not as thrilled as I did after seeing X-Men and Spiderman. Remembering it as being a bit campy but fun, I assumed it would inevitably fall into that ever-increasing pile of Saturday matin√©e adventures that would eventually fade and ultimately be forgotten from that enormous movie data bank in my head. But since that first viewing at the cinema, I have seen it a few times on TV and I have come to the conclusion that I really like this campy, fun movie. I find myself stopping to watch a few scenes while surfing the channels on TV and keep getting caught watching it, like a ten year old, sneaking into the theatre.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is great and his performance is what carries the film. I love the way he delivers the comic book style dialogue and one-liners. I particularly like the time period the story is set in and the cinematography. Awe hell...I'm going to get the DVD."

","Count me among those who didn't expect to like this movie. I'm not a big fan of comics, or superhero based movies... or into movies like Alien... so of course I had to be strong armed into watching this.<br/><br/>I love it, it's one of my favorite movies. Sure there is flaws, inconsistenties... big deal. It's a movie... and it's a fun movie at that. The performances are fantastic, the story is fun and it's just an enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>This movie is now added to our DVD collection and sits in the stack of ""constants"", the movies that are just plain fun that I can watch over and over and still enjoy."
"danhyndman","5","0","1","1 July 2006"," Formulamatic Comic Book Adaptation
","Hellboy starts out promisingly: Nazis and other villains attempt to summon evil forces from beyond our universe in an apocalyptic (and even Lovecraftian) opening scene. However, when the action switches to the present-day, the film turns into a formula-laden comic book adaptation, closely resembling X-Men, but with less success.<br/><br/>The action is nearly non-stop: the villains are bent on world destruction and Hellboy and his allies fight a nearly constant stream of hell-spawn hounds (which are a nightmarish cross between apes and crab-like things) in their attempts to stop them. However, it feels rather routine, as if we've seen it all before and have a good idea were it's going.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman is exceptionally good as Hellboy and, in a comic-book way, his character is convincing. He possesses incredible strength and is seemingly indestructible; yet he is socially awkward and is basically living in a comfortable prison. Jeffrey Tambor provides comic relief as the director of the secret government agency dedicated to fighting supernatural threats (think, Men in Black as the apparent inspiration here). Tambor is charged with the almost impossible task of keeping Hellboy a secret from the public and providing official denial, although 100's of people at a time witness Hellboy in his frequent appearances, whether he is fighting monsters in the subway, or pursuing the object of his affection: the beautiful and demure Selma Blair, who is troubled by her own fantastic (but basically uncontrollable) destructive powers.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is somewhat weak compared to Perlman, Tambor, and Blair, in particular the young FBI agent who is assigned to keep Hellboy out of trouble. However, his weak character may be intentional so that Hellboy appears that much more impressive in comparison. There is also a well-intentioned fish-like man who is brilliant, but nearly completely ineffective when he faces the forces of evil.<br/><br/>The villains are supremely evil but seem very two-dimensional, as if they never escaped the page of a comic book. The connection between them and the hell-hounds, although they are common enemies of Hellboy, remains unclear. It seems that both the ""human"" villains and the hell-hounds are simply dedicated, in their own ways, to bringing about hell on earth.<br/><br/>There are a some humorous moments (usually provided by Tambor's bumbling and Hellboy's one-liners). There is also a scene involving an re-animated corpse which is really hilarious. However, Hellboy is mostly just a stream of routine comic book action. Which is fine, if you like comic book action; however, the film could have been much better with a more imaginative story line."

","I love comic book based movies.They are awesome and wonderful escapism.Mythology luring on the screen and beyond those stories is something left for us to think. One of my all time favourite comic book movies include Spider-Man 2,Batman Begins,X-men and many more.<br/><br/>The only comic books I've ever read are Spider-Man,Phatom,Batman Begins, Justic League.I'm familiar with most of the comic book characters from watching the animated series.I loved to watch those Animated series featuring my favourite characters.X-men to Batman to Superman and Spider-Man and etc.They are highly creative and fascinating dramas,based on the Characters driven from a comic strip.<br/><br/>ButI only started reading comic books after I watched this film.I never even heard this Character before,until I watched the film.I never thought this film deserved a review or to be commented when I first saw it but now watching it a few more times,I found it really something different.Right after this I started to get my self familiar with the roots of these Superheroes and the very place they originated.Comic books are more than just Hand Drawn entertainment,or storyboard if you can say that.They grow beyond our imagination and beyond those pages.Those characters have such a definite description of themselves that you can simply relate to their situations emotionally and otherwise.<br/><br/>Spider-Man for example,in the sequel there are various issues that teenagers come across,and there no other way to deal with that than watching how Peter Parker,despite having all those heavy burdens and pressures and troubles decides in the end to continue his path as a superhero,because he never gave up.And I think that really relates to every teen out there,including me.<br/><br/>X-Men movies/Comic books can definitely relate to those people who fear of being neglected because of their diversity and their different background and how the world hates them.Here in the movies and especially in the Comics they give you a definite thought that just because you're different doesn't mean you don't deserve equality and this really elevates these movies.<br/><br/>And here comes Hellboy.A fascinating Fantasy Action Adventure that looks so unique and outstanding that it's hard to compare it with other films.This is one of the better Comic Book characters brought to screen,unlike the mediocre Punisher and Fantastic 4.<br/><br/>The makeup,the Sets, the looks and Characters are perfect.There so much humour and style here that it makes everything so much fun to watch.Although the plot is disappointing.But the fantastic Script and Ron Perlman as Hellboy makes it up for it.<br/><br/>There is enough sizzling action and wonderful Adventure there that keeps the viewers satisfied.ALthough I wouldn't say this is one of the best Comic Book Movies,it certainly is a welcome addition into that genre,and I definitely love the way the Title Character is presented.<br/><br/>This has flaws and plot holes,but that never comes into its way from becoming the ultimate fun-house entertainment.It doesn't really stretches your imagination or anything but this is definitely worth a look and I really liked it.<br/><br/>I would be honest to say that Superman is my least favourite characters. I like those superhero characters that really could exist in real life.For example Spider-Man,there could be possibility for it to be infected by a spider and become a superhero.<br/><br/>Then there is Punisher and Batman,both have no superpowers whatsoever,but they fight crime in a way anyone who thinks he or she should serve justice.<br/><br/>Hulk,X-men,Phantom,Fantastic 4 and such.I like Superhero characters that are real but not fantasy based. Superman is a rare possibility and so is Hellboy.And I believe many other characters like these.But nevertheless,they become part of our lives,we worship these characters.We love who they are and we wish to become just like them.<br/><br/>This film is none of that,but it is something different and definitely wonderful to look at."

","Hellboy, comic's beloved paranatural investigator comes to the big screen in this live action extravaganza of crap.<br/><br/>Like one of the lesser episodes of X-Files, Hellboy delves into the ""mythos"" of Hellboy, choking his origins down our throat without bothering to tell an entertaining story while they are at it.<br/><br/>In a rush to give us all the characters from the comics, Guillermo Del Toro fails to give any of them any life. Consequently we don't care the least bit when any of them are placed in mortal danger and by the time the movie is over the only thing left to say is, ""So what?"" The effects are nothing special and the fight choreography is best described as uninspired. This movie is a waste of time, money, and film."

","Warning, this a very poor translation of the comic. Without the subtlety, craft to the narrative and the emphasis on mythology/religion that the comic did so well, this is a flat clich√©d affair. We certainly didn't need the dull X-Filesque conspiracy focus.<br/><br/>Hellboy himself is portrayed well by Perlman. Abe is well conceived also, but the plot is to static and lacks the comic's ethereal mix of intelligent narrative and deep characters. Certainly Rasputin comes off the worse lacking strength, depth and presence.<br/><br/>If you've read the comics, aside from the visual impact of Perlman, you'll find this lacks the atmosphere, presence and maturity. If you've not read the comics, you'll be fooled into think Hellboy is a silly concept. It probably is - if you don't know how to craft it into something special. That's the mistake of this movie; it takes a complicated and atmospheric comic and straightens out all the twists and turns. Not good."

","A demon is found back in WW2-era England by some serviceman after some Nazi's conjure it up. Stricken with the rather unfortunate name of Hellboy, the demon grows up under the strict supervision of the American government, with other people with abnormalities. Now evil Rasputin is back to finish the job he had started back in the day and it's up to Hellboy, his new handler John Myers,(Rupert Evans) and his love and fellow freak Liz (Selma Blair) to put a stop to that. This was a pretty enjoyable film. Kind of like ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""X-Files"". Ron Perlman does a good job with the loner, wisecracking persona of Hellboy.

","Not great, not awful. Hellboy is a strangely put together film. It's not really action-y enough to be action. Not dramatic enough for drama. It's a summer movie that's slow and plodding. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.<br/><br/>The first thing to notice is the art direction. Every room is a masterpiece. Every costume is superb. This is a great, great film to watch for background. Color, lighting, set design are all top notch.<br/><br/>Too bad, then, that the script just doesn't live up to their lofty achievements. The post skips nimbly over some rather thin flooring that threatens to become holes any second. The dialogue, too, is rather sketchy. Especially in the beginning. This movie feels like one that had a lot of footage left on the floor.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, but we don't ever really know anything about the characters. No one has any real development. They just are, and they continue to be throughout the film.<br/><br/>This is a film that I would recommend for a day that you are feeling lazy. Don't think too much about it. Just sit back and let it wash over you. Maybe you will fall asleep. Maybe you will make it all the way through. Either way, you'll probably enjoy the experience."

","Del Toro did an acceptable job here. The opening scenes especially where we learn the origins of Hellboy and the enemy to be reckoned with. It's detailed and compelling and remains loyal to the comic. Ron Perlman is awesome. He has a gift of giving the ""brute"" humanity(i.e. ""City of Lost Children"".) <br/><br/>So, what went wrong? Selma Blair, that's what. She is vapid, unpleasant and barren of any emotion. I would like to say you just don't care about her character here, despite her best effort, but she just doesn't seem to put forth any. During what could have been a touching moment between her and love-interest Hellboy, she pauses for drama, but you're really expecting her to call off camera... ""Line?"". On a side note, Selma did well in her role for ""Cruel Intentions"", where she played a spoiled socialite-on-the-rise who is naturally vapid, unpleasant and barren of any emotion. To this, I attribute her current success, as she probably caught the attention of many filmmakers. But now that she is mucking up lead roles someone needs to say enough is enough, and I for one am crying uncle."
"basrutten","6","0","1","23 July 2005"," Somewhat of a mixed bag
","What do you get if you mix a 7-foot red demon with a temper, a fish-person, a girl who can set herself on fire, a reincarnated Rasputin, a knife-wielding gas-mask-wearing Nazi and a lot of other nonsense together? The answer is ""Hellboy"", a super-hero movie that tries to set itself apart from the crowd by taking a far more over-the-top approach than most contemporary super hero movies. In spite of the rather silly premise, it actually works. Well, almost.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" starts out very strong, with some great action sequences, an interesting background story, and a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to keep up this level of quality towards the end.<br/><br/>After the novelty wears off, I quickly found myself becoming a bit bored, due to a number of reasons. First of all, the story really isn't up to much: it's the usually tale of the bad guys trying to bring about the end of the world, and it isn't worked out very well.<br/><br/>The characters, with the exception of Hellboy himself, aren't that interesting either. The bad guys are fairly generic and not really frightening, and, despite some efforts to flesh them out, I didn't really care about the good guys either (contrary to, e.g. ""X-Men"", or ""Spiderman""). The fact that Hellboy is just about completely invulnerable no matter what happens also doesn't help, as it kills much of the suspense.<br/><br/>The action sequences in the start of the movie are very over-the-top, which makes them very enjoyable. Gradually, though, the movie takes on a somewhat more serious tone, which IMHO didn't work out very well. And although there are some genuinely funny parts in the movie, I found most of the one-liners and jokes not nearly as funny as they were probably intended.<br/><br/>The special effects were a mixed bag as well: the CGI looks fairly good, but the movie also seems to use a lot of conventional effects (make-up and costumes) and they often look fairly fake.<br/><br/>In the end, I have to say that ""Hellboy"" is somewhat of a mixed bag. It starts out great, but the thin story and the poorly worked out characters, it failed to keep me really interested.<br/><br/>*** out of *****"
"moviemanMA","5","0","1","5 July 2005"," Hellboy...Hell No!
","Some movies just don't live up to the hype. Hellboy falls into this category. With a story line that is way out there, this movie really just doesn't work. Being a fan of comic book superheroes, I enjoy a plot that is at times...out there. But this was just too weird. The idea for Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) the character is kinda neat, but the other characters, especially the villain, aren't good.<br/><br/>The character I speak of is none other than Grigori Rasputin, a man who is dead...but not. So he's sort of a zombie, but he has human qualities...like fighting. The man with no eye lids, lips, and a couple of other body parts missing, he hides behind a mask and body suit. After a couple of spins on the heart winder (his body is run by a special device that when turned...gets him going), he is ready to go. This is absolutely the most ridiculous character ever conceived.<br/><br/>Hellboy must save the earth from the wrath of Rasputin. With the help of Ape Sapien (voice of David Hyde Pierce), an amphibious, intelligent, cross between a human and a frog/fish, and a girl who lights on fire named Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), these ""freaks"" show up to save the planet from of course, total destruction.<br/><br/>My advice is to stay as far away as possible from this picture. The sequel Hellboy 2, directed by the same director as Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro, hopefully won't be as bad, but will probably be like it's predecessor...bad. Hellboy should go back where he came from!"

","I came into watching Hellboy with mixed emotions over what to expect, and hey, guess what? I'm leaving with mixed emotions! In what appears to be a big stretch, Ron Perlman plays a big lug. Well, OK, let's be fair, instead of a big hairy lug like he played in Beauty and the Beast, or a very odd lug in City of Lost Children, in Hellboy he stretches and plays a big RED lug. With horns. His name is Hellboy, a demon child birthed by an experiment in the third Reich to start the fall of Mankind. Or Something. To be honest, the plot is really ridiculous, something about Rasputin, an unstoppable third Reich assassin, and doomsday. The parts where it somewhat gets interesting is Perlman's dry delivery on his inability to pick up chicks when they don't really go for a big red lug with horns driving a garbage truck. Finally, if a film has to resort to casting Jeffery Tambor as an action star, well, you've got problems from the start."

","the evil monster made no sense. It had something to do with Nazis and laying eggs and something about how the monster could reincarnate itself. I'm not sure how it all fit together; it wasn't explained well. Hellboy himself was kind of neat. The make up and costume were well done, but the one liners fell very flat. Hellboy's girl had a unique talent; too bad it wasn't show cased much. The fish guy was neat, but if they were going to throw other freak crime fighters in, then they should have had a handful of them. But, what I really didn't care for was the monster and the evil guy because they made no sense. How did the monster come to be? Was it brought to earth by the bad guy? Was the bad guy some type of demon or devil worshipper? And what was with him controlling the ugly faced dead Nazi guy, who was a master with the sword? I never understood how he did it. And who was the blond working with the evil guy? Also, the movie set up how much Hellboy depended on his father, but when the father kicks the bucket, Hellboy isn't too upset. He gets over it awful quick.<br/><br/>And if they were going to have monsters in this, then there should have been several types of monsters to keep it more interesting.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I know this is based on a comic book, but I didn't think it was anything like Spiderman or X-men. I really liked those movies, but didn't think much of Hellboy. So, I only recommend it if you think you have to see every special effects movie out there."
"freakoo23","7","0","1","28 January 2005"," Hellboy Review
","Hellboy falls in line with practically every other comic to movie release. It does many things good and many things bad, but in Hellboys case, the good far outdoes the bad. Having said that, I really enjoyed Hellboy and I thought that the film was extremely well done. Even the opening credits have enough flair to keep you entertained. The cast is extremely versatile with there characters and I think that the casting director did a great job in finding great actors to play the parts. The film begins during World War II. With Hitler losing ground in Europe, the war is turning to favor the Allies. Hitler, in a desperate act, decides that the world must come to an end. He hires Grigori Rasputin and others to use black magic and create a portal to hell. This will cause a chain of events that leads to the end of the world. When the U.S government finds out about this plan, they send a special force team to Germany in order to foil Hitlers plot. After the portal is opened a demon crawls out and is rescued by Trevor Bruttenholm, a scientist who joined the special forces in Germany. He raises Hellboy (Perlman), a name he called him since he was a child, to be an efficient minister of justice for all the monsters that continually manifest in the United States. One day, while on a routine mission, he discovers that Rasputin survived the ordeal more than 50 years ago and is back to once again try to bring about the end of days. This leads Hellboy on a mission to save the world, get the girl, and avenge the death of his father. Classic stuff. He is joined by his love interest Liz Sherman (Blair) who is also a freak who can set her self on fire. Together they have many tasks ahead of them, and in the end great sacrifices have to be made. I really did enjoy this movie, the direction was nice and the acting was great. There was a lot of subtle humor littered throughout the movie and that made it all the more enjoyable. However, some parts of the film really held it back. For example, the plot is very unorthodox and sometimes you're not sure what is going on. This causes some huge problems when you're trying to follow the story. Also, there are a lot of loose ends that are never really tied up, or that are never fully explained. But the entire thing put together is a worthy movie that was well directed and nicely put together.<br/><br/>OVERALL THOUGHTS ON HELLBOY<br/><br/>Entertainment: Funny and exciting. 8/10<br/><br/>Plot: Hard to follow at times, but still mildly interesting. 5/10<br/><br/>Acting: Very nice. Perlman is wildly funny and witty. 9/10<br/><br/>Music: Fast-paced and exciting, but a little generic 7/10<br/><br/>Direction: Fits the genre, very nice. 7/10<br/><br/>Alberts Analysis: A very good movie with strong characters that is held back by the lack of plot explanation. 7/10"

","Superhero flicks are all the rage right now and Hellboy is yet another one to ponder. Unlike X-Men or Spiderman, I've never actually read a Hellboy comic so I went in knowing next to nothing about the character.<br/><br/>The movie gets a major boost with the casting of Ron Perlman in the lead role. Perlman is great as Hellboy and he breathes considerable life into the character. The best scenes were the ones where Hellboy was just being Hellboy. I liked watching his various girl problems and really enjoyed his conversations with the other characters in the film. <br/><br/>It's too bad the actual superhero aspect of the movie doesn't match up to Perlman's performance. I just never got interested in any of the action scenes. The villains didn't interest me and I actually got bored watching Hellboy fighting the same monsters over and over again. I can't give this movie more than a 6/10."

","This is quite a winning film; raw action with supernatural references, great CGI work, and a firm cast makes this one of the most original and entertaining films I've seen in 2004.

Other notable performances include John Hurt, Jeffery Tambor, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans, Doug Jones, and Karel Roden to name a few. <br/><br/>Let it be known that this isn't just a straight up shoot-em-up/ beat-em-up. Guilliermo Del Toro manages to mix in the perfect amount of comedy, romance, and an occasional tear jerker without taking away from the central supernatural core of the film. All in all, a fantastic romp through the depths of Hell that even Virgil can't top. See this film!"
"jwhale9382","8","0","1","17 November 2004"," Let's hear it for the 'Boy!'
","Hellboy was just a great movie. Of course, I like superhero movies. Well, here we go...<br/><br/>Ron Perlman portrays Hellboy. Perlman gives the character a tough guy attitude (the demon), but still shows his emotional side (the man). John Hurt does a great job playing Hellboy's father-figure, Prof. Trevor Broom. He's tough on HB, but still treats him like a son. He's the only person that HB absolutely respects. There's also great acting from Selma Blair (Liz Sherman), Jeffrey Tambor (Agt. Manning), Rupert Evans (John Myers) and David Hyde Pierce (voice of Abe Sapien). There's more than enough humor in this movie. Most of it comes from Hellboy, but everybody has their funny lines and funny scenes. The humor also helps to keep you interested. The one thing I love about this movie, besides some cool CGI, is the supernatural references made in this movie. First of all, the evil, Russian monk, Rasputin is the villain. Also, in the deleted scenes, there is a reference to the Tunguska Event (a big, mysterious explosion in Siberia). There are lots of other references, but I'm not going to list them all right now. But the one thing I liked most about the movie was the characters' desires to be human. This showed that they were more than just monster-bashing mutants and enabled the audience to better relate to them.<br/><br/>Good actors, some human emotions, plenty of humor, and a great action story about the supernatural. All in all, I say let's hear it for the big, red monkey."

And hits the spot with the right amount of (black) humor. <br/><br/>I think it's the best superhero movie till this moment.

","One of the biggest perks of ""Hellboy"" comes from the charisma of the massive red demon of the film's title, who is played magnificently by Ron Perlman. Perlman is barely recognizable underneath that dense makeup but his tough-guy attitude and his rough voice give him away.<br/><br/>And this is one of the many reasons I found ""Hellboy"" to be so entertaining.<br/><br/>Adapted from the Dark Horse Comics character created by Mike Mignola and skillfully directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Hellboy"" is one hell (no pun intended) of a roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro, who reached mainstream success when he directed Wesley Snipes in 2002's ""Blade II"" (which also featured Perlman in a key supporting performance), knows the material inside out and runs with it.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" is definitely one of the more ambitious comic book adaptations in recent years, and is also one of the more faithful. (Before seeing this film, I went to my local book store and I picked up ""Seed of Destruction"" and read that, which is where I got most of my information regarding ""Hellboy."")<br/><br/>As a film, it captures the spirit and excitement of Mike Mignola's Nazi-spawned demon hero, who battles the forces of Hell with a really big gun and an attitude. In the closing days of World War II, renegade Russian monk Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), who is working with the Nazis, brings Hellboy into our existence in an effort to help turn the tide of the conflict in favor of Adolf Hitler. The Allies stop the ceremony and Hellboy is adopted and raised to adulthood by a benevolent scientist, John Bruttenholm (John Hurt).<br/><br/>Rasputin will stop at nothing to bring about the Apocalypse but needs Hellboy to do it. Hellboy on the other hand, knows that being 7 feet tall and red can be very lonely, and he's fallen in love with Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), who can start fires when she becomes excited.<br/><br/>""Hellboy"" is a wondrous marvel from start to finish and I enjoyed it very much. I waited until the director's cut came out before I would comment on this movie so I could see it in all of its visual glory.<br/><br/>8/10"
"imdb-3621","10","0","1","29 October 2004"," Best comic book adaptation ever
","I love this movie. I saw it four times in the theater and four more times since I bought the 2 disc DVD. I am now waiting with bated breath for the Director's Cut DVD which is still on its way to me. You may wonder why I love this film so much since I am not into comic books nor do I usually love this kind of action film and I have a very simple answer for you: Ron Perlman, Ron Perlman, Ron Perlman, and also John Hurt.<br/><br/>It's the subtext of their father/son relationship in this film that really makes it for me. That, and also the Catholic subtext to the film, that take this film far beyond films that have a much more serious surface. But the great thing about this film is that the surface is so much fun as well. The film works on so many different levels. That's one reason why I watched it more than once.If I really like something I will almost always watch it again at least a second time. If I like it just as well or even better the second time around it's a good film. If I like it the most on my seventh or eighth viewing than it's a real classic. <br/><br/>The Catholic subtext of this film also ended up making viewing ""Hellboy"" one of the major recent spiritual experiences of my life. Frankly, in my opinion this film isn't just destined to be one of the best of 2004, it is destined to be one of the great classics of this decade.<br/><br/>I'm not a reader of comic books, but I loved this film so much I sat down and read everything I could get my hands on by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola.<br/><br/>I also read the prose novels written by Chris Golden based on Mignola's characters and all of the short stories written by horror writers also based on Hellboy. I've read all of the spin-off comics as well. The comics are just as great as the movie. Or I really should say that the movie is just as great as the original comics it is based on even though the adaptation in the film changes some of it.<br/><br/>I haven't become this enamored of something since I first read ""Lord of the Rings"" when I was 16. I read that book 30 times and saw each of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films three times. I did enjoy those films, but it says something about the movie ""Hellboy"" that I've seen it eight times and counting. ""Hellboy"" is not necessarily a better movie than the ""Lord of the Rings"" film, but it is a better adaptation, in my opinion, of its original than Jackson managed with Tolkien.<br/><br/>Kudos to Guillermo del Toro for bringing Mike Mignola's big red hero to the screen with such panache. And a big kiss to Ron Perlman for bringing him to life in a larger than life way. I've so fallen in love with Hellboy, both movie and comic, that I've written five fan fictions based on its characters and am working on the fifth chapter to my latest story. And I usually HATE writing.<br/><br/>I hope ""Hellboy 2"", scheduled for release in 2006, will be as fresh, funny, and original as this ended up being for me."

","I have to say I'm not really into the whole superhero/comic-book adaption genre; I didn't think much of Spiderman, hated the Hulk and find Daredevil hilariously ridiculous. The only superhero that gets me to the TV is Batman, I think even Batman and Robin wasn't that bad. Owh and I really like X-men and X-men 2, just because I'd like to be able to freeze things or to lift stuff with my mind. That all was until now, cause the X-men and Batman got company from Hellboy. There's a lot to say about this movie: The story of course isn't to original [Nazi's wanting to take over the world, with a Russian as the bad-guy..come on!] But the way the actors and the director brought the story was very entertaining and pleasing. Ron Perlman is fantastic as Hellboy, I don't think anyone could have done a better job. You come to think of him as a real person or mutant or freak or whatever, but at the end of the movie you love that guy and want him to get the girl. The girl, Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, plays a significant part in the story, for her Hellboy would do anything and he cares for her so deeply that he would die for her. She's has the ability to make fire, she's pyrokinetic, but isn't happy with her powers, she feels she's not human but also doesn't feel like a mutant. She just wants to be normal and to get that feeling she gets close with John Myers. John (Rupert Evans )is an FBI rookie hired to keep an eye on Hellboy. I have to say that this role is somewhat unimportant in the story and just doesn't really make sense. The director, Guillermo del Toro, did a brilliant job on this movie. The SFX are fantastic and on the whole the movie just looks so good. The fights are well-choreographed and very believable. The characters are portrayed in good way, you care for them and see 'm as real people. Except for the bad guy, Rasputin, he's hardly seen and when you he is, he just doesn't scare you. The real baddie was the 100+ year old Nazi Kroeger, he was like Rasputins bodyguard and with his knives and his looks he really freaked me out.<br/><br/>I really recommend this movie if you just wanna have an good night out, with nothing on your mind and just wanna watch a cool movie. It has a lot of funny one-liners innit, gripping fights, good acting and surprisingly enough romance. <br/><br/>This movie has everything go see it even if your not really into this genre like me!"

","With Spiderman, The Hulk, and The X Men crowding up the box office, you may not think there is room for another hero. But the superheroes will have to make space, because there's another hero in town, and he may just be better than all of them. But why should the Hulk be green with envy? Because director Guillermo del Toro has put together a film that is an incredible mix of adventure, romance and good old fashioned Satanism topped off with a huge red monster with a fondness for cigars. What more could you want!!! Hellboy begins in 1944 with the Nazis conjuring up evil forces to aid Hitler. However, after a confrontation with Allied Forces, the demon made for world domination falls out of a portal and lands in the arms of a scientist on the side of good. 60 years on, and working for the FBI, the small red horned baby is now a giant red monster. Although regularly saving the world from paranormal invaders Hellboy's very existence is only one of rumour to the average citizen. To keep this up, an FBI agent John (played by Rupert Evans) is drafted in to keep an eye on the horned one, while Hellboy himself keeps an eye on Liz (Selma Blair), a hot young woman who can turn herself on fire by thought alone. But trouble soon begins when evil baddie Rasputin rears his ugly head and makes a deal with dark forces to take over earth. And so it is up to the horny hero himself to step in and save the world. Without doubt one of the greatest transfers from a comic book page to the cinema screen, Hellboy delights in it's brilliant script, explosive story and romantic subplot that never feels strained or out of place. Scenes sparkle and the director of photography relishes the religious imagery that shadows over the films every reel. Tough, funny, with a genuine heart, Ron Perlman, as Hellboy, brings a depth to a role that could easily have been one dimensional. Rupert Evans lends good support as a rookie young agent and David Hyde Pierce is terrific as Abe, the fish man.<br/><br/>Comic book action heroes are sometimes hit and miss, but for this reviewer, Hellboy was heaven sent."

",". . . still pretty good. Not being a fan of comic books, it's no surprise that the name Mike Mignola and his creation is entirely new to me. The character premise and concepts seemed somewhat silly even in the same realm as Superman and Batman, and in a way it was silly. But it worked. <br/><br/>I can't deny Del Toro's craft and the underlying talent in this film, nor can I deny the very visible love these filmmakers had for the source material. Hellboy playfully captures the energetic look and feel of a comic book with its (literally) colorful characters, physics defying battles, and almost sitcom-ish setups (Hellboy on the rooftops eating cookies? Hilarious).<br/><br/>I've never been drawn to too many of Ron Perlman's performances; however, he was born to play Hellboy and I enjoyed every minute of him in red with sawed off horns. From subtle little gestures like hiding his cigar behind his back in the presence of his father, to the smart-ass/tough guy routine, to the matter-of-fact nature he confronts his epic battle-for-the-world problems with, Perlman was Hellboy.<br/><br/>And to ground the wild antics of the film's hero, Del Toro gives us the always great John Hurt as Hellboy's father figure. A man whose both sympathetic and authorative, vulnerable from age but, never-the-less, still strong. Were the role given to a lesser actor, Broom's face off with the villain would not have worked on as many levels (subtle and obvious) as it did, no where near as much information would have been communicated. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, from there my interest in the characters descends into a realm of 'eh' and 'I could live without it.' I did not like the Abe character (except when Hellboy was smarting off or blowing him off); Liz was interesting at times, but the little exploration for her was haphazardly handled. Kroenen and Rasputin both had their moments of glory (loved the reveal in Liz's room), but ultimately bored me one way or the other.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the monstrous Resurrection Hounds ¬ñ I didn't really care for their design (much like the Reapers in Blade 2.) I can't really pinpoint my exact reasons for disliking these elements; they just don't strike much interest in me.<br/><br/>Oh well, I can respect Del Toro and appreciate what he brings to the directing table. Kudos to Marco Beltrami for finding an appropriate score, and of course to Rick Baker for his awesome Hellboy makeup which proved crucial in accepting the character."

Adaptation of Mike Mignola's Dark Horse comic books about a demon escaping from hell onto Earth when Rasputin and the Nazis during World War II open a portal to unleash the apocalypse; the creature is taken under the wing by an American professor (Hurt) and then grows up a wise-guy operative for the FBI Bureau of Paranormal Research. Scripter-director del Toro's enlivens this wild, over-the-top extravaganza with an entertaining style and sense of humor, yet it cuts away to too many effects and monsters. Its best asset is Perlman's cheeky performance as the cigar-chomping, red-skinned Hellboy, feeding off enough attitude and one-liners.

Hell. He isn't even your average superhero. Brought forth by the Nazi's during a sacred ritual towards the end of World War II. Our hero was summoned by accident when the evil monk of Russian history/folklore,Grigori Rasputin was meddling with forces that lead to his undoing. With the twisted and evil monster trapped for another sixty years when things don't go as planned (US soldiers heroicly intervened). Hellboy is raised by Prof. Trevor ""Broom"" Bruttenholm (John Hurt), an expert in the occult. Our demonic hero is initiated in to the Beureau of paranomal research were he joins the amphibious, kind hearted, and clever fellow ""Freak"", Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce). When Rasputin returns once again with the aid of his minions the meniachal, undead asassin Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) and the monks faithful lover Ilsa (Biddy Hodson). Hellboy must unwillingly pair up with John Myers,(Rupert Evans) an idealistic, naive new agent of the Beaureu. Not only that but the big hunk of an evil basher becomes entangled in a love triangle with the pyro-telekinetic love of his life Liz (Selma Blair) and his new comrade. This movie I think was a combination of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and X-Men and somewhat like Daredevil. I think Ron Perlman does a great job doing Hellboy! I never heard of the comic book Hellboy until I saw this movie. The only thing I wanted to know about this comic book is if it was a DC Comics hero or a Marvel Comics hero? I find out it was neither. I am glad that Guillermo Del Toro is going to do a sequel this movie and Ron Perlman will return to his leading role, Hellboy!

","The whole idea of the movie was original & somewhat funny, so I was really expecting a much better story. Grigori Rasputin, Karl Ruprect Kroenen & Ilsa were excellent villains, but those cheesy monsters were quite annoying. I'm not talking about Abe Sapien, who was irritating at best. Why would Rasputin with all his evil powers use some dumb monsters for destroying the world? And how comes Del Torro thinks the details of these monsters' reproductive system is interesting for the viewers? At times I was wondering what was on the screen: a new installment of Harry Potter or a Ghostbusters reunion.<br/><br/>The acting is not great either. Though Ron Perlman was OK, the best performance I think was done by Karel Roden. As for the other cast members they were mostly not good. Selma Blair was particularly unconvincing.<br/><br/>Special effects are pretty good, but sometimes senseless & unnecessary. As for direction, it was something, which basically saved the film.<br/><br/>Despite the enormous stupidity of this flick, it has got a very inspiring & well written ending. It somewhat compensates the flaws of Hellboy: at least after the film my mood was improved & I didn't want my money back. Yet, this is not a good picture, so go for better options, if you have them."

","At long last, the film that Ron Perlman was born to star in hits the UK. Hellboy is adapted from the comic book by Dark Horse Publishing, and tells the story of a demon who just wants to be a good guy. Director Del Toro has held the rights to the film for a few years now, but wanted to raise his profile, and that of Perlman, before making the film. Blade 2 was the film to do that. Much like Blade, Hellboy is a character who is relatively unknown to all but the most fanatical of comic book fans. Again, like Blade, it is a character which is aimed more at the older end of the market.<br/><br/>The backstory√Ç‚Ä¶.Towards the end of World War 2, the Nazis were conducting rituals to tap into occult forces. One such ceremony was intended to tap into the power of Hell itself. However, the allied forces stopped the damage being done, but not before a demon child made its was through the gate. The child, with horns and an arm of stone, was adopted by a scientist, and raised to fight the evil in the world. This is Hellboy, and now, fully grown, he files his stumps down to try to fit in with the human world as he fights occult forces.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, this is the role Perlman was born to play. His looks, character, and nature are all perfect for the role of the 'gentle, brooding giant' figure that is Hellboy. Perlman captures the soul of the character so well, becoming a perfect translation from the pages of the comic. The inner turmoil of a being who so wants to be accepted as a human, yet tries to distance himself from others all the time is well portrayed here, and we get a glimpse into the heart of the guy. The wisecracks and quick one-liners are played with such a dryness by Perlman that you could think he missed his true vocation in life as a stand-up comic. Support from Hurt as his 'father figure', and Hyde Pierce as the voice of his aquatic comrade are also strong, adding extra flavour to the story. Not forgetting love interest, and pyrokinetic esper, Blair, who adds an extra sense of angst to the demon's soul.<br/><br/>The humour is one of the strongest aspects of the film. A story which is so fantastical could have been played out with all seriousness, and would have failed by doing so. It is the very fact that the film doesn't take itself all that seriously that enables you to suspend disbelief and accept the fantastical elements. The director Del Toro, who for once is given almost complete freedom on all aspects of the film (including editing, the one area which has upset earlier films by him), shows his knowledge of the source material by really delivering a film for the fans. The fact that he got Hellboy creator Mike Mignola on board to advise him on aspects must have helped a lot. Mignola will be staying on board for the second film, and is also involving himself in the script. This is, perhaps, one of the best comic-to-film translations ever, which the fans will be more than happy with. That's not saying that non-fans will feel alienated by the film. The story is, after all, an origin story, and gives plenty of story to draw in new-comers, and allow everyone to understand the background to this demon.<br/><br/>Suffice to say this is one which I will be watching again, and again, and with word of a 'director's cut' already in production (it was intended to have it ready for the cinema release in the UK, but they didn't manage it), I'm truly excited. Recommended to everyone."

","It's hard not to love Guillermo Del Toro as a human being: he exudes so much giddy optimism and love of his craft as to be contagious. His love of monsters, outsiders and more recently Mike Mignola's Hellboy has informed his own films for a long time and now, he gets to go back to his roots.<br/><br/>Hellboy is not a superhero comic, but it is a perfect world and hero for the comic medium. It has a very tricky tone, a blend of hard boiled thriller and B-movie action, mixed with Lovecraftian lore and a fascination for the occult. Its visual style, a significant part of its success, is no less difficult to translate effectively to the screen. Taken as a whole, it is easy to see why Del Toro would be instantly smitten, and it is admirable how many years of his career have been a series of strategic decisions to enable him to one day adapt this property. After showing his action chops with Blade II and horror mastery with The Devil's Backbone, he received a very timid green-light.<br/><br/>While he has made concessions to a wider audience by anchoring his film with one completely human everyman main character - serving as a gateway - and introducing a love story absent from the source material, Del Toro's otherwise stubborn loyalty to the comic is laudable: the tone is spot on, the look and designs are a beautiful blend of Mignola's and Del Toro's very compatible sensibilities, and Guillermo Navarro's photography often evokes the comic's hard contrast and rich primary colors.<br/><br/>The real coup is in the casting, and again we can thank Del Toro for standing his ground: he reportedly refused a significantly higher budget by turning down other potential leading men. Thank the stars, because Ron Perlman was born to be Hellboy, a transformation further aided by amazing makeup effects. He is ably supported by a very emo Selma Blair, the always wonderful John Hurt, and the Doug Jones/David Hyde Pierce combo behind fish-man Abe Sapien. On the antagonist-side, we have an inspired collection of freaks, chiefly Kroenen, cinema's finest SM-Nazi-ninja-zombie. How can a movie featuring such a delicacy not be worth a look?<br/><br/>Story-wise, things are a bit less than elegant at times, but the love and care at play often more than compensates, and you get the feeling the people behind this film probably thought this was the only chance they'd ever get to make a Hellboy film. As it turns out, they were wrong, and this is a perfect appetizer to the wonderful part II.<br/><br/>Much like the source comic, it is a bit of an acquire taste, but its wide-eyed, unapologetic geekiness is worth treasuring."

","A recent trend in the creation of super heroes is to add a characteristic looked down upon or seen as evil. This trend is very evident in the dark and Gothic late-night cartoon called ""Spawn,"" created by Todd McFarlane. The ever-growing popularity of ""Spawn"" created a demand for powerful, dark super heroes, a demand which has now been satisfied by the film ""Hellboy."" The 2004 film Hellboy, directed by Guillermo del Toro, is about a baby demon that was summoned by the Nazis and rescued by the Americans. This demon, aptly named Hellboy (Ron Perlman), was raised by America's paranormal adviser Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt) into a very bulky adulthood. Along with the psychic fish-man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and the fiery fire-starter Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), Hellboy is sent on a mission to stop the evil Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden) from instigating the apocalypse and ending mankind's existence. Guillermo del Toro was showing that things happen all around us that we cannot see. This was emphasized when the 'mysterious' Hellboy roams the streets to fight crime. This idea was also enforced by the secret paranormal association owned by the government. This theme was present (but vague) through the random plot twists and this idea seemed to be masked by the film's wry comedy. This movie was very well done, but not perfect. There were great action scenes where Hellboy wielded a rather large revolver against ancient beasts. Hellboy's wise-cracks and quirks, such as Hellboy's horns which he sands down to 'fit in,' put humor to even the darkest situations. The plot itself was well-written, and the make-up and special effects were amazing. Personally I would not buy this on DVD because the plot was predictable, but if you have not seen this hellish piece of cinema, go to the nearest Blockbuster and spend three bucks to see a movie that is definitely Cool as Hell."

","I've never read any of the HELLBOY comics before, and I went into this movie with an open mind........and when I came out I was pretty impressed. I liked this movie. Sure - there are some corny lines of dialogue, and when Hellyboy gets chucked around, it looks pretty comic-bookish and far fetched, but it's all good! :) Interesting characters too, and I liked the vision of hell as being a dark, empty void...and the seven gods (Ogdru Jahad) were A lot like some of H.P.Lovecraft's creations...I also hear that the director of this movie is deciding whether to make HELLBOY 2 or AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS? I'd go for the latter! He has the potential to do a good job! An entertaining movie, interesting theme (raising a demon to be a good guy) and a lot more..."

","Some spoilers.<br/><br/>As in a big red man with chopped off horns, with a fire starter, a psychic fish-man, Nazis and Rasputin. It makes for (what my friends tell me is) a great comic, and an entertaining movie. We are introduced to Hellboy at the tail-end of World War II when the Allied forces stop the Nazis and Rasputin (yes, the supposed ""sorcerer"" last seen in Russia's royal court--and in the cartoon Anastasia) from opening a portal to another dimension and bringing about the 7 Gods of Chaos to bring forth Ragnarok. Now I know the Axis powers wanted to take over the world, but I didn't realize that they wanted to destroy the world while at it. Anyway, it's probably just Rasputin with an apocalypse-wish. The Allies are able to nip the plan in the bud and the only thing that comes of the portal is a red-skinned baby with a huge hand, which John Hurt's Professor Broom befriends with a Baby Ruth bar. Broom will later head the secret FBI Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, which watches over prized government assets Hellboy, Abe Sapien (a psychic merman who reminds me of Frasier's brother Niles) and Liz Sherman, a pyro-kinetic (or fire starter if you will).<br/><br/>Rasputin has been resurrected, stronger than ever, and is planning to start up world destruction again. Apparently, the key to all this is Hellboy (which is why he was the first one to come through the portal). Hellboy, Liz, rookie FBI agent Meyers and FBI head Manning have to stop him before it's too late. It's a comic-book movie, with comic-book inspired fights that are fun to watch, and it's colored like a comic book, too: the stark red of Hellboy, the vivid interiors, and the darkness of Rasputin's palace-cum-hell mouth. In fact, the only colorless thing seems to be Selma Blair's (Liz Sherman) face, which is also quite revealing because she is cutting herself off from her emotions to control her pyrokinetic tendencies (just like Drew Barrymore's fire starter and not the X-Men's Pyro).<br/><br/>Although the movie is about supernatural entities and ruthless villains, the story is not devoid of humanity, and the most remarkable thing is that Hellboy is trying hard to be human--and succeeding magnificently. Hiding behind a mack truck body and a voice not unlike Darth Vader's, he is sixty but ages slowly so basically he's in his early twenties, and showing the gamut of emotions associated with that age. He gets aggressive, petulant, mischievous, and most importantly, he falls in love. That a minion of hell, destined to bring about Ragnarok, can do so--and save the world--then there's probably hope after all."

","This movie did as most comic book adaptations do... it was entertaining. The acting was decent, the storyline was decent. As were Spiderman, The Hulk, Daredevil, and about any other comic book movie... it is just aimed to entertain. Just like a good popcorn movie that has dull story lines but high action and visual effects, Hellboy follows in a long line of solid action flicks. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good action movie, without too much thinking, without too much drama, or any other deep seeded thought...In no way is it something that will have some significant impact on anyone, make anyone cry, or make anyone question some high priority subject matter but it was fun to watch."

","Hellboy is a fantastic action film that is definitely one of my favorites. <br/><br/>First of all, the costume design is great. The costumes for Hellboy and Abraham were uniquely designed to fit their personalities and they looked very real and full of details.<br/><br/>The visual effects were also spectacular too. The monsters were all designed with lots of details. The assassin also looked cool since he always had a gas mask on and he had the blades.<br/><br/>The action scenes were okay. They looked cool, but they did not require much skill. Hellboy just shoots a gun or punches the monster, nothing with martial arts or anything.<br/><br/>The acting, well, there isn't much to say about that. Nothing special.<br/><br/>The script was flawed. When Liz blew up the whole place with fire that blazed all 5 of the hounds, Hellboy, Myers, and Liz all still ended up being captured.<br/><br/>The theme was interesting.

","Had no idea what this movie was about, never read the comic series and wasn't aware of who the director was. I was pleasantly surprised though at how well made and entertaining this film is. The Nazi-paranormal linkup premise is great fun, and there is still plenty of life left in that premise even with the various movies and video games that have already capitalized on it. The special effects are stunning but controlled - the film doesn't hit you over the head with them at every turn. When they are unleashed, the sfx are just beautiful, and the set designs very meticulously crafted and lighting is exceptional. There are many scenes that use a kind of yellowish filter for effect and in the beginning sequence during WWII is shot will a a silvery-green look, somewhat like Saving Private Ryan, but with added unique coloration. The acting is actually engaging and the Hell Boy character humorously written. Overall, a really nice surprising gem."
"ed_metal_head","8","0","1","28 August 2004"," A Decent Comic Book Film
","Hellboy is easily one of the better movies that have been adapted from a comic book. Most of Hellboy's strengths are the result of director and co-writer Guillermo Del Toro.<br/><br/>Hellboy begins in the 1940's. A group of Nazis led by a mysterious sorcerer is trying to open a portal so that paranormal beings may enter to aid the Nazis in the war. However, soldiers stop the Nazis before they can complete their scheme. Afterwards, when the soldiers investigate, they find out that something has indeed entered through the portal before it was shut. They give that something the name: 'Hellboy'.<br/><br/>Fast forward to present day, Hellboy is now fully grown and works for the Paranormal Division, a secret unit of the FBI. This unit is led by Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm, the man who found Hellboy and serves as his father figure. Together with the rest of his unit, Hellboy battles evil supernatural forces. This is where the movie really begins, as an evil power seems to be rising.<br/><br/>The film itself moves at a nice pace. The focus is obviously on action, but there are comedic moments, that generally work. There is even some drama in the film, but while the attempt to include drama is praiseworthy, it does not work too well. Despite the fact that the plot is good, it does contain some holes that may frustrate the audience.<br/><br/>The direction of the film is definitely its strongpoint. Praise for this must go to Mr. Del Toro, as this is arguably his best film to date.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman as Hellboy seems to be an inspired piece of casting. Perlman is never brilliant in the role, but does what is required for the part perfectly. He also delivers some one-liners, most of which are funny. John Hurt also gives a creditable performance as 'Broom', Hellboy's father figure. Abe Sapien's (Doug Jones) scenes are enjoyable to watch, mainly because he sounds like supercomputer HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The rest of the cast give average performances: no one really stands out, but no one brings down the movie either. The weakest character in the film is Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). Blair plays her as a confused and emotional wreck throughout the film. Further Ms. Blair and Mr. Perlman have no on screen chemistry, which makes all the scenes they share feel awkward.<br/><br/>Visually Hellboy is brilliant. This is true especially in the wonderfully shot outdoor scenes, the best of which are the snowy ones. In fact, all the environments used are nice. The CGI effects also work well, with the exception being the evil monsters that Hellboy faces. Instead of being scary, most of them look as though they had been pulled straight out of a Men In Black film.<br/><br/>Overall, Hellboy is an enjoyable motion picture. Some good direction, a good performance by the lead actor and the occasional humorous moment help to cover up the film's flaws."
"depaget","Null","0","1","23 August 2004"," A funny, irreverent tale with it's target demographic firmly in it's sights.
","It's a comic book that's still a comic book. A pouting Demon, a kindly but dying adoptive father, a scheming FBI man and the re-emergence of Rasputin and his gang of immortal Nazi's are smashed together to create Hell on earth. It's a funny, irreverent tale with it's target demographic firmly in it's sights. <br/><br/>During WWII Broom (John Hurt) a paranormal adviser with the US army, happens across a clutch of Nazi's trying to lure Evil Incarnate through a self-made portal. What comes through instead is Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Flash forward 60 years and Hellboy (who's still developmentally in his 20's) is the FBI's secret weapon against all sorts of paranormal nasties. His companion in saving the world is Grigori (Karel Roden) a sort of Aquaman with a penchant for rotten eggs.<br/><br/>Hellboy is pining away for his love, Liz (Selma Blair) a literal firestarter, who insists on hiding herself away in a mental hospital. A young FBI agent, Meyers (Rupert Evans) enters the fray to wait on Hellboy's voracious appetite and provide grist for Hellboy's jealousy when he makes friends with Liz.<br/><br/>But evil stirs across town. Dispatched to the scene of a museum massacre, our heroes come across the Resurrection Hound (a sort of blubbery, wobbly dog) that multiples every time it is killed. The hound has been brought forth by the immortal Nazi's to wreak havoc and prepare the way for Rasputin to make his Evil comeback.<br/><br/>It's a comic book that's literally been made into a film. If that's your thing you're in for a ride. But if the occasional illogical plot points and rollicking ride through a by- the-number's-story that refuses to take itself seriously isn't for you - well pop over to more the more substantial Farenheit 9/11.<br/><br/>It's fun.

And, since its a comic book adaptation, it's important that it feels real.<br/><br/>The acting is super! I wasn't really a big Ron Perlman (I didn't hate him, but I didn't really care for him) before this movie, but I thought Perlman was PERFECT as Hellboy. And Selma Blair as Liz.

Granted, they're not perfect, but they're certainly better than Blade II's (Guillermo Del Toro's movie before Hellboy). In fact, I can only think of one scene I was really disappointed with in this film (Hellboy crushing the can with his stone hand).<br/><br/>The music in Hellboy is the best I've heard from Marco Beltrami so far. I don't think a bad score could destroy a good movie, but it could definitely subtract from its overall feel. Beltrami's score in this movie is fantastic!

"blackvelvetandapackofsilkcut","10","0","1","15 August 2004"," Quite Possibly The Greatest Comic Book Adaptation Of All Time
","All of my friends told me to stay away from this film.<br/><br/>All of my friends were wrong. <br/><br/>HELLBOY is quite possibly the greatest comic book adaptation of all time. And a solid film in it's own right. Guillermo Del Toro's visual style was perfect for the world of Mike Mignola. The characters came alive, three-dimensional, complete. <br/><br/>I have made it a habit to see all of the recent comic adaptations. I do this more as a show of support to something of my childhood than in expectation of quality or pathos. I was disappointed in the Schumacher Batmen. I was revolted by Berry's Catwoman and the new Punisher and Hulk movies. I enjoyed League of Extraordinary Gentlemen even though they took a brilliantly crafted work and watered it down so thin its taste was barely recognizable. I thrilled to see my X-men on screen - even though it wasn't them and the nobility of Erik Lehnsherr had been stripped of him and for some reason Bryan Singer had decided to adapt an adaptation rather than actually work from source. X2 was a little better. Though I encourage you to skip it and read Chris Claremont's novelization instead. Still, it was nice to see Collossus. Blade 2 was a farce. Spiderman surprised me. Spiderman 2 was a complete waste of time. When I read that Bryan Singer had signed to direct the new Superman movie I breathed a heavy sigh of discontent. I eagerly anticipate the new Batman film, even though the changes they have made to the storyline. I trust Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker even though I did not appreciate Memento. Following and Insomnia were good films. He has the proper temperament for a Batman film. The idea of a Fantastic Four film directed by the same man who directed Barbershop frightens me. The idea of a Tom Cruise Iron Man excites me. The idea of a Nicholas Cage Ghost Rider... whatever. Call back when you decide to go back to acting. I thought the idea of making Hellboy into a live action film was a terrible idea, doomed to failure. I'd always thought it would make a good anime but not a live action. I can admit when I am wrong. <br/><br/>Beautiful cinematography. Creature effects that utilized CG only when necessary. Lovecraftian references. References galore to the real world occult. A painstaking replica of the Spear of Longinus, in reality on display in the Hofsburg Treasure House in Vienna. Such detail. Such an epic feel. And yet such simple emotion underlying each character.<br/><br/>I understood John Hurt.<br/><br/>I understood Abe Sapien.<br/><br/>I understood Hellboy.<br/><br/>I even understood Grigory Rasputin, a man who has lived so long that he has actually come to believe that the world would be better given a fresh start and in his hands. I know people like him. I understand the mindset. The best villains aren't truly villains when you scrape beneath the surface.<br/><br/>Hellboy was a much more three-dimensional film than Spiderman 2 which has gotten so much press lately and been called the greatest comic film ever made, just as last year X2 received the same accolades. They had more action. Perhaps they were more kinetic. Hellboy had more depth and more visual texture making it more cohesive as a story and as as an exercise in the visual medium of film.<br/><br/>A good film."

This leads a young misfit expert in the occult, Dr. Broom/Bruttenholm, to an accidentally brought over devil child who becomes known as Hellboy. Decades later, Hellboy has grown up into a big, sardonic bad ass (played by Ron Perlman) who works for the government battling other evil monsters with a little help from his surrogate human dad Dr. Broom (played as an old man by John Hurt), his aquatic pal Abe Sapien, and his somewhat Gothic, fire starting lady friend Liz Sherman (Selma Blair).

Well, I found I liked the film even though Nazis aren't all that much fun in terms of villains anymore. There's an unexplainable warmth to this film and a sense of humor that makes it a lot more endearing than those self-righteous X-Men films. The film is helped greatly by the former man-lion of TV's ""Beauty & The Beast"", Ron Perlman in the title role, and I can honestly say I'll take Selma Blair over Kirsten Dunst, Jennifer Garner and Natalie Portman ANY DAY. The film is bogged down somewhat by the unnecessary addition of the young, effeminate FBI character, John Myers played by Rupert Evans, who was thrown in primarily to give all the little girls who weren't turned on by Hellboy's virility someone to drool over."

","Although I quite much enjoyed the Hellboy comic, I managed to keep my expectations at the minimum when beginning to watch this movie. When the ending credits started to roll on the screen, I felt heavily disappointed.<br/><br/>With League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Hellboy is a perfect example of how bad a movie you can make when the material the movie is based on is nearly perfect in all aspects. This is even more confusing when you keep in mind the fact that Mike Mignola was used as a creative consultant and he was on the set continuously during the making of the film (if I understood correctly).<br/><br/>Hellboy has numerous flaws, the most striking being the messing up of almost all the original comic book characters and making their personalities more mass-appealing and stupid with ""funny"" quirks. Hellboy himself is maybe the worst victim of this. <br/><br/>Most annoying of the flaws must be the compulsory ""new guy on the job""-character whose only meaning seems to be to make the viewers wish the death of his character. *SPOILER* Which unfortunately does not happen. *SPOILER* <br/><br/>The final of the big flaws is the total absence of any kind of gore or on-screen violence towards human beings. There's a reason behind this, and it is the sole reason to give the movie a PG-13 rating in the United States so that the movie makers get to rip off the money off as large an audience possible. This alone underlines quite badly the attitude the makers seemed to have towards the movie.<br/><br/>There would be a lot of more negative points to list, but I think those were the most important and obvious. Oh yeah, and the movie doesn't have a plot at all.<br/><br/>If you like the Hellboy comic, you are really going to be disappointed by this movie. If you have never even heard of the comic, you might even enjoy this. Being drunk or on heavy drugs. Take with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>PS.

In fact, my only really understanding of it was from the trailer and what I could gather on-line.  I was always more of a Marvel, Image, and D.C. fan.  I knew of ""Hell Boy"", but past that my knowledge was limited.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time and I just had to see it.  I love the dark quality and when they mix fantasy with history it just adds to the experience.  I was happy they had an actor play ""Hell Boy"" rather than using CGI like they did with the ""Hulk"".  Perlman pulled off a great performance and proved to me an actor could have played the Hulk.  I don't care what anyone says.  I am a lifetime Hulk fan and even though I liked the movie, I disagreed with then not casting an actor to play the Green Monster.<br/><br/>From movies like ""Hulk"" and ""Spiderman"" where my knowledge is far greater, I can tell where they took artistic freedoms with the storyline.  Of course, I have no idea how close they stayed to the comic book.  I liked what I saw and that's all I can base this on.  This movie was very interesting and pulled the viewer in.  There was always something cool happening, like crazy imagery.  It rocked. I would highly suggest it and there is another one in the making from what I hear.<br/><br/>Check it out.  Enjoy!"

","Cinematic clich√É¬©s can be tolerated if, at the very least, they bring to the fore some kind of extra added value, but with Hellboy the hackneyed core stands alone, bare and raw, for world audiences to see. Sad for them.<br/><br/>Another aspiring blockbuster very much akin to recent Van Helsing, HB's roots lie in, surprise surprise, comic books, and perhaps those thus aligned will glean some pleasure out of beholding this particularly tepid big screen adaptation. Unfortunately, unless you happen to be a fan of the source material, Guillermo del Toro's subpar product holds no enticement whatsover. Minimal, often insultingly poor, special effects and a story that wasn't original even before Raiders of the Lost Ark came out deprive the film of any serious potential, while its cast deploy disheartening letdowns in the performance department. Ron Perlman, long among Hollywood's leading choices for monster roles, and usually excellent, but now virtually absent John Hurt both suffer from not enough script and too much fluff as obstructions to proper execution. Perlman steps in a fallen demon child, born in our reality as a result of nefarious Nazi experiments in dark magic. <br/><br/>This Hellboy grows up to become a special agent for a counter-paranormal crime agency led by Prof. Bruttenholm (Hurt). Of course there's a few sidekicks and comic reliefs, like fish person Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), mentally supercharged love interest Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), and all-human FBI rookie John Myers (Rupert Evans). All of the above, even when put together, fail to generate any bonafide excitement. They can't even sustain a palpable interest level in the movie's lackluster proceedings, which soon degrade into trite ""good vs. evil"" rhetoric addled with CGI of a standard that wasn't eyepopping in The Faculty all those moons ago. Scant few action sequences, miserly use of one-liners and come-backs (now, what's a decent action flick without those?), as well as characters you can't quite get to caring about prevent Hellboy from reaching those higher, more rewarding planes of achievement. Or anyone in attendance from avoiding a rather placid kind of sleep. <br/><br/>Its only saving grace may be the somewhat entertaining villains, especially Ladislav Beran as ghoulish, coolly masked foe Kroenen, and Karel Roden as a funkier version of Rasputin, the evil (and now oddly undead) monk. This overall lack of appeal comes as a bit of a shock since, through respectable projects like Mimic and Blade 2, Director del Toro has proven himself a competent genre artisan. Perhaps next time round they'll get it right. Yes, there's a sequel coming. Whoop tee doo. Through visuals inferior to some video game titles now on the market, listless storytelling and protagonists that would obviously prefer to stay home and lounge rather than combat evil, Hellboy results in a tame product not worthy of its own infamy. Plus it's PG-13. Yuck.<br/><br/>Rating: * 1/2"
"ks4","5","0","1","2 July 2004"," Good popcorn movie, but that's about it.
","HellBoy<br/><br/>The story about a demon, brought back to hell to serve the evil, but ended up serving the good. Approx 60 years after HellBoy was brought back, the former evil mastermind, Rasputin, returns once again to bring doom over the earth, only one man can stop him, Hellboy.<br/><br/>Over the lasts years the new hype are superhero comic book adaptions to the screen, some of these have failed, some have been very good like X-Men 1/2 and Spider-Man 1/2. Here comes HellBoy, and obviously the expectations are high, and I got to admit, the movie fell through for me, I'm not saying it was the worst one ever, but it never really got to me, a true popcorn movie, 2 hours to unlock the brain and watch the screen.<br/><br/>I'm not going to lie, I prefer movies that takes some brain work, some deep movies where you can really get under the skin of the persons, of figure out the plot. This movie succeeds in neither, it's both a bit hollow, and the characters - except a few moments with Hellboy - feels pretty empty, furthermore the attempt to bring personal situations to the superhero world of Hellboy fails badly, the chemistry between HellBoy and ""Liz"" (Starring Selma Blair) works not too well, and generally I just thought that Selma Blair felt very miscast in this role. <br/><br/>This movie is generally what I would categorize as a ""Popcorn"" flick, not to much brain work, but a lot of action and very often use of CGI and other similar effects, this at times feels a little like an effect war, even though much of it is well done, I can't help myself thinking that it's all effects, one of the things I liked was how obvious it was that a person was playing ""Blue"", instead of that being a CGI character.<br/><br/>The direction of the movie is okay, the action scenes are smoothly done, even though I hate the classic element of ""A beats B, B beats A, A beats B, B beats A, A beats B and win."", That element is often used here, and it's kind of sad, it feels like the movie drags out a bit, it could have used the sparetime by personalizing more with the characters, anyway the action scenes are easy to follow and not confusing, well done and pretty entertaining, especially since they destroy everything around them, and I did find myself cheer for HellBoy, even though I knew he was gonna win anyway eventually. The future sight of ""The Apocalypse"" were the best 10 seconds of the film, a powerful sight, that may one day be even more realistic with the nuclear weapons etc. man possesses today, perhaps a hidden message here? Especially the sight of the newspaper were well done.<br/><br/>Sadly I think the director avoids the downsides of being a hero and all that, a downside that X-Men and Spider-Men portrays so well. There are a few moments of the film where the director tries to point it out, an example is the awkward scene between HellBoy and Liz in his room where he tells her that he wishes he could get rid of his looks and be normal, but he can't, a good promising moment there, but after that, it fades into the background and is not taken up again, unfortunately.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Ron Perlman is the powerful Hellboy, also a terrific performance for him, and his good humour fits the character well, all the other characters and actors in the movie falls through swiftly, some are average performances, like Rupert Evans as the FBI agent, not a bad performance, but perhaps not really many chances for him to show some good sides. As mentioned I found Selma Blair pretty poor in this role, and well that generally went for much of the cast, even though I must admit the FBI chief I hated, but in the end he got portrayed as a pathetic character suddenly socializing with HellBoy, not too well done.<br/><br/>Overall: A true popcorn movie, nothing less, nothing more, it had more potential, but fails to take use of it. If you feel like unlocking your brain for 2 hours, HellBoy won't let you down.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Ron Perlman and Selma Blair gave fair performances. The overall movie was enjoyable to watch and contained some genuine laughs.<br/><br/>However, it is bothersome that the current trend in fantasy/magic films, a trend that has been dominant for nearly two decades now, contradicts the very premise of the story. If you are going to give your characters supernatural powers and make them immortal than you must destroy them with similar but somehow superior supernatural powers.<br/><br/>It isn't just ""Hellboy"" that suffers from this illogic. Just about all fantasy films made today make the same mistake. Are they financed by the munitions industry?<br/><br/>When a character's indestructibility is demonstrated by having them recover from being blown up or having steel bars driven through their bodies than you can't kill them off later in the movie by driving steel bars through their bodies. It just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>For example, one of the truly fun things about ""Ghostbusters"" was its consistency: it used supernatural powers to battle supernatural powers.<br/><br/>Consequently, I rate this 5/10. Watchable, but illogical."

","I liked comic book characters as a kid, and still liked 'Spiderman' and 'Hulk' in theaters, so I wanted to like this film about one I never heard of before- HELLBOY! The word of mouth was good, so I gave it a chance. Big mistake.  Even though Hellboy himself was charming and should be given a sitcom or variety show, he just didn't have good material to work with. Hellboy, although clearly derived from the X-Man Wolverine in attitude, muscles, and facial hair, was fun and a devil bon vivant. The supporting characters were also quite fun, the professor played by John Hurt(Hellboy's adoptive father), the green FBI agent to appeal to chicks with his buster brown haircut, and Hellboy's other mutant buddy, Abe Sapien- a telepathic fish man. The fish dude, although listed as being played by another actor, had to be voiced by David Hyde Pierce of 'Frasier' TV fame- if it's not I'll eat some raw halibut! I expected the fish/hero to start complaining about his skinny wife Maris. Conversely, the bad guys and the monsters Hellboy had to fight weren't very appealing- they were either ridiculous looking or had no charisma whatsoever. It was also unclear as to what could stop them, or if they could be killed. They could survive some things, but be destroyed be similar types of attacks- it didn't even make fantasy film/comic book sense.<br/><br/>
  Another shortcoming with the film is it's excessive length. Two hours felt like ten, and the storyline seemed pointless. There also never seemed to be real tension, and the fight scenes were hard to follow. Go see 'The Mummy' or 'Hulk' again, and skip 'Hellboy'. Wait till he's hosting a talk show on TV to catch his act."

","I saw the trailer for this film quite some time ago and was left feeling with little hope for this film. Nevertheless I decided to watch it with the hope that I would be mildly entertained. I was wrong.<br/><br/>There is very little plot going on here, rather poor characterisation with really anti-climatic events proving the finale to the picture. Hellboy is an odd character at best but the thought of a character coming from hell is an intriguing one. All the other characters (whether they were in the comics or not - I really have no idea having never read them) were extremely droll in their execution and left a bitter after taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>The obvious selling point of this movie was the special effects, but even these were mediocre at best. Not a single ""big"" shot was done well with the majority of the film looking unpolished and incredibly fake. The supposed hell hounds were perhaps the worst case of this, especially when Hellboy was fighting one the in the train station. Quite clearly it was a man in a suit and looked more like a 1940s B-Movie than a turn of the millennium big budget blockbuster. In terms of visual effects, Lord of the Rings it ain't. Rather think Attack of the Triffids.<br/><br/>Unresolved plot lines, holes in the story, anticlimactic ending along with poor characters and worse special effects. I suggest you miss this unless you're a big fan of the comic or want to have your brain turn to mush for 2 hours. <br/><br/>Not as bad as Hulk but worse than all the other comic book films. Please Hollywood, STOP MAKING COMIC BOOK FILMS!!"

","Hellboy stinks.<br/><br/>Which inspired me to rent El Espinazo del diablo (The Devil's Backbone), directed by Guillermo del Toro as well.<br/><br/>The Devil's Backbone stinks.<br/><br/>And, Guillermo del Toro is in talks to do sequels as well.<br/><br/>Where all this stinks come from?<br/><br/>
I have an idea: Both films are competent at best, but they lack in inspiration and motivation. The visuals are crisp, ut give nothing to the story or content; the weakest point being the editing and storytelling..<br/><br/>
Hellboy's one-liners are constantly before a break in the scene, and there are no long takes. Drastic changes to the source make it ""sort-of"" good to the general public, instead of great to one or the other (sources say the creator of Hellboy approves of the changes, I think it's a lie). There is Constant dialog throughout the movie, and no progressive narration from Hellboy which ends the expressionistic/comedic overtones we have enjoyed in the books. And, despite the visuals looking crisp they are only competent to the look in the novels (the look is possible). I say it's not dark or has enough contrast.. But that would make it stand out, which nothing does here.<br/><br/>Comparatively, The D. Backbone always qued sound effects right before Santi enters, providing a much need obviousness to a scene we will be shown over, and over again without any furthering of the plot. The film could have been cut by 40 minutes. R-E-D-U-N-D-A-N-T<br/><br/>It's possible that del Toro was limited in his expression by his producers, but somehow I seriously doubt it, it's the storyteller."

","Another comic book has made its way to the big screen, and it is refreshing to see that this selection is dark and mysterious as well as lesser-known among the comic crowd. In this film, a team of heroic misfits is dedicated to saving the world from the ""things that go bump in the night"" with their secret weapon of a powerhouse, the titular Hellboy (played by Ron Perlman and referred to as `HB' in the film). He is confident and proud of his special gifts but after 60 years of seclusion, is eager for a taste of normalcy. Although they don't quite become the sum of their parts, the filmmakers paint quite a tapestry of primary-color action.<br/><br/>The film opens with a violent prologue set at the end of World War Two as the Nazis are desperate enough to test their first mystical weapon and bring hell to earth just to defeat the allied powers. A platoon of marines and President Roosevelt's paranormal specialist has surrounded the site and proceeds to disrupt the proceedings. Russian sorcerer, Rasputin (Karel Roden), and the Nazis are partly successful and they get the portal open long enough for a few things to slip through. One of those things is a little demon baby with a huge stone hand. He turns out to be friendly enough and grows to become the cornerstone of the American Bureau of Paranormal Research. Flash forward 60 years and the BPR is busy keeping down those other shameless creatures of the dark side when Rasputin is resurrected by his ageless Nazi lover and they renew the work that might bring about the end of the world. The BPR is having domestic problems keeping Hellboy under wraps as he tries to visit his estranged girlfriend, Liz (Selma Blair) and watches Hellboy's father figure, Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt), slip into the clutches of cancer. The new member, John Myers (Rupert Evans), might be able to fill the leadership role if he can just keep HB calm and comfortable.<br/><br/>The movie is at its best when riffing on the unspoken things that binds friends together, especially when the outside world is not a welcoming place. The Professor is a reject mocked and discounted by the marines who he is accompanying on the US military's first counter-paranormal mission. Myers, who is the audience's window into this strange world, has been demoted from regular FBI duty to be Hellboy's babysitter. There's Hellboy, who is desperately vulnerable because of his looks when it comes to his would-be girlfriend, Liz, who bears Herculean guilt for the lives she has accidentally taken with her nearly uncontrollable ability to generate fire. Quietly lending ESP intelligence to the group is the amphibious Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce) who has more mysterious origins, but who bears the burden of social isolation with far more grace than his counterparts. Although the Nazis are the group that put the evil of the movie in motion, could you ask for a more mysterious real-life personification of villainy than an undead Rasputin? His former Nazi henchman, Kroenen (Ladislav Beran), is eerily silent as he slices his way among heroes and does the world's best impersonation of a Trojan horse.<br/><br/>The work of keeping the world safe has made Hellboy a bit jaded, and he saunters in to defeat bad guys with the casual confidence of a bartender serving a drink to a regular that just doesn't know when to cut himself off. HB's heroic moments range from direct (saving John from a speeding car or snapping jaws) to the farcically comical (a box of kittens suddenly becomes a priority when duking it out with a bad guy in a crowded subway station). Simple visual jokes, such as John carrying a mountain of pancakes to try and satiate HB's voracious appetite while the big red guy trims his horns with a power sander are inspired glimpses into the day-to-day happenings of their quirky lives. The villains are remorseless, but not entirely cartoonish. They are evil, but rounded enough to give at least the illusion of depth. The henchman is obsessed with refining the tools of his sick trade, but likes to unwind while listening to his antique phonograph. Rasputin is wicked, but is also romantic and has enough of some sense of honor to offer a longtime enemy a quick and merciful end.  Making the villains more credible and vicious only makes the heroes more heroic for facing up to them.<br/><br/>With all of these characters assembled, one might expect an articulately layered addition to the comic-book genre of film. All this is not to say that there isn't fun to be had from watching ""Hellboy"". However, too many good questions are raised and left unanswered. Hellboy himself asks to know the reason that Agent John screwed up enough to get demoted from regular FBI assignments, but is still trustworthy enough to be the personal valet to the country's best-kept paranormal secret? It is never answered. How did Rasputin know about the connection between Liz and Hellboy? What caused HB and the Professor to have a falling out? They are all wonderfully realized characters, and the cast really deserves applause for their work here. It's just the story that doesn't go the whole nine yards in the end.<br/><br/>It certainly never takes itself as seriously as ""Daredevil"" did (that one ultimately collapsed under the weight of its own seriousness), but it never really soars to the ensemble satisfaction of ""X-Men"". It only falls apart in the climactic final act when everyone is in Moscow trying to defeat Rasputin's plan. Suspension of disbelief is allowed, but when all the characters that have kept you interested are tossed aside for sheer spectacle, the audience starts to disconnect. It seems at times to be preoccupied with violence. For example, does a final slugfest with another monster really need to be there when HB has already faced down his own creepy inner demon? But before all that, it is a quirky character tale of individuals who could only come from the world of comic books where something as simple as a candy bar is reason enough to come to the good side.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","So, I love superhuman super hero movies. But HB fell short big time. There's no tension or drama. It shows HB getting quite easily hurt where after a small fight with a small 'demon' he has to wear bandages, and he's all bleeding and stuff. But at the same time he's totally invincible regardless of what he goes up against. 99% of the movie is just talking, and you're sitting there dying for some more action instead of the endless extended scenes of two actors staring at each other not saying anything.<br/><br/>
Things happen for no apparent reason either. There's this main annoying demon, where if you kill it, it comes back as two. So they decide to tackle the situation by killing them all at once. The demon count is at 15 or something; logic would dictate if you killed them all you would end up with 30! <br/><br/>Or HB's main girl dies, and he whispers her name in dispair, and all of a sudden she's back to life. Why?!!<br/><br/>I'm sorry Ron, I think you're awesome, but the dudes who wrote the script didn't think it through. :("

All of the recent comic book movies have done an excellent job of tying in the romance/emotional struggle part without sufficing any action or thrills.  This movie fails at that.<br/><br/>This movie was honestly a strange romance that was not very focused. For those like myself who arent familiar with the comic, hellboy is released from hell in a bizarre nazi ritual believed by them to release these demon gods who will control the earth.  Well, they all get massacred and 60 years later, three of them reunite to raise hell (i had to).  Enter hellboy, fishman, carrie, and alfred (the names were changed to protect the comic characters actually interesting identities.)<br/><br/>Much of hellboy's dialogue is muffled by his constant cigar smoking, and the rest of the plot was somewhat muddled as well, never giving you a clear picture of these people that were going to destroy the world (except for sword guy, who was actually pretty lame).  The climax battle is brief and uninteresting, and the action scenes are broken up by the developing relationship between pyro chick and hellboy.  One final comment, i am sure this was out of the comic book, but tentacled beasts really are not very intimidating.  Oh yeah, one more thing, the cgi was pretty bad (especially the flames) and the main bad guy reminds me of the characters in the movie ""the guyver"" (which is great).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I guess if you are a fan of the comic book, this would probably be decent, but as for action fans, this is a skip-er"

Too bad I was more solicitous than I should have been, because this film was a complete load of crap.  One doesn't expect a lot of depth when it comes to comic book/action films, but the story was just lame.  The Nazi angle could have been interesting, and the first ten minutes of the film were decent in an Indiana Jones kind of way, but the film quickly spiraled into complete tripe.  Ron Perlman as Hellboy, who somehow still managed to look like Ron Perlman was just ridiculous.  His corny remarks every five or ten minutes wore thin within ten minutes.  I also don't think that one is supposed to fall asleep multiple times during a loud action film, but I was so bored (or perhaps it was a defense mechanism) that I did just that.  I try to find one thing good (or bad, if it's actually a positive review) about a film, and Hellboy's good thing was the Nazi assassin.  Had the film centered around him a bit more, I would have at least taken a bit of delight when this creepy monster was on the screen, but unfortunately I was forced to just listen to witty bon monts from Mr. Hellboy and try to figure out how much the fish guy was influenced by Greedo from Star Wars.

I didn't even understand who they were, so how could I care about them?<br/><br/>""The Hulk"" proved that we're no longer impressed by realistic computer-generated characters when they're featured in disappointing movies. It's okay to stress style over substance, but you've got to give us SOMETHING behind the effects. Del Toro doesn't do that at all, and the resulting film is a dismal failure. Avoid this one at all costs."

","First off, I didn't go into this movie with very high expectations.  I could already tell from the preview that it was going to be mostly special effects, with a mediocre at best storyline, but of course the producers would try to milk the story for everything it's worth by dragging on the less exciting talking sequences and ocassionaly throwing in the high-flying action sequences.  At first I wasn't going to see it, but then a new preview appeared showing off all the good comments critics had to say.  ""Ok my friends want to see it, I'll go.""<br/><br/>~(MILD SPOILERS, NOTHING MAJOR, BUT MAY HAVE YOU GUESSING)~<br/><br/>As I've mentioned, the story isn't going to turn any heads.  Madman (and Nazis) tries to do something uber-evil, but his party gets crashed by the good guys yet he still somewhat completes his goal, but gets (what would seem to be) destroyed.  (This is when our hero is found as a baby)  Fast forward 60 years, hero's all grown up, blah blah blah, he's a freak, he's got a crush on a girl, bad guy's brought back from the dead, our hero has some girl problems, something bad happens to someone our hero loves, now it's personal, que special effects, climatic battle, roll credits (no teaser for a sequel?! What a jip! :P).<br/><br/>~(SPOILERS END)~<br/><br/>Hellboy isn't as bad as I may have made it sound, not even close.  He's fun to look at, with some pretty good make-up effects on Hellboy and all the other freaks, and there's some clever writing (with the exception of ""There are things that go bump in the night, and we are the ones who bump back"". That's a horrid line.)  But there's enough clever one-liners to make you chuckle and in some cases, the entire audience roar.  The movie would be much worse without these, I think they serve as a waker-upper to compensate for the *meh* talking parts.  The action sequences aren't anything that make you jump out of your seat hollering at the top of your lungs ""THAT WAS AWESOME!"" but they offer a fair share of the over the top fighting you'd expect in a superhero flick.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's better than HULK but not as good as X2: XMEN UNITED.

Quite an interesting character, but they failed again here in making him unavailable at the end of the movie because he was injured.<br/><br/>Luckily there was some action, and Perlman made it watchable.

","This movie's basically about a musclebound mutant from Hell and his work with a secretive paranormal research branch of the government. He goes out destroying these huge tentacled creatures (and their eggs) from another dimension that look like a cross between giant octopuses and the Ridley Scott's Alien. Meanwhile, Rasputin(!) has been resurrected and he has his own plans for Hellboy and the powers Hellboy's freakishly large right fist possesses. There's also a romantic subplot between Hellboy and Liz (Selma Blair), a firestarter who unleashes a blaze when someone hurts her (think Carrie). The previews for this movie make it look like a summer movie, and that's what it should be. Those of you who are familiar with how the movie business works with strategic release dates and all realize that huge action movies that are 60% special effects are released during the summer for teenagers and the MTV generation who really don't know any better. This is more of the same. I'm 25, and the special effects seemed over done, even to me. There were a few funny moments in this film, but the film overall wasn't much better than I expected. That being said, Ron Perlman gives a really good performance as Hellboy, much better than other ""actors"" who commonly get these action movie roles(this means you Vin Diesel). A lot of the reviews are more positive than mine, but I left this movie feeling kind of indifferent as to its quality. I'll say it's pretty average, I'll give it 5/10."

","Hollywood seems to have a very specific desired outcome when it comes to producing comic book movies: to maintain the compelling visual style that makes the comic medium stand out in the first place and to tweak the story just enough to make a mainstream audience care.<br/><br/>This is, in essence, what happened with Hellboy. Don't get me wrong: I loved the film. The humor wasn't over the top, the visual style and set design was fantastic, and the performances were way better than I expected. My only complaints came from parts of the story that I had failed to ever find in the comics.<br/><br/>I understand that the jump from one medium to another will inevitably produce plot twists that die-hard fans won't recognize and, therefore, won't approve of, but Hellboy took this fact to the edge of my tolerance.<br/><br/>Though I could go on for days about discrepancies about horns, candy bars, and everyone's respective loyalties, the only one worth really complaining about is the love story aspect. I know Hollywood understands its audiences and audiences inevitably will want a love story to keep them interested (and make the film a potential ""date movie""), but this was a little over the top.<br/><br/>Whether it was the unfounded ""romance"" between Rasputin and Ilsa, the disgusting love triangle that distracted the characters from the more important parts of the film (such as, oh I don't know, stopping the approaching end of the world...), Hellboy's momentary ""for her"" jump to the dark side, or the stomach-turning final kiss between the main characters (just because the characters are fireproof doesn't mean there clothes are... hmmm), I was befuddled by the scripts desperate attempts at romantic shmultz.<br/><br/>Overall, great cinematic experience, but I think the filmmakers forfeited the true focus of the story (fighting the forces of evil with the forces of diet-evil) for a couple cheap romantic thrills."

How can a movie that's this dumb possibly recover its CGI bill alone?  I don't mean to insult any longtime fans but this film lacked so very much.  I honestly came in to this film as unbiased as a person can get.  In fact, as a comic fan in general, I was pulling for this film to be great.  I've never read Hellboy.  So, I don't know if the lack of character development is a writing flaw or a fault of Hollywood adaptation.  <br/><br/>I also agree that this movie seem to degenerate into a nonsensical monster/horror flick and that, sadly, seemed to be its goal.   I, too, was frustrated by constant slaughter of the `good guys' as a way to build a story only to have the climax peter out in one thirty second swallow/explosion.  The only real exposition in the whole film developed Hellboy's father.  So, shouldn't his murder have been of use to this film? It served no purpose.  If Flaming chick hadn't said the line `no one has even spoken to him for three days and he won't eat' we would've never even noticed that Hellboy's father had died.  Hellboy didn't act any differently and the revenge factor never even happened.  He threw a guy that won't stay dead in a pit of spears√Ç‚Ä¶ so what.  It's as if Del Torro realized that his budget was running out so he had to end the film as fast and as cheaply as possible.

Remember Quest For Fire? Beauty and the Beast? Well, Pearlman carries Hellboy well and adds more character. John Hurt excellent choice.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: Not a fan of Del Toro.

Like the comic book, Mignola's weakness is character building and creating interesting villains-- it's the same in the movie.<br/><br/>BOTTOMLINE: I looked at my watch four times during the movie regardless that it had a great idea that never really made it across. Hellboy has a need to belong and be like a human being and it ends up preaching about humanity and the being of being humane. Hellboy is competing with Jesus in that area (regarding to the Passion Of the Christ) where he suffers quite a bit in this movie, too.

The desire for a romantic connection for Hellboy to make him seem human was clear, but the script just didn't deliver in this area at all.  Of course the action scenes were great, but that's true of any movie nowadays.  I thought the ending was absolutely ridiculous.  Simply sticking a pack of TNT down the big monster's throat doesn't satisfy my need for a thrilling ending to what should have been an impressive battle between good and evil.  The characters were well thought-up, but chalk that up to the comic book creators.  I wasn't at all impressed with this movie, and I left myself plenty of room to be impressed with as low of expectations as I had for this movie.

But when I saw the movie, absolutely nothing bothered me at all, because it all worked so well for the movie. Everything was just exceptionally well done. It was faithful to the original without sacrificing the movie at all.<br/><br/>All the acting and the characters were also wonderful. While I missed tough-guy Abe from the comics, psychic Abe was loveable as well, and worked perfectly as a foil to Hellboy. Ron Perlman was unbelievable as Hellboy. It quite literally is hard for me to believe that someone could get so close to the character!<br/><br/>I loved the dialogue and the plot and the emotional aspects of the film as well. One-liners tend to crack me up, and these had enough of HB's dry matter of fact- ness to stop from being the extremely corny lines that you often find, that are out of place and make me wince. I guess Hellboy's personality is well adapted to one-liners.<br/><br/>The movie was a lot of fun to watch, and an excellent realization of the story."

","Having anxiously awaited this movie from the first stirrings of rumors of its creation many years ago, and as a fan of the comics since the first issue, I found Guillermo del Toro's take on Mike Mignola's Hellboy to be somewhat of a letdown. I have been a fan of del Toro's as well; his aesthetic sensibilities have elevated films like Mimic and Blade II, and The Devil's Backbone is one if the best ghost stories on film to date.<br/><br/>Hellboy, however, is rife with problems that detract from what promised to be a classic adventure ride. Some terrible sound mixing choices all but obscure many of Hellboy's quips and verbal jabs, mostly in the fight scenes but even during lighter moments. With a stogie in his mouth for much of the film, Hellboy may someday grace the cover of Cigar Aficionado but won't win any awards for delivering lines that can be clearly heard.<br/><br/>His sparring partners for most of the movie, the regenerating Sammaels, are poorly designed, making it hard to tell one end from the other and generally adding a confused look to the chaotic battles. In Mignola's comics the nemeses are so well crafted as to be instantly recognizable, whether Frog Men or Frankenstein Apes, and I had hoped that some of these creatures would make it into this adaptation. Instead, del Toro opted for the Predator-throwback Sammael, who is used and reused in three different fights, none more entertaining than the others. The penultimate villain, too, is just a towering mass of amorphous tentacles that evokes little menace and much confusion. Its very appearance seems tacked on, and, with no anticipation set up beforehand, makes little impact.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, because the characters themselves are all well-crafted. Hellboy is rounded out even more in the film than in the comics thanks to his yearning for the vulnerable pyrokinetic Liz Sherman. Amphibious Abe Sapien is a joy to watch in action and is missed in the second half. The villains, too, are intriguing; Rasputin's occult menace, Ilsa's power-mad love and devotion to him, and Kroenen's deadly and macabre, clockwork fighting machine antics are great counterparts to the heroes.<br/><br/>The problem, really, is del Toro's script, which seems to go from scene to scene without the benefit of having them tied together very well. Those elements lifted from the comics are grafted on to del Toro's new material, but there seems to be a bridge or two missing and the final result is a patchwork of things that work and things that definitely do not.<br/><br/>Had the story been slightly smaller in scope it may have fared better in the end. But tackling the origins of Hellboy and his ultimate choice in bringing about the Apocalypse may have been too much ground to cover in one film. What could have been a globe-trotting Monster Mash version of Raiders of the Lost Ark ends up as a messy collage of characters and action scenes that add up to less than the sum of its parts. I'm sure it will do well enough to warrant a sequel, and hopefully with all of the exposition taken care of del Toro and Mignola can come up with a story more worthy of the characters' efforts."

","Like so many out there who frequent cyberspace, I could not wait to see this movie. I was a big fan of Hellboy when it first came out and loved the Wolves of St. August series, shopping around to all my friends in hopes of introducing them to the character. And everything I had heard on the Internet about this film praised it as the Second Coming of comic book films.<br/><br/>Sadly, I find it anything BUT.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is by no means a disaster. I have seen worse, and Ron Perlman did an admirable job with the character, even if his make-up was a bit ridiculous looking. Regardless of the overall latex appearance of his bodysuit (which is a bit annoying, since Abe Sapien looked so startling realistic by comparison), he breathed life into the character and made me believe Hellboy was real when he was on screen. I, for one, am glad they used a real actor like him instead of going the CGI route that so many films (like the Hulk) take nowadays.<br/><br/>And by my own admission, it has been many years since I read the comic enough to know if the story was taken from the comic book or if it was weaved outside the printed page exclusively for the silver screen.<br/><br/>Regardless, it was seriously lacking.<br/><br/>The obligatory origin story starts in 1944 as a group of U.S. soldiers and Professor Bruttenholm (later in the film played as an elderly man by John Hurt) drop in on a secret Nazi ceremony performed by Grigori Rasputin in ancient ruins that reminded me of a would-be mod for the videogame Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Rasputin draws upon dark sorcery to open a gate to deep space to bring forth Elder Gods to bring about the Apocalypse, lending an immediate air of Lovecraft to the story.<br/><br/>So far, pretty good, and the effects were very well done.<br/><br/>But, as luck would have it, our American soldiers manage to thwart the Nazi efforts, and Rasputin is sucked into the void of space and his evil henchpersons Ilsa (how original for a Nazi villainess) and Kronen manage to get away. Professor Bruttenholm is not satisfied that all is well, and an inspection of the site reveals that a young demon from the depths of Hell has found his way to this dark Scottish Isle.<br/><br/>This raised a flag in my head, as I thought to myself that if Hellboy was indeed from Hell, as the name would apply, then why did he not come from Hell, but rather the cold, dark void of deep space? From a Lovecraftian Elder God no less. And Hellboy himself looking like no Lovecraftian entity I am aware of. It would have made more sense if they had opened a portal to Hell and the obviously demonic child came from there...but I am looking too deep into the semantics of the film and not suspending my disbelief.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the present. Special Agent John Meyers (Rupert Evans) of the FBI is transferred to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Development (B.P.R.D.) and meets the Elderly Bruttenholm (at this point John Hurt) and the wonderous Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by David Hyde Pierce). While Sapien is not given as much screen time as the hero, Hellboy, he is delightful when he is on screen, and his make-up job was much, much better than Ron Perlman's. Bruttenholm informs Meyers that he was hand picked from a list of candidates to work at the B.P.R.D., and gives him the task of taking care of the star attraction, Hellboy (Ron Perlman).<br/><br/>To be fair, Perlman is a tremendous screen presence as Hellboy. He was throughly enjoyable and his delivery of his dialog was flawless. As soon as he came on screen, in my mind's eye he fit the role perfectly. He fleshed out Hellboy better than Hugh Jackman did with Wolverine and ran circles around Tobey Maquire as Spiderman. Just like Patrick Stewart was perfect as Professor X, Perlman nailed Hellboy. No one else could have played that part. It was tailor made for him it seemed.<br/><br/>Too bad the rest of the movie fell apart the minute the action started.<br/><br/>I won't go too much further into the details of the plot, save that it involved a demonic hell hound named Sammael that was more Lovecraftian than Hellboy could ever hope to be, the ressurected Rasputin and his two henchpersons trying to finish what they started 60 years earlier by bringing about the end of the world, and Hellboy and associates trying to stop them. If CGI is your thing, this movie delivers it in spades. If over the top action is what you crave, you get it. If you like the standard ""Bad Guy wants to destroy the world for some reason, never stopping to thing that some demonic wasteland devoid of ALL life isn't what I would want to rule over, but hey, that's just me"" plotline, this one has it.<br/><br/>
If you are looking for something deeper in character development or a plot that makes sense, here's hoping Spider Man 2 lives up to the hype of its previews, but I wouldn't hold my breath.<br/><br/>To me, it is a blessing and a curse that we live in the times we live in. I am glad I lived long enough to see the realization of a watchable version of Lord of the Rings that didn't make me cringe. I am happy that the X-Men made it to the screen and avoided the straight to video curse of so many other Marvel heroes. I am glad that a small Marvel character like Blade could have a movie that was a pleasant surprise and still entertains me when I watch it. But I am disappointed when we get movies like Hellboy, which could have been so much more with an adaptation of a smaller story like Wolves of St. August than this special effects driven two hour plus drivel that we are saddled with instead.<br/><br/>Hopefully, when the inevitable sequel is made, they make the film less a centerpiece for trying to push the bar of special effects and more a character driven story where side characters like Liz Sherman are not wasted for the 15 minutes screen time they have.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this film a sad 6 out of 10. Promising start that becomes an orgy of special effects that sacrfice characters for digital mayhem."

","I should first let you all know that I have never seen the Hellboy comic book, nor the source material for many of the comic movies that have come out recently, though some I enjoyed, and others I did not.  I certainly did enjoy Hellboy, and don't regret the price of admission... however, I don't expect I'll buy it on DVD.<br/><br/>In its favor is Ron Perlman, as expected, who puts up a flawless performance in his role.  Also, a plot that only tells you the absolute basics keeps things moving at a pace too fast to leave you yawning.  Working against it is the performance of other actors.. most notably Selma Blair, who simply offended me in her presentation of some of her lines.  Did she shoot up tranquilizers before the filming?  Also, Del Toro takes absolutely no shot at achieving depth for the story.. making it all like a sort of long cartoon.  Finally, the special effects, though heavily relied upon, are flawed enough that they can take away at times."

In fact, I'd say that there wasn't too much trying to be crammed into the movie; I'd say there was too little. There could have been so many more examples of the kinds of things Hellboy runs into (I mean, he's run into ghosts, aliens, goblins, vampires, gods from various religions/parts of the world, etc. Here it is mostly just self-contained mythos being referred to/used as plot devices.<br/><br/>Then again, X-MEN had its flaws, yet was still good. X2 was better...maybe another HELLBOY would be good.<br/><br/>If there could only be a way to adapt WAKE THE DEVIL. Now THERE's an episode that would make a KICKASS movie."

","I surprised how much different the movie was from seed of destruction (the first helboy graphic novel) I could understand having that new guy being apart of the BPRD to introduce the charactors better that the comic book, but they didn't do that for the pyokenetic charactor. Instead of just having her apart of the team right at the beginning, they had to make things complicated and then she's finally apart of the team at the end. that really streached out the movie. which is why the ending was very rushed, even though that was supposed to be the most important part of the movie. the setting of where thing take place is all messed up too. it seems as though they wanted to shove all these hellboy stories (probably from the other volumes than just the first one) into one movie, when they should of just put some of them in the sequils. other than that, the movie's great. Ron Perlman look EXACTLY like hellboy!!!! John Hurt also looked just like Broom and is also a great actor (who'd a thought that's the same guy who played the elephant man)."

","Hellboy is a roller-coaster ride of special effects and catchy ""one-liners."" Without the computer / digital effects, Hellboy falls on its face more times than once. True, the actors held their own in a production made up of characters driven by themselves and not a story, Hellboy is an excellent example that the Hollywood studios have won the war against producing quality scripts into motion pictures. Hellboy is a good time if you want to see pretty colors and hear loud explosions. If you want a good story that will move you and make you think, pass on Hellboy and take in a good independent movie. Beside the fact, Selma Blair is terrific. Even though her character wasn't given enough time to progress, her beauty on the big screen captures her character."
"flasputnik01","2","0","2","4 April 2004"," no vision
","I wanted to like this one.  There were too many drawn out special effects sequences.  I don't think I can remember one effects sequence that was even remotely unique or even fun.  The one brief spot where the film came to life had no effects.  It was a simple,well staged scene involving four actors, a rooftop and park bench.  Hellboy needed a director with an original vision. It then needed the freedom that budgetary limits can often give to a real visionary.  I don't know if Del Toro could have spent 30 million less and made a much better film - but he should have at least acted on that premise when he was writing the script.  Somehow, I kept rooting for this film to get better.  Through one mind numbing, coma inducing effects sequence after another.  Right down to the bitter end."
"clydestuff","5","0","1","5 April 2004"," The Professor And The Beast
","If you were to break down the beginning of Hellboy in it's simplest terms, the Nazi's, aided by Rasputin of Nicholas and Alexandria fame, go messing around with the occult to bring forth some evil doers to aid Hitler in his conquest of the worlds.  Those doggone Nazis!!!  If they weren't out looking for the Lost Ark or the Holy Grail then they're messing around with the Dark Forces.  One would have to wonder how they ever found time to fight a war. Before they can succeed with their plan however, a battalion of U.S. soldiers, aided by a young Professor Bruttenholm, thwart their misdeeds, but not before a cute devilish baby pops into our world.  He is captured by the Professor, who promptly gives him the name Hellboy, and we fast forward a few decades to the present.  The Professor (now played by John Hurt)has raised the little dickens to manhood so that he is now played by Ron Perlman.  Having played the Beast Vincent in the TV series Beauty and The Beast in the late 1980's, Perlman is a an old pro at working in heavy makeup.  As Hellboy, the makeup is mostly red, he has horns that he keeps grinding flat to make him look more like a human, but he sports a tail so that's pretty much a useless endeavor.  He is now used by the FBI, to combat the forces of evil.  Unfortunately, the writers and director decided to gum up the works by throwing in everything but the kitchen sink.  The plot in this film becomes so convoluted at times, an extra strength bottle of Drano couldn't clear it up and I'm not sure I'll have much success either but I'll give it a shot.<br/><br/>First off, there's the thing about Rasputin (Karel Rodan).  He's there with the Nazi's for Hellboy's coming out party but we don't know how he got there.  Then there's a blond woman named Ilsa (Bridget Hodson). There's also some weird guy named Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) who we find out later seems to have been stitched together by an apprentice of Dr. Frankenstein.  Having escaped from Professor Bruttenholm's war party, they survive into the present day, without ever aging.  Then with a little bit of Hocus Pocus Alakazam, they summon up some CGI Demons for Hellboy to do battle with.  The problem with this demon is that every time one is defeated, two takes it's place. So, soon they're multiplying faster than you can say Roger Rabbit, and Hellboy and the rest of the world is in big trouble.  Again, I have written what happens in it's most simplest of terms so you might be able to follow it.  The explanations and reasoning used in the film are partially non existent and the rest of it is a bunch of mumbo jumbo hooey that you won't understand anyway.  What makes all this so irritating is that it is absolutely unnecessary.  There are a lot of good things going on in Hellboy that are completely wasted because of the overbearing plot laid into the film.<br/><br/>The biggest mistake Director and Writer Guillermo Del Toro makes, is that once we see the origin of Hellboy, he skips directly into his adulthood to expedite things.  We know the Professor raises him almost like his own son, but we don't have a clue as to any of the psychological or inner makeup of Hellboy.  We know he likes Candy bars, we learn he likes to take off some times against the professor's wishes, we find out he loves a good cigar, but little else.  We simply don't have a clue as to anything about him on a personal level.  It's not Perlman's fault.  He is terrific as Hellboy, often using a dry sarcastic kind of no nonsense wit, and Perlman always seems to be having a blast.  However, since we know so little about him as flesh and blood, we can't identify with him and we end up regarding him as nothing more than what he is on paper which is a comic book hero.<br/><br/>As if we needed reminding of the major failing of the film, Del Toro also gives us a love interest for Hellboy.  It seems Hellboy is carrying the torch for a pyrokineticist named Liz (Selma Blair). Think of Drew Barrymore in Firestarter and you've got the idea.  Blair also gives another good performance as Liz, a woman tortured by her existence.  Strangely, Del Toro does give us a brief glimpse into Liz's childhood, and because of it we understand her better than we do anything about Hellboy.  We are however, never given a clue as to how the Liz and Hellboy met, how he fell for her, why she left the compound he lives in or anything else for that matter. There is one great scene where Liz goes for a walk with John Myers(Rupert Evans)and a jealous Hellboy follows them.  It's one of the few moments of humanity given to Hellboy, and it's a big pay off.  If only there had been more moments like this than it would have been time better spent. <br/><br/>Hellboy is also not the only superhero to inhabit the lab where he is kept. There is sort of an Aquaman type being by the name of Abe Sapien who swims around in a tank, eats rotten eggs, and his psychic powers that he uses to aid Hellboy.  He is one of the most believable CGI characters I've ever seen in a film of this type, aided measurably by the voice of David Hyde Pierce. It would have been more interesting to have seen how the relationship between Abe, the professor, and Hellboy developed if Del Toro hadn't been in such a hurry to get to his idiot plot in order to burn up his special effects budget to the max.<br/><br/>As for the special effects and the battle scenes, they are terrific just for the sheer spectacle, and it's fun to watch and listen to Hellboy as he goes to war against the monsters.  The problem with these scenes though are the same with everything else about this film.  The origin of the monsters and everything about them is so murky, and jumped into so fast, that even these scenes are viewed from a dispassionate distance.<br/><br/>Benico Del Toro had all the tools to make the beginnings of a great new comic book series on film.  Unfortunately, when you have the tools and the only thing you can manage is to build a motorboat instead of the ARK, then I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Hellboy is a C."

It's very unsophisticated.  Like Hellboy will get smashed into a wall, pick himself, and say, ""Damn.""  There are a few funny parts, but not many.

I decided to stop thinking during the movie because otherwise I would have kept thinking to myself: ""What is truly going on here?"" I am sure that fans of the comic will enjoy this, but if you don't like special-effects-driven action movies with thin plots, I'd stay away from Hellboy."
"movieguy1021","6","0","1","4 April 2004"," Hellboy: 6/10
","Expectations have been set way too high now. Every time a movie based on a comic book comes out, everyone expects it to be the next , when a) most, if not all, of the popular comic book franchises have already been made into movies, and b) most comic book movies can't compare to Spider-Man. Yet these movies keep getting pumped out methodically, and people buy into them. I am one of those people, so on its opening weekend, I saw Hellboy, a lesser known comic-movie. There's obviously a reason why it's like that. Hellboy may be an interesting character, but his surroundings aren't.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman plays the title character, a demon transported from hell during the Nazi regime. He's brought up by Prof. Broom (John Hurt, I'll get to him later), and soon helps out the American government in controlling paranormal creatures. However, it turns out he has human feelings and all, and must face his inner demons, so to speak.<br/><br/>I must admit, going into Hellboy, I had high expectations. The trailers looked cool, and I thought it could surpass Spider-Man and get into Hulk territory. But I was wrong. Everything that went right in the two previously mentioned movies didn't happen in this one. The exciting originality and spontaniety of Spider-Man was thrown away in lieu of cheesy special effects. And the stunning story and depth in The Hulk was nowhere to be seen here. But I shouldn't be judging this movie based on others.<br/><br/>In short, Hellboy is generic. Although the plot was far-out, it didn't go that far with it, and ended up just being a generic ""kick the bad guy's ass"" scenario. Any of the fight scenes seemed completely fake, until you realized that Hellboy was just a guy in makeup. Then I was in awe, but the sheer awkwardness of the computer animation just seemed off. Hellboy's makeup, though, was great; it seemed perfectly flawless (although I did see an image afterwards where some of his fingers were visible when there were supposed to be incased in a wooden arm), and was probably the highest point of the movie. The movie in itself was entertaining, but just not as gripping as it could be.<br/><br/>Perlman is a great Hellboy. He stands out among this cast that could have gone for A-list stars but didn't. Hurt seemed to underplay his role. Ironically, Hurt played the title character in The Elephant Man, and I found these two movies similar, as they both deal with ostricizacation due basically to looks. Selma Blair, as the love interest, does what she can with her one note character, but she can't really do much with it.<br/><br/>All in all, Hellboy is entertaining, generally. There's nothing new. Just some PG-13 blow 'em up, and that's it. Destined to not be a classic.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and frightening images."
"wastebot","3","0","1","4 April 2004"," Almost as awful as Spawn
","Like Spawn, this is comic book horror.  Neither achieve anything close to the absolute class of this sub-genre, Darkman.<br/><br/>Nor does the FX measure up to the more recent Underworld, though it borrows a few of its weapons.  Like many recent horror films, it imitates Dracula/Werewolf weapons, using crosses, holy water, and silver to protect the good guys.  It's way beyond cliche at this point.  It's just boring. Please show a little creativity.<br/><br/>Where the comic book seems to ridicule these things, the writer and director of the film, Guillermo del Toro, actually takes them seriously.  The result is a film that ends with a yawn.<br/><br/>Not that it begins any better.  Indiana Jones derived Nazi stuff.  Then the middle of the movie gets better as it turns into an action film version of first-person-shooter games like Quake and Unreal.  I mention Quake and Unreal because it's also obvious that the writer/director borrowed from them.  Hellboy's world is dark and gothic.<br/><br/>If you've already seen this and like it, I recommend tracking down The Tick. Much more fun without all the heavy-handed religious propaganda.<br/><br/>For the actors, Ron Perlman caries the film, giving Hellboy Tick-like character (which is to say, a big goof).  David Hyde Pierce (voice only) makes one of the sidekicks, Abe Sapien, funny.  But other than the gas-mask man (not sure if he was acted or FX), the only villains to keep things interesting enough so that you don't start dreaming were the Alien-like creatures created with FX.  Just don't expect originality.<br/><br/>The tagline for this movie should have been:  Jesus will save you and give you a beautiful virgin even if you're ugly and were born in hell.

A plot that is totally arbitrary in setup, villians that have no palatable threat or menace, annoying sub characters ( fishman, John Hurt, Jeffrey Tambor )and a hero with good presence, but nothing interesting to do.

"gregsrants","5","0","1","3 April 2004"," Ho-hum boy
","While watching Guillermo del Toro's new film Hellboy, it was easy to see the influence of preceding superhero films in the past five years, specifically the success of Spider-Man in 2002.  Spider-man was a commercial success and critics praised the film for its mix of action and the backdrop of an outcast yearning for the love of a friend.  Hellboy looks to have taken much of that script and morphed it into a darker, more sinister type of adventure.  <br/><br/>In a paragraph, Hellboy is a creature spawned from a portal opened by Nazi's in 1944.  He is then raised by humans and released from his underground dwellings to fight the evil unleashed upon mankind.  So when the Nazi's conjure up wickedness yet again in 2004, Hellboy and the other freaks of the Department of the Paranormal are all that stands between Armageddon and human survival.  <br/><br/>There is a lot going for Hellboy.  First and foremost is the remarkable casting of Ron Perlman as Hellboy himself.  Perlman is no stranger to being outfitted in latex and costume having starred as Vincent in the television hit Beauty and The Beast in the late 1980's.  In fact, his role choices of Blade II, The Island of Dr. Moreau and Star Trek: Nemesis, might not have you immediately recognize him if you met him on a street corner.  Only in action films playing the bad guy (Romeo is Bleeding, Alien Resurrection) do we ever get the see the true mug of this behemoth.   <br/><br/>Second notch of the belt has to be director del Toro.  Previous helmer of such Blade II and the Devil's Backbone, del Toro has proven to be a successful storyteller when the subject matter is dark and sinister. <br/><br/>
Third is the interesting Dark Horse comic book character that the movie surrounds.  Hellboy doesn't have the human secret identity where a pair of donned glasses trick everyone into believing there could be no commonality between the geek and the hero.  Hellboy doesn't have that luxury.  He is a giant amongst humans with red skin, shaved down horns protruding from his forehead and a tail hidden only by his fashionable trench coat.  He chomps on cigars and blatantly goes against his father's wishes.  In short, he is the anti-Peter Parker.  <br/><br/>But for all the pros, there are quite a number of cons in Hellboy.  First and foremost being the running time.  At 133 minutes, I could not remember a film where I watched so many scenes that I thought should have hit the cutting room floor.  I felt as if del Toro thought he might not get a green light for a sequel, so he decided instead to make a long movie that should have been sniped by about 45 minutes.  Between lining up for tickets and popcorn and then sitting through countless commercials and trailers, I was exhausted before the 2+ hour movie even began.  Maybe I was in a bad mood, but I really hadn't counted on spending my entire afternoon to watch a summer-fare type flick.<br/><br/>Also holding back Hellboy from my long term memory banks were the routine special effects.  Routine I say because there is nothing new here.  Hellboy jumping from building to building was done in Spider-man.  The return to ashes demise of the creatures was too similar to the death of vampires in the Blade franchise.  And the creature effects on a whole reminded me of what Rick Moranis transformed into in Ghostbusters.  So although I won't go as far as to say that the special effects weren't well done, they have just all been done before.<br/><br/>Lastly, I didn't buy the love story.  As mentioned, I thought this was a cheap way of trying to copy what made Spider-man so appealing, and it just didn't work.  Hellboy and his devil looking sneers and the innocent eyelash bashing of Selma Blair's Liz Sherman.  Plllee-eze!<br/><br/>On a whole for every plus, there was a negative which probably makes sense based on my rating of **1/2 stars.  The powers of the ¬ëfreaks' were interesting including the David Hyde Pierce voiced Abe Sapien, who can see into the past and eats rotten eggs, but the character of Jeffery Tambor was completely unnecessary and uneven.  The humor too was hit and miss.  Hellboy fires off more quips that Clint Eastwood did in The Rookie and only about half of them hit the mark.  <br/><br/>In all, I give Hellboy a small recommendation.  I wouldn't stand in line for a great deal of time, nor would I expect too much out of a comic book adaptation, but if you go in with the right frame of mind, you may walk out thinking you got your money's worth.  Me, I couldn't help but think of all the promise I saw in the Hellboy trailers.  It looked to be an action filled adventure with a smart ass hero who is outcast by society. Instead, I got a film that was just long, sometimes confusing and now a forethought, was only slightly better than the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. <br/><br/>

","I really don't know why people liked this movie. In all fairness, a friend of mine also went, and he usually has good taste and oddly enough he liked it better than the new Punisher movie, which I enjoyed in spite of its cartoonish stupidity. But the two people I went with agreed: it was terrible. Here's my pretentious review.<br/><br/>Director Guillermo del Toro's last outing was `Blade 2,' an adrenaline-packed, over-the-top orgy of violence, action and humor that stayed true to its comic-book origins without alienating audiences unfamiliar with the source material.<br/><br/>His latest film, `Hellboy,' encompasses only one of these characteristics, namely, that it stays true to its comic-book roots. Every other aspect is nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. From the special effects to the dialogue to the pacing of the story, there is not a single redeeming factor found within. Clocking in at slightly more than two hours, the film is a painful example in what happens when comic-book films go terribly, terribly wrong.<br/><br/>In a movie so riddled with flaws, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact moment when things begin to go wrong, though it's reasonably safe to say that the introduction of Hellboy's character 10 minutes into the film is when it first becomes apparent that the ensuing two hours are going to be an excruciating experience.<br/><br/>Brought into our universe, dimension, whatever - it's never made clear exactly where Hellboy or the assortment of other monsters come from - by a group of occult Nazis (who, quite naturally, speak flawless English; many of them even lack a German accent) during World War II, Hellboy is but a young creature, half-human, half-demon and lured to the side of the allies with a few Baby Ruth bars. So poor is the CGI-rendered baby Hellboy that he looks even more cartoonish and out of place than does Jar-Jar Binks.<br/><br/>
The film then flashes forward to the present day, where Hellboy is a strapping young half-demon in the employ of the secret government agency known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Design, and his `father,' that is, the scientist who lured him with candy bars, is the much-aged Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt, `Dogville'). Bruttenholm is slowly dying, and in his desire to find a suitable replacement, recruits a young FBI agent by the name of John Meyers (Rupert Evans II) whom, in one of the film's many clich√©d moments, is described as being `pure of heart.'<br/><br/>
Meyers, of course, has only heard of the BPRD and of Hellboy through the supermarket tabloids, (which are utilized throughout as something of a running joke, though unlike in `Men in Black,' they are neither funny nor clever). Although ostensibly serving as the lead human character in the film, and in spite of the movie's painfully long running time, he is woefully underdeveloped and remains blandly unlikable throughout.<br/><br/>
In spite of this, he becomes embroiled in a love triangle with Hellboy and the prodigal BPRD employee and fire starter Liz Sherman (an enchanting and underutilized Selma Blair). Oddly enough, this seemingly important sub-plot is never brought to a satisfying conclusion, and is used mainly as a way of showing the soft underbelly of the otherwise aloof Hellboy.<br/><br/>
The film's muddled plot centers around a group of undead Nazis bent on, what else, world destruction. Of course, it's up to the BPRD to put an end to this nefarious scheme, with Hellboy as the brawn, the odd half man/half fish Abe Sapien (whose voice bears an uncanny resemblance to `Frasier's' David Hyde Pierce, but is played by the unknown Doug Jones) as the brains, Liz as the incredibly powerful backup brawn and Agent Meyers as the tagalong human.<br/><br/>Although the filmmakers attempted to inject a good deal of humor in the movie, the only two parts of `Hellboy' that generate any laughs are the terrible special effects and a pretentious, overly dramatic funeral scene; complete with an obligatory downpour and a plethora of black umbrellas.<br/><br/>
Additionally, there are so many plot holes than one wonders whether those involved in the creation of this abomination were even paying attention during the filmmaking process. For example, Liz has a tremendously spectacular ability to incinerate anything and everything in her path, yet she uses her power only once; Hellboy is fireproof, and despite the noticeable wear and tear his outfits go through, they too seem to be able to endure the various explosions and fires he survives. Of course, these are minor quibbles when it comes to the giant gaps in the main story - such as where these monsters come from, why a group of three Nazis appear out of nowhere after more than 50 years in hiding just so they can turn the earth into a scorched wasteland, and most importantly, why the audience is supposed to care about any of the characters or their various dilemmas.<br/><br/>
`Hellboy' is an inexcusably terrible film, guilty of nearly every sin the sci-fi/action genre can commit - it's boring, the story makes no sense, the characters are unlikable, the special effects are horrendous and the ending encompasses the very definition of anti-climatic. With a number of much better films already in theaters (`Dawn of the Dead,' `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind') and a good deal of promising ones (`The Punisher,' `Kill Bill 2') on the horizon, there's no reason for even the most avid of filmgoers to waste their time and money on this travesty."
"gillesmarini","5","0","1","21 March 2004"," Was Ok Movie ..I saw the screening the 19 march 2004.
","Well, the movie was funny and had good special effects. Hell Boy actor played really well (great actor). But the rest was a bit flat. Looks like they ran out of Money toward the end of the movie. So when you come out of the movie something is missing big time. I guess I have to see it again to maybe enjoy it more?? The fights in the end were not spectacular and when you are going to see those type of movie you really want to be amaze by it. Here again after the 3/4 of the film it think it was to quick. The bad Nazi soldier was really well done very dark the people reaction around me were amazed they like it. Many think in the movie did not fit and did not make sense. Go watch it . Cause like they say here ..got to see it, to talk about.. See ya all.. Gilles"
