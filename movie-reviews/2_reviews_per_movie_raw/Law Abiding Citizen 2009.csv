","The movie was not unlike other movies where you see the good guy go rogue after rough handling by ""the system"". But I really liked the development of the characters in the beginning, and I am sure I am not the only one out there hoping that the ""Law Abiding Citizen"" would be able to pull it off.<br/><br/>Then came the middle where plot points become strained, where we have to take a few leaps of faith and leave the world of genius for one of Hollywood. OK, I'm still there, taking the ride with you.<br/><br/>But then we get to the ending which destroys the film and makes it into brain pablum; mental oatmeal that anyone can digest but no one can get any flavor from. Mr. Genius buys several industrial areas -- but why? Only 2 seemed to be necessary for the plot. And why would Panama know the purchase prices? And down to the cent! Corporations don't need to share that information with foreign governments. Nix that link and this movie would have been more interesting. We're expected to believe a genius would leave the cleaning cart in obvious view in the hallway and right next to the area where he put the bomb? We're expected to believe the genius wouldn't have trapped his escape route. And we're expected to believe they transferred this bomb from Point A to Point B without setting it off and in record time, all while Foxx waits in the cell, and Scotty Junior brings up the rear, unseen and unheard.<br/><br/>I wanted Foxx's arrogant character to lose his daughter, to feel what this man went through, and then I wanted him to get away with it.<br/><br/>Anyone agree?"
"mike-3842","7","735","817","16 October 2009"," Great Idea, Poor Ending
","This is a great idea. A technical genius who is somehow able to commit revenge murders from his jail cell. He doesn't hide the fact he's a killer; in fact he announces each murder just before it happens.<br/><br/>Technically everything was possible and the method very cleverly hidden so I was kept in suspense until the last 20 minutes when the cat was let out of the bag too early. The ending is a let down. It's true Hollywood: Technically improbable, illogical, and in my opinion it spoils all the character development made until that point and wastes the opportunity for a much darker ending with a more satisfying outcome.<br/><br/>All that said I really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone not disturbed by moderate violence. Go see it!"
"jlamarca","4","172","192","18 February 2010"," Typical Hollywood BASTARDIZED ENDING!!!
","Come on Hollywood, this guy was so clever, tactful & brilliant & yet you expect the audience to believer that he wouldn't even have a bloody security system installed on the very building, which was the only means of exit & entry to his prison cell... never mind that the building housed nerve & command center, from which he executed his flavour of justice!<br/><br/>Here's another plot hole of gargantuan proportion(s); how in the heck did Fox get the briefcase/bomb back to the jail cell BEFORE Butler returned? Oh yeah & WHY would Fox willfully allow Butler to detonate the bomb, even though he had discovered the means, by which he was perpetrating his reign of terror?!? That would be the epitome of anti-justice- especially considering he was the acting D.A.! Why didn't they show him being charged & prosecuted for murder?!?<br/><br/>This is a case whereby you actually wanted the bad guy to get the last word in on the matter!!! But no... Jamie Fox had to come out on top! Actually, I think Fox would/should have been the FIRST person on Butler's list! WHY couldn't Hollywood just grant this movie the ending it righteously deserved?!? It was going sooo well! Whoever is in charge of the ending to this film ought to have been on Butler's list!"
"agibaer","4","222","255","3 December 2009"," Good movie screwed up completely in the last 15 minutes
","Just watched LAW ABIDING CITIZEN. I don't know why i still bother watching American movies. It's a decade-long Hollywood tradition to screw up good ideas by illogical plots and happy endings. The WHOLE point of the movie, bringing DOWN the legal system could only be proved if Shelton was to walk free after all he did. To show that the legal system was unable to hinder him murdering people though being in custody AND had to set him free, because the DA and the judge broke the law to stop his series of murder thus ignoring his civil rights which would ultimately lead to dismissing all charges. The supposed plot to blow up the mayor and homeland security does not at all fit neither the character of Shelton nor the plot of the movie. Good movie screwed up completely in the last 15 minutes. Hollywoods Epitaph."
"leathalsac","8","367","427","29 October 2009"," Great Movie just don't watch the end.
","I didn't have high expectations for this movie and only went because my friend made me. That being said I loved it. I actually wanted to applaud and cheer at one point and I never do that. Clyde now ranks as on of my favorite characters ever. Now for the bad part. Jamie Foxx was horrible!!!!!!! I don't understand why directors and casting directors like to put bad actors against good actors. It seems to be an ever increasing trend in Hollywood. we saw it in ""the Italian job"" and we see it here. Jamie's acting was the worst I had seen in a long time. He showed no emotion at all. I would have liked to see a better actor cast but hey who am I? Also, listen up producers, the ending was ridiculous!!!! I mean come on. you build this character up only for a huge let down. That was by far one of the most irresponsible endings to a movie I have ever had the misfortune to see. When I tell people to see this I am recommending that they leave at a specific point about 15min before it's over and imagine your own ending because no matter what it will be better. Endings like that is the reason people watch independent films. This movie could have been an all time classic but for Jamie Foxx and the writer's lazy ending. It still may because I loved most of it. I pray someday producers figure out that we want something a little different and allow things to end the right way, the responsible way for their viewers.<br/><br/>Thank you,"
"lazydawgotp","4","69","77","2 April 2010"," started out amazing and then went downhill.
","Spoiler alert! This movie had an awesome idea and would have been great but for the end of it. 1st off Jaime Foxx is supposed to be a bad guy, but they make him a good guy in the end. For crying out loud, he let a child rapist off the hook to further his career, and then they make him the hero in the end. And Gerard Butler's character is supposed to be a super genius that outsmarts the most wanted terrorists, only to get outsmarted by a a spoiled rich lawyer who neglects his family. It's like some amazing writer wrote the plot and then some jerk director comes in and changes the ending. Why can't Hollywood just give me a good ending to a movie.<br/><br/>I wouldn't see it unless you like crappy endings!"
"markthompson147","3","273","322","2 December 2009"," Did the director fail to see the irony.
","OK so the premise of the ending is that, although the justice system is flawed, you cant just kill people to get your own justice and you are becoming what you hate and it will lead to your demise. So how does the director explain then that Foxx, the supposed good guy of the film, instead of using the justice system he represents to hold Butler accountable for his crimes, does instead just murder him in his cell. How does that make him any different to Butler. But Foxx murdering someone is apparently OK and he goes on to have a happy life watching his daughter play the cello. Murdering someone because they are murdering because of the murder of other people. Irony anyone.<br/><br/>Its a real shame but the stupidity and lack of bravery in giving the film the ending it deserved just ruined it."
"cartman442003","5","34","38","25 July 2010"," Kurt Wimmer buckles under pressure; goes with the ""safe"" ending
","""Law Abiding Citizen"" is a movie that got me angrier than ""Transformers 2"" and more disappointed than ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Yet, I'll probably watch it again. And again.<br/><br/>See, ""Citizen"" inspires a rare sort of hatred in me. 90% of it is a provocative, fearlessly cathartic and hauntingly relevant piece of social satire mixed with a grade-A action thriller script and top-notch acting across the board. That's why I'm going to watch it again, despite how terrible the ending was.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, the movie spends all of its time making us know that Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is a meticulous planner who's serious about getting even with the system of justice that allowed his wife and daughter's true killer to go free with a mere 3-year sentence. Literally every move the justice system and his ex-attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) make, Shelton has already set in motion countermeasures for that step and the next three they will take. Rice is characterised as a smarmy, ladder-climbing political manoeuvrer who cares more about his reputation as a prosecutor than dispensing actual justice. Not once during the course of the movie does he ever, ever admit that he was wrong not to pursue full conviction for both the killer and his accomplice, or even conceded that Shelton was cheated out of justice by a corrupt and broken system of law. ""Some justice is better than no justice"" is the phrase he uses to rationalise his decision. This being a very anti-establishment film, it's clear that the intention was for us to see Shelton as, though a morally ambiguous psychopath, a man who sees the justice system for what it really is: a mere system. A cold, soulless, illogical, by-the-book factory made up of bored and overworked people that treat justice ""like it's an assembly line."" Rice, therefore, represents the system then, in both occupation and personality: he's incorrigible, he's utterly cocky, and he refuses to acknowledge fault in himself or make any concessions for Shelton. Though he clearly believes in justice, he's still part of the problem. Right?<br/><br/>You're right. That was the intention. However, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" ends up being just another crime thriller. The ""psychopath"", the societal outcast, is punished and ceased, while the clean, self- righteous lawyer finishes the job just in time to make it to his little girl's cello recital. No, really. That's where it ends. In fact, once Shelton is killed, it cuts soundlessly to the recital and then goes black. A quiet, abrupt end. Despite everything that had been built up, it just ends.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that this was the original ending that the writer of ""Equilibrium"" intended to have. This movie reeks with the pungent stink of producer tampering. The quality and style of the ending doesn't match that of the rest of the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if that was intentional, if that was Kurt Wimmer's way of spiting whoever forced him to change the ending, the one where the psychopath succeeds in uprooting the corrupt system, succeeds in bringing ""the whole diseased, corrupt temple down on (Rice's) head"". The ending was far from ""biblical"". It was a short, quiet, but mostly ugly, cop-out. Because of that, I'm cutting the score I would have given this movie, a 9, in half. It's rounded up because I feel like this movie could've really said something, could have stood out, had it not ended like every other movie that gets cranked out of the old Hollywood assembly line these days."
"mikifambl","2","157","197","27 November 2009"," Bad End
","I cant believe it, why the ending is always bad. It's great movie until the end. People, believe me, make a movie in which the bad guy wins, it will be better, take my word on it!!!!!! It was one of the better movies i have seen in last six months, and i still got to repeat that the ENDING was awful. Great actors, great story, and why always justice prevail, my question is: What do you rather watch, be honest, the bad guy who wins the American justice, or the other ending?! I think the first choice is the right answer, i am certain that all of you think the same.<br/><br/>Thanks"
"kiarash_torkian","Null","38","45","19 August 2011"," The last 15 minutes, is still hunting me
","The movie was great, the fact that Clyde found all these loop holes in the justice system, and his development to see what he had done through these ten years had completely nailed me throughout the movie. This movie was a no doubt nothing lower than 9 without that ending. It's like the director, accepted the first plot ever decided, went on with the first scene recorded and completely ignored the after effects.<br/><br/>1. Clyde was a mastermind, in engineering, a spy, and a lawyer, and just the fact that a simple lawyer can out smart him is just an insult to the entire movie and the audience.<br/><br/>2. Clyde left the cleaning cart right where the bomb was placed.<br/><br/>3. Clyde placed the bomb in such an obvious place, as soon as Nick and his teammates walked in, they noticed the briefcase. If he had placed a big giant sign with a big red text on it saying ""The bomb is placed here"" wouldn't have made it anymore dumb.<br/><br/>4. Clyde leaves the place, and while on the road he checks the camera and sees the mayor and every member in the room. Why didn't he just blow the damn thing up? <br/><br/>5. The first thing I was confused about in those scenes, was why doesn't he switch the camera to room the bomb was places to see a quick situation on it. Oh wait a genius spy didn't think of that.<br/><br/>6. He leaves the area before Nick even discovers what kind of bomb it is, and what to do with it. But for some reason, they get to his cell ahead of time while Nick is in his ""I have learned my lesson"" appearance.<br/><br/>7. Clyde dies that day, in fact the prison literally explodes and not any kind of research to what happened? Who killed him and why was a bomb in prison? No I guess they might have been busy watching Nick's daughter playing on stage."
"aaslaksen-557-561421","1","325","442","16 October 2009"," LOL worst ending to a movie that had the potential to be as good as Taken
","LOL so I went to this movie expecting 2-ish hours of non-stop righteous anger and awesomeness a la ""Taken""... the movie built up pretty well with some flaws (why does he need to mysteriously need to escape from the cell and be his own accomplice?). And ended in probably the worst way I could possibly imagine. If I wanted to come up with the ultimate Hollywood BS ending, I could not have thought of what they pulled out of their *** myself. At some point the movie makes the conversion where Gerard Butler goes from good guy to bad, and Jamie Fox becomes the good guy... I definitely did not follow. Why would I want to see a movie where the morally bankrupt lawyer wins!? LOL that's so terrible it's worse than laughable; it's worth about 5 mins of laughing and 15 mins of ranting outside the theater after the movie ends (which I did btw). In a situation where the protagonists' wife and 10-year old daughter are raped and murdered, the entire system deserves to be brought down. If I go to a movie where the system screws over the little guy and that little guy comes back to dish out real justice, I absolutely, positively DO NOT want to see the ""system"" win in the end, regardless of any Hollywood-ed glossed over change of heart the corrupt lawyer might happen to have. I'd give it about an 8.5-9.0 until the last 15 minutes where it rapidly plummets to a 1.0 at best. Worst. Ending. Ever."

","This is a movie that's extremely fun to watch in the theaters because you get to hear and see everyone's reaction to each of his killings. The best one had people actually saying loudly ""wow"" and ""oh my god!"".<br/><br/>What drew me to the movie was the fact that the hero wasn't going around killing people with his bare hands or face to face. He was doing it with his mind, with careful planning, and deft precision. That was something refreshing to see. I can totally relate to his feelings of anger over the flaws in the justice system and his desire to take matters into his own hands - to make things right.<br/><br/>The ending was disappointing but the rest of the film was not and I liked it overall."
"rasa06","8","60","77","27 November 2009"," Unsatisfying ending
","This movie was fabulous until the last 10 minutes. it was full of action and real characters. The characters had flaws. Through the entire movie Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) was not a character that I liked or sided with, while Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) was human and easy to empathize with. Although the entire movie required suspension of disbelief, the ending was unfulfilling and implausible given the rest of the movie. It was as if the villain was actually Rice with his corruptness, while Shelton was indeed a law-abiding citizen driven to vengeance by the corruptness of Rice and the justice system. The real disjustice was the ending of this movie. I kept expecting the intelligence shown by Shelton throughout the movie to come to a head in the ending. I was highly disappointed by the anti-climatic ending. Stop the movie about 10 before the end and create your own ending; it will be better than what was on-screen."

","""Just as every cop is a criminal / And all the sinners saints. As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer / 'Cause I'm in need of some restraint..."" --Sympathy For The Devil, The Rolling Stones. <br/><br/>Handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser, I see a poster for LAW ABIDING CITIZEN and overhear the officer in the driver seat comment to his partner, ""Seen that movie? Awesome."" <br/><br/>Of course he'd think it was awesome. We all know that cops are bottom-rungers, trained watchdogs, the lowest cog apprehenders of the lowest cogs. They only know enough about ""The Law"" to apprehend without discernment. And they know nothing about ""Justice."" Now I could've tried to dissuade this bacon burger of his ignorant opinion, but a) I was busy exercising my right to remain silent, and b) he would not possess the mental capacity to comprehend me; which might have led to c) a nightstick to the throat.<br/><br/>LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is about a vigilante, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), who takes revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child. Clyde is apprehended by the police (see? ""apprehend without discernment"") and from his jail cell he terrorizes lazy, despicable attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) to teach him a lesson. Nick let the murderers walk on a plea bargain, instead of taking it to trial and risking losing a case. <br/><br/>CITIZEN starts as a very satisfactory, righteous vigilante story and an indictment against the criminal ""justice"" system, and turns into a one-dimensional vendetta that involves Clyde blowing stuff up, Hollywood style. <br/><br/>The movie's first half is a rollout of counterintuitive surprises: Clyde carving up his wife's murderer and then letting himself be taken in - naked, mind you, ladies! (that's some Sparta-licious booty!); Clyde citing an obscure case number at his hearing and the judge allowing him to walk - then chiding the judge for almost letting a suspected murderer go free and being taken into custody for contempt!; Clyde blackmailing Nick into getting him a Duxiana mattress and a steak dinner in jail. <br/><br/>When Clyde kills his cellmate unemotionally and lies back waiting for the warden peacefully, we realize something is going askew - it's a cool scene, but Clyde is starting to look like Hannibal Lecter, rather than a man bent on revenge for his wife. It astounds me how writer Kurt Wimmer and director F. Gary Gray lost the movie's message so inelegantly.<br/><br/>To stop Clyde blowing stuff up and teaching him lessons, Nick Rice decides to go vigilante and blow up Clyde, Hollywood style. Which means he learned NOTHING from Clyde. Taking the law into your own hands is EXACTLY what Nick was trying to stop Clyde from doing. Further, Nick had no proof that Clyde was perpetrating all the vengeful acts - you might ""know"" a person has committed crimes but before you BLOW THEM UP, shouldn't you take them to trial first, or at least read them their rights? <br/><br/>But that cop said this movie was ""awesome."" Getting an idea of the shallow mindset of uniformed flatfoots? <br/><br/>It gets tiresome when we can figure the ""winner"" of the movie by figuring the biggest paycheck. Butler may have carved his name into the A-List with 300, but Foxx (RAY, DREAMGIRLS, THE SOLOIST) is the money here. <br/><br/>Clyde states unequivocally, ""everyone must be held accountable for their actions,"" yet Nick is never brought to justice himself when HE goes vigilante without evidence. I've said it before: Vigilantism is as malformed and unjust as The Law that it thumbs its nose at. Two sides of the same confused coin. This movie chooses to ignore any further consequences of vigilantism or the law or justice after the moneyboy gets his way. <br/><br/>In the DVD Commentary, the filmmakers say Nick Rice is interested in Justice as a concept - but they've got it wrong. He's interested in The Law as a Job. Clyde laments he is a law abiding citizen, thus the law should deliver him justice. So we take it for granted the title pertains to him. But the unrealized irony in this movie is that detective Nick Rice is playing the LAW ABIDING CITIZEN - the one who suckles at the black teat of The Law for his advancement - and Clyde Shelton is the Justice-seeking citizen.<br/><br/>So explain the Justice of why I'm in the back of this police car?

Clyde is killing them and isn't even hiding it, he admits it. Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx ) is the DA on the case and needs to find out what the hell is going on.

If you're a smart ass while watching this movie you'll find out there are a lot of plot holes so I recommend you not to think it all through. Heads up for Gerard Butler, this guy is making some mayor progress on this one after some sh!tty movies last year. I think we'll be seeing more of King Leonidas in the future so hurray to that. On the opposite, Jamie Foxx is on a decline. Ray was an excellent movie but after that it's just bad. As Nick Rice the DA he is just one stone face mofo, no emotion no nothing.

","Law Abiding Citizen, in a way, is a movie that became too big for it's own good. The Gerard Butler character was a mastermind. He was so intelligent that no one could figure out how he was doing the things he was doing. So crafty, that no matter what safety precautions were taken, people were still dying. The problem, though, became very apparent as Citizen was nearing the last half hour. How do you explain it all. It's almost as if 3/4 of this movie was made, and then the makers remembered that they had to end this thing. And so they did. Only what we were given, the resolution to it all, was so anticlimactic (and for that matter, unbelievable) that it was almost laughable. I think it would have been better to leave it a mystery then to give the audience what was one of the most outlandish conclusions to a film I've seen in a long time. That's not to say that what came before this was a masterpiece. The dialogue was, at times decent, and at other times sub-par. The characters were never developed enough for people to really care about what happened to them, and the editing left something to be desired. But even with all of that I was still interested. I still wanted to see where all of this was going, and how all of this was happening. I shouldn't have been so eager. They say that sometimes, the unknown is much more intriguing than the known.

Unfortunately, after a successful killing spree against numerous members of the justice department from within his jail cell in solitary confinement, the star of the show, who is smart enough to arrange all of this, is somehow clumsy enough to allow his methods, nightly exit route from prison and piece de resistance (napalm bomb) to be discovered, leading to an about face by the chief prosecutor (now DA) who suddenly goes from object of hatred to vilified victim/come star as the previous randomly dumped star of the show napalms himself by accident. What a shame, what a confusing and ridiculous ending.

","In Philadelphia, the family man Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is violently attacked at home by two punks and his wife and daughter are rapped and murdered by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte). The two criminals are arrested by the police but the ambitious D.A. Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) makes a deal with the assassin Darby that accuses his partner to keep his average of convictions in court despite the protest of Clyde. Ten years later, Darby's partner is executed by lethal injection but the defective machine makes him suffer lots of pain. Meanwhile Clyde abducts Darby and executes him in a sadistic way. Clyde is arrested without evidences and Nick negotiates his confession. Sooner Nick discovers that the purpose of Clyde is not only vengeance, but to destroy the corrupt justice system and the head of the city that released the assassin of his family. <br/><br/>Since I saw the trailer of ""Law Abiding Citizen"", I have been anxious to see this film. Last week, it was released on DVD in Brazil by Swen Filmes and after watching it, unfortunately I found it a blockbuster movie with a promising beginning and a disappointing conclusion. The plot works well showing the deception of an apparently common citizen with the way the corrupt justice system works. Then there is the first inconsistency: why should a man with his background wait for ten years to catch a criminal that had been released seven years ago? Why should he be in jail to destroy the justice system and the City Hall? Last but not the least, why didn't he kill the wife and daughter of Nick Rice to make him feel the same sort of pain and grief that he had been submitted with his decision? That would be the most appropriate revenge for an intelligent man after killing the murderers of his family, but probably the producers were more interested in the box office than in a reasonably more believable non-commercial plot. Only people that do not think might find this movie amazing as I glanced in some reviews. The exaggeration and accuracy of his plans are also annoying and absolutely unbelievable, and the arrogant character performed by Jamie Foxx is despicable to win in the end. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""CÃ³digo de Conduta"" (""Code of Conduct"")"

","Why, oh why can't we see just one movie come out of the American Stables where the ""bad guy"" (who isn't really bad) wins? This film, as others have said so many times, is great until the last 15 minutes but then the whole automatic ""but you can't take the law into your own hands"" moral bull kicks in. I'd like to see just one director have the guts to show that sometimes the law has to be broken for justice to be done because the legal system can be corrupted. This film DID show that the system sometimes doesn't work. It illustrated that very well but it still followed the same path of countless others like it and veered away from the real justice towards the pseudo-moralistic tired old message; the Law is the Law.

The supporting cast is dreadful, none worse than Viola Davis who offers one of the worst, least convincing, acting performances I have ever seen.<br/><br/>There is potential in the scenario of a suspect seemingly wreaking havoc from behind the prison walls, but the explanation, when revealed, is so preposterous, and the ending, just plain stupid.To be found in the bargain bins at a DVD outlet near you soon."

","""A Serious Man"" was sold out, so I needed to waste two hours before the next showing with another movie. I picked this one. Big mistake. It is about a genius government assassin who gets revenge on a corrupt justice system with the aid of a machine gun, an exploding cell phone and blowfish venom. We do not get much insight into his character, because most of the movie's dialogue consists of variations on the phrase ""This is f**ked up."" Along the way, a series of strange riddles are raised: 1) Why does the CIA assassin live in a neighborhood where junkies are liable to break into his home and kill his family? Wouldn't his pay grade allow him a home with less riffraff and better security? 2) Why would a CIA assassin be surprised at the fact that the justice system is flawed? 3) Why does the Philadelphia city government keep scheduling meetings to figure out how the assassin is committing murder from his prison cell, yet it never occurs to anyone to maybe install a camera or a guard to see what he's doing in there all day? 3) Couldn't the city at least transfer him to a higher-security prison after he confesses to killing about 12 people? 4) Why do the two lawyers go investigate the Batcave BY THEMSELVES when they can't even get through a full workday without a colleague being killed by an exploding object? 4) How can a bomb under a bed incinerate everything but the bed? <br/><br/>I think the answer to these riddles is, ""Because the movie is retarded,"" but they still left me feeling upset and confused. It is worth noting that at one point in the movie, certain events are recorded to a DVD seen by the lawyer character's daughter, and the lawyer describes the DVD as ""a dumb horror movie that she shouldn't be watching."" That sums it up. Even the characters in the movie thought the movie was dumb. 2/10."
"Siamois","4","12","15","19 January 2010"," When important issues are trivialized
","The core concept of this film made it an excellent candidate for griping, pulse-pounding cinema with a message. There is this seemingly ordinary man, Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler). One night he and his family are attacked, only him survives. The main culprit gets off easily thanks to the parody that can be the justice system and a career-driven prosecutor (Jamie Foxx). We are quickly introduced to Sheldon and his family and we feel for him when everything is taken from him, destroyed. On the other side of the coin, Jamie Foxx plays an interesting character in Nick Rice. When the film starts, Rice is a young, ambitious man who seems already jaded by the system, unaware that behind each case, there is a human story. But we still sense a decent man, a family man as well just like Clyde. Nonetheless, Rice makes a deal with the man who killed Clyde's family. This all takes place in the first 15 minutes of the movie or so, then the rest of the film takes place ten years later, when Clyde comes after everyone who was involved, killers and lawyers alike. <br/><br/>What makes this movie extremely interesting early on are the lack of clear drawn moral lines. Both Sheldon and Rice are flawed individuals in an imperfect, cruel world. But the movie goes south very, very fast as the ""Hollywood factor"" is cranked up. <br/><br/>First and most important script mistake: Clyde is not an ordinary man. He's a tech genius and super assassin. Congratulations to writer Kurt Wimmer Gary Gray for making us relate to that dude early in the film only to make him yet another superhuman. When Clyde goes on a rampage, the plot becomes so far-fetched and unbelievable, it destroys much of the underlines themes that made the movie click with people. <br/><br/>A great many people are dissatisfied with the holes perceived in modern justice systems. We see the flaws and the maze of procedures. We would like the accused to have their rights, but we also want justice for victims. Many of us have felt at one point or another that justice was not served and have felt disempowered. The premise of this film strikes a chord because the thought that an average joe might try to rectify this appeals to us. But he's not an average joe. <br/><br/>Second script mistake: as the movie evolves, Clyde goes from being a misguided guy out for his own brand of justice to a megalomaniacal caricature, half-way between a comic book villain (think Magneto) and a terrorist out for mass destruction. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the seemingly arrogant, jaded D.A. Nick Rice doesn't seem to evolve at all in the 10 years since this incident happens. And we're not really exploring his character, inner issues or doubts he could have. <br/><br/>All the grey zones, the lack of black and white that this plot built in the first 10 minutes quickly erode into a story that is black and white, with lines clearly drawn. Clyde is the bad guy. Nick the good guy (and a boring, inefficient one at that). <br/><br/>The actual rest of the film? Lots of explosions and incidents that seem to come right out of an action thriller movie like Die Hard... only the whole structure of the film is that of a crime thriller, not an action movie. Because of that, because of the lack of humor (this is the plot of a serious film, executed like a humorous blockbuster) the film is terribly dysfunctional. <br/><br/>The result is a forgettable entry that doesn't qualify as an effective drama, or an effective action film... or an effective anything. It's just a missed opportunity."

Butler is excellent as the crushed father and husband who believes he must use his unique skills and talent to make an example of a justice system that has forgotten the victims. You sympathize with him even as he enacts his vicious lesson plan upon Foxx's coworkers. Foxx is an arrogant self-serving assistant district attorney who is only concerned with his conviction rate as he claws his way up the ladder in the justice system. He has forgotten the victims. But when he has a family of his own, he begins to see Clyde's point, yet he cannot give in to all of Clyde's demands to stop the carnage.

You can compare Clyde to the Joker pretty much, but in my opinion 10 times better. Clyde devises sneaky and cunning ways by taking down his victims and the whole sense on whether he is the hero or villain also adds to the excitement. Jamie Fox also does a great job playing his character, a heroic yet corrupt lawyer.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes that will guaranteed make you laugh and a few scenes that will pretty much tell you that Clyde is just one kickbutt character, no questions about it. Every scene you will be wondering what will happen next, because you honestly won't know. The movie has a few twists and turns and will always keep you guessing.

"Buddy-51","7","24","36","17 May 2012"," Entertaining if occasionally implausible thriller
","""Law Abiding Citizen"" starts out like a modern-day version of ""Death Wish,"" spends a few moments aping the ""Saw"" franchise, then settles in as a cat-and-mouse crime drama centered around the theme that the American legal system seems designed as much to thwart justice as to enact it.<br/><br/>The movie stands firmly in the long tradition of wish-fulfillment fantasies in which the victim of a broken legal system - functioning as a stand-in for an equally frustrated and helpless audience - finally says enough is enough and takes matters into his own hands, even going outside the limits of the law, if that's what it takes, to achieve justice.<br/><br/>As with the Charles Bronson character in ""Death Wish,"" Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton witnesses his wife and daughter being brutally raped and murdered by a couple of armed intruders. When the worst of the perpetrators cops a plea and is back out on the streets after a mere three years behind bars, Clyde is forced to take matters into his own hands. But he isn't content merely to bring down the killers themselves but to systematically go after everyone in the legal system â€“ from strict-constructionist judges to hamstrung attorneys - who helped facilitate the injustice. That's where Nick Rice, well played by Jamie Foxx, comes in, the decent but by-the-book prosecutor who helped set up the deal and has now, along with everyone else involved with the case, become a prime target for Clyde's take-no-prisoners reign of terror and retribution.<br/><br/>The one thing that distinguishes ""Law Abiding Citizen"" from similar films in the genre is that it's not afraid to have a deeply troubled, possibly even psychotic, character at its core. For Clyde does not fit the mold of the typically lovable antihero. The audience is, in the early stages at least, asked to root him on as a conventional Angel of Retribution dispensing the justice that the court system saw fit to deny him, but so much of what he winds up doing steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics. It's this moral ambiguity that helps to mitigate some of the implausibility of Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which often goes for effect at the expense of credibility. Indeed the movie's insistence at making him a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent existential force of nature to be reckoned with takes the movie out of the realm of reality and cheapens some of what it is trying to do. And, in the process of reaching its climax, the movie takes a plot turn so ludicrous and credibility-defying that the whole thing pretty much crashes and burns at the end.<br/><br/>That being said, Nick's interactions with Clyde are fun to watch and, thanks to taut direction by F. Gary Gray, there are some moments of genuine suspense scattered along the way. So if you can put your skepticism and critical-thinking skills on hold for the duration, you can have a pretty decent time with ""Law Abiding Citizen."""
"chicagopoetry","4","37","61","19 October 2009"," One Of The Worst Vigilante Movies Ever Made
","I guess every actor sooner or later finds himself in the position that Denzel Washington found himself in with ""Fallen"" and ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is certainly Jamie Foxx's low point. I was looking forward to this because I thought it was going to be a drama about an ""every day guy"" (as advertised) taking the law into his own hands after his family is brutally murdered, but instead it turned out to be about an unbelievable super spook somehow wreaking vengeance on all the wrong people in a truly ridiculous, boring and uninspired tale of misguided revenge. Gerard Butler's interpretation of Anthopny Hopkins in Fracture or Kevin Spacey in Seven only kept the momentum going for a little while until the completely absurd plot took over. This is one of those movies where you are expected to suspend your disbelief indefinitely but unfortunately, the nagging question lingers that if this guy is able to concoct and exact such elaborate plots from a solitary confinement prison cell, then why couldn't he defend his own wife and child in his own home to begin with. Silly, stupid, and a waste of time. Let's hope Jamie Foxx holds out for something better next time."
"dfranzen70","5","26","42","15 October 2009"," Senseless, predictable, sloppy
","F. Gary Gray's Law Abiding Citizen, about a man using violence to bring down the legal system while behind bars, falls under the weight of its own premise. Butler and Foxx are good, but movie pretends there's a cat-and-mouse game afoot; Foxx's DA has little to do but run from explosion to explosion, and by the end logic and continuity have been cheerfully tossed out the window.<br/><br/>Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is an average guy who's victimized by a home invasion, during which his wife and daughter are murdered while he watches, tied up. The bad guys are rounded up, and district attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) gets one of them to sell out the other, thus making a deal that allows the first to get off scot free. As you might imagine, this doesn't sit too well with Mr. Shelton, who is not happy that the deal was made without his knowledge or input.<br/><br/>Flash forward ten years later, and the convicted felon is about to be executed, and it turns out to not be a particularly pleasant execution - things go wrong, the bad guy suffers a painful death, and so on. Rice eventually puts two and two together and figures out that Shelton's behind it - but it seems that there's more to the situation than meets the eye, as Shelton has an entirely different agenda in mind. And thus begins the nominal cat-and-mouse game, as Shelton continues to wreak havoc while in solitary confinement in Philadelphia's maximum-security prison.<br/><br/>For me, the movie fails on several levels. Although it does have plenty of well-staged action scenes, the logic needed to sustain what's really a psychological thriller is absent in large quantities, as the so-called good guys' actions often don't make much sense other than to propel the plot a bit more.<br/><br/>First and foremost is the motivation. Shelton is mad because Rice took the deal that let one of the guys who murdered his (Shelton's) family go free. Shelton then decides to ""show"" everyone involved that their system of justice isn't optimal for anyone other than the bad guys; to illustrate this point, he decides to bump off those who had anything to do with the plea bargain. Which makes sense to a point, but Shelton then extends that logic to include anyone involved with those involved with the plea bargain, and even those who happen to be idly walking by (figuratively speaking).<br/><br/>So at first, we're meant to think that Shelton's a victim here (he is), and we really should root for him. We're in his corner. Rice is an egotistical jerkwad who barely notices his family and doesn't prosecute unless he's assured of a victory, so he's easily seen as a bad guy. But over the course of the film, sympathy for Shelton and his situation completely disappears. Which would have been fine if Rice had been shown as an equal match for Shelton's wits - he was instead led around by his nose, constantly several steps behind the villain.<br/><br/>And therein lies a crucial problem with the movie: it's predictable. Yes, there are some scenes that will make you jump, but Gray takes so long in setting them up that you sort of expect them to happen. There's also the problem of showing the best action scenes in the previews and trailers, so you know those are upcoming as well.<br/><br/>This is a standard revenge action film with a twist (i.e., that the antagonist is behind bars while most of the mayhem is occurring) that doesn't even make sense at the end of the movie. Let me put it this way, to avoid spoilers. Throughout the movie, you're wondering how Shelton is able to accomplish his violent deeds while in solitary confinement - really, the only thing the movie has going for it - but when you find out his secret, it's so mundane and eminently avoidable that you wonder what all the fuss was about. In fact, the ending itself is senseless, as a better alternative certainly was available.<br/><br/>You also wonder if Shelton's point about the injustice of the justice system was even really made; Shelton's slaughter of the innocents doesn't prove that the system is injust, it just proves he's a sadistic murderer.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to witness a question-and-answer session with director Gray after the movie. I took the following from the session: 1. F. Gary Gray likes doing different types of movies, because he wants to avoid being typecast. And yet this movie wasn't cinematically much different than, say The Negotiator or even Set It Off. So I'm not sure this was an accurate point.<br/><br/>2. F. Gary Gray doesn't think this movie is anything like The Dark Knight. An audience member drew the parallel, but the director seemed to think that his movie was much better than the Batman movie, and he downplayed any thematic similarities. Here's why they're similar. Each film has a psychotic bad guy who spends much of the film trying to get under the protagonist's skin - and usually succeeds while in custody of law enforcement. Both films are dark, psychological thrillers. Both films have antagonists who have more vibrant personalities than their respective foils. The films differ in that the performance of one actor (Heath Ledger) was monumentally better than that of the corresponding bad guy (Butler).<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen, hyphen or no hyphen, is an overblown, illogical mess that can be a lot of fun to watch if one checks one's brain at the door and isn't concerned with such notions as cohesion and reason. Things go explody. The end."
"Bonesnap","7","7","9","31 May 2010"," An ending that works (for me)
","Almost everyone agrees. Law Abiding Citizen is a great movie but the ending sucks.<br/><br/>The problem is, with about 30 minutes to go, the movie wants us to stop cheering on Clyde (Gerry Butler) and suddenly start thinking of Nick (Jamie Foxx) as the hero. That's not going to work, the audience has just invested about 90 minutes of wanting Clyde to continue with his vengeance. Damn right too.<br/><br/>The plot should have continued to its logical conclusion. Clyde was trying to teach Nick a lesson, that the system was so broken that it could only be fixed by being destroyed first. Rather than the squeaky-Hollywood-ending-slop they served up, here's what should have happened...<br/><br/>In the solitary confinement cell at the end, Jamie Foxx's character Nick should have taken the cell-phone from Clyde then remote-detonated the bomb at city hall, blowing up the mayor, the brass, the whole rotten system, then gone off to watch his daughter's cello recital.<br/><br/>Now, that ending would have been really insane, but it would have taken the movie to its logical conclusion. Nick's conversion would have been complete. As an ending, it would be right up there with Jimmy Cagney at the end of White Heat, 'Made it Ma, top of the world!' Morally dubious, yes, but it would have given us a bona-fide classic. It would be rating 9.8 here on IMDb rather than this insipid seven-point-bleh.<br/><br/>Oh, and the movie loses a point for Gerard Butler not using his own voice. Gerry is a Scot and has a fine Glasgow accent, he should use it."

","I was curious to see what Law Abiding Citizen had in store and I was not surprised to see an intelligent and thought provoking film. Gerard Butler stars as Clyde, a man who watched his wife and daughter die at the hands of two dirt bags. One of the dirt bags testifies against the other and one of them gets death row while the other goes free. The lawyer who makes the deal on Clyde's ""behalf"" is Nick (Jaime Foxx). Foxx plays a truly unlikeable character, despite being the protagonist. Ten years later, when death row time comes for one of the killers, it goes horribly wrong and both of them are killed...the trail of blood leads right to Clyde.<br/><br/>Clyde is taken into jail and he won't give a confession. This is where it gets interesting. Clyde uses leverage through threats which he is capable of making good on. He can somehow kill people in jail. He mostly uses explosives and carefully assembled sequences of chemicals. As an audience member (and I could even gather this from the trailer) it's very satisfying watching Clyde's devices kill people. It's easily the best aspect of the film.<br/><br/>This is where, despite it being incredibly interesting and entertaining, the film is lacking a bit. You know the ending from the start. As an audience member you know from the get go that justice and truth and morality will ALWAYS prevail, which is an issue that this film really tries to bring to the spotlight. The court system is corrupt. You can't help but side with Clyde and delight in him killing people throughout. Unless I'm sick and deranged...I was totally on his side the entire time. Not just for his philosophy, but because he gives us the sort of sick torture and gratifying kills that America wants to see. How on earth can we cheer for law abiding Jaime Foxx's dry character and his walking victims of friends and family? There are a few plot holes, but I can't give them away without spoiling the film. Other than the morality struggle the film puts the audience into (we cheer for the villain) it's great entertainment.

","Although there are plenty of opportunities to find loopholes in the script for LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, it's basically a thriller about vengeance sought by a man wronged by the justice system who feels he has a right to kill anyone connected with the case involving the brutal murder of his wife and daughter. JAMIE FOXX is the DA who orchestrates the plea bargain that gives one of the guilty men a good deal.<br/><br/>And it's directed in such a skillful way by F. Gary Gray and played with such intensity by GERARD BUTLER and JAMIE FOXX, that it keeps you riveted to the screen for the duration of the plot. The supporting performances are all expert, especially VIOLA DAVIS as the frustrated mayor of Philadelphia and ANNIE CORLEY as a judge who rules by the book.<br/><br/>When you stop to think about it, much of the plot is less than credible with Butler able to outwit and keep one step ahead of the authorities all the way until the contrived ending. But it's an interesting plot, keeping the viewer in suspense as to what will happen next. It succeeds on the high tension level right up to the fiery climax.<br/><br/>Butler scowls a lot and gives the impression that he can hold a grudge better than any man on earth, especially since what he does goes to such extremes. <br/><br/>Although none of the characters have much depth, they move through their roles with enough skill to make even the credibility angle be something you're likely to overlook for the sake of a good thriller. The tension is set at the grim opening scene and there's never a let-up, even though there are occasional bits of humor thrown in for good measure."
"DICK STEEL","5","19","32","17 January 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Law Abiding Citizen
","Law Abiding Citizen is one of those thrillers that has a great premise and idea, but bogged down by so many plot loopholes that it becomes an effortless comedy. What was supposedly an excellent run riddled with implausibilities became even more ridiculous in the final 10 minutes that you'd wonder if anyone had any inkling of a logical conclusion, or had decided to cop it all out to avoid being branded as anti-establishment, and as a result, just plain ordinary lacking the guts to just stick with its plan to the end.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx stars as hotshot (assistant) district attorney Nick Rice, who boasts an extremely high conviction rate, a fact that he repeats many times, and we learn his dirty little secret was to make deals with the guilty - charge them for less, but they still get charged anyway. A conviction is better than no conviction at all should he lose the case. Too bad his latest case was, in my opinion an open and shut one, and he steps on the shoes of the victim, Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler), making a deal with the murderers of his family such that one gets sentenced to death while the other gets a short jail term. Not very ethical, but he gets to chalk up his positive statistics.<br/><br/>The perversion of the justice system gets highlighted, since justice is blind and the law can be manipulated with flip-flopping highly paid lawyers and incompetent judges. So Clyde decides to take on the system and teach them all a lesson. Which is a walk in the park because he's a clandestine strategist, but who had misguided faith in the system which explains why he sits around and does nothing, until 10 years later, which is acceptable according to an old Chinese proverb, to exact some form of revenge, making this like a torture porn outing, but without much of the gore on display.<br/><br/>I'd appreciate the film for its take on vigilantism when the system fails you through its corruption and incompetence, and just how much the limit actually is in order to push a man over the edge to declare war on just everybody, and pissing on the system while at it. Turning the system's tools and procedures over its head and onto the same organization may seem like guilty fun, but when the payback gets a wee bit sophisticated each time, you'd start to wonder on the plausibility of it all, even though it was established that Clyde Shelton is a man who can kill you softly while looking directly at you.<br/><br/>The film boils down to which side will you be on, and who would you root for. There's this shade of gray in both men, one willing to make deals with murderers to keep up his personal record, the other taking the law into his own hands, only to not want to stop when the going gets good, but being more ambitious in wanting to take down the whole system. From his prison cell no less. Although Clyde has a valuable lesson to impart to Nick in that what's important is doing the right thing, it did go a tad overboard in order to amplify its idea, especially with sweeping statements like how the entire city got gripped by the apparent acts of terrorism.<br/><br/>Gerard Butlner plays his character crazed since he's a man with absolutely nothing to lose, though it's quite unbelievable that for someone who's well versed in clandestine operations to be ambushed like you see in the trailers, without so much of a counter-strategy in place. But between the two leads Jamie Foxx seemed a little uncomfortable as he can't really portray that degree of arrogance required, and given the emotional distance from his family director F. Gary Gray failed to allow you to feel Nick's fear when his own family got threatened by Clyde.<br/><br/>But the real stinker was the insult to the audience's intelligence in the final moments which tried way too hard to be clever in introducing an impossible twist which has to involve time travel. It's quite the slap in the face telling you that Fate will shine its light on the powers that be, or on any one else bent on seeking justice, but one must know when to stop before going too far and lady luck begins to turn her attention away. Recommended for the build up, but not its unsatisfying, gutless ending."

So the initial and main plot device *just doesn't work* - the perps are all obviously guilty of murder since there was a witness who saw them invade his house and there was the presence dead bodies regardless of who did the actual killing.

"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","18","31","26 October 2009"," Liberty and Justice for All? I don't think so
","Law Abiding Citizen, the movie that I wasn't sure what to expect from. I knew from the trailer that I wanted to see it, it has two great actors, Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx. A really great concept to show how messed up our judicial system is in America. But ends up being more of an action film above all. If you get past the all the parts that are not believable, this was a great movie. I just let go and started having fun with it, but what kept it from being a terrific movie was the ending, I'll get to that in a bit. I love these films, the movies that point out screwed up a system can be, a poor man looses his family to a violent crime and there's a deal made so the one who actually did the crime is the lesser punished? We see that on the news every day and just shake our heads on how messed up it is to see scum on the streets on technicality. Law Abiding Citizen has you rooting for a man who did what any man or woman would do if they felt their case was over looked, but then when he goes above and beyond it, that's when the movie goes in being unbelievable.<br/><br/>After a home invasion that left his wife and daughter dead, Clyde Shelton, a top-notch retired spy is told that one of the criminals who killed his wife and daughter would get off, due to his cooperation with the district attorney's office to put his accomplice on death row. Ten years later Shelton begins exacting revenge not just against the criminals, but the entire justice system. He is quickly captured, but Nick Rice, a young D.A. at the time who chose to make the deal in order to keep his conviction rate up so he could climb in the ranks in the department, realizes that prison isn't enough to keep Shelton from killing everyone involved in letting Clyde's family down, criminal or judicial.<br/><br/>I'm really struggling with this movie, because I don't want you to get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie very much. I just think that the concept was a bit far fetched, we went from rooting to Clyde to saying ""woah, hey, you've gone to far"" which makes you question your own morality. But I'm warning you, there are major spoilers after this. The ending was what ticked me off, Clyde is this genius who has figured everything out, he knows what he's doing and can always be 2 steps ahead of the people who are investigating him. When Nick discovers how Clyde has always been 2 steps ahead, it's like that's it, we're done. That's it for Clyde, he dies and that's it? I'm just supposed to accept that Clyde doesn't have a back up plan or maybe surprises us by having a complete different use for the bomb he planted than what Nick thought of in the first place? But I have to let it go, because most of the movie is actually good, you let go and it's a great movie, it's just the ending that lost it for me. But it is worth the watch, but I think I would tell you to rent it vs. seeing it in the theater.<br/><br/>7/10"
"the-movie-guy","10","37","71","7 October 2009"," Law Abiding Citizen is a commentary about our justice system
","(Synopsis) Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is a brilliant planner and inventor. One night two robbers invade his Philadelphia home and brutally kill his wife and daughter, and almost kill him. The killers are caught, and Assistant DA Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is assigned the case. Nick is ordered by the DA to make a deal with one of the killers to testify against his partner for a 10 year plea bargain prison sentence. Clyde doesn't want Nick to make the deal, but Nick says it was too late and the deal is done. The other killer got the death penalty. After 10 years, the other killer is released from prison, and he soon ends up dead. Clyde is arrested and kind of admits to Nick that he did it. Clyde is put in jail, and he warns Nick that he must fix the broken justice system that failed him and his family or else anyone connected to his case will soon die. Even from jail, Clyde's threats become a reality, and Nick must stop Clyde before his family is next.<br/><br/>(My Comment) Law Abiding Citizen is not only a thriller, but also makes a commentary about our justice system. It is unconscionable that a victim of a brutal crime must take justice into his own hands. Gerard Butler does a fantastic job of taking out his vengeance against the justice system. At first you think he is right, but then he goes too far and just becomes another sociopathic criminal. Jamie Foxx does a wonderful job of trying to outsmart his adversary and in doing so, he learns a lesson, you don't make deals with murders. The movie has several twists and turns that will keep you guessing, and on the edge of your seat. Overall, this is one good movie that is a must see. (Overture Films, Run Time 1:48, Rated R) (10/10)"

","We just watched this movie and really thought the thing was a load of far fetched Hollywood tripe. Its always disappointing when a poorly scripted story begins to show holes and continues to become a far fetched fantasy that our 3 year old wouldn't buy. We thought the introduction was a little messy and the story just got worse as it went on... I don't really think it deserves a 2 so I am going to change that to a 1. I'm starting to think Jamie Foxx might be better off sticking to music and the other main character better in a remake of Braveheart with Mel Gibson as the village elder and Tom Cruise as the loner who comes in to assist when the s*it hits the fan... and everyone lives happily ever after.

","The movie was filmed decently, the shots were okay. The script itself was horrible, overall making the entire movie pretty bad. In my opinion there were lots of useless shots without purpose, beyond buying time. The highlight of this movie is when Darby (Christian Stolte) escapes the police with the assistance of Cylde (Gerard Butler). There was no purpose of knowing of Jamie Foxx's family in the script, The character's Kelly Rice, and Denise Rice did nothing for the movie as a whole. As I stated there were a lot of useless shots with a purpose these were some of them, resulting in poorly advancing the plot of the story. Overall the plot was horrible the worst part of the film was the ending. I give Law Abiding Citizen 2 out of 10."

","I wish I could get my mind wiped after experiencing this sick and twisted film. Perhaps I'll have to watch The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to help do the trick. I went because I thought I'd see what Gerard Butler's up to these days. And since his name also appears on the producing credit, I figured it must be a bit of a labour of love. The labour, I have discovered is in trying to forget this dreadful film. The only thing I wished for after witnessing this dreary affair was to get my two hours back. Can't be done, I'm afraid. Just have to forget about it and move on. Hopefully writing this will help with that process.<br/><br/>This film relies heavily on it's powerful moments of intellectual intrigue, watching the two leads match their wits against one another. Outside of those moments the film holds no greater gravitas. And ultimately, watching the gruesome death toll rise is an extremely witless experience. I left feeling soiled to the point of needing a shower for my pains in participating in this macabre exercise in blood-letting and ego-posturing.<br/><br/>I am left wondering, with so many better movies to see in the world why have I wasted my time on this one?"

I accept that I am most definitely not the target audience which is probably 18 year old boys but I still have to have a few words to say about this utter garbage.<br/><br/>The opening scene was extremely violent and frankly nauseating to watch. We nearly walked out then. However we crossed our fingers and stayed. It was obvious this was going to be a revenge movie but the common man trying to take on either the bad guys or the system might have been worth watching. But no. Gerard Butler turns out not to be you or me, no he's superman performing superhuman feats of total unbelievability accompanied by the regulation massive explosions etc.<br/><br/>Yes it has its little twist in the plot but that doesn't compensate for the complete moral vacuum that exists for every character and the story itself. There are no good guys here. No one you can cheer for because none of them have the slightest concept of how perverted their belief system is. This carries on through right to the end which is appalling for its complete surrender to violence as the ultimate solution.

I could relate with this film as well since it has to do with the justice system having a lot of flaws and I was screwed before cause of it as well like many others. But Clyde Shelton who is a character played by Gerard Butler got screwed really bad, his wife and daughter gets brutally murdered in the beginning of the movie and the killers just gets away with a tap on the wrist by the justice system. This film made me question what is right and what is wrong and the boundaries and what justice really is cause there really isn't a definite form of justice, Clyde Shelton doesn't seem to be fighting for his family but for himself as well although you can't help but cheer for the guy. The character Jamie Foxx played wasn't a likable character even if he thinks he is on the right side of the law, he just doesn't give a crap about his client or even tries to be in the shoes of the victims but acts like it's just a poker game regardless of the case and goes about bragging about his 96% conviction rate and while thinking his life is fine and dandy, he was just mundane throughout the film. The story fast forward to 10 yrs later after the entire smug legal system that basically leaving the client behind and just basically telling him to shut up and the rampage begins with Clyde Shelton getting some payback and trying to take down the system with some cool twist and turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat. What I really liked about the film is that it doesn't just show the victims perspective but Clyde Shelton's perspective as well when he goes on a rampage, and the guy definitely has a right to be angry so some of his kills are satisfying cause you feel they deserved it, and he is not just a badass but also intelligent and elaborate. I thought every actor and actress got the right amount of screen time, except Josh Stewart cause his talent went to complete waste. Gerard Butler starts off being a hero that just about everyone can cheer for cause let's face it we all been screwed by the legal system while not really being a terrorist and I was with him in till he becomes the super villain. The disappointment of this film is that just about every character in this film is just not likable and the message of the screwed up system gets lost as the film progresses. If this film was ballsier and ambiguous I would have given it a higher rating, but despite that it was a entertaining one and you won't feel cheated while watching it in theaters it just ain't a deep movie.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Action is a genre in desperate need of some young blood. In a day and age where a 62 year old Sylvester Stallone (not looking a day of it!) can be a box office sell out with a fourth Rambo film, it just goes to show how much they're relying on the old stars to draw in the crowds. There have been some more modern stars with potential, such as Vin Diesel and The Rock, but they've never been given a script that really struck fans. The same could be said of muscly Glaswegian lead Gerard Butler, who's been in recent films such as the joyless, soulless Gamer and poor man's Gladiator 300. And this latest disappointment makes nothing any better.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen had the potential to be a really tough, raw action thriller and in some ways it sort of does. The plot's the familiar, formulaic sort involving a man who's family are murdered right in front of him, only to see justice fail him and for him to return ten years later with vengeance on his mind. But after his first encounter with his first thug, where he pretends to be a sleeping cop, the film's credibility goes completely out the window and it turns into a ridiculous, far fetched fantastical sort of tale that goes completely against the raw, realistic revenge film it was advertised as. Since the plot's very similar to The Punisher, you see how that film worked because of the fantasy/comic book theme to it and it's outlandishness wasn't a problem but here it completely eviscerates the tone. Further implausibilities and inconsistencies keep popping up throughout the film and before long it's all gotten too much. The fact that it all ends up being quite predictable doesn't help, either.<br/><br/>The opening sequence has gained some tongues wagging for how nasty and shocking it is, and while it's certainly not nice, the film really picks up it's mean spirited side more towards the end, by which time it's gotten even more silly and unbelievable, and boredom has inevitably set in. F Gary Gray most notably directed the distracting but unremarkable hostage thriller The Negotiator but that's a masterpiece to sit through compared to this, a dark revenge tale that had the potential to really get under your skin but ends up getting under your nerves. *"

It doesn't even have the guts to follow through with it's inane premise in a remotely logical or interesting way and veers off into wonder bread land because in the end we wouldn't want to make the natives restless.

"kuciak","8","5","7","2 November 2009"," white man as victim in age of Obama
","In a book called the Oxford History of World Cinema, their is an interesting article written by Joseph Sartelle called Dreams and Nightmares in the Hollywood Blockbuster. he makes some interesting points, especially regarding the movie DIE HARD, suggesting that our hero in that movie is also somewhat also representative of THE WHITE MAN AS VICTIM. He also sites some other films. While the writer's theory may be preposterous to some, it is interesting. In Law Abiding Citizen, F Gary Gray seems to be commenting in his film on this. He is also commenting as well on the changing roles in our society of authority figures, and the age of a possible terrorist attack that we live in.<br/><br/>Clyde Shelton, as played by Gerald Butler is THE LAW ABIDING CITIZEN. However, while he is a victim, having lost his wife and daughter to a heinous crime, how law abiding is he. We learn that in the past he was somewhat of a think tank who helped people in our government get rid of people they considered undesirable by apparently ingenious ways. When justice does not serve this man who has been involved in others deaths, look out for this law abiding citizen. Perhaps F Gary Gray is suggesting that the most dangerous man in the world is the white male who sees himself as victim. Shelton could even be somewhat representative of the US after 9/11, out for revenge, and justifying why he must do what he is doing, and killing as he is killing.<br/><br/>While he clearly has the audience sympathizing with Clyde Shelton, his first murder that he does is on a very disturbing note. During the execution of Darby's accomplice in the killing of Sheltons wife and family, a man who we realize is remorseful, and is apparently less guilty of the two men, but perhaps did not have as good a lawyer, Shelton has some canisters changed, so that this executed man, not only is executed, but suffers as well. Even Shelton's killing of the more guilty Darby, is done by the mind of a very sick individual.<br/><br/>Nick Rice as played by Jamie Fox is presented as an ambitious, but not very likable individual. He is more concerned about his percentage of guilty verdicts, even if it means that an evil scumbag like Darby will get a short sentence. That he is black, and like Shelton earlier, has a wife and daughter is no accident. The only reason we as an audience do not want him to get killed, is because we are more concerned about his wife and daughter, the two protagonists in this film, are neither hero or villain. That two of the leading white characters, a woman just below him, and his boss, an older male, are killed by Shelton, allows for Nick Rice to reach his dream of being the top man. The black mayor played by Viola Davis, tells Nick that he should be fired. However, instead she has her black aide, a man bring a bible, and swears in Nick as the top DA. That all three people in this room during that time are African Americans suggests the new roles that African Americans are taking in this the US, and perhaps Gray is asking the question if someone like Obama will be different from his predecessors. The Mayor, a more sympathetic figure than Nick Rice, even she during the meeting, where she may become a victim of an explosion bring up Homeland Security. At the end of the film, Nick is able to watch his daughters violin recital, a proud parent with a wife who is happy that he is there. But we are not left with a feeling of comfort, or even that Nick is a better man. He is a man who has gotten what he wanted at the expense of others, and the film leaves us with the impression that Nick is guilty as Clyde is, even if he does have the law on his side. During Clydes death, we see fire surrounding him, like an idea of hell. Nick could have prevented Shelton's death, but did not. He might have even caused the deaths of others at the prison. Will the flames that Nick escaped, eventually consume him as well.<br/><br/>Finally who is SHelton? Is he really any different than some Arab terrorist, who has an agenda against those in authority, and like some of these terrorists, justify their actions because they have felt they have been wronged. SHelton does not bring up Islam, but he does bring up the bible with his ""It will be biblical"" While some of the film may be far-fetched, it is none the less an interesting film, which asks questions, but does not give answers."
"sddavis63","2","9","15","29 April 2012"," Ridiculously Over The Top
","Obviously, this movie is a sort of ""Death Wish""-inspired movie, with the main character (Clyde, played by Gerard Butler) out to get revenge after the gruesome murders of his wife and daughter. The difference is that Clyde doesn't turn vigilante. Instead, 10 years later, he sets out to take revenge on the justice system (mainly represented by the prosecutor Nick, played by Jamie Foxx) that agreed to a deal with one of the guys who invaded his home in exchange for testimony against the second.<br/><br/>The idea has been done. It may be inspired by ""Death Wish"" but it's been done elsewhere as well. Done to death might be a way of putting it! Basically two things bothered me. The lesser of the two was that the movie essentially opens with the murders, so I had no chance to develop any real connection at all with the wife and daughter who were killed. A little more development of the family's life would have drawn me more fully into Clyde's anguish. Of course, I can understand the raw emotions that would be involved, but there's no real connection. That's a weakness. Mostly, though, I just found this to be ridiculously over the top.<br/><br/>I have no objections to movies that are ""over the top."" Generally speaking, though, even an over the top movie has to have some semblance of believability; something that causes me to say ""yeah. I could see that happening, no matter how silly it seems."" This one had none of that. The character of Clyde - as he's eventually developed in the movie (both in his background and in how he's pulling off the revenge he seeks) - was, I'll say it again, ridiculously over the top. I couldn't even begin to buy into it - not even for a second. And, given the aura of total unbelievability involved, I found it dragged on and on. You know Clyde will eventually be caught - just get to it, was my attitude through most of this. Get it over with. After the first few shocking bits of revenge, it lost its power and I just wanted to get to the climax - which, to be honest, I found a bit anti-climactic. (2/10)"

We get a glimpse of a lot of movies now and then.<br/><br/>The main problem or the act of the classic is with the characterization of the lead role.

To my guess, the main idea of the movie is how a decently talented person with good intelligence faces a situation demanding for revenge. How big a schemer he becomes. And if such a person lacks any fine view of the system or his ideologies.. how terrifying such a person becomes is the main essence of the movie.<br/><br/>Well the director tried to show the lead role a person with out any clarity in what to do, but it is apparent from the movie, that it is just the case with the director himself. The taking and screenplay, and in fact the story all suffer from the same problems. Fortunatley to our rescue, Jamie Foxx comes to our rescue with some fine performance.<br/><br/>To conclude... watch the movie for yourself and choose which category does the movie belong to ... a cult classic or a childish flick :D"

Others die around him, his own family remains untouched, he is even promoted to fill a space created by the death of his direct superior, but all he must say for redemption is ""I don't make deals with murderers any more.""

"Maziun","1","7","11","21 June 2014"," One of the worst movies ever made – endless stupidity and nihilism
","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS<br/><br/>Hollywood often makes very bad movies that insult viewer's intelligence. Take for example ""Transformers"" (the whole series). I guess that sometimes people don't care for quality and just want to have some mind numbing dumb fun. There are movies fun despite being dumb and sometimes so dumb it's fun. The worst kind of movie for me is one that is incredibly dumb , yet thinks it's smart and has something important to say. ""Law abiding citizen"" is that type of movie. It's not surprising considering this movie was created by Kurt Wimmer – responsible for the horrible ""Equilibrium"".<br/><br/>On paper the story doesn't look bad – it's a classic story about man who lost his family , the justice system fails him so he decides to deliver justice on his own. It's been done before with good results – ""Death wish"" , ""Punisher"" and many other movies. ""LAC"" pretends to be intelligent crime drama when in fact it's a retarded macho fantasy for the most primitive viewers.<br/><br/>I can understand when a movie asks for suspension of belief . I can't accept when movie asks to abandon common sense, logic, intelligence , wisdom to make the movie work. Wimmer also doesn't care about police procedure, law and reality. The movie doesn't make sense from the very beginning.<br/><br/>* Our main hero is an ex CIA assassin who lives in dangerous neighborhood. I guess that they don't pay him enough money to live in better place or at least to have better security. * Thank God in real life it's not as simple to enter somebody's house just by knocking to the door * The two thugs are acting and talking to our hero like this was supposed to be some kind of revenge ? They are acting like they know him and something more is going on , yet it was just a robbery ? I thought they were send by someone to kill him and his family for some reason. We didn't even get told why they wanted to kill Gerard and his family. * Ex CIA assassin is surprised that the justice system is flawed * The thugs are obviously guilty of murder since there was a witness who saw them invade his house and there was the presence dead bodies regardless of who did the actual killing. There was NO NEED to make a deal . The thug who raped our hero's wife left blood , sperm , hair and other traces of his sin and the police CAN'T PROVE IT WAS HIM ?! So Jamie Foxx needs to make a deal with one thug to punish the other ?! Pure idiocy. When someone dies in the commission of a felony - it's felony murder, usually the same as first degree murder for all participants (though not necessarily capital murder). So the initial and main plot device just doesn't work. * The word of killer in the court is stronger than our hero's word and the other thug's word. * Gerard waited 10 years for revenge . Talk about patience * Gerard is ex CIA assassin but his plans are simply unbelievable * The killer shoots at the police despite that they haven't seen him * The scene with ""sleeping cop"" is just laughable * What was the point of recording the slaughter ? What was the point of sending DVD to Nick's house ? No real point in ""giving Nick a lesson"" *All the city gets locked because of few killings ? *It's all Nick fault , but he gets a promotion *In prison nobody is smart enough to install camera or guard to keep an eye on him *Gerard built the tunnel leading to a prison and he simply walks out and walks in whenever he wants. *Why does Nick thinks that Gerard's investment in Panama has to do anything with the killings ? *The security of Philadelphia city government doesn't know how Gerard looks. No comment *Gerard installs bomb with delay ? Why ? Nick says they can't move it because it will explode. Yet he gets the bomb to the prison before Gerard ?! HOW ?! *When bomb explodes it doesn't burn the bed on which Gerard is sitting. The flames are surrounding him like an fallen angel Seriously , one of the worst endings EVER.<br/><br/>The antihero Nick gets absolute redemption which is just pathetic even for such bad movie. The whole concept of justice has been prostituted into far fetched macho fantasy. There is no intelligence at work here , only stupidity and some predictability. There is no character you could care about and no good acting either.<br/><br/>""Law Abiding Citizen"" is far removed from anything of merit. The fact it has good rating on IMDb (7.4) scares me. Do really people have such bad taste ? I give it 1/10."

","Law Abiding Citizen does not fail to bring intensity and intelligence. The movie was great: good character development, great action, good suspense and the plot is alluring. Clyde Shelton, Gerard Butler's character, is surprising likable even with all his misdeeds; I found myself rooting for him at the end. I thought he did a fantastic job with this character – Clyde Shelton was chillingly intelligent and charismatic. The movie shed light on the corruption and problems with the legal system and how one man decides to fight back. Although his actions were extreme, he got his message across and his justice served. Jamie Fox's character, Nick Rice was slightly conceited and not very likable; however he does learn his lesson. As a whole the movie was entertaining and good; however <br/><br/>***ENDING SPOILERS*** <br/><br/>the ending was a huge let down; as many might agree it seemed very improbable and inconsistent with the story line and the characters. Everyone knew that the antagonist was going to fall, but the way they did it seemed infeasible. Clyde Shelton, who is supposed to be a ""Brain"" and who had ten years to think and plan this through, is easily outwitted by a lawyer and cop? How is this probable? Through out the movie we see Clyde manipulate everyone to do his bidding in order to shed light on the legal systems' defaults; his plan seems flawless and ingenious. Of course not all plans are flawless and sooner or later they might have caught on. However he had ten years, he would have thought of all the possibilities of someone catching him thus I doubt Nick Rice would have discovered his secret plans that easily and early. So to cut to the climax of the movie they rushed the ending – the last 20 minutes - so they completely disregarded Clyde's background, plus all the years of planning, and made Nick Rice the hero. I could hardly cheer for the protagonist because of the inconsistency.<br/><br/>Because that I give it a 7/10. Awesome movie, poor ending."

Watching Foxx mug his way through this mediocre script it's hard to believe he once won an Oscar for Best Actor but what's really sad is this picture actually has quite an ingenious plot, but one that is very badly handled.

","Law Abiding Citizen is one of those films of which the production team is likely to think that it is cleverer than it actually turns out to be. Nevertheless the thing that fascinates me about LAC and like films, is the vast chasm of difference existing between critical and general consumer reaction. Case in point is that at time of writing, it has a Metacritic average of 39%, a Rotten Tomatoes rating of an even worse 26%, whilst an IMDB rating of 7.4 from over a quarter of a million contributors. This is saying that by and large, the critics hated it , whilst the general punters really liked it. In any one's language that's quite a differential. I'm giving it a fence-sitting 6 for the following reasons.<br/><br/>It's a well-made film from an experienced director with a cast list that exudes quality. The story undoubtedly raises some very valid questions about the strength of integrity surrounding the ongoing workings of not just the U.S. legal system, but those of Western countries in general. It's almost a daily occurrence reported in various media outlets, that alleged perpetrators of serious crimes are given seemingly sweetheart sentencing deals. Law Abiding Citizen takes a what if approach in playing out a scenario, where the wrong type of person, with the right type of skills and resources, has his revenge on the system that he perceives let down his loved ones.<br/><br/>In an almost horrifyingly gripping prologue, Clyde Shelton loses his family in a home invasion. He later feels betrayed by prosecuting attorney Nick Rice's actions in handing the instigating crim a pretty generous deal to secure his accomplice's conviction of murder. This begins a compelling narrative, that does occasionally throw up some genuinely unexpected twists.<br/><br/>To my way of thinking it is pretty entertaining while you watch things play out, but does require viewers to accept a number of genuinely contrived story points, that at best have slight degrees of realism and at worst are pretty much absurd. At a movie level this sees us having to accept the revelations that Clyde Shelton has a (ever-reliable in movies) Special Forces background, a lawyer's knowledge of criminal law, a genius ability to invent and adapt tools and resources he requires and the ability to build and resource hide-outs in the most unlikely of places.<br/><br/>LAC thus becomes a variation of the vigilante movie in reverse. We wonder which of the ostensible ""good guys"" are going to be the next victims and how is it to be achieved.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler both produces and plays Shelton, which was originally offered to Jamie Foxx, who requested instead to swap with Butler and play the increasingly frustrated DA. Both actors are very convincing, especially Butler who demonstrates he is adept at highlighting both his goodness and badness in the one character. The hook with this film is that no matter how horrid his actions are, a percentage of the audience will see Shelton as the aggrieved hero and Rice, the villain of the piece.<br/><br/>For me, as entertaining as it is and to a degree thought-provoking, ultimately Law Abiding Citizen becomes just too unbelievable to take too seriously at all."

"the_rattlesnake25","3","7","12","9 January 2010"," Butler may be a Law Abiding Citizen, but this film certainly isn't...
","'Law Abiding Citizen' is your typical and quite lacklustre American vigilante thriller. Clyde (Gerard Butler) avenges the death of his wife and daughter ten years after they were killed by home invaders. By using every little technological gizmo available in the twenty-first century to exact his retribution among those he believes have wronged him and his family in the most brutal and satisfying fashion. While Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is the hot-shot lawyer who first tried Clyde's family's killers and is now paying the price for making a deal with one of the men to turn on his partner and send him to death row.<br/><br/>Despite plenty of inventive mind-numbing violence on show, this film suffers from two major drawbacks in my opinion which restrict 'Law Abiding Citizen' from simply being an enjoyable action-thriller and instead turns F. Gary Gray's latest film into nothing more than just another throwaway film. The first is the repetitive nature of the film's structure which eventually follows the increasingly boring narrative route of a dubious moral confrontation between Clyde (Butler) and Nick (Jamie Foxx), followed by an elaborate death sequence. Before the two men meet again and have another moral and ethical tussle and start the cycle over, and over, and over, and over again with nothing in-between. Instead of enjoying the film for what it is, a popcorn-flick, you are instead constantly questioning the motives of the characters and what the central point/theme of the film is trying to communicate to the audience.<br/><br/>Secondly, despite having both Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler in prominent roles and a backroom cast containing the likes of Gregory Itzin, Bruce McGill and Sarah Lowell there isn't one dominant character in the film. Both Butler and Foxx put forward barely adequate performances which allow the audience just a brief insight into the minds of the morally ambiguous Clyde and the strict judicial employee Nick. This insufficient characterisation also detracts heavily on the already ridiculous ending, not because we don't expect it, but that we don't understand it. When the lights go up in the cinema, you will be left questioning the whole moral dilemma the film has placed forth and in essence, what was the ACTUAL message of the film itself. Believe me it isn't as clear cut as it seems considering the scenes that have gone before. It must also be noted however that Kurt Wimmer's script does not act favourably toward the actors or actresses either. Most of the scenes which contain potential between Butler and Foxx simply end on a profanity and a simple yes or no answer. Not exactly Oscar winning material.<br/><br/>With a gleaming Hollywood cast of Jamie Foxx, Bruce McGill and the safe-grossing Gerard Butler, 'Law Abiding Citizen' certainly had potential to be something more than just another 'revenge/retribution picture', but unfortunately a poor script, a terrible plot and awkward pacing make this film one to miss this year."

Not only does Shelton target the killer, but also others heavily involved in the broken justice system, particularly DA Nick Rice (Foxx) who gave the freed killer a plea bargain. Clever concept and full of quirky dialogue. But it begins to slide down more and more into unrealistic circumstances; as if it wasn't on the verge of being far-fetched in the first place. The movie leaves you in the center of the characters' motives. Not once does the film attempt to make a stand for anything. The entire movie has a 'decide for yourself' logic, pretty much making the existence of the film lack any purpose. The two leads were great; along with a strong supporting cast, especially Colm Meaney as a somewhat comedic relief.<br/><br/>** (out of four)"

","42/100. Preposterous plot that has so many holes it resembles Swiss cheese. Over acted by the leads with unmemorable supporting performances. The score is too intense and interferes with the story. After thirty minutes you just don't care what happens. This plot has been done so many many times before, can't Hollywood come up with something more original? It is never convincing because it is all so absurd. Dark and dingy, it tries to throw in out of place ""Saw"" type scenes to attract that audience, making it needlessly violent and unpleasant. A silly mess. It doesn't even make much good use of the Philadelphia location shooting. On the plus side, it does have some good cinematography."

","This film has something for everyone. There is a white lead and a black lead. That ticks 2 boxes. There is a gory (in places) thriller for the guys and eye candy for the girls. Another 2 ticks. There is even something for the StarTrek fans...... its a box office winner. But it forgot to tick a very important box. A credible storyline. After a promising start, it deteriorates into complete, unbelievable nonsense. The endgame is bordering on farce. I am sure it is hard to find new twists, which we expect these days. A completely original story is impossible, i do understand. But at least make it credible, tell a straight story well, rather than a convoluted one badly. Jamie Foxx has won awards!! He is a great actor. Gerard Butler is.... well he's Gerard Butler. He's done a couple of good films right? What were they doing in agreeing to do this utter tosh?? Do yourself a favour, stay in, save some money and rent Taken instead. Or go the whole hog and get the original Deathwish...... it was far, far better and a whole lot more believable."

","I'm something of a sucker for vigilante flicks . As a human being so much is outside our sphere of influence . It's a bitter truth that nice guys finish last and the average human being is more sinned against than sinner and watching movies where everyday guys go around maiming , mutilating and executing vermin can be - if not cathartic - then certainly an entertaining way of spending a couple of hours . LAW ABIDING CITIZEN has all the makings of an entertaining revenge thriller . Gerard Butler an up and coming movie star from Scotland plays Clyde Shelton whose family get murdered by scum so takes the law in to his own hands and tortures the scum to death for which he finds himself facing prison . Shelton then vows vengeance against the law makers who put him in prison so there and then we're watching a film that has a slightly more original take where both law breakers and law makers are fair game for a crusading avenger <br/><br/>So far so good and you're able to empathise with Shelton and let out a cheer as he really goes to town on one of the people who murdered his family . Hanging , firing squad and lethal injection is far too quick for some criminals so it's nice too see a murderer being tortured to death by poison , castration and finally dispatched by having their arms and legs cut off with a hacksaw . The story then concerns itself with people in the district attorney's office being bumped off but it couldn't possibly be Clyde Shelton because he's confined to a maximum security prison . After all there's no way he could commit the crimes whilst in confinement <br/><br/>The problem is the law enforcement characters in general and Jamie Foxx's prosecutor in particular all know Shelton must be behind the revenge killings of the prosecutors . Why they would think this is never explained . After all they send bad people to jail every day including mafia godfathers and violent street gang members so why they blame Shelton for this lacks logic . Believing Shelton is responsible they also never jump to the logical conclusion he might be paying someone to carry out the killings on his behalf <br/><br/>Of course as it turns out Shelton is indeed responsible for the murders but the revelation as to how he can do this while confined to a maximum security prison is so ridiculous the whole film falls apart by this ridiculous ending . You don't need a very high IQ to see why this could never happen in real life . I thought some of the more contrived unlikely subplots of the gritty hard hitting prison drama OZ strained credibility but that was a fly on the wall documentary compared to the ending seen here which is a pity because LAW ABIDING CITIZEN had some potential but wasn't developed to its full potential"
"Hawkensian","3","3","4","9 August 2012"," 'Law Abiding Citizen' takes implausibility to the next level, and it isn't funny.
","This film is silly, and not in a good way. Any film you have criticised in the past for farfetchedness or implausibility will be put into perspective by this truly ludicrous film. <br/><br/>Firstly, all characters are wholly flat and featureless; there is no depth or anything of interest in any of them, the film comprises only stock characters. Gerard Butler co-stars as 'Clyde Shelton', a seemingly omnipotent God-like figure who appears to be stronger and more capable than the FBI, the Philadelphia Police Department and various other judicial bodies combined. There's a line of dialogue that acknowledges this absurdity, but that doesn't make it okay. Shelton is on a mission to correct the judicial system, which he deems to have failed him after the murder of his wife and child. His extraordinary tactility and expertise are tenuously explained in a scene that gives a clichéd back story of how he was a human disposal expert, the character predictably saying ""He was the best"".<br/><br/>His superhuman capabilities are all very convenient, but I don't think he's all that bright, because he clearly makes everything much harder for himself. Once the credits roll, it becomes apparent that the plot has one gaping hole, there was no reason for Clyde Shelton to want to be in prison, it would be completely illogical for him to want to be there; you'll know what I'm talking about if you decide to see it. Besides this fatal flaw, there are also the ways in which he exacts revenge, which become increasingly nonsensical and boring as the film progresses. <br/><br/>All of this absurdity is fatally compounded by the fact it takes itself seriously. I expected to enjoy this film in a similar way I enjoyed 'Commando', a film which is implausible too, but works through caricatures, hilariously bad acting and fantastically corny one-liners. In 'Law Abiding Citizen', however, there is barely a grain of humour. Despite this, the film does provide one laugh, a scene in which a particularly irritating character is inexplicably killed by a maliciously modified mobile phone. <br/><br/>This humourless and unbelievably far-fetched narrative prevents you from engaging with 'Law Abiding Citizen' on any level. Placing its tongue in cheek just occasionally may have been its salvation, but unless there is a drastic director's cut someday it will remain a brain dead pile of cheap viscera with a hugely generous IMDb score that speaks volumes for people's taste.<br/><br/>www.hawkensian.com"
"spikey_jap","3","3","4","7 June 2012"," Good Premise, but Stupid Overall
","The best thing to do while watching this film is to watch the film based on how it is presented; basically turn off your brain. If you do actually pay close attention to the storyline, you will see that this film is action packed, but the story that backs it up is ridiculous and idiotic. It felt like the director wanted to create a film that will use our brains, tackling the flaws in the court system, but ended up making a silly film that really lacked intelligence behind everything. To tell you the truth, it really felt like there was no storyline; it was just about a guy killing off people who were involved with a particular incident. There was nothing to back up this story and nothing to present to it. To simply put it, this is a popcorn flick where you have to turn off your brain and just enjoy what was presented.<br/><br/>Another flaw that the film contained was information behind everything. There were many things that were left unanswered and unexplained. As you watch, you would think that these characters would choose answers that would help solve the situation. However, as you watch this film, you realize that these characters, whom are supposed to be smart, will make the dumbest decisions, only making the whole scenario as worst as it already has become. Also, when it comes to the storytelling, you can see where the film is leading to miles away; the film is very predictable. Some moments were unexpected, but when it comes to the storyline and how it will end, you will probably figure that out within 30 minutes or so into the film.<br/><br/>When it came to the acting, everyone performed at an average level. None of the cast did anything that outshines one another or did performances that sucked. There was nothing wrong with the characters, except for the fact that they acted moronically. They had other ways to deal with the situation, but had to do the opposite of what they could have done and it got annoying. The only character whom I thought was the best character was the antagonist, Clyde Shelton, portrayed by Gerald Butler. He plays these games with the lawyers, speaking out one liners that was laughable, had that mystery behind him and is a tactical genius. How he takes out these people and how his plan was not exactly genius material, but it was pretty impressive. Personally, he was the smartest character in this film, but that is not saying much, based on how dumb everything is in this film.<br/><br/>Clyde's tactics to take out his enemies leads to some violent actions. As gruesome as some of it may seem, the action was not incredible, but was reasonable. Hearing that this film had mindless action, I wouldn't go as far as to say that. Each action that Clyde commits is an act of revenge, maybe ridiculous, but wouldn't go as far as to say that it's mindless. Clyde's plan was pretty impressive, committing actions that were awesome. However, my only complaint is the climax based on how everything came to an end. How everything came to an end really represents how mindless everything about this film is. Even as I watched this film, not taking everything seriously, I still wasn't satisfied with the final showdown. <br/><br/>To make it easier, this film is okay if you don't pay attention to the countless flaws. This film is neither great nor bad; just another type of Hollywood popcorn flick that you just can't take seriously. However, if you do take this film seriously, then you will definitely hate this film."
"Pipesofpeace-171-685725","3","3","4","27 September 2011"," Promising idea, awful movie
","What starts out as your basic meat-and-potatoes, DEATH WISH-style revenge flick turns so ugly, so quickly, with a SAW-like torture scene that it has a tough time fully recovering. The film becomes a bit more intriguing as we see several intricately engineered murders(think FINAL DESTINATION meets Rube Goldberg)that protagonist Gerard Butler seems to be carrying out from inside prison walls. Either Butler's character is one of the most brilliant criminal geniuses ever conceived for the silver screen...or the ending is a completely idiotic and ridiculous cheat. The latter would be my assessment. Which is too bad, because a really satisfying ending to this film might have turned this into a guilty pleasure (or perhaps something even better) instead of the cynical, insulting mess that left me so annoyed and angry with the filmmakers."
"callanvass","6","3","4","22 April 2010"," A hit and miss for my liking, with an abrupt ending.
","Law Abiding Citizen was a fairly entertaining watch for me, mainly due to the masterful performances from Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler. I really dug the opening to Law Abiding Citizen, because not only was it powerful but eye-opening as well, seeing Gerard break down over what happened to his family was heartbreaking. What bugged me about Law Abiding Citizen was it's annoying inconsistency with its pacing. It really seemed to drag on at a few points by being too talky, and it left me looking at the clock to see how much time was left. Also I had trouble feeling sympathy for Gerard or Jamie's characters because of them were quite selfish in many ways. Gerard's took it way too far to prove his point to the point where I stopped feeling sympathy for him, I don't believe in killing innocent people. Jamie's character was always in it for himself, not really thinking of what Gerard wanted and became more and more stubborn through the film until the end. The ending itself just seemed to be all thrown together, and as a result I didn't get the payoff I wanted.<br/><br/>Performances. Jamie Foxx is excellent as Nick. He's ruthless with a good heart at the same time, though his increasing stubbornness and his unlikable character at times had me having problems relating to him. Gerard Butler gives one of the most intense performances I've seen in a while. While I didn't agree with his actions and therefore it ruined some of the experience for me, his performance was nothing short of outstanding, and I especially loved his confrontations with Jamie at the prison.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Law Abiding Citizen has it's entertaining moments, but its too inconsistent for my liking. It had a promising start, and the potential was there, I just couldn't relate to the movie as a whole. It's worth a look to pass the time, just keep your expectations low.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Lifexinxrewind","5","3","4","2 April 2010"," Want some well done over-the-top action? Law Abiding Citizen isn't the droid you're looking for.
","Sorry, Law Abiding Citizen, but I'm sadly not able to stay interested in a movie that so blatantly abandons logic at the drop of a hat. The first half of this film was reasonable if cliché, but when most of the plot has taken place 20 minutes in, it was obviously going to be a struggle to fill out the remaining running time without boring the audience. Unfortunately, Law Abiding Citizen manages to be boring AND ridiculous. In between scenes that I found myself drifting off during, the absurdities piled on until I had completely checked out before the final climax. The generic ending didn't even begin to help things. As much as I like Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx and don't mind seeing them on screen, some things really bothered me. For instance, Jamie Foxx plays a lawyer, so why is he being involved in every aspect of the investigation as if he was a detective and a member of the police dept? I like to call this the CSI effect, they want to show all the clues and leads and yet in real life they would not have the DA be anywhere near these aspects of the crime scene, especially handling evidence, and ESPECIALLY seeing as how he is emotionally involved and connected to the victims. I mean, he could have been a suspect if they wanted to spin it that way! And why aren't the police keeping an eye on the prisoner at all times that has somehow continued carrying out hits on people even while in jail? They don't have a spare video camera to keep on him? And they don't bother to do a background check on this man after the men responsible for his family dying are murdered? You know, maybe look up records of what land he owns and such? The absurdities get much worse from there (trust me), but adding to the crazy tone changes of this film is the considerable gore. At least with a movie like SAW I am going in expecting to see disgusting acts and can prepare accordingly, but when I pop in a crime thriller I don't exactly sign up to see things like a man get tortured via circular saw tearing apart his legs or another man get stabbed repeatedly in the throat with a t-bone. It's ridiculous and even as a desensitized film-goer it turned me off. Beneath all this was a decent point about the way our legal system breaks down and lets true criminals off the hook. Law Abiding Citizen would have been better served coming up with a better second and third act instead of relying on excessive violence and over the top plot twists that only serve to hide the messages it wants to promote."
"velijn","4","3","4","20 December 2009"," Fun... at a price
","Fun... at a price<br/><br/>Vengeance is a dish.... But this one was definitively overcooked in the microwave. A movie of this kind may go over the top - and Butler does that in spades - but you still can have fun. Never mind the loopholes in the script the size of a batcave - how on earth could our good guys be in time to set up up Butler's demise while they were in City Hall at the same time as him, and how did they find the time to evacuate the inmates before the whole thing blew up? Well, let's call it the Spielberg Syndrome. The ability to turn a well-made film in the last scenes into a Disney'ed ending.<br/><br/>Butler changes from a symphathetic widower and victim of the System into a monster, virtually turning into a brother of Darby. So be it, and we close our eyes and have fun - sort of - with the movie and how this clever guy keeps stepping ahead of Foxx. The way in which the faux judge gets her ear full is genuinely scary and that's the point, of course.<br/><br/>Scarier still, is how Foxx turns into an even scarier monster - either on purpose by director and screenwriter, or because of sheer stupidity. For most of the movie Foxx remains a deeply unsymphathetic A.D.A. who still thinks his monstrous plea-bargaining that set off the whole chain of events was correct. A career mover.<br/><br/>But take the last big scene. Let's overlook for a moment the sheer impossibility of being in the same location as Butler in City Hall and yet capable of personally setting up his demise in the prison. Anybody remembering a block full of inmates and prison guards? I mean, when the building blows up the WHOLE thing goes ka-boom. Including inmates and guards, thus probably killing more ""innocent"" people than even Butler dreamed of. And then going to a recital in true Spielberg fashion - all's well that ends well. Mmmm... we could even build a new Disney World attraction around this theme.<br/><br/>As an aside, if Butler was such a genius with gizmo's and gadgetry wouldn't he have built a simple detector to be sure that nobody has entered his batcave while he was on his shopping sprees?<br/><br/>So, was it Gray's and Wimmer's idea all along to show that Butler and Foxx were the the same side of the same coin all along? Doubtful; script was too bad for such subtleties. So, was it a bad movie? Probably, but fun to watch, at a price.<br/><br/>Maybe this year's Christmas message is that we should be very, very distrustful of A.D.A.'s. Mmm.... now THAT's a thought we can live with."
"imdbtruth","1","4","6","6 December 2015"," Disgraceful Propaganda!!
","This movie made me so mad! Do you know who the DHS lists as its top ""terror threats""? It's not Islamic Jihadists like it should be, no, it's returning veterans and constitutionalists... Why are local police being armed with military grade weapons? They say it is to combat the potential threat of returning veterans and constitutionalists... This movie falls right in line with that anti-American propaganda... The main character in the movie is some sort of super spy/soldier/brainiac, and after losing his family, he turns his lethal skills against the government that trained him to kill... This progresses to the point of him becoming a full blown terrorist... They show Jamie Foxx's character puts his hand on a Bible and swear an oath to uphold the constitution, then immediately following that scene we see his character (who is the District Attorney) and his cop buddy gleefully giggle at the thought of entering the suspect's property without a warrant, which they do, and had they not, they would not have saved countless lives... This sends the message that constitutional rights should be relative, on a case by case basis... The mayor in the movie puts the city under martial law, yet another abuse of constitutional rights... Jamie Foxx's character also beats the suspect while he is handcuffed... The final disrespect for the law comes in the end when instead of just being satisfied with busting the perpetrator red-handed, Jamie Foxx's character (the DA) decides that he'll take it upon himself to be the judge, jury, and executioner, as he kills the man instead of letting him have his day in court... This is also similar to what happened in Boston... They unjustifiably and illegally put that city under martial law after the bombing of the marathon... Three people died at the hands of those ""terrorists"", and that was all the justification they needed to turn an entire city into one big prison... If we shut down every major city every time 2 or more people get murdered, obviously we'd live in a continuous state of martial law, and that is the precedent that was set after the Boston incident... Another parallel we can draw from this movie and what happened in Boston, is that just like the cops/DA in this movie decided to bypass the court system and just go ahead and execute the suspect, the police/Feds in Boston did the exact same thing... They killed the one brother first, then they had the other brother contained inside that little boat... They fired over a hundred rounds into that little boat in an attempt to execute the suspect in cold blood, it was only by dumb luck that the suspect was able to escape without a fatal injury... This movie just sends all the wrong messages... There are no good guys in this movie... I HATED IT!"

It ruins any possibility to take this movie as serious as you might have thought initially.<br/><br/>The cast is terrible. Jamie Foxx is a really really BAD choice for the lead role of a macho D.A. with high conviction rates. This actor is more for comedic roles like in horrible bosses. Here, his acting is bad and his presence on screen even worst.<br/><br/>The direction and editing is OK but the music is not. It has a character but in my opinion a wrong one. Don't like the mood it creates in combination withe the unsaturated blue-ish cinematography.<br/><br/>Is it fun to watch? Not really.

","Law Abiding Citizen is a violent film that gets progressively worse until the credits start rolling. By half-way through the movie I was quite surprised by the polish and cinematic value I was getting from Law Abiding Citizen, but then it becomes absurd and just plain dumb. The acting is awkward. Two actors are thinking masterpiece while everyone else has cheesy B-horror on their mind. Butler, without much competition, gives his best performance, and Fox gives his usual great performance, while nearly everyone else gives the level of acting one might expect from a Saw flick. I despise the fact that there are numerous unanswered questions in Law Abiding Citizen. With all of the negatives said, I still enjoyed it. It is a fun mash-up of gory horror, action and a tiny bit of drama thrown in. Is this movie for you?

No character is redeeming but the wounded husband and father garners the most sympathy till he starts killing lots of people to make his point (not a spoilers since all of the trailers clearly show this fact). The movie would have been much better if he had put the officials in the corrupt criminal justice system under their own knives instead of just killing them. It had the potential to be a movie similar to Absence of Malice or Runaway Jury. But the story is poor, a perfect example being Foxx's character running around like a cop instead of a prosecuting attorney. You don't see the guys in Law and Order running around the streets catching criminals."
"shanayneigh","8","4","6","22 May 2010"," Unexpectedly good movie - unfortunately awful ending
","Last couple of years, there's been an upswing in vengeful vigilante movies, a genre I'm quite fond of. However, one thing that has marred the movies I've seen in this new wave is the casting of the villains, who have been way too over the top with their drama-class-bad-guy-acting. Some examples are Death Sentence and The Brave One, which are otherwise fine films.<br/><br/>This is not the case with Law Abiding Citizen, which is cast nicely (almost) all the way from the starring role to small supporting roles. One exception though. I can't stand Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>Also, matters are more in shades of gray, unlike the other vigilante movies where things are more dichotomous.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of F. Gary Gray. I feel that his previous films have been too clunky, but he does a fine job here.<br/><br/>I have only one issue with this movie, and that's the ending. I couldn't help but rooting for Gerard Butler's character, and I feel like it was a cowardly choice on the part of the filmmakers to have him killed in the end. Some might say that it's poetic justice that he dies as a direct result of his own device, but I just feel that it's the formulaic Hollywood cliché that the bad guy has to go down in the end.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a movie well worth watching! It's not a movie which will reveal the meaning of life, but it's fun entertainment."

","It would have been an easy 8 star bordering on 9 star film, unfortunately the end of the film was poor. <br/><br/>The director/film execs have decided that Rice (Foxx) has to survive along with some local officials. The whole point of the film was that the system was corrupt, everyone watching up to the end would have rooted for Shelton (Butler). There was no depth to the mayor's character or the heads of varying departments so no-one would have really objected to corrupt officials being ""removed"" from office. <br/><br/>Rice gets to walk away from it all free, he was the man that started the whole path of destruction off. If the mayor was to escape justice, the very least the director could have give us was a final scene with Rice being garroted by one of the special ties.<br/><br/>I would have had city hall blow, Rice kill Shelton (as he was advised to do) and then at the very end of the film, Rice's family leaving the house as he is trying to decide which tie to wear. Quick shot of his wife driving off with the kid in the car and then back to Rice tying his tie, struggling with it as he realises its one of Shelton's ties and then falling to the floor, choking to death. Finish it with him still alive but on the floor gasping for air - that way we'd never know. Then this film would get its 8 or 9 stars.<br/><br/>I think there is a big market for film makers to prevent the sugar coated endings, give the anti-hero a win, give the audience a film worth watching from start to end, just give us something other than this kind of disappointment."

","If you've ever watched ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"" and thought it would have been a whole lot better if ""Leatherface"" was treated sympathetically, you may enjoy this movie. Seeing the ads for this movie I thought it was some sort of bog standard vigilante movie. What separates it from that genre, I think, is the 'twist' in the 'hero' of the piece. Perhaps you could intellectualise the movie and presume that it takes the genre to its extreme, logical conclusion. Well, okay. All I saw was a movie with a heart of darkness...an insight into the American psyche...a fixation with 'justifiable homicide' in which the vicious murder of your family is a ""blessing"" in that it allows these gun lovin' folks to show us how ""righteous"" their blood lust is.<br/><br/>Years ago, as a child, I saw ""Death wish"" on video. Perhaps by the standards of the day it too was extreme. By comparison, ""Law abiding citizen"" is torture porn, if not explicitly, then by leaving you in no doubt what manner of atrocities are committed on the 'deserving' criminals. Gerard Butler plays Clyde Shelton, a family man whose life is destroyed by a particularly vicious and brutal home invasion. The context seems implausible, and the nature of the crime even more so. It's basically the pretext to 'justify' his subsequent actions. That's why the crime is so nasty.<br/><br/>Released around the same time as this movie is Mel Gibson's comeback, ""Edge of darkness"". I may have seen the original BBC TV series that this was based on, but aren't certain of that. I doubt if Gibson's version closely follows the original. In any case, I only raise this other movie as an example of superior story-telling. The crime there is more motivated, and Gibson's character doesn't descend into some sort of horror movie psycho, like Shelton does. Perhaps this is where the 'intellectualising' comes in...why am I not sickened by the murder of Jews during World War II yet am horrified of revelations that Nazis made soap out of the corpses of Jews and lampshades from their skin? Well, I suppose that one can rationalise and say that in war, death is certain and you can invent justifications. But when you start making furniture and cosmetics out of your victims, that is just beyond justification, right? No, Shelton does not make lampshades out of the skin of his victims, but he says what he will do to them, and we see him about to embark on some of the things he has promised to do. That's what I find so nasty about this movie...it's torture porn wrapped in the flag of righteousness.<br/><br/>Not being from America, I find all the justifications for Shelton's actions flimsy...he often rails against the legal system...he sounds like what I imagine a rabid Fox 'News' 'journalist' would sound like on this subject.<br/><br/>That's my take on this movie...it's a Fox 'News' story...and wet dream, all rolled into one.<br/><br/>If you don't like your revenge fantasies to turn sick, I'd stay away from this movie...go see ""Edge of darkness"" instead...much more intelligent...inclined to see the BBC version again, too."

","I'm voting this down, but I still pretty much enjoyed it. Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, and everyone else in this movie do superbly well with an engaging action thriller. I was engrossed enough in the first 20 minutes to want to see the whole thing through.<br/><br/>This movie is about revenge, society's concepts of justice and punishment, and the follies of unexamined ambition. It develops these themes from the start and with a good pace throughout the film. The two main leads and their supporting characters are pretty thoroughly believable and deserve much praise for their work.<br/><br/>And the second phase of the film is almost entirely unbelievable. As the action escalates, we are treated to plot action that defies even common sense to hammer home the pervading themes. For specific examples, I'm sure the message boards on this site can elaborate very competently. I was thinking ""oh c'mon...really?"" with every scene. It was that horrible.<br/><br/>My hope is that whichever producers hacked this up will not be given such latitude in film again. But sadly, schlock sells.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the wonderful strength of the performances, and certain nice detail touches during the first phase of the movie, I'd be rating this as a complete failure. Instead, it's a movie with lots of potential and heart that went way way off the rails into stupid Hollywood nonsense."

","As justice too often goes, so go movies about justice. The law abiding citizen does not always win. But then, what does it take to win? Do we know when we have won? Some call it ""good enough"" while others who feel cheated define justice their own way. Law Abiding Citizen was just that. One man's definition does not agree with the system's definition and now one man steps up to challenge the system because he can and he is mad.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler, in my opinion, pulls off the best performance of his career. A monstrous Dracula, a misunderstood phantom and one ticked off warrior among Persians could not stand up to the anger this 21st century man used to overpower a system gone wrong. He was able to display that anger in a way I do not believe many others could have equalled.<br/><br/>People who will like this movie will be those who feels justice has too often gone awry and needs adjusting and also those who pull for the underdog.<br/><br/>As good as the story was and as good as performances were for the most part, the movie disappoints in the end. An exciting concept of one man fighting the system so ruthlessly met an early, anti-climax. The ending was rushed either because the end result could not be either conceived or possibly achieved.<br/><br/>The system wins but the citizen scores to satisfaction. 7/10"

","I first saw Gerard Butler in Mrs Brown (1997), but didn't know it. I next saw him in Dear Frankie (2004) and The Phantom of the Opera (2004), both of which made me realize how good a performer he is.<br/><br/>So this is the fourth time I've seen him. I wished I'd passed because this film is beyond belief, literally and figuratively. Butler did this one for the money, that's for sure: there can be no other reason for such a talented actor to waste his time, my time and my money.<br/><br/>Where to start? Perhaps by saying: don't bother. Or – burn notice. Or – tell it to the Marines. Or – get Dexter to do a number on all copies. Or – don't ban nukes, ban this excuse for a movie. Or whatever turns you on...<br/><br/>Because dear viewer, you'll go a long, long way before you see another movie that is worse. Why? Okay, here's what it's about: with a nod to Michael Winner's winning story about some guy's Death Wish(1974), Clyde Shelton (Butler) decides to avenge the cruel murder of his family by home invaders when justice is denied by a corrupt system and officials. He devises and sets in motion a ten – yes, TEN – year plan to wreak havoc, Armageddon-like, upon a system that must be destroyed to be made right. Talk about having patience, huh?<br/><br/>But, it gets worse because, to get the ball rolling, Shelton has to get into prison. To do that, he starts murdering the bad guys who murdered his family. And, when being questioned in prison, he murders others while he's there. Because why? Because he's a solitary guy and wants to be left alone... <br/><br/>To tell you more will reveal the whole fatuous reasoning behind Shelton's actions. So, if you really want to bring out the masochist in you, go see it. The better thing to do is to vote with your absence to send this movie to trash video and hope the producers lose a bundle. They deserve to.<br/><br/>Because, in their desire to make a statement about the sorry state of the American criminal justice system, they have simply traded on the base machismo of an eye-for-an-eye theme and presented the whole thing seriously, instead of satirically. In doing so, they have, instead, prostituted the whole concept of justice – simply and simplistically – in an attempt to make abuck – or too many.<br/><br/>Yes, it's that bad. If I could give a zero out of ten, I would. One is far too much. I've never said that before about any movie, but this one deserves it."

","""Law Abiding Citizen"" opened here in the first week of this month. I was eagerly waiting for it because Gerard Butler, who plays Clyde Shelton is one of my fav actors. I like his acting very much. I loved Dracula, 300, Butterfly on a Wheel, P.S. I Love You, RocknRolla & the more recent, very sexist film The Ugly Truth. Gamer didn't release here, so I have to wait for it on cable.<br/><br/>The point is Gerard Butler's portrayal of characters always moves you, whether to a positive or negative for his role is always the viewer's choice. He is one of those actors who manages to pull you into his world (like Johnny Depp, but he's even more amazing).<br/><br/>In Law Abiding Citizen, he plays a father whose family is brutally murdered.. I rooted for his character from the opening scene. I won't go into the plot details too much. I didn't even have any issues with the director's twist of him as super-genius. In this 110 minutes roller coaster of a movie, the last 10 minutes is a slap in the face for us audiences. We had been anticipating so much more in the climax, than the lame excuse for a typical Hollywood ending. Aside from the last 10 minutes, this movie rocks & yeah I also didn't like the way they showed how he managed to kill all those people from his prison cell.<br/><br/>Butler says to Jamie Foxx's character Nick Rice that ""This Will Be Biblical"". It COULD have been BIBLICAL if the writers didn't get cold-feet at the last moment & made a pathetic ending. My recommendation would be to get out of the theater before the last 10 minutes, so you could go home with a satisfied feeling instead of going home dejected & trying to find all the possible cuss words for the director & writers. 7 on 10 for the very trashy ending. You may have seen that I didn't talk about Foxx or any other characters, that's because you don't give a damn about any of the others. It's Clyde all the way & we love it.<br/><br/>7/10"

Because he keeps getting asked to do an American accent. When talking with his own accent, in Rocknrolla, he's terrific. As far as I'm concerned, Jamie Fox alternates between great performances (Ray, Collateral, The Soloist) and absolute dreck. This movie falls squarely in the latter category, placing it at the same level as Stealth.<br/><br/>I found it hard to swallow that Jamie Foxx would sanction arranging a deal for a murderer who killed someone's wife a child, but then show such a supreme lack of understanding when Gerard even vaguely threatens his family. And Jamie's character turns around and threatens to do to Gerard what Gerard has already done to his family's killer."

","One of the sickest films ever made. An unbelievable bloodbath, torture and mayhem are supposedly equated with ""justice"". But then this is a country that kills people with lethal injections and, quite frequently, innocent people represented by incompetent lawyers. So maybe no sicker than reality, USA style. Also, the ridiculous conceit, common in many violent US films that the ""hero"" is somehow unstoppable, invincible and possessed therefore of apparently supernatural powers. Is this supposed to be an indictment of a legal system? The alternative is maybe justice as understood by Al-Quaeda - decapitation, ripping bodies apart to ""demonstrate"" some supposed point about their own superior humanity."

","Law Abiding Citizen is about as close as a movie can come to being good while still having a ridiculously poor script. The acting from Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx is fine, though not exceptional. Butler basically does a good job with a very inconsistent character. The production values are good, and the movie has a few nice gory scenes, although most of the outdoor scenes were so green-tinted that I suspect the entire movie may have taken place in the Matrix and I must therefore entirely forgive the plot holes.<br/><br/>The problem is, from start to finish, the movie is filled with silly plot inconsistencies, unresolved details, and twists that throw prior scenes into question. The characters also make decisions that seem incongruous with their professions, knowledge, and with reality. <br/><br/>If you can enjoy a movie with a lot of bad writing, there's still a lot of movies I would recommend first, but Law Abiding Citizen is watchable at the very worst."

Fox went against his own principles and the lofty law to ""win"" (don't want to spoil it) and thus affirmed everything that Butler's character believed! Ridiculous and irresponsible. They tore down the entire psychology of the movie up to that point and all for what? I loathe director's who think they are being oh so clever with novel 'twist' endings.

","Let's get one thing straight: despite being released in a late January slot surrounded by Oscar-hyped films, Citizen is no award winner. Thank goodness. As much as the Oscar season can contain some of the best movies of the year, they are invariably all dramas and tend to be emotionally heavy. Citizen is anything but emotionally heavy, subsequently proving to be the ideal way to just switch off and enjoy the escapism.<br/><br/>It all starts with the ludicrous screenplay by Kurt Wimmer. The Equilibrium and Street Kings writer makes a smart move and ensures the dialogue isn't taken too seriously – ""It's gonna get biblical"" – and the 'awesomeness' factor is amped up to eleven. You may find it difficult to forgive the implausibility of the plot entirely, however the aforementioned qualities of the script, along with a few insanely, almost tongue-in-cheek lashings of violence, should help gloss over the nonsensical parts. Sure, it's a massive stretch to believe just about anything Butler and Foxx do on screen, but damn they look cool doing it.<br/><br/>F. Gary Gray adds to his muddled output of thrillers; this film coming after the decent The Negotiator, the second-rate A Man Apart, the underrated The Italian Job remake and the disappointing sequel Be Cool. For all his unwise film-making decisions throughout Citizen though, Gray contributes something very important: flair. He shoots passionately and confidently, allowing the two megastar leads to shine as expected. Gray can also lay claim to an awe-inspiring, fiery slo-mo shot near the end, a particularly bravura moment for the director.<br/><br/>Butler and Foxx add plenty of style to a flick that keeps the term 'popcorn-movie' in business.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

"eeeaarrgh","6","4","7","26 October 2009"," Another Hollywood Ending
","This was a very, very dark movie with a lot of potential to explore the complex interplay between an individual's desire for revenge and his social contract with the state to forego that desire in favor of state- administered justice. Gerard Butler was wonderful as the ""villain"" and Jamie Fox did a passable, but unfortunately one-dimensional job as a pompous prosecutor more concerned with self-aggrandizement and his win percentage than doing justice. <br/><br/>Maybe the movie hit a little too close to home since I did a turn for a few years as a prosecutor and wrestled a lot with balancing the capacity of an over-burdened judicial system against the needs of crime victims to get justice (and I don't just mean the simple revenge of a conviction). The reality of that system soured me and made me appreciate how important it is to treat people like people, and relate personally to the bad things that happen to them, but life's ugly side rolls off of Fox's character like water off a duck's back, and even as self-centered as he was supposed to be, that just didn't ring true. The movie's premise is horrifically dark - a man destroyed by brutal crime, and then caught up again in the unethical machinations of the judicial system. The way he turns the system on its head in ruthless fashion is an absolute pleasure to watch, and a real cathartic experience for anyone who feels trampled by the ridiculous fiasco our criminal justice system has become. <br/><br/>Predictably, Butler's character goes very far over to the dark side in his quest, but rather than defaulting to the ""violence begets violence"" or ""hate only breeds hate"" theme, and ending with a man destroying himself with his vitriol, this movie took an interesting turn, and played with the idea of spinning that tired theme a bit to make it more didactic, more of a lesson about how the system really *is* messed up and how it can be changed from within if we relearn that justice is a human endeavor, with people affected by every decision. But instead, the movie takes the cheap way out, killing the villain in ridiculously improbable fashion, and lets the self-promoting hack of a DA emerge essentially unchanged by the experience. Boo."

","When I was going in to this movie I was thinking that ""this movie is going to make me think,"" and lo and behold that's about the only thing I was able to think throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>In all honesty though, Law Abiding Citizen is a movie that in trailers presented itself very well, but ends the movie by jabbing a pencil into its open eye socket. We open with a scene that depicts the brutal crime against Clyde (Gerard Butler) and his family before jumping to the trial. Attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) cuts a deal with one of the offenders against Clyde that lets him off the hook. Jump years into the future and Clyde has turned full circle and decides to take a full out revenge against the killers and the justice system.<br/><br/>I'm sure most people are thinking, ""well bonkers (yes bonkers, I said it) this sounds like a culturally significant movie that challenges the morals of today's justice system with such a plot line as that,"" and that is precisely what the movie trailers wanted you to think. Law Abiding Citizen is one of those movies that has a first act interesting (and by interesting I mean intelligent) enough and raw enough to make you lean forward in your seat close enough so they can smack all the intelligence out of your brain with the rest of the movie. In short, Law Abiding Citizen is misleading, and at the very best, killed by limitations.<br/><br/>The main reason for this is because it spends the first part of the movie making you feel sorry for Clyde. Its something we've seen happen before. It is the story of the man whose daughter gets raped (in this situation family killed) and he sees the rapists go free. He then jumps into action by doing what the law couldn't do, and that is serve justice on their asses. This movie takes it a step further, reminiscent of Death Note (simply in the taking the bad guy and making him easy to identify with at first before making him absolutely bat **** insane). It then proceeds to realize that it might be getting a little too intellectual for the normal blockbuster crowd and proceeds to add explosions and to completely drop all the points it was trying to make but inserting the picture of the story writers genitalia in your face.<br/><br/>No, in all reality, what Law Abiding Citizen feels like to me is a movie that got cut short, either in money, time, or manpower. It feels like the writer got choke chained by the producers and didn't have the time to write the challenging cultural piece he was going for. Either that or someone told him Gerard Butler was going to be in it, and somewhere a black guy was falling down an oddly placed hole.<br/><br/>While I can't say this movie is lacking at all in the acting department, I can't stress enough how misguided the previews and indeed the movie itself are. Bottom line, you aren't getting a well thought out movie here. I would honestly like to say don't waste your time, but like a few recent Dean Koontz books, there are just a couple parts of this movie that everyone could see. What is lucky about this movie is that it isn't the only challenging moral movie ever made. If you feel this movie is lacking just give it another five or ten years and someone may come along with a good enough schedule or budget or idea to actually get the point that got lost in the explosions in Law Abiding Citizen in some other high brow titled movie.<br/><br/>Final Rating 7/10."

"Quinoa1984","5","3","5","26 April 2010"," what starts as an intriguing *serious* injustice-revenge story turns stupid... and still serious
","F. Gary Gray needs to find his groove again. The director who debuted with Friday went ahead and became a director of dramatic films, like The Negotiator and A Man Apart, films that have their moments if they are, obsessively-repeated TV airings notwithstanding, forgettable. But with a film like Law Abiding Citizen, he should have taken a better look at Kurt Wimmer's script and seen what he had to work with. It's really two movies, sort of shoe-horned in to one another. The first one, at least in the first half hour, would appear to be an injustice-revenge flick where a guy watches in horror as two thugs break into his house and rape/kill his wife and child. But at the trial one of the thugs rats on the other, one of the thugs gets death row and the other pretty much walks. Then, years later, when the one thug is about to be killed by the lethal injection, he strikes his first blow of revenge... and then another... and then...<br/><br/>Then it becomes the second movie, which is basically a comic-book flick (think the Joker in the Dark Knight) set in a realistic urban-crime center. The problem mostly is in this second half, and in how the actors are made to play it. Gray doesn't know really how to make this into something as silly as it really is - how Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton is the biggest criminal mastermind in the history of, well, this year's masterminds - so he plays it completely straight. As actors, good ones, like Jamie Foxx and Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill go through the motions of the script, it becomes oddly, not as interesting as its premise would make us believe.<br/><br/>Part of this, I wager, is on Butler's end. Some may disagree, but his performance did nothing for me. The character requires someone with a lot more dramatic hump and subtlety, maybe even ambiguity, and Butler, after the opening set-up scenes, goes into a Hannibal Lecter imitation that is just unconvincing (some have suggested it's because he has to put on an American accent, but is that the reason for sure or is it just the material?) And, again, the script and direction clash with a heavy-handed, jarring mix. Some scenes are seriously compelling. Others just had me laughing at how Shelton was able to basically blow up ANYTHING within a hundred mile radius, including cell phones.<br/><br/>Gray could have worked this into something much more entertaining if it left its BS moral complexity at the door. It can't be both styles - dark/deep and crazy - and it should have been either/or; it had the potential to be something that goes for broke, but the absurdity that mounts isn't the right kind with the tone of the film, not to mention the predictability that comes out of the script as it is (for example, any time a character says they wonder if they really did make the right call with the Shelton-family killer, the next scene, dead). It's a split in the film that is never reconciled, and while I could always see a better movie being made out of some scenes, it didn't come together on the whole."

","Man, I love incredibly smart, prepared and omnipotent characters, such as Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs) and Catherine Tramell (Basic Instinct) to name a couple. Also, I like both Gerard Butler, despite his string of too many bad to mediocre films and Jamie Foxx (ditto.) So, why was Law Abiding Citizen justokay? Let's skip to the end and state, it's the ending that did it in. But, we'll get to that later.<br/><br/>Basically, this cat'n'mouse movie is like an ""adult"" Saw flick. At least, it starts off that way. And speaking on how it starts off, what's with all these recent movies concerning vengeful fathers out for justice when their daughters get kidnapped or killed? (SEE: Taken, Edge of Darkness and now this, Law Abiding Citizen.) Again, I'm getting ahead of myselfSo here's the basic synopsis: Engineer Clyde (Butler) is having a nice evening at his home with wife and daughter. In (and out of the blue) arrive two men who stab, rape and kill both mother & daughter. Despite the bad guy's efforts, they're arrested and after one makes a deal, the other gets the death penalty.<br/><br/>Fast forward 10 years, and as the deal maker, State Attorney Nick (Foxx) watches, the accused dies an unusual and cruel death. Immediately, the previously freed man on his plea bargain is suspected and before he could be apprehended by the police, he's caught and (literally) cut up by said-vengeful father, Clyde.<br/><br/>But, Clyde's a clever one though. It's established fairly quickly that Clyde's in control. He's out to out-smart Nick, the police, city and most importantly, the system. One by one, Clyde makes Nick strike deals while Clyde controls things on the outside and people die. Make that, they die outside and inside of prison, all so that Clyde can make a point. Will he outsmart everyone, namely Nick? Let me state, I liked the movie, namely because, again, I like omnipotent characters, even when they're considered unrealistic. On the flipside, I think it's more fun when you don't know too much (i.e. Michael Myers in the original Halloween or Tramell in Instinct.) And that leads me to the closing. I can't spoil the finale, but I will say I didn't care for it and I doubt anyone else, who made it that far, will, either.<br/><br/>On the technical side: though not 100% original, the plot's really not that bad, the acting's okay and the dialogue's average. Let's make that, thanks to the closing and revelations, the entire movie becomes average. Still, I will recommend if you believe in vigilante justice/revenge."

Then the Jamie Fox character shakes his hand in front of the entire press corps only to have photographers capture and print the picture...wow, stupid or what? He would have been crucified for doing that by the media in any city. He wouldn't have his job a week later let alone ten years later. There's much more to say but this is just indicative of film making by committee.<br/><br/>I bet the original script was great. This film is a mess. Too bad!

","First written review, despite many hundreds of ratings. I figure though, that experiencing the worst movie of all time, is a special occasion, if nothing else. The fact that this movie has received a user score at this time of 7.4, and have had a box office of almost 127 millions dollars in revenue, is the kinda thing that makes me question the future of the media. <br/><br/>Us users apparently have lost the consensus to distinguish between dogshit, and expression of art, or maybe we even prefer seek out the poopers of convience and mindless entertainment, and the pimping producers and directors who just keeps on feeding us like addicts, giving us what we want, instead of what we need. <br/><br/>Why even watch it then, you might ask, and surely I wouldn't have on my own, but in groups you need common ground and compromises, but even in my noble commitment, it pains me that I did not find a single likeable moment or feature of the film. <br/><br/>The pacing is absolutely horrible. We get about 30 seconds of introduction to our main characters life and family, before we see attempted rape and paedophilia and off screen killing, to people we do not know the names off, and haven't had the slightest chance to care about yet. It makes this gruesome scene, that are supposed to justify some of the atrocities later on, seem almost comical, because it completely vandalises the gravity of its themes, in order to create a short and offensive tragic backstory. Only to a couple minutes later on, jump 10 years in time, to say; all what have happened before, is basically irrelevant, besides from excusing Gerard Butler from being a mean badass.<br/><br/>Memorable names, and faces as Jamie Foxx, Richard Kelly and Viola Davis, visit the screen. Only to stain their careers, professional continuity, and sense of quality and self-respect we might have thought they possessed.<br/><br/>The film ending gets caught, in its own internal lack of intelligence. Clyde Shelton's motivations and campaign is never remotely relateable, reasonable or probable, and at least the movie stands by its own insanity at last, by ending it all in fiery flames and explosions, while the supporting characters are running away for cover, to avoid getting swallowed by this nonsense. So should you!"

Cut to ten years later, the man who murdered Shelton's entire family is free to walk the streets. Shelton, however, has spent the last ten years studying the legal system in order to bring revenge on all involved in the case. This film was great. I thought it would just be blood, guts, explosions and more blood and while it was that it didn't just rely on that to reel people in. It told the story of one mans revenge and Butler does it in a way that keeps you on his side. You understand why he does what he does and he's funny with it too.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that I am easily scared, I loved this film.

","Recap: One terrible and fateful night ten years ago, Clyde was stabbed in is home and made to watch the brutal killings of his wife and young daughter by two burglars. In the following trial, the main perpetrator uses the legal systems to cut a deal with Nick, the hot shot district attorney handling the case, to avoid the death penalty. Clyde is devastated, but powerless to do anything about it. Ten years later it is time for the death penalty for the accomplice to be carried out, but the supposedly calm execution turns into a brutal killing. Soon after that the burglar responsible is murdered in the most gruesome way. There seem to be someone out for vengeance, and Nick can think of only one suspect.<br/><br/>Comments: Surprisingly good, even though the two leading actors in Gerard Butler and especially Jamie Foxx do raise some expectations. It is a little out of the ordinary crime thriller with a thick and well written plot, giving it a deep suspense throughout the movie. Even though it is no secret who did what, it still manages to not only keep the suspense, but add another level to it. Just because that we precisely know who, but not how, there are a new element of uncertainty.<br/><br/>Foxx and Butler fits well with their characters and give nice performances. They have got good support from (most notably) Colm Meaney, Leslie Bibb and Bruce McGill as well. But a warning should be made. It is a very honest movie with its special effects and do show more of the gruesome details of the killings than other movies. Hence it is quite bloody and might not be for anybody. You got to have the stomach for it, or at least a handy pillow in case you don't.<br/><br/>8/10"

","For exactly one hour this film was a thrill to watch: A good story, starting with a suckerpunch, good acting, intelligent dialogue, nice surprises, fantastic cinematography. What a ride, I was enjoying it immensely. A ten star rating for the first 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Then, all steam gone from one minute to the next. From then on, it turned into an average thriller with predictable turns of action, the story got washy, the characters lost their brilliance, I was not bored but a bit annoyed.<br/><br/>From the clumsy build-up of the assistant's approaching demise - which I saw ten miles coming, come on! - to the Hollywood ending, it might not have been that bad if the first 2/3 hadn't been so fantastic. Viola Davis as the mayor the only light in the last third (but she shines brightly as usual!:-)).<br/><br/>I guess the writer ran out of an idea how to end this intelligently, with all the impact expected after the great start...<br/><br/>He probably made a mistake of judgement: We, the audience, root for the avenger. What did you expect after showing us what he suffered right at the start?! I was having fun watching him succeed, I wanted him to, looking forward to more twists.

","As a Philadelphian, I watched Law Abiding Citizen with great interest. The film does exert extreme care to accurately portray our town. The story begins with great promise, and one almost thinks that it will avoid the worn out clichÃ©s of the 'out for vengeance' and 'super criminal' genres. In the final analysis, however, it stretches our suspension of belief too far.<br/><br/>Borrowing a page from Shawshank Redemption, LAC takes what was in that great film a moderate suspension of belief regarding tunneling out of a prison to a totally unbelievable one about tunneling into one. In the end, Hollywood could just not resist the outrageous action film stunts, and the good cast of Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, and Colm Meaney are helpless to make us feel as if we are watching anything other than a gory and violent cartoon. If you watch, leave your mind at the door.<br/><br/>Many reviewers here have commented that our 'hero', Clyde, would have been held in a county jail rather than a fortress-like prison, as shown. First off, Philadelphia IS a county (unto itself), and DOES have at least two fortress-like county jails that look exactly like the prison shown: the one I think it shows most often is called House of Correction (aka Pennypack House). Second, these jails have solitary confinement blocks and do house inmates awaiting trial.<br/><br/>If you are from Philly, this movie is a must-see. Otherwise, it is strictly for fans of mindless action films."
"mdepeters","3","2","3","11 July 2010"," Ridiculous plot, but I did finish watching....
","The plot is absurd. First,there is no chance that a deal would have been made with the character that actually killed Bulter's wife and child as opposed to the guy that gets executed. One would assume that when he lawyer told him he was going to fry if he didn't agree to testify against the killer he would have cut a deal to save his own butt. Without an explanation for why that didn't happen the plot has no credibility. Further, Foxx's explanation why he can't prove the case is silly. Second, Butler would have been held in a county jail not a prison. Third, the likelihood that a person could leave and return from any correctional facility on a regular basis without being detected is zero. Fourth, how stupid is Foxx's character that is doesn't figure out that what is going to happen at 6:00 is actually going to happen after 6:00? I could go on forever.<br/><br/>Movies like this anger me. As a person who has worked in the criminal justice system as an attorney for 20 years on both sides, the ridiculous set up for the plot misleads the public and makes it more difficult for an already burdened system to function.<br/><br/>Despite these problems the movie kept me watching and had a couple of good scares and some laughs. However the overwhelming unbelievability of the plot ruins the movie."

What was done in the end should have been grounds for the ""conviction happy"" acting DA to be disbarred and thrown in jail for doing what the Law Abiding Citizen did throughout the movie. This is a man that has the know how and is an engineer by trade and a local city cop with no protective gear goes and figures out how to disconnect his bomb and move it to another location..Unbelievable! This was an act of terrorism on a city and Homeland Defense should have taken over the case from the local police. Since when does local cops trump the federal government.

Well, an A movie in regards to production design, but not in regards to script. Starting out quite effectively this movie all too quickly spirals down into boredom and involuntary comedy. In the end, we spent more time discussing whether Jamie Foxxs fat policeman sidekick was the lovechild of Nick Nolte and Gene Hackmann than how unrealistic it would be for a DA to do a hands on investigation in the catacombs of a Philly prison.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie is great if you are really drunk on vodka and happens to think it is a comedy, since there are so many obvious involuntary funny moments in it.

Also ,Jamie Fox did not strike me as a prosecutor or as a D.A at all ,he looked ,talked and acted more like a cop,part of it is his fault -under par acting- and the other is the script's putting him where he has no business being-investigating at night,blowing suspect up in his cell-. Last but not least ,the ending is just terrible:transporting a bomb-which can be remotely detonated at any minute- from the city hall to the prison cell,putting it under the bed and waiting in the dark for the bad guy to show up so the D.A can set him up to blow himself up !come on!cant get any cheesier than that! Too bad cause the story had potentials!"
"shen-614-335082","8","2","3","22 December 2009"," Very good movie but a ending letdown
","The movie is about a man whos family is brutally murdered by couple of burglars but he himself survived. Now the law system screws him over. First of all they make the criminal who actually did the killing to confess against he's partner who was there but who did't actually kill or injure anyone. Now the so to say innocent guy gets the penalty of death but the real cold blooded killer gets only 5 years.<br/><br/>After 10 years the husband to a murdered wife and father to a murdered daughter wants the revenge and not only against the criminal who killed them but against the system too. He develops a clever plot how to kill the guy who murdered he's family, how to get thrown into jail and how to teach system a lesson by killing off the people involved in that case. The irony moments are as he uses all the laws and rights to bargain himself a better food, better bed and basically make mockery out of justice system. Then he does start killing of the law twisting people including judge, the family murderers lawyer etc. Since he is in he's cell nobody can understand how he does it. At one point he gives a DA a chance to save everyone by dropping the charges and letting him go which the DA denies. That in my opinion is one pretty important moment. Basically he says ""hey you let the murderer who killed my wife and daughter walk, I got my revenge, now let me walk too and we call it even"".<br/><br/>Sadly last 15-20 minutes ruin the movie for me. And the reason is obvious - first the system screws innocent victim over excusing itself as ""the law must be strict and respect civil rights even if its unfair"". But at the end all he's civil rights are trampled upon and then its okey to bend the law and of course for the cherry on the cake they just kill him at the end. So the moral of the movie is that victims get screwn over many times - first by the criminals, then by the law and then again by the law.<br/><br/>If they wanted to make a decent ending then in my opinion there's two options: First: DA proves fair and square how he broke the law, snuck out of he's solitary cell and killed many people. He gets a death sentence or lifetime but the idea is that DA does everything by the book and has now learned he's lesson. The moral would then be that no matter the situation the system will be strict and will not back down and bend the rules. At the moment system got more and more corrupt as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>Second: Since the system wanted to get him so badly at the end that they broke he's civil rights all the charges are dropped and he walks away as the free man but everyone have now learned their lesson and the moral is that changes are needed. That would have been best solution for the end."

It has some real great scenes, like when he is being questioned and he just tells off the cops in the most genius way. But overall, if you want a stupid movie that could have been pretty damn good, watch this."
"connerbowman","6","1","1","7 August 2019"," 8 star movie, -3 stars for ending
","Basically the ending of the movie is its undoing. There are 2 ways you could look at this movie: 1) Gerard Butler taking on and exposing a flawed justice system or 2) Jamie Foxx upholding a flawed justice system out of a sense of honor and some sort of ""it may not be perfect but it's better than anarchy/vigilante justice/whatever"" sentiment. The ending destroys both those ideas because not only does Butler fail to make any meaningful impact in the end (as he would doubtless only be remembered as a criminal/terrorist) but Foxx turns his back on the ideas of justice he's held throughout the movie by extrajudicially killing Butler (and probably a few others) and causing thousands of dollars of damage to a state prison.<br/><br/>So 8 star movie, -3 stars for the ending, but add another star because I loved Colm Meaney, on of my all time favorite star trek characters."

","This film counts as among the best movies I have ever seen. It is a solid revenge based thriller, with tense drama and terrific performances by Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx. Indeed these two actors will be remembered for this film when they are no longer in this world.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is about a man Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler) whose wife and daughter are murdered right before his eyes as he remains incapacitated by his attackers. Afterwards he seeks help from the law - particularly his attorney Nick Rice(played by Jamie Foxx). To his great distraught he finds that one of his attackers Clarence Darby(Christian Stolte) has cooperated by giving a full confession of the crime and putting all the blame on his partner Rupert Ames(Josh Stewart) who was innocent. Rupert promptly gets the death penalty by lethal injection and whereas Clarence is given a reduced sentence of manslaughter in the third degree and sentenced to only five years of imprisonment.<br/><br/>Outraged by all of this, Cylde seeks justice against the entire judicial system in his own brand of justice...<br/><br/>Verdict: this movie is a stylish A-grade thriller in the same vein as Fincher's Seven(1995). Acting, directing, photography is top-notch. The excellent screenplay is by Kurt Wimmer who has written great screenplays for movies like One Man's Justice 1995, Sphere 1998, The Thomas Crown Affair 1999 and Equilibrium 2002. F. Gary Gray is a superb director who has directed another good thrillerT he Negotiator (1998). Brian Theodore Tyler who has done all the music of The Fast And The Furious Franchise, handles the background music and effects exceptionally well. I highly recommend this movie for your collection."

This character went exceeded the limit of tolerance I have for non-compassionate personalities such as the one he portrayed in this film, especially being a husband and father to be himself. As far as far as the actor himself goes, I found it very difficult to believe he would choose such a role after seeing him prove himself to be such a fine dramatic actor.

When Gerard Butler as the aggrieved father fails to get justice for the death of his wife and daughter because of legal complications, he chooses a path of intelligent vengeance. The way Gerard goes about his task with impunity is very engaging and compelling, because, all along, we can understand his angst at not getting justice. I started putting myself in Gerard's shoes and started feeling that I would have possibly done the same, if god forbid, I was ever in that situation.

","This is an awful film. I watched this film at the cinema (UK), and so I can't really remember much of it now, but what I do remember is thinking that the opening scenes were really promising as Gerard Butler must witness his family being murdered. From then on in I thought this film was going to be great after such a strong start and with endless possibilities/plot routes to go don I didn't think the film could fail. Boy was I wrong. For some reason it goes down the route of Mr Butler's character offing those who offed his family. However, there are certain scenes in film that come across as sheer lunacy in that they are so unrealistic and far fetched it's hard to imagine anyone come up with the idea. Plus, I seem to remember the film becoming really confusing by the end, either that or it was so damn stupid that it seemed to confuse me. Anyway, my advice would be to steer clear of this one because...it's cr*p."
"Closeone","4","1","1","30 April 2011"," Too easy
","This movie is, really, disappointing. It was promising with such a good cast : Foxx, Butler... Butler's family is killed, okay. Foxx is a bit corrupted by his ego, why not. Butler first seeks revenge on the 2 murderers, logic. And he is looking to be caught, now we're talking! He's making scale models of ancient engineering system : hm, he's smart and meticulous. Wait, why is he getting naked before getting caught by the police? Never mind... So basically, he makes deals with Foxx in exchange of information, confessions, to teach him : first that he's smarter, then that Foxx should keep his word, blablabla, everyone must be held accountable for their actions, it's gonna be biblical, blablabla. It was all too predictable for the murders, and completely out of proportion. <br/><br/>Basically, Butler wants to teach Foxx a lesson by killing other peoples. And to do that, a smart guy like him, is going batshit insane on the entire city to prove his point about the justice being corrupted. First you're sorry for him that his family has been killed, then you're kinda impressed by how he's playing this cat/mouse game, and finally you don't understand anything because of the missing explanations about a whole lot of things and of the lack of logic into the screenplay. Foxx finally learn his lesson, but after breaking some of his principles. So, he didn't really learned anything... And ""the hard part isn't making the decision, it's living with it"" (which is wrong : the hard part is making the right decision, it's called thinking, otherwise it's just a cheap excuse to be incompetent) right after Foxx's mea culpa to his mentor (whose short term fate is so obvious, like telling someone you love him right before he starts his bombed car...) is just unbelievable.<br/><br/>Seriously : it's just too easy. The villain is way ahead everyone, just too evil. The good guys are also the bad guys because in one way they made the villain who he is today (doesn't ring a bell?). The movie is murder after murder after murder, and the conclusion is something like ""you should live with your decisions but I didn't and I still don't but just this one time, after all, one more won't hurt eh?"".<br/><br/>This is nothing more than a popcorn movie, but with this cast, it's so disappointing, like if Heat would have ended up with De Niro staying with his girlfriend and killing her so he won't have anything to lose : it makes no sense."
"Mudgekapitol","7","1","1","3 March 2011"," Amazing movie...until the end
","When I first saw the trailer to this movie I automatically was anxious to watch it, thankfully it was in the instant watch on Netflix. So I sat down and I watched the movie.<br/><br/>The concept is really really great, and original. The characters are really believable, and overall just those parts are already great. Then when you watch it, it gets even better.<br/><br/>In the beginning you feel really bad for Butler (having to watch his wife get killed and raped, and his daughter get taken away and killed, that made me cringe). Then when you find out that Foxx had made a deal with the murderer, you don't feel so bad because if you watched the trailer like I did, you know that Butler's going to get his revenge.<br/><br/>Then from then on I was really impressed with how the movie played out. I was just hoping that Butler was going to get back at that son of a bitch who killed his family, and when his whole plan to take him down is happening, I was really impressed at how elaborate and sly it was. Having him take the murderer down feels rewarding not only to the character but to you because you know Butler got his vengeance. But it doesn't end there..<br/><br/>From then on it's even more fantastic. Knowing that he has carefully read through all the laws in the justice system and shows it to Foxx as he makes him think he just gave a confession, but really he doesn't have diddly-squat on Butler, is so awesome. Then I completely didn't expect him to go crazy on the judge when she's about to let him go, but he proved a good point in what he said. And then from there on he pretty much is just taking down people from inside jail using some sort of accomplice. Lots of suspense and action, and it's really great how it plays out.<br/><br/>Then...there's the last 15 minutes. Before I got to this part in the movie I looked on IMDb to see what this movie scored, and it only had a 7.2. And I thought, 7.2? But this is so great, it deserves more than that! And I didn't know if it was only me who thought that the ending was kind of unfulfilling, but looking through the reviews lots of people agreed with me. It's just...the ending didn't at all compare to how well the movie was before it. You would think the director would have something better up his sleeve after making such a great movie. I mean, I feel like the end just defeated the whole purpose of the film. In the end they make it out that Butler was the bad guy and Foxx was the good guy, but that's not what I thought at all! Foxx was the arrogant lawyer who made deals with murderers, and Butler is a man who lost his family and is just trying to show people how twisted the justice system is. I don't think it was appropriate that Butler was the one to die while Foxx got away clean. That just doesn't seem right to me. I'm not sure how else it would have ended, but it should of been in some way Foxx understanding why Butler did all this and becoming a better man for it, while Butler got out and continued on with his life. And not only that, but I think the whole, them finding his secret tunnels and whatnot..was just not right for the movie. I think it just gave away how he did it way too early..and when they do find it, the whole time I'm just expecting Butler to know that this is all happening and he's got a trick up his sleeve to stop them. And then after all that waiting you realize that he didn't even know! That Foxx outsmarted him! Are you telling me that this genius who was taking down the system didn't even know about this??? That's ridiculous!! Which brings me to my next point..there were lots of plot holes! Like, what I just said, how is it that this genius was outsmarted?? And, why is it that he left is custodial cart right outside the room where the bomb was?? How come he left the bomb right out in plain sight? Couldn't he have hidden it or something? Why didn't Butler have booby traps in his tunnel?? How did they get the bomb from Point A to Point B in record time without detonating it before Butler got back?? Stuff like that that didn't add up.<br/><br/>So overall, it was a great movie, and I'll give it a 7..but the ending was shabby and just not what I expected to wrap up such a great movie. They portrayed Foxx to be the good guy; the hero, and that was just wrong. Butler should have gotten away clean, not Foxx."
"sonyaa_random_musings","5","1","1","24 January 2011"," A tame climax to a potential thriller...
","Recently,I watched Law Abiding Citizen (I liked the film title,nothing could have defined the film better than this!) on television,though the plot was good,the story was progressing very well and the motive for revenge was established;but being a scriptwriter myself,I felt that the film could have been even better and somewhere,somehow,something didn't connect with me.<br/><br/>1)In the film,I clearly remember Clyde (Gerard Butler)making an emphatic point that the end would be Biblical but I found nothing of that sort really happening! All I found was that in the end a righteous man was persecuted and the unrighteous prevailed! For starters, Law Abiding Citizen is about two principal characters Clyde and Nick(Jamie Foxx).Nick becomes the focal point of the film when he knowingly partakes in the miscarriage of justice in the brutal massacre of Clyde's family which is responsible for Clyde's transformation from a family-loving man and a law abiding citizen to a man unleashing his wrath and fury against the system. <br/><br/>2)I felt that in the narrative of the film, if the director chose to metamorphose Clyde's life in the span of ten years then Nick's life should also have been marred by a life-changing incident,like say for instance if he had lost his first-born to a serial child killer where the killers got away with lightly for the crime and despite all this he kept his sanity,the end would have been justified at Clyde's death. <br/><br/>3)Alternately,perhaps if somewhere mid-way during the film by a twist of circumstances if Nick's family would also have met a similar fate as Clyde's;perhaps he loses his daughter by some hound on the run which in turn would leave Nick shattered, then the climax could have very well been an open-ended one and a probable dialogue I imagine is Clyde telling Nick,""So how are you feeling Nick? We're even...!"" Perhaps,this film could have had a sequel too where Nick is waging his battle against the system in Law Abiding Citizen-II. <br/><br/>4)And as a viewer what I found even strange was that while Clyde burns, Nick is shown enjoying a cello performance by his daughter!! I mean... the message is not positive..Nick cannot be exonerated for a crime which festered and manifested itself in the form of Clyde! Do you agree? What do you have to say about it? <br/><br/>Sonyaa, www.sonyaa-random-musings.blogspot.com"
"freemantle_uk","5","1","1","23 January 2011"," A right wing revenge thriller
","Since making the ultra entertaining 300 Gerald Butler has become a star and an in demand actor. But for every film like 300 and Rocknrolla he has to counter balance it with a film like the Ugly Truth and P.S. I Love You. He has now turned to pure exploitation cinema, with 2009 seeing the release of Law Abiding Citizen and Gamer.<br/><br/>Clyde Shelton (Gerald Butler) was a successful inventor living in Philadelphia with his wife (Brooke Stacy Mills) and daughter (Ksenia Hulayev). But one night, two criminals (Christian Stolte and Josh Stewart) invade his home, tie Shelton and his family up and murder his family in front of him in an almost A Clockwork Orange style. When the case goes to trial the ambitious prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) settles for making a weak deal just to keep his conviction stats up. 10-years later a betrayed Shelton goes out on a mission of revenge, torturing the two criminals who took his family and from behind bars wages war against the whole of the legal system.<br/><br/>One thing has to be said straight away, Gerald Butler can not do an American accent! I don't understand why casting directors keep insisting that he plays non-Scottish characters, he hasn't got the vocal range. That said he does play the most interesting character in the film, a man who has lost everything using his skills and intelligence to get revenge and showing faults in the American legal system. But the filmmakers ruined that idea by turning him from being ordinary man pushed the extreme to a black ops assassin who makes Bond film type gadgets.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen starts out interesting enough, starting with a violence crime against a man's family, how the legal system in America is based on whether you can get an easy conviction even when they have a decent case against a criminal and the torture scenes where pretty much something out of a Saw film. The way Shelton picks people off, from criminals to lawyers is similar to a horror film but done in a thriller/action film. Shelton is a man who is pushed the extreme it is hardly surprising he acts the way he does. Action fans will be satisfied with the violence action scenes but there isn't enough of it.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is an obviously capable actor, winning an Oscar for Ray and won the respect of directors like Michael Mann and Joe Wright. He does a decent job and he is the best actor in Law Abiding Citizen. But it was hard to sympathise with a man who put his work first, is blindly ambitious and does not use the justice system to its full extend. He looks for the easy deal and not the best deal and if this film was set in the real world wouldn't the media question some of his prosecutions? Like why do rapist get tried for lesser offences. The film was at first sympathetic to the Butler character but the way the character changed from being a broken man who loved his family and plans his revenge to a man who turns out to be a cold and calculating assassin for the CIA felt so fake. His methods even change from someone who does real physical torture to attacking from a distance: he was a little like a poor man's Joker.<br/><br/>The message of the film can be seen as a right-winger's wet dream. It is a film that says if the justice system fails then you should be allow to take justice in your own hands and be allowed to use violence against criminals. The other argument it makes is that the American legal system is filled with holes that allow criminals to escape justice and that there is a real distrust of the system. That rights are designed for the benefit of the accused and American legal officials should be allow to ignore civil liberties for the 'greater good'. Isn't Common Law based on the idea that you are innocent until proved guilty? Writing wise Law Abiding Citizen is filled with holes, like how Nick changes, his hypocrisy and how he changes his mind on issues in the manner of hours. There is also the idea that Nick is meant to be a really smart lawyer who should have potential for elected office, but he does make some pretty stupid decisions through out the film. The film also does not explain why some events happen like why was Shelton attacked (if he was such a good spy wouldn't he have a lot of security) or how some people do not notice certain things.<br/><br/>Basically the first 30 minutes are good but after that the film does not know which way to go and does have a dodgy sense of morality."
"tieman64","Null","1","1","23 November 2010"," Interesting B movie, shamelessly trashy, at times smart
","""The state calls its own violence 'law', but that of the individual 'crime'."" - Max Stirner <br/><br/>Today's trashy B movies often say more about the world than high-minded fare by celebrated directors. Case in point the low budget flicks of Romero, Assayas and Gerard Butler's latest trashy action flick, ""Gamer"".<br/><br/>""Law Abiding Citizen"" is a bit harder to get a reading on. On one hand it's another silly anarchist fantasy, in which a father (Butler) whose family is murdered blows the world to hell because the Law let the criminals free (ie the terrorist chic of ""Death Wish"", ""Dirty Harry"", ""Fight Club"", ""The Brave One"", ""Dark Knight"", ""V For Vendetta"", ""Taken"" etc), whilst on the other it's a pretty ambiguous (ie the writers are totally confused) look at terrorism, law, justice and the collapse of moral clarity.<br/><br/>So here we have Gerard Butler playing a weapons expert who unintentionally becomes symbolic of both Western militarism and medieval tribalism. When his women (his daughter and wife) are killed and raped, this sexual violation activates Butler's masculine code of honour, prompting him to open up a can of high-tech woop ass on Philadelphia's elite. The reason for his terrorism? He believes the city (as personified by actor Jamie Foxx) is intrinsically selfish, looking out for its own interests and profits. The goal of Butler's terrorism? To teach the state to be more violent and less lenient toward criminals.<br/><br/>So what's weird is that this is the only pop-fascist film I can think of where the terrorist is terrorising people to teach them to be more violent toward terrorists. The Gerard Butler character is not just exploding into righteous, ""purifying violence"", but exploding into violence to teach Jamie Foxx to set aside law, morality, personal gain, profits, wealth etc in favour for swift, violent retaliation. This is a very George Bush, Dick Cheney styled American fantasy: when someone breaks into your home, kills your women, children and downs your World Trade Centres, don't think, just put aside your personal interests and kill them.<br/><br/>To highlight this, the film has Jamie Foxx being sworn in (his hand on the Bible) to the position of District Attorney an hour into the film. He takes an oath to stand up for the law, personal rights etc, but then immediately becomes a divine saviour, magically solving puzzles and guiltlessly transgressing the very laws he swore to uphold, breaking into private property, snooping in records etc all for the greater good.<br/><br/>What's bizarre is the way the Jamie Foxx character learns to sidestep Butler's lesson. Butler wants Foxx to ""put aside his personal desires, don't debate and just kill"", but when the time comes for Foxx to kill Butler, Foxx's character finds a way to win without pulling the trigger himself. He literally infiltrates Butler's terrorist cell, plants Butler's own bomb under his bed and tricks Butler into detonating the bomb on himself.<br/><br/>So you're left with a truly weird ending in which the hero (Jamie Foxx) is still a seemingly nice family guy whose pursuit of self interests leads to terrorism and who is still too morally righteous to embrace cold violence, preferring instead innocuous law breaking, subterfuge and neo-war styled infiltration. In other words he is the modern embodiment of the Law, in permanent possession of an unacknowledged shadow. This is the complete opposite of all the other films in our recent wave of post Gulf War ""revenge movies"" (it's probably not a coincidence that the last wave of revenge movies coincided with Nixon, Watergate and Vietnam).<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Worth one viewing."

","It is not often that I comment upon a film that has done nothing to move or upset so I thought I would break with tradition and offer my opinions.<br/><br/>First off - as a film, LAC is not terrible. The stand out aspect of the film is that it is able to maintain its pace without breaking stride, allowing the audience no time to dwell on the utter ridiculousness that is the plot. Now I may be naive as to the way the American Legal system works but it appears that, for the sake of a tidy narrative, it would be appropriate to have a Lawyer, who also acts as lead interrogator, who also heads the investigation against our 'lead man' who incidentally used to be his client.<br/><br/>It is also a little confusing as to who we are routing for. Clyde Shelton - a wronged man who decides he should kill everyone who got close to reading an article about the murder of his family, or, Nick Rice, who seems to route for Sheldon until the point at which Clyde decides to fool around with Nick's life.<br/><br/>This issue of loyalty to our leads also begs us to ask the question why Clyde didn't decide to take immediate action against Nick, who was, let's face responsible for cutting a deal with the man who raped and killed his family.<br/><br/>Herein lies the problem that the well paced plot forces the writers to completely bumble any sense of integrity in either character.<br/><br/>Viewers may also find some points of the film a little to convenient, making a great show like 24 look positively plausible. A few people have moaned about how a nice guy, turns so very bad, but given the way his life was turned upside down, I didn't really have a problem with a brutal reaction from Clyde. The implausibility however, is dragged to red-alert, when we realise that Clyde only has a couple of people who he should really be punishing - so we are forced to endure a supposedly moral man bump off lawyers for the sake of making the movie last more than thirty minutes.<br/><br/>There is also a big question mark as to how the rapist and murderer, managed to get off with pretty much a telling off, while his accomplice who seemed to be no more than a voyeur gets the death penalty. But, as we quickly learn, this is a film the will consistently, until the final credits role, ignore the unignorable in a bid to keep the story accelerating.<br/><br/>The film has its violent moments, which some may object to, but given the whole ridiculous mess, they may not prove to be offensive as they otherwise could be.<br/><br/>Criticism aside however, I did not feel like asking for the price of my ticket back and it will certainly keep you entertained. If you are prepared to sit back and not reflect too deeply on the utter stupidity of the film, give it a try. If you are the type of person who watches superman and says 'that would never happen' save your breath and go watch something else.<br/><br/>6/10 - Because stupidity isn't always bad."

And this was just the beginning!<br/><br/>From this point, LAC takes you on a roller coaster ride though the story that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat right up until the end of the movie. I thought F. Gary Gray did a wonderful job as a director on this movie. The complexity involved throughout the entire process of making this movie is evident. Yes, ultimately this is just a movie meant to entertain, but there were so many different levels. Some things that stood out to me most were: - Obviously, the butt kicking! - Gerard Butler's character, Clyde, seamlessly goes from being a husband, father and trusting law abiding citizen to a calculating killer himself with a point to prove. Gerard Butler's performance in this movie is phenomenal! He sucks you in immediately so that you understand and feel his pain and heartbreak but in the next breath he completely puts up a wall and shuts you out so that your only option is to watch, guess and wait for his next move (not to mention to be thankful he's not after you.) Even as he emotionally shuts you out and his pain becomes his own, he remains truthful and you quickly realize Clyde literally means every word he speaks. One moment this was especially clear is when he says he is going to bring the palace down on top of Nick's (Jamie Foxx) head who soon finds himself with City Hall about to come crashing down on top of him. - The robotic and often times self serving actions of those in power. So quickly they are willing to make a deal with a criminal or try to pawn them off on someone else so that they don't have to worry about being seen in a negative light. (These people are the true sociopaths in my opinion!) - Jamie Foxx brilliantly brings life to character who forgets the important things in life as he focuses on the success of his career. Being the best at his job is his top priority even if it means the needs of the people he is supposed to serve and his family are forgotten. He can't even remember the names of the murderers he's freed! - The interaction and banter between Gerard and Jamie is very entertaining and often humorous in a humorless situation. The tragic hero vs. the anti hero. Who do you root for? Are you sure?<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to all. It will not only get your adrenaline pumping, but also rips away your preconceived notions of right and wrong and leaves your senses naked with nothing to hide behind (just as Gerard Butler's character strips himself bare after everything he knows, trusts and loves is taken from him). It will force you too look at uncomfortable truths no matter how much you want to look away. I don't believe this movie is meant to make you want to go out and fight the system or even make you think you can repair it's flaws (Hello...it's a movie!), but it should make you realize that you can't expect someone else to deal with an ugly situation just so you can be the good guy. We all make our own decisions on how we're going to deal with the hand we've been given. Can you honestly lay your head down at night and say you did what was morally right even if it isn't what's best or most convenient for you? I would say most of us can't."

","This was a fantastic movie. I am very critical of movies and this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The people who complain about the ending simply didn't understand the premiss of the movie. They said Gerard didn't win, but he absolutely did. Gerad wanted to teach Jamie Foxx the error of his ways and show the hypocrisy of the legal system, so Gerad created a plot in which the only way to stop him was by usurping the law and killing him. (Enforcing consequences equal to his action) His goal wasn't to live. It was to teach Foxx a lesson, in it he said something along the lines of, ""It wasn't about revenge, I had 10 years for revenge, if I wanted you dead I could have killed you and your family on any day. This is about teaching you a lesson, about tearing down this, this broken thing."". His goal was for Foxx to kill him. Gerad's acting was phenomenal throughout the movie, and the story was thrilling and intelligent."
"enderwilliam22","10","2","4","15 June 2013"," An Excellent Thriller with a Thought-Provoking Message and Ending
","First off this movie was outstanding in terms of acting and suspense. Gerard Butler's performance was fantastic, you could really feel how anger and a desire to take justice into his own hands had overwhelmed him. The torture of Darvey scene was chilling and very well done, and the extensiveness of Shelton's plan to ""bring the whole system down"" was impressive. I've seen almost every review here criticize the ending of this movie, and honestly when I first read them I hadn't seen the ending yet, and based on the reviews I thought it would be some depressing ending where Clyde succeeds in his plan and kills Nick's family or something. But, when I saw the ending I honestly didn't think it was nearly as bad as people say. I can see where some people would be angry that Shelton was killed, since he was the man who had lost everything and wanted to overcome a corrupt justice system. But, I felt that the message of this movie and the dynamic character of Nick is meant to provoke thought and inquiry about who was really in the wrong. While the legal system isn't perfect, Nick was able to get some justice, and I honestly feel that Clyde could've stopped once he had killed Darvey and gotten his revenge. But, his desire to share his pain with those who had wronged him is when a person can choose to like or dislike him. For me, I felt that taking innocent lives of the justice department warranted the ending. The last lines of the movie, the last confrontation between Clyde and Nick was excellent, the dialogue between the two was one of the best parts of the movie. So, I really like the ending, but I can see where some wouldn't. Either way, the message of the movie is unique, and the acting, dialogue, and suspense make this movie a must see! I'd definitely recommend it if you're into suspense and can stomach a few gory scenes."
"oneguyrambling","5","2","4","14 November 2010"," Awful, misguided nonsense.
","That's it. I'm done.<br/><br/>Hollywood can't even make mindless action without screwing it up with unnecessary plot devices and twists and misguided moralising.<br/><br/>Why can't I as a simple everyday punter expect a decent B movie with a few good kills and maybe some dumb jokes? Nooooooo, not in this day and age of Lakeview Terrace, The Brave One, Death Sentence and Law Abiding Citizen.<br/><br/>The opening scene apparently justifies the final 90 unnecessary minutes. Gerard Butler plays Clyde, the victim of a home invasion that goes wrong. He and his wife are beaten and stabbed and his young daughter is killed. He alone survives.<br/><br/>(Rethinking the events of the home invasion: two guys wearing masks knock on Clyde's front door and immediately hit him with a bat, (the cats-eye would have saved him), one of the thugs continues beating him, the other takes a few trinkets from the shelf and then says ""Let's go"". Seriously, you plan a home invasion, get the masks and bat, steel yourself and bail out after a few knick-knacks? In short you risk 20 years for a murder rap for a maximum couple grand, where is the logic there?) Just wait folks, if you think that wound me up for no reason it only gets worse.<br/><br/>Clyde is now recovered and meeting with his lawyer Nick, played by Jamie Foxx. Nick is a young hotshot who cares more about his conviction strike rate than justice, and as he has concerns that the two defendants might slip on a technicality and ruin his %, he cuts a deal with one to rat on the other.<br/><br/>Now of course the real bad guy is the one who squeals, and he is smarmy and smug about the way things turn out. Clyde is not happy with this unexpected twist, and I know what you're thinking, but this isn't Death Sentence or Death Wish 2, it blazes its own trail. Unfortunately though, you couldn't find a more ludicrous and infuriating trail than the one they choose here.<br/><br/>My moral? Sometimes doing the same thing over isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as you do it in an entertaining manner.<br/><br/>Cut to 10 years later >>>>>>>> From here on in LAC takes the blackest of black turns, and in doing so loses every shred of credibility.<br/><br/>Nick and his wife are 10 years older - and I tell ya they don't look like they have aged a day! They now have a 10 year old daughter of their own.<br/><br/>The squealing bad guy, now out of jail, is murdered in a brutal manner by a cold and calculated killer. Nick is set on the case and immediately suspects that Clyde must have something to do with it, which makes sense given earlier events.<br/><br/>They take Clyde into custody and a pointless game of cat and mouse begins. In the initial interrogation Clyde out-lawyers the lawyer, in a way that even the dopiest person watching must have seen coming, but not hot-shot Nicky.<br/><br/>Clyde promises to tell all as long as his simple demands are met, and things get more and more wacky and frustrating from here til the credits roll downwards.<br/><br/>Clyde remains in prison however the bodycount rises at a frantic rate, as everyone associated with the case is systematically picked off in a methodical and astonishingly convoluted manner.<br/><br/>Nick and his buddies suspect that Clyde must have someone on the outside, and his methods and background slowly become more clear. In one of movie-making's stupidest techniques, Nick must be in attendance at every discovery so he can grow more frustrated and involved, doesn't anyone have a phone so that they might call the local cops to check on something rather than take a helicopter across the city? The last 30 minutes is an exercise in p*sstaking once the full scope of the situation is revealed, I could see it coming and still wanted no part in it when it arrived.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is grandiose and overblown, a twisted revenge fantasy gone awry with some awkward posturing and moralising thrown in for good measure. I like a little violence in my movies - even pointless violence - but trying to justify it with a plot that has more holes than Ricky Ponting's Advance Hair weave just sh*ts me.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen wants to be seen as Se7en crossed with Saw, but to me at least it is nothing more than unnecessary crossed with sh*t.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5 / 10. A B-movie that loses a grade through an inane plot and an inexcusably bizarre message.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","Law Abiding Citizen is a story of a man whom his family were brutally murdered, then after being let down by the court, decides to give all the people involved a lesson.

After his 3rd victims, he (I may say the script writer) has become uncreative and predictable which make me feel like watching another episode of ""Law and Order"" TV series.<br/><br/>After watching the movie, I keep thinking why they didn't make his family murder as a conspiracy. So after his revenge to all those thugs, he start killing people who give the order one by one, and the DA has to use all of his resources to unfold the conspiracy, discover his method before this 'hannibal' gets him too at last. This way, the story can be kept unpredictable and amusing than targeting government officials as sitting ducks and saying that it's not a vengeance.<br/><br/>And if he's so damn genius, why he can't figure out a simple fact that killing all the gov't official will not bring the system down or even fix it?. They will simply be replaced by another official, and then what? kill em all again and again? <br/><br/>So, this film execution itself is fine but lacks of a good & strong script, which make me give 6/10.

"sariforever","7","2","4","4 December 2009"," Great movie with a weak ending!
","I've just seen Law Abiding Citizen and I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie. It is entertaining, thrilling and even smart at some points. The actors are really good especially Gerard Butler who plays the villain Clyde Shelton. Jamie Foxx is a good opponent playing the lawyer. <br/><br/>It's a movie about the American system of justice and it's flaws. Or let me say it should have been this movie. It all begins with unbelievably cruel scenes of Clydes daughter and wife being tortured, raped and murdered and the injustice happening when Nick Rice the lawyer is handling Clydes case wrong. Rice is making a deal with one of the murderers which leads to the point that this guy is walking free after just a few years while his accomplice is sentenced to death.. Clyde can't help but starting a revenge war after ten years but he doesn't just want revenge. He wants to show that this system is wrong and corrupt.<br/><br/>Up to this point and a lot further the movie is brilliant. It has you on the edge of your seat. Prepare yourself being on the side of the villain the whole time while Nick Rice isn't a likable character at all. We all know he made the wrong choice as a lawyer just caring about his success rate and it's kinda satisfying to see that he or his system has to pay for it. There are some turning points and surprises through the movie which are well planned. The only problem of the movie is that it is inconsistent towards the end. It is a fantastic thriller until the last 15 minutes start. Clyde is one of the smartest characters seen on screen. He's always 2 steps ahead of Nick Rice and is playing his games ingeniously. (SPOILER!) But all of a sudden his last coup goes wrong or let me say is suddenly too easy to see through and simple. He gets caught by Nick Rice and his team and this is where the unsatisfying feeling takes part. <br/><br/>Instead of following the plot that the legal system has it's flaws which can lead to murderers walking free they simply kill Clyde in the end. (Which is another huge plot hole because since when is it legal for a lawyer to kill a murderer with his own weapon and then living a normal life as if nothing happened afterwards?!) Means the corrupt system wins in the end. You kinda get the feeling this is another ending that had to fit into Hollywoods way of thinking. Definitely not what we want to see! There are some other plot holes all around the end but I think I already said enough ;)<br/><br/>All in all the movie is really good! The actors are great and it is thrilling all the way through! The reason why I still give it a 9/10."
"Pumpkin_Man","8","2","4","4 November 2009"," An Awesome Film!!!
","This movie was a lot better than I had expected. To me, it was like a mix of 'Saw' and 'Max Payne. Gerard Butler does an awesome job as a psychotic man with nothing to lose. Ten years after a home invasion that leaves his wife and daughter dead, Clyde Shelton returns to seek true justice. I love when he dismembers the man who murdered them. When Clyde is sent to jail, people are still dying in mysterious ways, and Nick Rice tries to stop it. When Rice interrogates Clyde, he wants something in return such as his iPod, and a steak. Soon, nobody feels safe leaving their homes, because they don't know where or when Clyde will strike next. Does he have an accomplice? I highly recommend LAW ABIDING CITIZEN!!!"
"arnoma2000","7","2","4","3 November 2009"," Kept me at the edge of my seat
","Law Abiding Citizen was a movie that many people would love. I was one those people. However, like many of those people, I was disappointed with its flaws. Every movie has flaws and I have yet to come across one without any. Don't expect perfection, but instead know that it could have been better. I really wish that the movie had a little more time spent on to fill in the plot holes. Nonetheless, I had fairly high expectations and came out satisfied with all but a few scenes of the movie.<br/><br/>WAIT!!! I suggest you know very little of the movie before watching it in order to fully experience the suspense of it. Reading the below may or may not influence how you will perceive the movie. STOP HERE!!!<br/><br/>I loved the movie because unlike many of the movies out there this one has spunk. It is the kind of movie that keeps you thinking and in suspense. This movie reminded me of an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit with Robin Williams. Which, by the way, is one of the best episodes I'd seen so far. I highly recommend watching that episode if you end up liking this movie. I think that the movie should have leaned more to the nature of that episode, but who am I to judge? They both show the law being bent and in favor of the criminal. In addition, what makes the episode and movie so good is that they both possess the quality of which the audience tries to sympathize with the criminal and understand him/her. Thus making it hard to side with the good guys (the law-the protagonists).<br/><br/>Of course it is predictable, but vaguely at best. The movie contains many interesting ways of approaching things and some of them surprised me and some didn't.<br/><br/>The plot is terrific with a few exceptions. The acting was good but the protagonist's character, whom Foxx played well, didn't quite have the sympathy the audience needed. The movie makes the audience side too much for Butler, and I was all for Butler until the end. Overall I think the whole movie could have used a little bit of more work.<br/><br/>Beware of a few easy to predict scenes and the ending, but all in all I think the movie was a hit. I'm still waiting to see a movie that has all the good parts Law Abiding Citizen possesses, but without the flaws."
"archiecm","5","2","4","31 October 2009"," The reviews said it would be better.
","This film had some exciting moments and a good premise. But in the end, It seemed to start off high concept: prisoner holds all the cards. But Butler's character dissolves into a monster not unlike Darby, the guy who killed his wife and kid.<br/><br/>First of all, why did the Assist. DA, Foxx, take Darby's testimony to hang Ames? Darby was the doer and Ames the tag along. That's a game changing mistake right there. If the Foxx character had done it the reverse way Butler's character wouldn't have been so justifiably worked up; the true killer would have gotten the joy juice. You can't tell me Ames was too loyal to turn states evidence. So the whole movie needs a ridiculous set of facts to be set in motion. <br/><br/>But accepting that for arguments sake, the movie presents a promising scenario -- a man who is so good at taking the law into his own hands that he can call the shots. But then the movie turns crazy. Why does Butler shun bail? So he can wage war on the city justice department? OK, but he could have done that easier on the outside. True, doing it from the outside wouldn't have made Foxx's character look so idiotic but it would have made Butler more believable, less reckless and out of control. Instead he starts to kill innocent people from within, like his cell-mate and Foxx's assistants. It is now a lot harder to like this guy. He's mostly on a power trip--one designed to rub everyone's faces in their own sh*t. What high moral principle does that champion? After many more deaths of people who only vaguely helped to execute the wrong guy, Butler hears Foxx's last appeal for reason. The audience is mostly seeing it his way, i.e. enough is enough. But Butler can't get out of his own obsessive sickness. So killing him was more or less logical. Butler had morphed into a pitiful joke compared to his original goals. Did the movie really want us to jump back onto Foxx's side? I wasn't comfortable with that. I felt disappointed. There was no real point to the film then.<br/><br/>I'll take Dexter over this guy any day. Dex never takes out the innocents. And his code only covers true destroyers of life who have no chance of ever rehabbing. And he does it all anonymously--the vigilante lives to fight another day.<br/><br/>Afterword: I've been a bit dishonest here. I was actually rooting for the Butler character to blow up city hall. I guess it was the logic of the film that I'd bought into. Now I see that there are two sides to me--a peaceful citizen and an enraged maniac. I disowned the maniac the minute the movie ended."

","Law Abiding Citizen could have been a movie that you would remember as one of the best thrillers you've seen lately or a movie about a deep matter, the ones you don't see often in Hollywood.Buuut it wasn't.<br/><br/>However, still the fact that until one point (leaving aside some too of Hollywood scenes and the acting of Foxx which was inexplicably bad) you could agree that it was somewhat of a breakthrough idea, deserves some credits.<br/><br/>First of all, I would like to say that i expected to see more of the main events that formed the character of Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler): the slaughter of his family and his revenge on the killer. Maybe i ask too much from a Hollywood movie but if you were exposed to images more shocking that the ones you actually see in the movie, you would be able to understand the feelings that the protagonist experiences and see the brutality that he was forced into to escape from his misery, receiving no help from Justice.<br/><br/>The second and biggest problem were the holes in the scenario which appeared incrementally, leading up to a disappointing (and rather rough) ending. I'm not going to get too much into details concerning the acts of Clyde during his plan but I would like to comment on the fact that although the writers had in mind the whole time that Clyde was fighting not only for his family but very much more against the surprisingly ""justice-free"" judicial system, they sort of abandoned this main idea and turned their focus too much into the characters and how Clyde could influence Nick (Jamie Foxx). I was really intrigued when the writers were making remarks about how the effort to make the judicial system perfect and caring for all had turned it into a seemingly unfair and naive system, but I was finally let down by the ending which didn't try to pass the idea of a dead end in our dysfunctional society to viewers in a more clear way.<br/><br/>Just to mention my idea of an ending, i would like to experience the well expected catharsis which would come through the death of the Mayor and the upcoming upheaval of the society, followed by a judicial system punishing the murderer, serving the rights and the safety of the Many once again."

If all of these people were dying and supposedly he was responsible for all of it and people knew he was responsible for all of it, wouldn't they just put a camera in his isolation cell to watch his every move 24 hours a day.<br/><br/>Plus, what lessons other than vengeance do we actually learn from his actions. He's trying to take down the system and change it, but no moral lesson will come of this.

Gerard Butler plays the loyal husband and father, who takes revenge on those who brutally murdered his wife and daughter, and those who were responsible for letting the killer go under punished. Jamie Fox plays a coward lawyer, more interested in climbing the career ladder. Looking for the quick and easy deal, at the victims expense. All to avoid prosecuting what had to be one of the most vile of crimes. I immediately began to cheer for the father who was supposed to be the villain in this film. I cheered for the father from beginning to end. Gerard does a spectacular job as the wronged genius taking revenge at all costs. Unfortunately Jamie Fox could not pull off his part and I had no sympathy for the character. The movie also has a problem with there plot twist scene in the movie with an implausible explanation to the ""how he did it"" question. Followed by the unimpressive hero, who solves the case because the hero is supposed to. I have no doubt the film would have been better if they had switched parts, with Gerard playing the lawyer and Fox playing the father, he could have given them the bad guy ending they were looking for."

","A thriller about a man whose wife and child are raped and murdered by burglars in front of his eyes. Due to a botched case in the justice system, the primary rapist gets away with a plea deal while the other defendant gets the death penalty. In the real world, plenty of criminals get away with crimes due to terrible justice. Brock Turner is an example of this: Raped an unconcious woman and got off with 3 months in jail because the judge didn't want to ""Ruin his life"" and his dad claimed he shouldn't be punished harshly for ""25 minutes"" of rape. He deserved much more. So I can really see why Shelton is pissed at everyone.<br/><br/>Anyway, Shelton, played by Gerard Butler, spends the rest of the movie getting revenge on everyone.

","This film flew under my radar for a decade; not sure why I'd never heard of it. Jamie Foxx is solid and excellent in the part of the straight man (always the toughest character to put across), and Gerard Butler is an outstanding 10+ as the ""good guy/bad guy"" villain. The plot, up till the very end (when things do spiral a bit out of control) is excellent, and the writing is top-notch throughout: understated and menacing.<br/><br/>Reviewers' criticisms tend to focus on:
First, the wide liberties taken with legal procedure, police procedure and reality. I can't disagree, but I had no trouble enjoying this as an action/psychological film, start to finish. If we held every movie to a strict burden of accuracy, there'd be damed few films left. Sometimes---frequently, in fact---one must put aside the real world and simply take a film on its own terms.
Second, the ending. Again I agree; it's a comedown from the previous hour and a half of tight action---but that wasn't enough to spoil the film for me. The ending flashes by quickly, and we are spared any after-the-fact moralizing or explanations. Didn't really bother me at all.<br/><br/>P.S. - I can't resist commenting on one of the ""Goofs"" posted on IMDb: that the cello fingerings in the recital scene do not match the soundtrack. I'm a professional musician, and that's certainly true. But even worse is that Nick's daughter DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HER ACCOMPANIST! Major faux pas!"

There's plenty of blood, guns and explosions to keep any action fan engaged. The film jumps to the conflict right at the beginning and this is one of the best things about it.<br/><br/>It also happens to be a genius balance between plot and characters, i.e, it's both character and plot driven at the same time which is a rarity in many movies. It's one of the finest and most underrated action thrillers made till date. I'd suggest you to check out the director's cut which is far more violent and has some extra footage.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen gets the viewer emotionally invested for the most part, although the ending is bound to generate mixed opinions."

","18 October 2009. This solid, engaging, and powerfully gripping thriller contained some minor weaknesses at the beginning of the movie as well as a less than potent psychological wow factor that could have propelled this movie into a superior movie. The beginning of this movie flashed by the character development much to rapidly for the audience to bond with Gerald Butler's family and sort of went through the emotions along with a less than clear explanation and development of the series of actions leading to the carriage of mis-justice (how did whom was sentenced wasn't adequately or satisfactorily explained). Along the way there were some convenient script devices that allowed for some leeway in reality-testing, but by the end most (but not all) of the questions are resolved. The climax also failed to offer up the ""24"" television series element of the big bang threat but offered up only a moderate (we really don't care as much as we might) scene. The movie has a great twist, with the same impact as THE INSIDE MAN (2006). There is also an emotional punch with Jamie Foxx's character's female assistant in the movie. Overall, this movie redeems itself by the end of the movie along with some intense gripping emotional roiling scenes that can be directly attributable to a tough and smart script. 7/10."

He is nicely portrayed by Butler and most people will probably root for him even though his actions which starts out relatable and understandable slowly escalates into complete madness.<br/><br/>At the other side is the ambitious attorney Rice who Clyde blames for cutting a unjust deal with murderers a long time ago. There is a underlying theme of the attorneys being self-serving and more interested in their stats than doing the job but they are all portrayed as good people at heart. I liked Foxx performance of the attorey and overall i thought everyone in the cast did an excellent job.<br/><br/>Clyde begins a long sequence of attacks on the justice systems which continues even after he is put behind bars. It all really fun and suspenseful however it starts to become a bit silly towards to end and the ending itself felt rushed and especially silly. I have no idea about the layout of the city the movie is set in but if you can't disarm a bomb it seems more reasonable to dispose of it somewhere it can not hurt anyone as fast as possible instead of getting it to the prison and hiding it under Clyde bed ....<br/><br/>With all said and done it was a fun movie which i would recommend and if they have toned down the later parts a bit and concluded the story better it could have been more than just a fun movie."

","The film starts in a seemingly happy family home environment which soon descents into grim chaos via two uninvited guests to the house. Butlers' character the husband and father survives the ordeal but sadly his wife and daughter were murdered by one of the two intruders. To bring the two intruders to justice Jamie Foxx's character is the District Attorney (DA) for Butler however delivers some very insensitive words of actions and process, which involves effectively a deal with the murderer to serve just 5 years in jail and the other intruder 10 years in prison, then to face the death penalty. So the injustice of this so called justice does not sit well with Butler at all. So he takes notes of all involved in this justice deal and plans his deadly revenge within 10 years. A big part of his revenge is to be sent to prison himself to prove in his own way how the justice system is severely corrupt and operates by making deals with murderers to get to an outcome.
There are a lot of reviews on here which say the movie has a bad ending. As it was improbable for the DA (Jamie Foxxx) and police authorities to turn the tables on Butlers smart, well executed deadly plans. However throughout the whole movie. The story and scenarios were very sensationalise to fit the narrative in a typical Hollywood blockbuster movie. The tactics Butler managed to perform in the early part of the movie were unrealistic but you roll with it, as you understand it is a movie. So in the end it does seem plausible that the DA gets Butlers killed instead of proving Butlers' crimes and bringing him to justice. The reasoning Butler killed way more people associated to the DA. Some very close colleagues and allies. So it does make sense the DA would want Butler dead instead of taking the high road and bringing him to justice in a court of law. Overall good movie. Majority of it will keep you entertained if you look over the plot holes. Recommended on that basis."

I don't think the ending was as bad as people make it out to be, as I perceive it. <br/><br/>Let me explain.<br/><br/>When Clyde dies and Nick survives to watch the recital, Clyde's ambition is complete; Nick has been reverted back to the justice system to which it set out to be (a justice system). I.e he will no longer make deals with criminals (so he says). Nick represents the overall corrupt system, the best of the best, and the brutality Clyde creates snaps Nick into this realization. He lives because nobody can turn the system back to a truly justice system, just him - ok his trainee could've lived, fair enough.<br/><br/>The hero (Clyde) dies, but his legacy lives on through Nick. <br/><br/>I'm not sure how effectively I've portrayed my opinion, hopefully Ive conveyed it as clearly as possible.

","The movie is well made, good acting, moving plot, good pace.

Certainly when clearly the system fails to adequately give justice.<br/><br/>It is not pretty, or good, but hey, they started it.<br/><br/>Much of the story, however, involves the politically correct and sociologically responsible twaddle. The protagonist (Gerard) must of course be held accountable for his actions as judge, jury, and executioner. And the other main lead (Fox), the embodiment of righteousness and law and order, must chase and arrest this vigilante.<br/><br/>After the justifiable revenge on the robbers, the story devolves in a maniacal plot on revenge to the whole system where the justice system, led by D.A. Rice -really, the D.A. is actively involved?- saves the day. And even outwits the genius, but clearly derailed Shelton, in so far as that he blows himself up with his own device meant for the town's dignitaries.<br/><br/>Hurrah, civilization triumphs again.

"Screen_Blitz","5","0","0","31 July 2017"," This man versus law story starts off with a promise, but eventually dives into the preposterous territory
","Our society is very complex when it comes to dealing with the law enforcement, and the flaws in the justice system set a clear example of that. This concept marks the core of this crime-thriller which places Irish actor Gerard Butler in the role of a man seeking vengeance against the court system who failed to meet into his emotional demands. And how does everything go down from there? Well, the film, directed by F. Gary Gray, starts off on a promising note introducing us intellectual themes of corruption and negligence within the justice system, both things that have been reported on the news for the past several decades. But once it comes time to kicking the action into gear, that is when things go south. Slipping into the territory of absurdity, the film proceeds with a plot that feels more heavy- handed than genuine. There are a few elements that Gray gets right, and that is providing us a few good thrills and action set pieces. His major problem is showcasing the shock and fury of Gerard Butler's antagonistic character. This film follows Clyde Shelton (played by Gerard Butler), a husband and father who's night of peaceful family time is disrupted by ruthless gangsters who invade his house and murder his wife and daughter right in front of him. While one of the gangsters is caught and receives the death penalty, the other, Clarence Darby (played by Christian Stolte), is offered a plea bargain by lawyer Nick Rice (played by Jamie Foxx) who will allow him to testify against his accomplice for the crime. Shelton is not too pleased about this and feels no justice has been served. Ten years later, the law enforcement finds Darby gruesomely murdered and Clyde reveals to be the one responsible. Upon sending him behind bars, Nick Rice learns that he is waging war against the him and the district attorneys to deliver them the message about their corruption. <br/><br/>F. Gary Gray's legal thriller is not your average turn-off-your- brain popcorn flick, at least not in concept. There is some smart commentary offered by the corruption behind the justice system, particularly the flaws in judges' failure to serve justice and letting the morally corrupt run free with little to no legal repercussions. We have heard of this many times in the past, particularly when we turn on the news and hear court cases gone awry to the judges' mistakes of recognizing the grim nature of citizens who wrong against society. This intellectually-engaging theme sets the stone for the film's strongest point. Everything else feels a little blemished. In response to the court's decision against his favors, Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton becomes the driving force of the plot as he ensues a brainy plan to seek vengeance against the justice system. He is smart and way of the game, but his evil doings more often than feel a bit too ham-fisted than believable -- this is best demonstrated in the scene in which tortures his victim in the style of a 'Saw' movie. While it is easy to understand his sadness and frustration, our sympathy for him quickly dissolves when the story dives into his absurdly sadistic nature. It might have been more easy if the film is portrayed him in a more humanly manner than a exploitative psychopath with a thirst for blood. Although this dubious methodology opens doors for some pulse- pounding thrills and bloody action set pieces to feed on, the plot feels a bit too absurd to take seriously and builds up to an ending that simply doesn't land. Gerard Butler is not bad in the role, his only problem is the writing of his character which. Jamie Foxx on the other hand does fine in his role, reeling in charisma and humanity, while trudging through the preposterous nature of the script. <br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is a flawed man versus law thriller that may sparkle with an absorbing message on the flaws in the justice system, but falls short to a superfluous approach of its story. This movie is nothing truly memorable. But the say I can say about it is that it is not a lumbering disaster. After all, there is a good side to be admired about F. Gary Gray's direction, that is if you can get past the stilted fashion of the plot."

","​Plot Overview: After the justice system leaves the man who murdered his wife and daughter alive, Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler) enacts on a killing spree of revenge and tries to teach the Justice System a lesson.<br/><br/>Directed by F Gary Gray<br/><br/>Starring Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx<br/><br/># NO SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Overall: This may be the definitive example of good movie held back from greatness because of the ending. It is a good ride and I imagine you will enjoy it but the end does ruin the film to an extent.<br/><br/>The type of people who like this movie will be people who enjoy a reasonably smart plot and people who enjoy revenge thrillers.<br/><br/>Would Recommend.<br/><br/># POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Gerard Butler was amazing as Clyde Shelton and shows that he can be great with a good script and great direction. His character was so sadistic and cruel yet simultaneously interesting and to an extent to feel sorry for him. I think the dynamic of this is brilliant and the movie exploits that well. Jamie Foxx was good as Nick Rice but still, at the end of the day, played a typical jerk lawyer but that doesn't take away from his overall role in the film. What I appreciate is how no one here was necessarily depicted as a GOOD guy. The movie tries to make you root for the victims but still acknowledges that they're still bad people. <br/><br/>I love the story and wholeheartedly believe that the first 2/3 of it are genius and so intricately designed. The 'Grand Reveal' at the end was pretty weak and did little to amaze me. Leading on from this, I believe that the writers began to run out of ideas towards the end. It starts with him infiltrating Death Row to assassinate an inmate in the most painful way possible. Then by the end of the film he's shooting people with a drone. This loss of creativity harms the film and makes the final act weak. I've said it multiple times already but I'll go more in depth into the ending here so take warning to spoilers... Right, so the ending is that Clyde attempts to blow up a bomb beneath the mayor of the city and detonate it from prison. Nick uncovers this and manages to, by some magic, transport the bomb from the town hall(I think) and under Clyde's bed in Solitary confinement before Clyde gets back there himself, making Clyde detonate the bomb, thus committing suicide. This ending is weak for numerous reasons. The first being the fact that it is totally implausible for the entire thing to happen but that is just a logical flaw. The narrative flaw for me is that this is a movie about the little guy get trampled on by the government and then rising above them. Who do you wanna see win in that situation. I imagine the little guy so the movie choosing this ending felt like a cop out and a waste. I would have liked to see Clyde win and, if that happened, would have made me give the movie a 9 or even a 10. Sadly, this ending never happened and we have to make do with what we have.<br/><br/>The movie was competently shot and edited.<br/><br/>The effects looked terrible. <br/><br/>This movie was a cleverly designed thriller that was mostly enjoyable and didn't shy away from death which I admire.<br/><br/>The first two acts were amazing and were brilliantly designed. I have mentioned by hatred of Act III numerous times so I won't go back to it. Another miscellaneous annoyance I had with the film was that a convicted, genius killer who has slaughtered at least 10-20 people, managed to smuggle a bomb past security and plant it directly beneath the mayor. I know I needed to hold my disbelief but this was a little too far.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed the majority of this film and think it was a competently made revenge thriller that lost its way towards the third act.<br/><br/>8/10"
"johnwiltshireauthor","5","0","0","28 October 2016"," I'm averaging my rating
","Ten for 98% of this movie. Zero for the ending. So that's a 5-star in my book. So corrupt justice system wins in the end? This film has the most sickly-sweet, Hollywood ending I think I've ever seen. They could have had the little girl hugging a puppy while she gave her concert performance, I guess. Maybe they could have made her blind or something to tug a bit more at the heartstrings they assume we have. Basically, this movie is the perfect vengeance film (if you ignore the ending). Guy's wife and little girl brutally raped and murdered and the killer gets off on a plea bargain. Ten years later and everyone starts to regret that decision. I guess Hollywood just chickened out at the end. They just couldn't have the little man win out--natural justice prevail. But this still is a very enjoyable movie and I recommend it. Just turn off five minutes early and make up your own ending. Much better."

","First of all- The film is amazing. I recommend EVERYONE to watch it. BUT, it could have been much more amazing. First of all, the first half of the film, is a 10/10. The problem is that suddenly, it turned to an other film, a similar film- but not what it was in the beginning. In the beginning we say a revenge story + teaching the good guys how to actually be good. Then... It became a super spy film? The whole ""nice loving father"" image shattered in light of new information which broke the plot.<br/><br/>And in the end, how did they find the bomb? HE FORGOT THE CLEANING EQUIPMENT OUTSIDE THE ROOM OF THE BOMB. It's a retarded answer. The film makers made him too smart so they had to make a plot hole. It doesn't make sense he'll do it because he didn't leave almost ANY trace most of the times.<br/><br/>Those are the only bad things in the movie. Two major flaws. But aside of them- The film was GREAT."

","The notion of justice being based on ""Left or RIGHT"", and not ""RIGHT and wrong"", is not a flaw based on Justice, it's a flaw based on Humans. This is why, I love this movie. ""People need to be accountable for their actions"".<br/><br/>The justice system changed Nick, when he was supposed to change and better the system, and throughout the entire movie, he failed to see this, until he threatened Clyde by saying; ""If you touch my family""... Then straight after that, he was blind again. Clyde wasn't an enemy, nor was he a psycho. Clyde was Nick... Clyde was the very system that wanted to stop him... The difference is, Clyde didn't break the system, the already broken system, broke him... And now, they wanted to judge him for exactly what they are. And how did they end up doing it, by turning into Clyde... But who's going to judge them?<br/><br/>And Clyde's rampage, wasn't the proof of his brokenness, that all was to make a point. Clyde's turning point, was when he killed his cellmate. That, for me, was the epitome of what the justice system did to him.<br/><br/>And the ending... For me, it can remain as it is, with just 1 simple adjustment... I would've preferred for Clyde to have been aware, before he hit the call button, that he was calling his own destiny. That way, the system knows it didn't win, it knows that it lost, the moment Clyde lost his family.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8, because it engaged the hell out of me... It's relevant, and close to any heart that has had to deal with, Left vs RIGHT, and not, RIGHT vs wrong."

","The movie was great. It was tragic and put a different spin on crime movies. I loved Clyde's character and Gerard Butler's acting was on point. I enjoyed every point of this movie. There was just enough mystery to keep me watching, and no over-the-top gory scenes. But at the same time there was enough to make the movie intense and enough that you could feel some justice in Clyde's family's deaths. I don't know about everyone else who watched this movie, but I was on Clyde's side entirely. Not once did I feel for Nick or any of the others, except for maybe Jonas and Sarah since they seemed to have they most sense in their heads. Onto the bad points... Nick's character was lacking in emotion or any kind of remorse. His friends died and he didn't cry once. He's known these people for years. You'd think he'd shed a tear. Although he's got a family, it appears he barely understood Clyde's reasoning or his total devastation and what pushed him over the edge. So the ending was a disappointment at best. Killed the best character in the movie and let the robotic one walk free to probably still be awful at his job and understanding people. I'd have let the inadequacies of Nick's character slide if only the director had put some sort of effort into the ending. Maybe leave the audience satisfied. Since I was on Clyde's side, I don't think he deserved the ending he got. He was simply a man who lost his family and snapped. But for that, he did not deserve to die. I'd have been happy with a simpler ending, one that comprised of less death. Maybe they sent Clyde to a more secure prison, or maybe when Nick and him are in his cell talking, Nick actually realizes how wrong he was, Clyde comes to his senses and stops killing, and goes free to be on the run. I know that seems like too happy of an ending, but it sure would have been better than what was offered to us. These days, these types of endings are all directors offer us in the attempt of being original, when in fact, all most of us really want is a better ending. #stopthemadness2k16"

","Law abiding citizen does contain many twists and turns throughout the whole movie, there is no doubt about that. It also contains pretty good performances from both the lead roles i.e,Jamie and Gerard.But the film does looses its interest between the last 20 minutes when it is found that Gerard was easily able to get away from the prison through a tunnel which connects his house and prison in which he was kept. I was like why there was no security there outside his prison? At this point the viewer will surely looses the interest in the whole movie but i have to say that it is a nice film having many thrills. I could have easily given a 7.5 only if the ending was much better. But overall it will be enjoyed by many. Especially those who don't watch movies every week or so."

","To be completely and painfully honest with you, the only reason that I decided to watch this film when it came up in my Netflix suggestions is because I have been a Jamie Foxx fan for a long time, and have also found Gerard Butler's previous movies to be entertaining. I figured that I had nothing to lose by watching this title, and instead was blown away by the premise of this film.<br/><br/>The acting is good, the character stories are more developed than some run of the mill action movies and as such I found myself in the conundrum of not knowing whose team I should be on. I sympathized equally with Foxx's and Butler's characters, and found the banter and conversation between them to be well-written and well-acted on their parts.<br/><br/>Even my mother (who admittedly hates action/thriller type movies) watched this while glued to the television screen, indicating that the background to these characters stories run deeper than most films, and as such lend to a move enriched movie experience.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this film if you are a fan of the action-thriller genre. There are enough twists in the plot to keep you happy, and plenty of exciting and suspenseful scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. Well done overall."

","Up to the last 10 minutes of the movie i was like - oh, this is definitely a 10/10 movie, builds great suspense, extremely grasping and has you on your toes all the time. But then all of that just had to be wasted at the end. All the suspense built up was just gone.<br/><br/>I can safely say this is the greatest movie with a lack luster ending i have ever seen. I was constantly thinking - why does this movie have a rating of 7.4? This is an awesome movie! Now i understand why and agree with the 7.4. <br/><br/>Aside from that it is a great movie, a mastermind trapped into a solitary committing terrible killings, constantly tricking everybody, so everything goes just as he had planned. I get why it had to be like that, after all it is a Hollywood movie, it was all about a man fighting against the system alone, nobody is going to condone showing somebody destroy the law system of the USA, let alone if it is done by a single person. They just had to let the dumb cops somehow trick Clyde and give him a dose of his own medicine in the end.<br/><br/>Still 8/10, since the majority of the movie was really great, an awesome thriller.

"DonaldDooD","5","0","0","2 October 2014"," The Litmus Test for Viewer Idiocy
","I didn't love this film by any means. It focused too much on the violence, not enough on the characters, and its plot is impossible. But I will have to give it this - its themes and execution have revealed a lot about the movie-going audience. Indeed, they're dumb, emotional, and shallow.<br/><br/>People love to romanticize vigilante justice. Its brave, rebellious, and edgy! Of course people would cheer for a man giving eeevvviiilll villains their just desserts. ""Who cares if he's breaking the law? He's the good guy! Our justice system screwed him over!"" What empty platitudes. While no justice system is perfect, it is far better than vigilante justice. Its easy to defend it as some glorious act when its against a murdering rapist. People forget when it hits the innocent, or those who stood a chance at reform. Believe it or not, people actually have different opinions. And we can't allow all of them in our legal system.<br/><br/>Yet time after time, I've seen people hate this film because it doesn't let them indulge in their vigilante power fantasy. They want the film to pander to their wants, ignoring the horrible deeds vigilantes can commit. And such a movie would be boring. For all its faults, at least Law Abiding Citizen tries to show how desire for revenge can encompass one's life, that ""good"" and ""evil"" are sometimes intertwined. It mostly failed, but it at least tried. But that's not what the audience wants, I guess. Just impossible intelligence, impossible success, and impossible luck, no message of real subsistence attached. As pure as justice porn gets.<br/><br/>I think I should start showing this movie to new people I meet, just to judge their character. This may be my most visceral disagreement in film. In a world filled with generic action films, I can't believe people not only want another unchallenging popcorn flick, but demand a film cater to their personal fantasies. Its depressing."

","After hearing about this from a teammate, a friend and a coworker (not all the same person), I decided to watch it.<br/><br/>This is a tale of revenge. A middle aged man by the name of Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) witnesses his wife and daughter get brutally murdered at the hand of two criminals. This atrocity happens very early in the movie and sets the tone. Asst. DA, soon to be DA, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), tries the case and doesn't secure a verdict satisfactory to Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler). That leaves Clyde to take matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>The movie was quite inventive and clever, even if Clyde was mad with vengeance. You couldn't help but root for Clyde to some degree as he wrought death and havoc upon those responsible for his family's killer's light sentence. He started his warpath with the most responsible parties, i.e. the criminals, then he extended out from there. Each move made tactical sense until towards the end. I ask you: after the two scumbag criminals, their lawyer and the judge... who is the MOST liable for the lack of justice? Obviously it would be Nick Rice!! So why then wasn't he immediately targeted? <br/><br/>At first I was thinking that Clyde had something more in store for Nick. I was thinking: he's going to destroy his life. Get him fired, make him lose his family and then land him in prison somehow. But, as the movie went on, Clyde was targeting everyone BUT Nick. It really didn't make any sense. Then the ending plain sucked. The dialog between Clyde and Nick was too cheesy; in fact, this was not a good Jamie Foxx performance. It was obvious that he was trying to play the cocky DA but he mailed in the performance. Back to the ending... it was not well thought out. Sure, they brought the bomb back to his cell to make him do himself in, but that was so absurd. Let's see: 1.) transporting armed napalm 2.) have no idea when he'll detonate it 3.) got it back to his cell (of course through the secret entrance) 4.) stayed in the cell until he was ready to detonate it 5.) escaped before being blown up too.<br/><br/>A better ending: A.) Nick Price straight up kills Clyde or B.) Clyde kills Nick Price as the final sacrifice and either gets away or gets caught and takes his death penalty having gotten the vengeance he sought. I assume this was supposed to be a happy ending because the good guy gone bad was killed, but I couldn't help but feel that the ending was incomplete. At the very least the ending was ambivalent; no way to say that good triumphed over evil."

When the killers are caught, Nick Rice, a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over his objections, Nick is forced by his boss to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Fast forward ten years. The man who got away with murder is found dead and Clyde Shelton coolly admits his guilt. Then he issues a warning to Nick: Either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family, or key players in the trial will die. Soon Shelton follows through on his threats, orchestrating from his jail cell a string of spectacularly diabolical assassinations that can be neither predicted nor prevented. Philadelphia is gripped with fear as Shelton's high- profile targets are slain one after another and the authorities are powerless to halt his reign of terror. Only Nick can stop the killing, and to do so he must outwit this brilliant sociopath in a harrowing contest of wills in which even the smallest misstep means death. With his own family now in Shelton's cross hairs, Nick finds himself in a desperate race against time facing a deadly adversary who seems always to be one step ahead."

Clyde Shelton could kill Rice and accept his death happily binding all his revenge and the 'change' in the system could be made by accepting the jury that there are some flaws in the system. Something like that. Or Shelton could somehow escape from death to indicate the sequel.<br/><br/>Rice was also the part of the corrupt system and he should also suffer.

"pitguy32","9","0","0","2 June 2014"," Key Points that are Invalid
","Firstly let me say this is a Great Movie and Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler have awesome Characters ... Butler's being the better of the two. <br/><br/>HOWEVER there are key parts that just don't add up. For example when they go to Butler's house and arrest him. Firstly the DA HAS to have some Evidence in order to obtain an Arrest Warrant and a Search Warrant which they have none. Without one they would not have been able to bust into the man's house without the other they wouldn't be allowed by law to Search it. These things put together spell MISS Trial ALLDAY and twice on Sunday. Now the other key factor is ...what was the point of Butler stripping down right before the Police bust open his door ? There was no point even in an insanity plea the Judge would have deemed it inadmissible because he was in his own home while being nude.So that whole scene was misleading and just wrong. Thirdly what DA goes out with the Police in a ride along to Arrest one man ? <br/><br/>These are just a couple of things there is also the fact that they keep him locked up in jail with no evidence and the Judge doesn't grant him bail which would not happen in real life with ZERO Evidence. Plus there is no court in the world that would take a plea from Darby with his accomplice and the ONLY Witness stating it was Darby who did the murders. He is the key Criminal and they had statements saying just that from the Witness and his own Partner.<br/><br/>Now the Jail scenes .... there is no way in hell they wouldn't notice a guy missing from his cell for hours at a time in Solitary Confinement as anyone who has been in jail knows they do a count every 2 hours. On to the part where they search the food being brought into the jail YES they might search the food BUT Not 2 or 3 times KNOWING that a man's Life is on the Line if they are late secondly the DA OVER RULES the Warden not the other way around. So if the DA says do it NOW the Warden HAS to comply! Also the bombing scene... there are Camera's outside that Parking Lot Gate they show them when the cars come in. Yet they didn't see a guy RIGHT outside the Gate setting up a Bomb Trip Device. <br/><br/>I'm not even going to discuss the impossibilities of not being able to dig into EVERY Cell in Solitary Confinement. <br/><br/>Just some observations in regards to the misleading concept of this movie. GOOD MOVIE but the script needs work. In writing and directing and producing movies you want the movie to be as real as possible so why so many misleading ideals in this one movie ?"

","Sometimes I wonder why people make movies which glorify citizens taking the law into their hands. Your loved ones are brutally murdered, the convicts are let off lightly and you spend ten years preparing to kill everyone involved for the unfortunate incident. Is this a viable logic? Though the film tries to present an intellectual, innovative and well planned scheme behind the killings, all our hero does is vent out his revenge on others in the same gruesome manner (worse at times) the way his loved ones were killed. Some parts of the movie reminded me of the epic Shawshank Redemptions.<br/><br/>And by the time the veil was lifted and our smart hero's execution of the massacre explained, I wasn't the least bit interested, although considering the fact that the movie was less than 2 hours.

I would have rated it much higher but for two factors, Jamie Foxx who isn't a great actor in my book and secondly, the way the story falls apart in the last 20 minutes and suddenly the hero is treated as the bad guy and the guilty prick becomes the hero, not to mention the hero who is so smart throughout the whole movie suddenly makes mistakes worthy of a bumbling crook not a mastermind. The movie starts out like it's going to be your typical thriller ala The Fugitive or Death Race, then turns into a pretty graphic revenge moments like you may expect from a movie like Saw before finishing off like a typical Hollywood movie with the hero saving the day (I get the feeling the end may have been done to accommodate typical audiences and/or studio heads).

","The 2009 thriller, Law Abiding Citizen takes place in the present day in Pennsylvania. This movie focuses on a man named Clyde (Gerard Butler) who feels failed by the justice system so he takes justice into his own hands by seeking revenge on the ones who killed his family and those who failed to get the justice he deserved. 10 years later Clyde begins the work of his master plan to get the justice he needs by first seeking out the killers and then the justice system. Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), the District Attorney, is at the center of the plan and tries to solve the mysteries that are happening in the world around him. There is an unexpected end to Clyde's master plan – to most this restores safety, but one person goes up in flames. There is a good representation of the female voice throughout the film because there was a growth in the female character, Sarah Lowell (Leslie Bibb), who is involved in the District Attorney's office and works under Nick. It is through Nick's support of her that she was able to get involved in the case because the other men in the department didn't believe she would be beneficial to the case. Throughout the film, you see her voice getting more recognition because she uncovers many great facts. This does play into the idea that females do tend to get underestimated in the workplace unless they are supported or protected by a male. <br/><br/>The development of the character of Clyde is brilliant. His intellect is beyond what someone would ever believe. SPOILER The events that happen in the film are so well organized and planned that the audience would never be able to tie them back to Clyde – it is mind blowing when you finally realize the ending. In relation to characters, Clyde is by far my favorite character in any films. His manipulative and survivalist mind is something I have never seen in films before. This character is a one of a kind character and by far leads this movie to be something much better.<br/><br/>My overall opinion of this movie is high. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a crime related thriller. It left me wondering and stumped at all ends, and the ending is just genius. I have watched this movie hundred of times (not even a joke).It is brilliantly structured and even though I know the twists and turns of the movie, it never gets old."

","OK so this is a rather intense thriller with Gerard Butler as the victim of a heinous crime turning him into a blind vengeful and dangerous murderer. And Jamie Foxx as a district-attorney trying to stop the murders. Well I have mixed feelings about this one. It's a passable thriller which will keep you engaged until the end. But the end may please some but it doesn't make it right... And yes Gerard Butler's character has been through hell, losing his family but does that justify his vicious murders? And believe me some deaths are pretty horrific. Jamie Foxx is excellent as the mostly rational d.a. trying to prevent worse....but in the end he ends up being Charles Bronson...and Gerard Butler...we get what he's been through...but his character is INTENSLY despicable.

","Law Abiding Citizen is an amazing movie. It keeps you guessing and interested through ought the entire movie, up until the ending. Kurt Wimmer did such a good job with all the surprises Gerard Butler's character plans out and builds his character amazingly well as the movie progresses, but once his secret has been revealed it goes downhill from there. It's extremely improbable that Jamie Foxx's character would be able to out-smart ""the best of the best"" when it comes to planned murders. Butler's character has been set up in a way which leads us to believe he notices everything. He doesn't notice that Foxx is slowly creeping up to him? It just doesn't add up to me. <br/><br/>Overall, AMAZING movie. It keeps you guessing and wanting to know more and more. Gray did an amazing job as director and is perfectly filmed for Butler to thrive. The only complaint I have is the stereotypical ending. If you haven't seen this movie already, you definitely should."

","This movie is in two parts ... the first 94 minutes and then the last 15 minutes. The first 94 minutes is without a doubt a 10 out of 10 or should I say 5 out of 5. The last 15 minutes is 0 out of 5, if I could give it a minus score I would! I must have watched it 10 or 12 times and I've only watched the ending once, the first time obviously! It almost makes me cry to think about how badly they butchered this film at the end, it could have been one of the greats of all time, quite seriously! I decided not to put a spoiler in about the ending, I suppose it's only fair you should watch it like I did. I bought the Bluray as soon as it came out, convinced that it would have an alternate ending but alas that was not the case, they must not have written one. I pray that they remake this film one day with the ending that 99% of movie goers want to see and when you see the film, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. <br/><br/>Fast forward two years and I'm now editing the review I wrote in 2013. I've just finished watching most of this movie again and I wanted to explain to you the emotions I was going through while watching. The ending truly does haunt you, knowing that it's coming. I have never felt this way about a movie before, it causes physical pain knowing what's coming. I suppose it's because it could have been so great and in the end you feel betrayed by a director and writer who quite frankly have no feel for what movie audiences want. Do they have any idea how detestable a character Jamie Foxx plays. All you want is for him to come to a painful end and I'm sure they have no idea. I don't know if anyone will ever read my review and it doesn't matter, I just had to vent my feelings before they totally consumed me!"

","Any film which inspires a person to do the right thing or to try to make amends for an injustice, is a beautiful thing! People love, and some people even *need* a strong vengeance tale. Law abiding citizen is certainly a fine one. <br/><br/>I even referred to it in My real life when I was dealing with a detective who had failed to pursue appropriately (or at least notify Me of pursuit of) a person who attacked and hurt Me even though they had an admission and all the relevant information to do so.<br/><br/>I believe that when the justice system fails, it becomes conscientious citizens responsibility to pursue justice instead. Too many persons guilty of terrible crimes against other people are walking free because of an ineffective judicial system full of irrational technicalities and irrelevant loopholes. <br/><br/>So when justice isn't served by the system, the responsibility falls upon the people. Justice is ""an eye for an eye"" whenever such is possible and reasonable. But it must not ever involve harming an innocent party.<br/><br/>In Law Abiding Citizen, these ""rules"" are pretty well adhered to, though there is a sense of impending harm that looms over certain innocent parties though. I believe the film ought to be viewed by those studying sociology and psychology to trigger discussions on the subject, because it is very real. <br/><br/>The pursuit of justice is performed by an incredibly resourceful genius who has long planned every move before it happens. Nothing performed by our vigilante is random, every move has been plotted precisely. And the perpetrator is clear, though there's no clear explanation as to how it occurs while a man is in intensive prison lock-down. There's an exceedingly interesting, touching and creative script. The audience as perplexed as law enforcement is, in solving ""how does he do it? How was that even possible?""<br/><br/>Acting is great, as are the sets, dialogue, sound and effects. <br/><br/>I was a bit upset about the ending, but found that it was the only decent solution possible to the plot at hand. I highly recommend this film! It is a very satisfying movie that will capture your attention! <br/><br/>Appropriate for individual viewers, couples, families with their children a subjectively mature 14 yr's or older, and for small gatherings of friends. <br/><br/>Foul language is kept to a minimum, there are brief moments of implied drug use, brief innuendo of rape, and a quick shot of a nearly nude woman resting. The largest concern for parents or those with extremely uptight sensibilities will be the violence, though there isn't a gore factor."

","There's something to be said for a movie that's exactly what it advertises itself to be. I loaded up ""Law Abiding Citizen"" because all the trailers had promised me a gloriously shlocky revenge caper combining the revenge elements of Death Wish with the over the top planning of the Saw series. <br/><br/>And it does have some of that style. Cars are attacked with weaponized bomb squad robots, government officials get killed through wacky cell phone bombs, and other over the top methods of destruction. In the style of many hokey violent movies, a character exists purely to give a speech on how thoroughly trained and bad ass Clyde Sheldon is. <br/><br/>But oh lord does it lose steam every time it thinks its making an interesting point. The movies notion that the justice system isn't working because it just isn't brutal and vengeful enough is never given enough teeth to be meaningful. The way Sheldon's family is murdered in the beginning is nonsensical and is never given much context. Bad men enter his house and kill people, because old men firmly believe that this is a thing that happens all the time. Wouldn't reprisal have represented a more compelling reason? Evil men don't deliberately murder your family without some sort of pretext. Maybe his sketchy military weapons history would have inspired it? But no, they're evil bad men who did it because they're drug-using criminal scum.<br/><br/>He loses of course, because that's how it has to happen in a Hollywood film, but the moralizing delivered by Academy Award Winning Jamie Foxx feels like a lazy bit of tacked on finger-wagging.<br/><br/>I think this movie would have benefited from going either more exploitive or more poignant. The belligerently conservative Old Testament God moralizing about the judicial system seems weird and clumsy, and doesn't match well with the ludicrous plot twists necessary to make the trashy narrative possible.<br/><br/>Make a point.

Once Clyde paints and embroiders the city authorities, the prosecutor tries to do the best he can to stop the killing spree, but just like in ""Saw"", the lunatic seems to be unstoppable.<br/><br/>It's a really good detail that the prosecutor's character is played by a black man and the mayor's played by a black woman.

I was rooting for bad guy Clyde (Gerard Butler) all the way in his fight against a corrupt justice system that violates its own principles at every turn. But even as it undermines its own moral foundation (symbolically represented by Clyde's tunnels), the story tries its best to make us favor the DA Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx) instead. It doesn't work.

","""Law Abiding Citizen"" combines elements of 'Saw' and 'Death Wish', but without the traps and weapons. If you're expecting gunfights and physical torture traps, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're not expecting these things, but are still looking for a story heavy on plot, you'll be disappointed. But if you're expecting an entertaining movie that delivers the goods, and tells a reasonable story, then you'll enjoy yourself. Gerard Butler is no Tobin Bell or Charles Bronson, but he is fit for this role, I suppose. The subplot involving this D.A.'s family is unnecessary. It doesn't connect with the rest of the movie, to say the least. Also, Foxx's and Butler's characters spend most of the movie putting up with one another, suggesting the film could have gone a little more over-the-top.

"gaelele","6","0","0","9 January 2011"," A good movie if you are looking for action and gore.
","Warning: this review contains spoilers. <br/><br/>Plot: Law Abiding Citizen is about Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) as a criminal prosecutor, and Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) as a victim of a horrific crime.<br/><br/>It starts with Clyde Sheltons (Gerard Butlers) normal family life being rudely interrupted by the brutal rape of his wife and vicious murder of both his wife and child by two burglars. While Shelton himself, also being stabbed, is laying helplessly on the floor bleeding.<br/><br/>Nick Rice (Jame Foxx) is prosecuting the two men who did it. To maintain his prosecution rate, Rice decides to cut a deal with the murderer, without telling Shelton. He lets the real guilty one of the two burglars get less prison time, letting the other one go to death row.<br/><br/>10 years later Nick Rice is a family man himself with a wife and child. They are all attending the execution of the same burglar when things start to go wrong. The man being executed is violently shaking and screaming before he dies. Rice finds out that the injection modules are tampered with. He suspects the other burglar did it (the real rapist and murderer), who is now a free man. When he arrives at the suspect's house the murderer is just getting away, thanks to telephone instructions of his victim, Clyde Shelton. Shelton is guiding him out of the hands of the police. Not to help him, but to systematically torture and kill him.<br/><br/>Clyde Shelton is arrested but is playing a very clever cat and mouse game with Rice and the police, he sets demands, or other people involved in the case will start to die. When they actually start doing so, Rice does everything in his power to stop Shelton, before it is too late.<br/><br/>Review: 5.5 out of 10, I found this movie not very good. Even though the plot is well thought out, the action is not bad, and this movie has real nasty gore scenes. The acting is pretty good and it isn't boring either, I simply found the movie very wrong.<br/><br/>While watching this movie I could not help thinking that the creators where set out to confront people with as much torture, murder and violence as possible. They created a grand display of erosion of the US constitution. The movie makes the viewer personificate with the victim of the crimes, Shelton, who initially seems to expose the flaws of the United States Justice Department.<br/><br/>When Shelton actually turns in to a murdering terrorist the viewer will feel as if they should never have doubted the US Justice Department. Full fledged police state propaganda follows with random police checkpoints and warrantless searches. The police bending the law is all accepted to keep people safe. Nick Rice turns from criminal prosecutor, to police investigator, to District Attorney in a matter of days. <br/><br/>I found the end disturbing where Rice decides to become a murderer, and kill off the imprisoned Shelton himself, to prevent more from dying. It ends when he coldly smiles watching his daughter play the cello after that.<br/><br/>I also don't like Jamie Foxx for some reason, so this review may not be entirely objective. Go watch this, if Jamie Foxx and police propaganda do not bother you, and if you like movies that contain rape torture and gore."

","Law Abiding Citizen is great, there's no denying that. The story is well thought of and brilliantly written and leaves you gripped, watching the battle of wits between Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx was brilliant.

You could really feel the emotion from Clyde who wasn't only tormented but was extremely clever and didn't stop at anything to get the results he wanted. The characters were brilliantly written, the direction was done well and the action scenes were okay but I felt the ending was rushed and lacked in timing and pace, which let the movie down in my opinion. Another thing that let the movie down a little was the amount of blood and violence, I think it could have been toned down a little since the storyline was very good anyway and had you thinking.<br/><br/>I was kind of expecting your usual revenge/thriller movie, which has been done many times before, but Law Abiding Citizen manages to make it its own movie with an intelligent story and very smart characters.

","Good start to the movie, the intense violence and gore (which I normally don't prefer) set the correct tone for the movie. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler was a great pairing for the part. Nice to also see Colm Meany acting outside of the usually viewed StarTrek TNG (transporter chief O'Brina) episodes too. Would have given it 10 stars if it weren't for the lackluster ending.<br/><br/>Better than most thrillers lately, but the movie just kinda died on the vine toward the end... did they run out of ideas? Without giving away any spoilers I seemed that the District Attorney (Foxx) seemed to show that self-serving godlike plea bargaining without any morals is the way the legal system is played. Also, the DA repeatedly breaks laws to suit his mantra of -it does not matter what is right but what can be proved in court-. Kind of a bummer to see the good guy (Foxx) sink to the same level as the antihero (Butler)... I'm sure law enforcement fans walk away with a slight tinge of embarrassment knowing that the law (usually) is not faithfully represented in the movie... even in Philly!!<br/><br/>The plot holes, continuity goofs and otherwise incorrect parts of the movie were at a tolerable minimum... given that movie directors (and film staff) don't seriously -proof- their work. I can even forgive the minor fact that the coordinates given for the kidnapped lawyers location North 39° 57' 4' ' West 75° 10' 22' ' was not accurate at all... but somewhere in -downdown- Philly."

","Gerard Butler's latest performance seems just a pretext to use his muscles; in theory it should be the excuse for telling again about the US legal system, always more concerned with procedures than real justice. However the story is too full with holes and discrepancies. So let's say that the entertainment value is hard to deny but aside from that and, putting aside the ideological tools, the whole plot is about a hyper-violent fantasy about an unstoppable killer. The biggest disappointment is seeing Jamie Foxx in this unlikely thriller, G. Butler is more suitable for this but an award winning actor should act in more believable movies.."

","I think expectations of a lot of people were to see a great vengeance movie with simple plot and a lot of action that makes you really feel the story.<br/><br/>When you think about the story from morality point it all makes sense - even if justice system fails you can't take matters in your own hands or you will become no better than the criminals. This is quite a common point in Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>But somehow it didn't fell right. I think most of the people were sympathetic to the Clyde and he was killed too soon. You leave the theater with mixed feelings about the ending (mostly bad feelings).<br/><br/>The story is not trivial - usually in vengeance movies there is a good guy and a bad guy - you can imagine the rest :) Here there are no good guys. Clyde's character is not simple - on one hand he gets his revenge but on the other he kills a lot of people that obviously didn't deserve to die (punished - yes, but killed - not). Nick looks like bad character, but we can see his justification so in the end he is not so bad.<br/><br/>But still making Clyde die and leave Nick completely unpunished and even promoted just doesn't seem right. What point did this movie tried to make? Justice is corrupt but you can;t do anything about it? Vengeance is not good for you? <br/><br/>In any case this is a great movie that makes you think ""Why?"" for a while after you watch it :)"
"LordElfstone","6","0","0","17 September 2010"," interesting idea limited by typical movie conventions
","I pretty much agree with the review that is currently voted as the best one. The movie toys with the familiar concept of taking revenge...the audience both wants to see the Clyde succeed, but feels uneasy at the same time, knowing that revenge has never served anyone. Then, when it becomes apparent, that this may go too far, that should be enough to sustain interest and a love/hate relationship with Clyde. After all, the movie doesn't play too serious and allows for humor, which should be displaced in this kind of situation, quite clearly marking it as entertainment as opposed to a thoughtful piece of work. By that point you probably no longer care and half-root for him to succeed, just to see how over-the-top this can still get. He already seems to put the Joker to shame...causing mayhem *while* being in prison. But the last act ruins all this excitement and the all-too-popular by-the-numbers final resolution act with an unimaginative twist runs the whole thing into the (familiar) ground. Still, the first part is nicely done, creating hope for something unusual and the rest plays out better in your own head, I guess."

","It was good to see a movie finally depict what I like to think I'd do to someone who went free after they broke into my home, stabbed me in the chest and then raped and murdered my wife and daughter in front of me while I lie there helplessly.<br/><br/>The - I suppose he is the antagonist - then goes on to flip off the entire justice system, and continues to kill people while rather plainly stating that the only way they'll stop him is to admit that their system is broken then shoot him in the face.<br/><br/>Sadly it became harder and harder to sympathize with him, as his targets became less and less involved with his case to the point where he eventually started killing random people because it was convenient for his plan, or just for being part of 'the system', in order to 'deliver his message'. Does somebody really deserve to die for handling the paperwork of the lawyer who dropped your case? One also wonders exactly how he meant for his message to be conveyed as all the public saw were people getting murdered for no apparent reason, and the mayor and her higher-ups didn't seem to care at all about his plight.<br/><br/>The movie would've been more interesting if he had simply stopped killing people after the two who murdered his family, and then eluded punishment through the same legal abuse that failed to give him justice. (Perhaps to then turn around and point out the system's flaws before accepting his punishment?) Him being a super-awesome-CIA badass also took away from the fun of him being an everyman standing up for himself.<br/><br/>The movie rapidly degenerated to the point where, in the final half hour, nobody seemed to care if anything made sense anymore.

"jenlasti","Null","0","0","2 September 2010"," Powerful movie in Beginning and Middle but...
","The end of the movie was horrible and very contradictory. Fox's character commits murder for justice of the people that Gerard's character killed. Gerard was taking justice into his own hands and committed murder. But the ending contradicts itself. It shows that if you are in a position of power, such as ""district attorney"", that you can commit murder for ""justice"" and it can in fact be called justice. So Gerard's character appears as the bad guy when he was murdering for ""justice"". They were both wrong. But this movie makes you resent Foxx's character for being very arrogant throughout and unemotional to anyone else except himself. It makes you empathize with gerard's character. Thus, the ending offers a huge let down and disappointment.<br/><br/>On another note, Gerard did a great job acting!!! I think he nailed his character dead on! However, Jamie's acting...quite frankly I'm biased. If he was meant to portray a very cocky, arrogant, and unemotional character than he did an OK job.<br/><br/>This movie could almost be compared to ""silence of the lambs"", ""taken"", and other great works....but the ending sucked."

On this one i found my self hating Jamie's character as he shows to be a ""system tamed"" lawyer whose only intentions are climbing up the ladder of the establishment regardless of the turn out. Through the movie i developed tremendous empathy with the character played by Gerard Butler. In fact i think anyone watching this movie will feel that way. Someone who has his live destroyed in the way he has his, would at least have done what in my opinion he should have done in the movie. End up with the corrupt system that rules us all. I did not like Jamie's character throughout (not in the interpretative sense) he shows no remorse for his wrongs, in fact he stands tough for them in front of those for whom he cares and finally die for them. Rather unpleasantly, like half way through the film, i already knew that an American made Hollywood movie would tragically (for the story) let down a unique chance to set this production apart from the mainstream false morale endings that seem to plague the industry nowadays. Maybe its unsafe to display what would have been a fair ending to this story to a part of the American public, as they may try to bring it in to practise. I don't know. Certainly in Europe things probably would have ended in a different way, although we are twisted here too :). Coming to terms with whats fair i'd say that apart from saying the ending is appalling, there are some very loose threads. First, someone as smart as Clyde and having ten years to prepare, wouldn't have let anything left to tie up after he was imprisoned. Second, even in the worse movies i've seen involving bombs, the villain always has some device prepared in case anyone tries to move or deactivate the artifact, providing it to go off.<br/><br/>Left to your own judgement remains to say if both characters get the ending they deserve. which in my opinion they don't."

"MovieEnthusiast13","7","0","0","4 August 2010"," Butler portrays a vengeful father/husband in this action-thriller
","Gerard Butler is an interesting actor. He has done comedies (The Ugly Truth) and many action movies (300, Gamer). Personally, I think he is better as an action star. In Law Abiding Citizen, he plays a man with a plan to take down the justice system. The movie is a good thriller with lots of violence and mystery.<br/><br/>Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler) is an honest, law abiding, family man until two home-invaders attack Clyde and murder his wife and daughter. Jamie Foxx plays Nick Rice, a lawyer who decides to make a deal with one of the killers. Flash forward ten years, one of the murderers is being given lethal injection, while the other perpetrator has gone free after a short prison term. When the injection goes horribly wrong and the other killer is found mutilated in a warehouse, Clyde gives himself up to the police as the murderer. From within the prison walls, Clyde begins to orchestrate the assassination of anyone involved in the case.<br/><br/>The story is a classic locked-room mystery, how does Clyde continue to kill people even after he has been locked up? The answer to this question I thought was a little weak of an idea, but it was still inventive and proved just how resourceful Clyde was. Otherwise, the story is believable and makes for a good thriller. I felt that the script was quite good for a mystery-thriller, one of my favorite quotes comes when Clyde Sheldon states that he is ""gonna bring the whole f***in' diseased, corrupt temple down on your head. It's gonna be biblical."" <br/><br/>I bought Gerard Butler as a nice, family man. He was also believable as a vicious serial killer (although ideally I would have preferred to see Clyde fall into madness, but this would be a whole other movie). Gerard Butler does seem a little bit too nice when he tortures the murderer of his family, but when you consider what he's doing, and how he talks about it later, his character is actually quite real. Jamie Foxx is good as a lawyer, but he doesn't show as much emotional depth as I think could have come from this role.<br/><br/>Overall, Law Abiding Citizen is a good movie to watch, especially for people who like action-thrillers. The film is gritty, violent and is enjoyable to watch."
"wingedheartart","7","0","0","11 July 2010"," liked it but so bothered by these few things
","This was a pretty darn good movie. I absolutely abhor the beginning violence, even though it is I guess, necessary for setting up the story and the anger/frustration etc. for the main character. I just have a difficult time with the thought of children being hurt and this was just a little much. <br/><br/>One thing about Gerard Butler's character. Towards the end when it is shown that he has a way in and out of solitary, with that tunnel etc. to that big building/warehouse, we are to believe that he didn't leave multiple booby traps behind in case someone figured it all out? COME ON!!!!!!! He was smart enough, way smarter than the D.A. and other criminals, why in heck would he NOT put up some sort of trap or multiple traps or even a camera monitoring his entrance and way back into jail? That was so stupid I guess Kurt Wimmer had written himself into a wall. Not to mention, the bomb on Gerard's cell NOT have a way to turn the bomb off? Just in case something came up that he might want to change his mind or do something else? COME ON!!!! <br/><br/>He might have been in that cell with the bomb ""called"" and started, but he could have easily had some sort of code to punch in to stop it. Or to get out of that cell. That would have left Mr. Wimmer with an open for a second film as well. Where the D.A. and cops think Gerard's character is dead, due to the explosion, but it shows an alternative tunnel, no one knew about and a dark fellow escaping? Duh. <br/><br/>I don't normally get so annoyed, but the fact that Gerard's character had SO many things going in his favor due to his intelligence, no traps or safeguards for his tunnel and his own protection is just ridiculous. Kurt Wimmer, if you read this, please don't do that again. <br/><br/>All in all, Gerard did an excellent job of being the smart bad-good-guy. Even though he was systematically killing off the people that had worked on the murderer's cases years before, he was very believable as the man who has lost his heart and his love in a horribly, violent way. I still felt sorry for his situation, through all the violence. <br/><br/>The situation may have originated with the killers, but the following violence and tortures were due to the D.A. and assistant D.A. and could have been prevented. So frustrating. <br/><br/>Okay, enough of this. Worth watching, but if you have a difficult time watching mom's and children get murdered, wait 5 minutes and come in after all that."

"jonathanruano","8","0","0","10 July 2010"," Law Abiding Citizen
","Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is at home playing with his wife and young daughter when suddenly he hears a knock on the door. When he opens the front door, two thugs Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and Rupert Ames (Joshua Stewart) burst in. Darby stabs Clyde, his wife and child. Only Clyde Shelton survives this event and he turns to the ambitious lawyer Nick Rice for justice. But since DNA has been denied at trial, Rice opts for a deal in which Darby gets five years for testifying against Ames who gets the lethal injection. This sombre, dark and serious backdrop is surprisingly and unexpectedly the set-up for an effective dark comedy in which Clyde Shelton not only takes revenge against Ames and Darby, but also teaches Nick Rice a lesson that he will never forget.<br/><br/>I am inclined to regard ""Law Abiding Citizen"" as a dark comedy/fantasy, because I cannot imagine it working any other way. Gerard Butler does not play his character straight, but rather with a comic and sarcastic edge almost as though from the very beginning he is out to make a point that the system of justice (as he sees it) is ridiculous. The facial expressions and the emotional response are different from what you expect from a man who lost his wife and child. Just compare Butler to Brandon Lee in ""The Crow"" and you will see what I mean. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is also more of a fantasy than an action thriller, because what it is really about (if you think about it) is a victim fantasizing about what he would like to see happen to the criminals who ruined his life and to the justice system that (in his mind) let him down. Since the movie is about Clyde Shelton's fantasy and not about anything real, it features many unlikely and fantastic (but nonetheless entertaining) twists and turns that could only be found in a revenge fantasy. For example, Clyde Shelton launches countless terrorist attacks against the justice system while he is in prison. To be sure, the film explains how Shelton is able to do this, but(without giving away the surprise) the answer provided is itself implausible. The frequent face-to-face encounters between Nick Rice and Clyde Shelton in prison are also part of this fantasy, because they are too unlikely to be believed. A prosecutor would simply not spend so much time visiting a man that he had sent to prison. Lastly, the concessions to Shelton - which include a nice bed and a Frisco's steak - are highly unlikely, which is why those scenes and more particularly the reaction of the cell mates to them are so funny.<br/><br/>I think this movie is going to appeal more to people who are themselves victims of crime and fantasize about taking the law in their own hands and about meting out justice to those who have wronged them. But I also enjoyed watching ""Law Abiding Citizen"" when I stopped taking it seriously and saw it more as a revenge fantasy with a dark comedic edge - and on that basis I do recommend it. For all of the implausible plot developments, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" has kept me entertained right to the end. Finally there is something quite refreshing about the Clyde Shelton character - and the way Gerard Butler played it - because it is different from the Hollywood characters in the revenge genre. Butler did something bold and original here, which indicates that he is more than the typical Hollywood actor (a la Keanu Reeves) and that the writers for once actually gave some thought to making this character not only intelligent, but subtle and intriguing."

","I joined IMDb to write this review as people seem to miss the point of the ending.<br/><br/>Butler is brilliant at portraying sheer helplessness at the beginning and the movie is well set up to show the result of 10 years of spiraling into hatred. There is that old proverb that 'less is more' but honestly Jamie Foxx just didn't give enough.<br/><br/>Smaller roles: Props for Darby and the informant, they did great jobs. Overall if you're wondering if you should see this movie. All I can really say is, the movie is terrific but there is one scene that made me (a 16 year old boy who watches his fair share of messed up stuff) cringe a hell of a lot. Other than that, you should watch this movie<br/><br/>Now for the ending. If you don't want spoilers stop reading now. Also before all of this movie defense I would like to say that the ending was pretty poor and it didn't explain most of the details in how it occurred. It just happened.<br/><br/>I agree that the circumstances are pretty off, a genius like Clyde probably wouldn't leave the cart outside the door and he probably would have booby-trapped the tunnel. However people saying that the ending is bad for the movie may have missed the point. Clyde was trying to show Foxx two things: 1 - Don't deal with murderers 2 - The system does not encourage justice, it is merely treated like an assembly line.<br/><br/>The only way Foxx was able to defeat Clyde was by breaking his civil rights. Without doing that he would not have found the escape route. Part of the reason Clyde smiled at the end was because he had won. Foxx broke his ""god given"" civil rights in order to defeat a psychopathic serial killer."

Reminds me a bit of the Dirty Harry series. I agree with other reviewers who have criticized the ending.

And the ten years later stint is hilarious, as the only thing that has changed is Foxx's house, and he has a bit of a beard.<br/><br/>Butler is the star though here, usually playing the 'proper' good guy in other films, it's nice to see he has a little nasty side to him, regardless of how silly his hi-jinks are.<br/><br/>Cars blow up, people get shot, and you can more or less guess who will be the next to die by what they say prior to their death.<br/><br/>it's the kind of film you watch and enjoy immensely during the running time, but then after the film has finished, you wonder why you enjoyed it so much, and question the realism of the film and the probability of how much of the film is believable.<br/><br/>But it's a jolly good film, and not since Falling Down, have i rooted so much for the 'bad' guy.<br/><br/>Forgettable, but enjoyable."

","Law Abiding Citizen is directed by F. Gary Gray starring Jamie Fox, Gerard Butler, and Colm Meaney. Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) which is a military specialist who tries to corrupt the judicial system by murdering judges, lawyers, and police to prove his point of how he thinks the judicial system should be changed. Clyde Shelton who plays Gerard is a family man that witnesses the murder of his wife and child. As he goes to trial with the man who kills his family the judge lets him off with a light sentence.<br/><br/>Gerard's character is proving his point to society on how he perceives justice should be ran. Shelton is not out for revenge!!!! He also brings the importance of family to Rice and how it should not be taken for granted. In the last scene where Shelton was in his cell holding the bracelet his daughter made with flames surrounding him showed the passion he had for his family. He has no psychological problems at all he knows exactly what he is doing and why he is doing it he had ten years after the trial to plan every last detail. His character plays the protagonist in this film more than the antagonist. He is right about the law and how it is corrupt and an unjust system."

","This is F. Gary Gray's best movie to date.....in this genre anyway.....Friday is now a ""classic"" film. Law Abiding Citizen is about Clyde Shelton, a father/husband in a regular American family. During a break-in at Clyde's home, Clyde is gagged and bound as his wife and daughter are brutally murdered right in front of his eyes by ruthless drug addicts. Clyde somehow survives the attack, and, over the next 10 years, secretly devises a plan to get his own version of revenge.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is fantastic as ""Clyde"". This is his best work since ""300"". He really captures the anger and frustration this husband/father has with the justice system. There are no limits to his craftiness, his genius, or his anger. Very good acting job. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is average at best as Nick Rice, the District Attorney that Clyde feels is responsible for letting these guys off easy. Everything about this character is pretty cliché. The conscious-less attorney has to go through his own personal trauma(inflicted by Clyde) to understand Clyde's anger. Seen it before. <br/><br/>The ending. The ending isn't as bad as everyone says...It could have been better.... but it could have been worse, by the writer of Equillibrium, Kurt Wimmer. Don't let the ""bad"" ending stop you from watching Gerard Butler run amok on the Philadelphia police/legal system. <br/><br/>Some scenes in this movie remind me of Saw. Which is pretty surprising. It is a very dark move about revenge, justice, and most of all ANGER!! Kind of a passive/aggressive anger by a very menacing Gerard Butler character. I also love the score of the film... there isn't possibly a better song to play in the gruesome prison cell/stabbing scene than a brutal rendition of DEFTONES' ""engine no.9"". That scene is amazing, and there are a few other scenes that make you jump out of your seat. All in all this is a very good movie....because of the acting by Gerard Butler."

","Many movies require a suspension of disbelief. Law Abiding Citizen is no different but is not any more a stretch than other similar movies.<br/><br/>The lead actors are not great but not bad. Both actors offer subdued and restricted performances that are not overdone and do the trick to carry the film along without overpowering or detracting from the story. The main character played by Butler is one of the more interestingly written characters I have seen in a while and a plus for the film.<br/><br/>The films direction and style are also not overdone but still a better than average quality that also carries the movie along and does not attempt to be too artsy or showy.<br/><br/>Going in to the movie, I was pretty sure that this movie was going to be the same force fed drivel that Hollywood craps out all too often. I was pleasantly surprised that despite feeling like I have taken this similar trip before, I enjoyed the entire ride in Law Abiding Citizen.

","Clyde Shelton's (Butler) family was brutally murdered via a home invasion. Clyde blames Nick (Foxx), his lawyer, for making a deal that lets one suspect testify against the other in order to get a light sentence. Clyde has plans to show Nick you do not make deals with murderers. <br/><br/>And, those plans are spectacular. I was not ready for them. But, considering that Clyde gives himself up after killing the other suspect in his family murder, it was too early in the movie for this to be over. So I wanted to know more. I was hooked. Nick was fond of saying that it's not about justice, it's about what you can prove in court and Clyde took it all to heart. What a guy.<br/><br/>I am not that familiar with Gerard Butler except to have seen him in one ditzy chick flick so this intense drama showed me something more about him. And, it was all good. I expected him to go on a rage like a Mel Gibson character when someone does something bad to his family. But, this was not Clyde's plan. Hard to do anyway since he was locked up in jail. I would almost say this was a good cat and mouse story, but here it was all cat. Clyde's in jail and he's making demands. How good is that?<br/><br/>Very good thriller and the pace is perfect.

It's pretty smart and will have you question yourself all the time with stuff like ""what is his end game?"" or ""what is going to happen next?"". The other great thing is that it's hard to decide who the bad guy really is: do I feel for the guy who saw his family murdered and does what anyone else would by killing everyone or for the lawyer who isn't really a bad guy but is also responsible for this happening? Hard choice.<br/><br/>Hard choice? Yeah, it's a hard choice until about 4 minutes from the end of the movie, where it all goes to s h i t. Sorry, I don't have any other word for it.

"crazy-ben66","7","0","0","16 February 2010"," A great and original thriller, 'til the end.
","My review does contain spoilers, however, the concluding paragraph at the bottom does not. <br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is very much a film that begins very promisingly. A shocking scene involving the rape and murder of a man's wife and young daughter means that it becomes very emotionally uncomfortable early on, but this creates a path to sympathise with Gerard Butler's character Clyde Shelton. The majority of the movie is set 10 years after the incident, beginning with the execution of one of the criminals responsible. The other, possibly more involved assailant was set free 7 years earlier after making a deal with D.A Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx). This leaves Shelton to mourn over the loss of his family and the fact that justice has not been fully served, leading him to exact bloody revenge on 'the one that got away', which he is then arrested for, after admitting it on tape. <br/><br/>As the film moves on, past the half hour mark, we realise that Mr Shelton is out for much more than revenge. He wants D.A Rice to pay for what he did, and so, for the last 10 years, he has been putting together a master plan to trick and murder each member of the justice department for their wrongdoing in the case. His reign of terror begins with comical demands, such as a new bed for his cell, and a steak dinner with all the trimmings, in exchange for information as to where an attack will be carried out, or where certain lawyers are being hidden. <br/><br/>This is when the cracks in the story first begin to show. Up to this point, this movie has been a fresh kick up the backside for most other action/thrillers that follow the normal Good VS Evil scenario. When Shelton's demands stop, and the killing doesn't, his reign-of-terror- for-a-reason turns into a bloody rampage with absolutely no point or reason for doing so. Throw in a silly excuse for how Shelton can put together all these contraptions, then begins the race to stop Shelton from killing everybody, lead by one District Attorney with an attitude. Jamie Foxx suddenly turns into super lawyer and runs amok, attempting to uncover Shelton's true plans. <br/><br/>As the film comes to a close, the original and thought provoking tale is lost, and the ending is revealed as that of a uniform action flick, meaning the big actors and high budget are the only thing separating this from a straight to DVD Steven Segal movie. By solving everything in the space of 10 minutes, the blurry lines between good and evil are put into focus a lot more, resulting in Jamie Foxx rising out of the flames as the I-WIN-HERO and Gerard Butler's lovable psychopath Clyde Shelton as the DEAD-AND-BURIED-SUPER-VILLAIN, again meaning the movie loses its original roots. <br/><br/>The outstanding acting is to be praised however, with Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx playing off of Kurt Wimmer's script brilliantly. Butler putting in possibly the performance of his career so far. Although, the directing, by the rather in-experienced F. Gary Gray is passable and nothing special. <br/><br/>To conclude, Law Abiding Citizen is a refreshing and fast paced roller-coaster ride for about an hour, until the cracks begin to show and it ends, leaving us, the audience, feeling rather ripped off. I urge anyone who enjoys a clever action thriller to definitely give this a watch, although it may take a strong stomach to sit through some of the more violent scenes. It is worth it however, just try to avoid building up a love of all things different about the movie, as they will just as easily be snatched away from you in the dying minutes. <br/><br/>7/10"

","Despite a highly unbelievable plot and an anti-climactic finale, Law Abiding Citizen gets you hooked because it has a kick ass edge to it and a small does of cunning and irony to its story, in addition to two slick actors at the top of their game.<br/><br/>Clyde Shelton is an engineer and a family man living happily in Philidelphia. One night, his house is broken into, his wife is raped and his daughter killed. A mistake on the part of the justice system results in what Shelton considers to be an insufficient sentence for the two perps. He comes up with a plan to get back at both the killers and the prosecution who he feels didn't do their job. it is a plan ten years in the making, but there will be blood for sure.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen does a good job of building not so much suspense but rather energy. As the film builds, it keeps you going, but therein lies a problem as well. With each chapter, the plot gets more contrived and less believable. By the time we reach the climax, the story almost cracks under the weight of its own absurdity. Who would believe that one individual can outsmart an entire city's law enforcement. On top of this the ending has a dumb payoff.<br/><br/>The one element which maintains its strength is the duality of Fox and Butler. Their screen time together is solid. This is the film that Fracture could have been if it wasn't so confused in direction and more focused on the people. Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling are no match for these two. <br/><br/>All in all, Law Abiding Citizen is not an intelligent movie, and it is certainly not for the squeamish kind, but I enjoyed it."

Rice then sees the original error in his ways and begins his campaign of violence (or protest) to rectify the unbalanced scales of liberty. That said, the remote control .50 cal with the rocket launcher was awesome. But .50 cal is overkill against the automotive sheet metal of a Chevy Tahoe. As for Jonas surviving the onslaught - well that was preposterous. So much lead had been pumped into the vehicle - no one would have survived. Back to the production itself ... many tips of the hat in this film: for example the slow deliberate stabbing during the home invasion (hello Saving Private Ryan), the paralysis and chop up of the baddie (hello Dexter) to the elaborate deliberate vengeance of Clyde (hello Seven).

","If your expectation when going to see this movie is to meet a relative of Hannibal Lector, the calm and all knowing master, you will be somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is a concept that just begs to speak to the primal feeling of hatred within many of us towards the big bad government man. In this instance it is one angry mastermind whom we get to see take it out on the system. You could do much with this concept. You do need some intelligent complexity to tickle the viewer's brain throughout such a film, but the base for success is already there. Sadly, this one got messed up.<br/><br/>The story is has a few unpredictable turns, but unpredictable is not a good thing if the twists and turns do not lead to anything satisfying. The makers do not go through with the whole genius-criminal concept like, for example, in Silence of the Lambs or Saw. Neither do they go through with a brilliant-detective concept. The movie ends up being somewhere in the middle or nowhere at all and the ending ends up being a total letdown.<br/><br/>The talking doesn't make things any better. Most of the dialogue between the two main characters, the district attorney and the angry guy, could be taken away and it would make no difference whatsoever. The two are talking intensely, and you may for a while think that you do not understand whose point is more just and what that point is, but do not worry - if you're not understanding it's because there is no clear point, moral or other - just English words said in a thrilled tone and repeated at the next encounter. This is why, although the acting presented is solid, the characters are a little dead, and they make the story a little dead, which in turn makes the movie a little dead. I remember Hannibal Lector, I remember Norman Bates, but I already forgot the the name of the bad guy from this movie.<br/><br/>If the characters aren't particularly interesting then you tend to look for something else. So what else is there? This is a thriller with not many special effects, so the action is not the center piece. The thrills do work, even if due to the viewer's confusion rather than anything else. Also, one result of the shallow main characters is that the rest of the cast gets more spotlight, which they take gracefully.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is not bad - it's bi-curious. It doesn't quite know what it wants to be. In a way, that fact mixed with a healthy dose of violence keeps you closer to the edge of your chair. However, the expectation for a satisfying (or unsatisfying) release never gets justified – the pretty silver bowl is empty."

","To those who may think (and quite rightfully so) that the vendetta/ vigilante genre has been seen, done, that the t-shirt has been purchased and then thrown away: Law Abiding Citizen is still worth your while.<br/><br/>Though Gerard Butler appears so far to have taken on quite generic roles that don't really demand exceptional skills even if he does perform well in them (Dear Frankie, The Phantom of the Opera (a good voice was required here, and the Butler delivered), 300, and the like) he gives himself a slightly edgier challenge with Law Abiding Citizen.<br/><br/>Here he must be Clyde Shelton, someone that to all appearances is just a ""regular guy"" as he informs the judge at one point: an engineer/ tinkerer who holds a number of patents for some inventions. A man who loves his family - the love for his daughter is evident at the beginning, and will remain throughout.<br/><br/>Yet there is more to Shelton. This is where Law-Abiding Citizen sets itself apart from the recent Kevin Bacon, Jodie Foster (in my opinion abortive), et alii attempts.<br/><br/>The whole idea of the individual man taking on the regulation of justice, of what is good and wrong, of giving himself the power to dish out fatal punishment is thrown out of the window in this film. There is no room for doubt; even in the first instances of Shelton's revenge his reasoning cannot support the methods he employs and the ends he achieves, even if his overarching intelligence is astonishing. Nevertheless Butler still manages to garner our sympathy during the initial stages of the movie.<br/><br/>The script, acting, soundtrack, pace - everything is well selected and executed in Law-Abiding Citizen. Jamie Foxx, though it appears he was initially cast as Shelton, still pulled the egocentric lawyer through successfully.<br/><br/>Butler as Shelton is quite impressive. As we slowly gain more insight into his mind his undeniable insanity unfolds smoothly and eerily. It is the depth of his character that keeps the movie going. Bruce MgGill as the elder lawyer Cantrel advising Nick Rice (Foxx) is worthy of note, and Colm Meaney could have been put to more use as he is a superb actor. Finally, Leslie Bibb put on a surprisingly good performance.<br/><br/>If you enjoy thrillers with hard-hitting action added in the mix, this picture is for you. 7.5/10"

Bush could have used this so called director on his payroll. I was so disappointed. I will never watch another show by this so called director again. Even in The Kingdon Jamie Foxx brought the show to a halt. A dead fish is more stimulating than he is. F (failure) Gray Gray, now thats original name, blew it. Gerald Butler made the show.

","I would have given this movie a 9 had i not watched the last 15-20 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Movie started off by rushing through the incidents that took place that lead to the present. In away this was a good thing for me to have the sad boring stuff out of the way to make way for the good stuff.<br/><br/>I really liked the way the movie built up its plot. And was done in a way that the audience would really feel for the bad guy. So every time Clyde kills someone, you tend to feel somewhat satisfied.<br/><br/>However, towards the ending, all of a sudden the movie didn't look so smart as it started off. What seemed to be this brilliant plan that was plotted by a brilliant tactician over 10 years turned out to be something that was loosely put together and only got this far because he was lucky enough to not get caught. The whole brilliance of the movie was taken away in the end by revealing secrets which weren't that great, and poor direction at the end in hopes of making a dramatic effect.<br/><br/>However despite the poorly done disappointing 15 minutes in the end, the movie was good. it was entertaining. and was unpredictable. It keeps you at the edge of your seat. and you keep thinking 'oh man this guy is great!'. if you stop watching the movie from the point where nick tallies up the expenses, and leave the remaining for your imagination, you'd get a 10+ movie. But if you finish watching it, you will feel cheated!"

This is surely the message this film was trying to convey so it's ironic that in the end we dissolve back in to Hollywood fantasy.<br/><br/>This was so very nearly a great film unfortunately because of the ending good is about as a good as I can give it.<br/><br/>I'm hoping the directors cut sorts out the ending."

","All the internet chattering aside, LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is just what it sets out to be - a thriller that keeps the viewer involved in the mind games of a passionate man right up to the end (uh, well almost - except for the needlessly sugary revolting Hallmarky last few frames meant to clean up the mess the movie suggests...) Kurt Wimmer wrote this 'taking justice into our own hands' story with a good deal of imagination and gadgetry and F. Gary Gary keeps the momentum of the story going along at a breakneck pace. Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) opens his home door to face two thugs who beat and kill his wife and daughter and injure him substantially. Shelton seeks a good lawyer and finds himself in the hands of smarty guy Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who sets the film in motion by accepting a plea bargain on behalf of the killers - one will be sent to prison with the death penalty and the other just gets a little time. Shelton is distraught at this abuse of the justice game. Jump forward 10 years and the one killer has a botched heinous execution while the other, now free, is is laughtered hideously - both by Shelton. There is a plan in Shelton's head to destroy everyone who allowed justice to misfire and the rest of the film is how the genius mind of Shelton (jailed after his slaughter of the killer) manages to wipe out everyone involved in the court system that instigated the terror.<br/><br/>Butler and Foxx make a good sparring pair and there are some excellent cameos by Colm Meany, Viola Davis, Bruce McGill et al. Yes, this is a violent film, and not for the squeamish, but it does make us look at the judicial system with different eyes. If only the director hadn't glopped on the sloppy goodie-two-shoes happy-wappy scene that ends the film and feels like a purging cathartic....<br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"BronzeKeilani26","9","3","8","12 November 2009"," Unique thriller, great ending!
","In this strong, twisting court room crime drama thriller a man becomes angry because his family was murdered and they received no justice in the courtroom. We all know in real life, justice doesn't always come by way of the court room...so now the plot thickens. I loved this movie because it also had a message in it. Our justice system is very flawed and half the time prosecutors don't have faith in themselves or have more cases than they can handle and simply plea bargain with bad guys. This is the best I've seen Gerard Butler do since 300. He fares better in serious roles instead of comedy. Jamie Foxx wasn't his usual self but I give him a B for effort. All in all the movie had some great twists and mind blowing ideas to make it exciting!"
"dtucker86","Null","3","8","16 October 2009"," a very bad move for Jamie Foxx
","I went to this film really wanting to like it. I thought it would be a sort of ""Death Wish"" remake. Charles Bronson's character lost his family like Gerard Butler's character did, but he only killed criminals. Even though Butler's character suffered a terrible loss, you cannot feel sorry for him because he killed innocent people and in the end was no better then the men who murdered his wife and daughter. Jamie Foxx is a fine actor and I lauded his performance in The Soloist earlier this year, but he should have passed on this film. This movie seems to have a preoccupation with graphic violence. SPOILER Alert, that scene with the Judge and the cell phone and where Foxx's lovely assistant gets cooked in her car were very disturbing and one of the reasons that I did not like this film. The only good thing about Law Abiding Citizen is that it does raise serious questions about our legal system and how justice often fails."
"zardoz-13","10","3","9","26 October 2009"," One Hellva Great Law & Order Thriller!!!
","""Set It Up"" director F. Gary Gray's sophisticated but far-fetched law and order actioneer ""Law Abiding Citizen"" ranks as the one of best mediations about our flawed justice system in the guise of a cracker-jack popcorn thriller. Good movies pack twists and turns as well as surprises, and ""Street Kings"" scenarist Kurt Wimmer serves up at least five (count'em) surprises in this high-octane hybrid of prison pictures and mass murderer epics. Moreover, Wimmer has created an imaginative cat & mouse conflict of wills between a stalwart hero and an ingenious villain who share shades of gray. In other words, Jamie Foxx's prosecutor appears callous, while Gerard Butler's villain retains some sympathy. You may find yourself rooting for bad-guy Butler over good-guy Foxx. Meanwhile, Gray stages the white-knuckled action with finesse to spare. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" surpasses Gray's earlier nail-biters ""The Italian Job,"" ""The Negotiator"" and ""A Man Apart."" Not only does Gerard Butler constantly upstage a dour Jamie Foxx, but Butler delivers the heartest performance. He comes close to chewing the scenery, but the villain that he plays would chew scenery so his juicy performance isn't too far off base.<br/><br/>""Law-Abiding Citizen"" opens with two desperate criminals, Clarence Darby (Christian Stotle of ""Public Enemies"") and Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart of ""The Collector""), invading a house in suburban Philadelphia. The two are posing as food delivery guys; at least, Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler of ""The Ugly Truth"") opens the door for them because he mistakenly believes they are in food delivery. Before he has time to react, they smash him savagely with a baseball bat, knock him down, and then gag and tie him with plastic zip-ties. A helpless Clyde watches in horror as Clarence stabs his wife (Brook Stacy Mills of ""Hairspray"")and is about to rape her when Clyde's daughter (newcomer Ksenia Hulayev) enters the room. The thugs abduct the daughter and the next thing we hear is that the little girl has been murdered, too. Since he cannot assemble enough evidence to convict these hoodlums, career-oriented Assistant Prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx of ""The Soloist"") decides to preserve his winning record of prosecutions and cuts a deal with Clarence. To get a lighter sentence, the dastardly Clarence testifies that Rupert killed Clyde's wife.<br/><br/>Initially, when he hears about the plea bargain, Clyde is shocked. He saw his family butchered and he hasn't forgotten the murders. Rice points out two things. First, Clarence is going to jail for a long time. Second, Rupert has been sentenced to death by lethal injection based on Clarence testimony. Reluctantly, Clyde trusts Rice to do the right thing, but he has vengeance lurking in his mind. Grief-stricken, Clyde cannot help but feel that justice has been denied him. When it comes time to execute Rupert, he dies in the worse way possible and creates a sensation for Nick and his co-worker, Sarah Lowell (Leslie Bibb of ""Iron Man""), who has never attended an execution. Ten years elapse and Clarence gets out of jail, but not for long. Clyde kidnaps him, takes him to an anonymous warehouse and breaks out some of the props that would go with a ""Saw."" Clyde sends Rice a DVD copy of Clarence's murder, but Clyde cannot be identified in the video because he has on a welder's mask. Things come to a boil when the video arrives at Rice's house and his daughter gets her hands on it. She thinks that it is a video shot of her at a musical recital.<br/><br/>Clyde is waiting when the police arrive, and they take him into custody. Rice appreciates Clyde's vengeance because he has a daughter, too. Afterward, when Rice sets out to prosecute him, Clyde wants to make a deal. What Rice doesn't know is that Clyde is manipulating him. Eventually, Clyde winds up in solitary confinement, locked up and away from everybody. Rice thinks that everything is cool because Clyde is where he can harm nobody. No sooner is Clyde in solitary than he goes to work. He warns Rice that he will kill, too, unless they release him. Rice is incredulous when public officials who had something to do with the Shelton murder case begin to mysteriously die in front page murders. The mayor of Philadelphia (Viola Davis of ""Doubt"") demands that Rice take action against Shelton, but Rice can find nothing. After all, Clyde is locked up tight in a maximum security cell with no way to get out of prison.<br/><br/>This thought-provoking morality yarn never wears out its welcome during its nimble 108 minutes. Mind you, the only flaw in the film is its outlandish quality. Nevertheless, the theme that everybody must be held accountable for their actions is played out to perfection by the filmmakers. The first-class supporting class includes Colm Meaney of TV's ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" as a Philly detective, Bruce McGill of ""Obsessed"" as Rice's colleague and Annie Corley of ""Monster"" as a Philadelphia judge. What you don't catch the first time out in this complex crime movies adds to the entertainment of second and third viewings. Make no mistake, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" earned its R-rating for strong bloody brutal violence and torture, a scene of rape, and pervasive language. Although its contains some pretty graphic murder sequences, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is nowhere near as sadistic or repellent as the latest ""Saw"" movie ""Saw VI."""

It's when the actual killers of Clyde's wife and daughter-Clarence Darby-decided to turn evidence again his innocent, in not murdering the two, partner Ames that he's given a five year sentence with Ames getting the death penalty. This has Clyde blow a fuse and take out his anger and later vengeance not only on his and his families attackers and murderers but the US Jusitice Department as well! Feeling that the assistant Philadelphia D.A Nick Rice, Jamie Foxx, fell down on the job in letting Darby get get off with a light sentence Clyde spends the next ten years planning to not only murder both Darby as well as Ames, who's in fact to be executed, but Rice and his fellow members in the city's D.A and Police Departments!<br/><br/>As we, and D.A Rice, soon find out Clyde is not only crazy but an electronic genius as well as master escape artist! Clyde uses those talents to not only murder, in the most gruesome ways possible, Darby but Ames as well. This when Ames was in the process of being put to death, via lethal injection, by the state! It wasn't enough that Ames was to be put to death but Clyde had to make sure that he suffers the worst kind of death by secretly switching the more or less merciful drugs that were to kill Ames, who had nothing to do with the murder of Cyde's wife & daughter, with a concoction that had him have his veins pop out and blood vessels burst to the point where most of those witnessing his execution had to run from the death chamber before they passed out from fright!<br/><br/>By far Clyde's most deadly attacks were saved for those in the Philadelphia Justice System murdering some dozen assistant D.A 's judges and even Darby's lawyer in his war against those who helped get Darby off on a plea bargain! Not attempting to avoid arrest Clyde in fact got himself arrested in order to be put in the hole, solitary confinement, after murdering his cell-mate with a-I kid you not- leftover T-bone stake! It's from his jail cell that Clyde secretly conducted his one man war against the Philadelphia Justice Department with no one, in and out of the prison, having any idea how he was doing it!<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT**** Clyde's bizarre as well as murderous actions didn't win anyone in the audience over to him. In fact you felt far more sympathetic towards the two thugs, Darby & Ames, who started Clyde on this murderous rampage then towards Clyde himself in his total disregard for human life which was far worse then what his family's killers did. When we finally find out just how this criminal mastermind-Clyde Shelton-was able to pull all these murders off, while behind bars, you realized that it wasn't that he was so smart but that those in the D.A's office, including D.A Nick Rice, as well as the police and prison administrators were so damn stupid! In them not being able to figure out, which should have been very obvious to them right from the start, just how Clyde was actually doing it! <br/><br/>The film's mindless and confusing ending was the cherry on top of the cake for this turkey of a movie with Rice finally figuring out how Clyde was able to pull his evil plan off in part with him bing influenced by the writings of 19th Century German military genius and philosopher Von Clausewitz. Something that would have Von Clausewitz in him being even remotely connected to an insane and whacked person like Clyde turn, or better yet spin, in his grave!"

But the rest of the movie, was incredible. Clearly, if you read the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and here, there are some people who just don't get the movie. That's okay. They don't need to. They are probably either mad because the movie had a few faults and therefore hate the whole thing, or mad because the movie's message was too controversial. Either way, it doesn't matter.

","In a world of films that are either too brutal or too special effects laden, it is nice to see a film like Law Abiding Citizen. It is not too brutal, and is only brutal in some parts, and that brutality works. The film starts out with two dangerous men with baseball bats breaking into a nice family's house and killing Clyde (Gerald Butler)'s family. Fast forward, and one of the men is out of jail, and Clyde is more than aware of that. After the trauma that Clyde experienced, he decides to kill the one who is set free. He tells his story to Nick (Jamie Foxx), a man who formally refused to do anything about the short sentence one of the brutal men got. Now Clyde is in prison, and is killing all the people who had to do with his arrest because he finds it unfair that he gets put away longer than one of the men who killed his family. The film all builds to a great climax, and it never skips a beat. From the first second to the last, Law Abiding Citizen is a very good and very tense action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the acting is fantastic, too. I definitely urge you to see Law Abding Citizen ASAP."

It takes ten long years of planning for Clyde to bring his plan to fruition. But after he has killed both men who murdered his family, and tells Nick he has only just begun, doubts begins to form in Nicks bosses mind, and his assistant attorneys,Sarah Lowell. She says to him in a key scene ""I'd like to know it was for more than just the conviction rate. I like to feel some of it was for justice."" The slow dawning on Nick that maybe, just maybe, there is something more important than his career and that is what Clyde is showing him with all the mayhem. Foxx shows with very subtle expressions that he does get it and by the end in the cell with Clyde, both men are resigned to what will come. Nick leaves, and lets the fire bomb go off and Clyde, resignation and weariness on his face, awaits the holocaust.<br/><br/>Terrific film with two fine performances. The scene of the first killing by Clyde is gruesome but Butler and Gray subtly show the madness that ten years of waiting for justice has brought this man. Each step of his plan to kill those responsible for the injustice done to him and his family shows his brilliance, but also his descent to the dark side. Butler is spot on in the courtroom scene where he tells off the judge who went along with Nicks plea bargain and let the killer off with a 5 year sentence. Clyde's 10 years of plotting and planning, and reading the law, makes for a riveting scene and dialog.<br/><br/>The scenes of gritty warehouse areas in the gray dawn, or at night, bring to mind the great black and white films of the past. F. Gary Gray and his cinematographer have captured the film noir quality of light and dark, wet pavements, the shadowy faces, the bleak factory/warehouse areas, and the cold, physical and emotional, of the great 'classics' like ""Kiss Of Death"" or ""White Heat."" I score it a 9/10"

","LAW ABIDING CITIZEN (2009) **1/2 Jamie Foxx, Gerard Butler, Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill, Leslie Bib, Michael Irby, Gregory Itzin, Regina Hall, Viola Davis, Richard Portnow. Over-the-top guilty pleasure-inducing vengeance thriller with Butler out for some justifiable payback for the monstrously brutal murders of his family (ok, a decade later, but stick with it) and playing cat-and-mouse with stubborn ADA Foxx as he scrambles to figure out how he is doing it from behind bars! Echoes of DEATH WISH, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SAW for its 'torture porn' methods, the film finally runs on fumes in the final act (if you can't guess by then how Butler is doing what he is doing maybe film going isn't for you?) but credit Kurt Wimmer's sly screenplay and some nifty bang/boom/shudder set pieces by director F.Gary Gray keeps things chugging along before derailing into eye-rolling incredulity."
"bobbysoasis","7","2","5","25 October 2009"," Great & Gory Start....Fast Body....Unlikely Ending ""TimeWise""
","Jamie Foxx seemed ""removed"" from REALLY GIVING-IT-ALL but Gerald Butler was a very pleasant surprise. The start was quick to the point...it set the stage in brutal fashion and almost made you comfortable with the first GORY vengeance sequence. From there, the series of ""complicit"" kills were interesting but weakly filmed/presented...sort of ""B"" movie quality. The supporting cast was uninspired...no up-and-comers here! The biggest letdown was the ending...""how-the-heck"" did Jamie and his crew manage to get back to the prison with the bomb and plant it in the solitary confinement cell ahead of Clyde?...how was someone as smart as Clyde unaware people had found his ""lair""?...and how many other inmates in solitary would have died in the devastating blast?"
"dbborroughs","7","2","5","25 October 2009"," If you except this operates in its own little world you'll have a good time
","Gerard Butler stars as a man who's wife and daughter are killed by home invaders. He survives the attack, but when its time to go to trial, the self centered prosecutor, Jamie Foxx, decides that a trial isn't in the best interest of the case and pleas it out with the result that the real monster of the invaders essentially walks. Butler then conspires to get revenge not only on the invaders but everyone in the system that allowed justice not to be served.<br/><br/>Taking it on its own terms, this is a film that operates in its own twisted little world, this is a very good revenge thriller. What sets the film apart from every other Death Wish style thriller is Butler is under arrest at the time the really big fireworks take place. The fact that he is alone in his cell is what frustrates everyone in the film and makes for exciting viewing for the audience.<br/><br/>Lets be real, this isn't a great film. It is a very good one. The problem with the film is its operating in its own world where things happen because they are dramatically exciting rather then they make sense dramatically or even make the film remotely real world like. The more you think about the film the more problems you will find. (I also find the ending seems to have come in from another movie, but by the time it happens I had given up any hope of logic and reason.) I like the film. Its a good mindless popcorn film. Unlikely to win any awards I do think this will end up in semi heavy rotation on cable, at least for a while."
"honorhorror","8","2","5","24 October 2009"," Culture shock series: Law Abiding citizen.
","Before I go into the review, allow me to give you some facts about this movie on the other side of the earth. Firstly, it was among the highest ranking movies on popular Sino movie site Xunlei, with an incredible 9.8/10. Secondly, most Sino viewers actually think Clyde Shelton stands for goodness in this movie. Some of them even thought that he's the noblest martyr of his kind. Thirdly, the favorite scene considered by them and me was this one. The female judge was having an emergency meeting with lawyers Nick Rice and Jonas. When she got a phone call on her cell phone, the lawyers were startled by the fact that she's violating the law about no cell phones in the courthouse. She commented casually that the point of being a judge is she can do pretty much whatever she wants. The moment she picked up the call and put the phone to her ear, the phone exploded, and the tiny bomb blew her head open, killing her. Instantly, I burst into applause because it's too satisfying to see an injustice justice being punished by someone in the prison.<br/><br/>Does this kind of judge exist in practice? I am afraid most of you would say, ""Definitely"". OK, do good judges exist then? Honestly, I am not sure. I don't have any hard evidence about any judges' compass, be them pointing north-north, or north-northwest. But, after I saw Clyde Shelton's story, I guess bad judges do exist, so do madmen like Shelton. My question now becomes, do badness and madness have bounds on the screen, or do I enjoy this madness and on screen bad deeds each time they go a bit crazier? My answer is a reluctant yes, thus I admitted my sins watching movies. The point is I now know there's a need, a call deep from my soul that it's better to stop enjoying such a movie experience. The moment Clyde Shelton claimed he's a ""Law Abiding Citizen"", this term along with its original meaning in the USA constitution corrupted, since anyone who has seen this movie would unconsciously avoid using ""law abiding citizen"" by expressing his respected citizenship. Of course, there are exceptions, especially we Sino people who have come to believe there was no ultimate good in the first place, and everything including the law is all relative depending on which social class you're in. While the Americans may be able to tell there are good judges and there are still goodness in the juristic system, we Sino people can't. That's because we Sino people don't believe so even before we see the movie.<br/><br/>Even the American audiences can have some thrills watching it, actually. I've read on IMDb that a lot of people do think US jurisdiction system is faintly ill, which provided the hard facts as the justification of Shelton's rage. If one's rage can be justified, rationalized, then the next thing in line you need to nod to will be madness. Shelton wanted to see good in law, but actually he stocked more in revenge. His life was tore apart, yet he didn't know anything to seek beyond the law. If such a dramatic, tragic development of character is an art house rule, then Law Abiding Citizen the movie should be called a testimony for Split personality. I don't have a story in my life which is sadder than Shelton's, but if there's a chance I could talk to him, I'd say law cannot enforce itself. And, it's not a great discovery made by me or Columbus. It's just written in an old, ignored book, the Bible.<br/><br/>Actually, I don't plan to persuade any Shelton to abandon his revenge and self-induced justice, neither does the Bible. See, laws are for humans to know their sins, not for them to capture any goodness. In fact, there's nothing humans can wield to capture the goodness. The law, the education, the marriage can all be inspiring goodness if one's soul still have some brightness. On the contrast, the law, the education and the marriage can also be ongoing disasters if one has decided to eliminate that remaining brightness in his soul. OK, the fact about humans is that the brightness in souls are always dying, so the only way to be redeemed from that direction is to repent and turn to Jesus Christ, who in the Bible, provided he has come not to abolish the law, on the contrast, he has come to fulfill the law with his love and spirit.<br/><br/>Movies like Law Abiding Citizen didn't happen in the real world, but oops, that's only a half-truth. Mayhem on the screen was pushed to their most degraded, horrifying way, which more or less leaves a mark on audiences' souls. In the first place, it didn't happen physically, but then those who think they have immunity as a reasonable adult would find they will need to see something crazier to be satisfied next time. The not-so-convincing ending ensured the movie to be politically right, but still, comparing to the point the movie made with its disturbing illustration, such a political rightness is only a lie. You would think the Bible asked too much from you by calling you to reflect and repent, but compared to Law Abiding Citizen which urged you to question laws, moralities and goodness to the end, the Bible's much more forgiving."

","I watched this movie with very little expectation, i guess i just wanted to watch a movie that i think is good because of the actors in it but i came out wanting to watch it again. The plot thickens as the movie goes on, it keeps you bolted on your seat and waiting for the next scene. The movie really brought out Gerard's superb acting, don't get me wrong...Fox is a very good actor but i left the movie only remembering all the scene by Gerard...really really good or maybe its just the character. It's been a while since i watched a movie with twist and turns on every phase (this is my favorite genre by the way so i might be bias) but this movie ended a long drought."
"alienworlds","Null","2","5","20 October 2009"," A Challenging Film on many levels
","An excellent and complex film that manages to explore the idea that justice can be a double edged sword. A rarity in that sense also, since it presents but doesn't judge, allowing the audience to make their own conclusions rather than championing one side or the other. Clever. Subtle yet action orientated. It got to the point that I was not sure who I was really rooting for myself, after seeing the mincing that was going on behind closed doors regarding what to do and who to do it to and if they could get away with it all. Fascinating take on the modern justice system quite unlike the black and white renderings of same that appear on television on half a dozen syndicated crime shows. I could see it again."
"mr-wy1994","9","2","5","18 October 2009"," Wow
","If you didn't see The Dark Knight,(or saw TDk and didn't quite get the message), You need to see this movie. Gerard Butler plays a great bad guy, I can definitely see a future for him as far as playing bad guys. Jamie Foxx played his role with progression, he really showed that he got smarter throughout the movie. The rest of the cast did a great job as well. The plot was very well put together, although there were some confusing snippets at the end of the film. Gerard really does however put most of the movie on his shoulders, he does also tend to act as the Joker did in TDK,(without on Oscar win. Sorry Butler fans). Overall if your looking for compelling drama, great suspense, and Performances that will blow you away, this is the movie for you."
"therpgeek","10","2","5","17 October 2009"," An Amazing Movie Throughout
","The focus in ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is on one Clyde Shelton. In the beginning of the movie, he watches his wife and daughter die at the hands of a pair of textbook thugs. Gerard Butler flawlessly executes a role that will keep you guessing through over an hour and a half of well thought out killings, tauntings and flauntings. There is the occasional predictable death after an incredibly snide remark or one character's brash overconfidence; you'll see it coming a mile away. However, the story is fantastic and by the end of it you'll find yourself rooting for Clyde, who is supposed to be the bad guy. Jamie Foxx plays a District Attorney who is, of course, your standard movie attorney. The system is perfect, we do what we have to do, push your morals aside, so on and so forth. The movie centers around Clyde who, ten years after his family's death, embarks on a well-planned mission to bring the system down in a way that he only describes as ""biblical."" This is an enjoyable thriller and it's well worth the money."
"bradcar77","6","4","16","13 October 2009"," Squandered potential
","I too caught an advance screening, and honestly, I only went since it was free. The trailer didn't really entice me and I'm not a big fan of Jamie Foxx. Having lowered expectations was probably a good thing in that it was better than I thought, while still not a good film.<br/><br/>The most disappointing aspect about it to me is that you could see the good idea in there waiting to get out, but that good idea is muddled by poor writing and direction... while the deaths are staged as thrills or shocks, they are each so heavily foreshadowed or so clichéd that it lacks any genuine excitement. You see everything coming about 5 minutes before the characters themselves do. There are a couple of twists and turns that aren't entirely obvious, but based on the premise, it could have been so much more."

","Lame, contrived and implausible. Vigilante movies are squarely aimed at the lowest common denominator, and this is certainly no different. Exception here is that instead of a straight find 'em-and-kill 'em story, the plot gets more and more unnecessarily convoluted and bizarre the further you go on. Eventually the plot twists get predictable, and tedious.<br/><br/>The other problem is that in the end it is the justice system that is painted to be the problem, not the misguided villain. You are normally meant to sympathise with and support the vigilante, here, no matter what brought him to this situation, he is beyond sympathy.<br/><br/>Dead giveaway that this is a pile of excrement is the presence of Gerard Butler. He is a one-dimensional action actor and can't do an American accent.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is better than this, as his Oscar win and another nomination attest to. His choice in movies needs to be better though. Despite his clear acting talent, he is fairly unconvincing, and even irritating, here.<br/><br/>Good supporting cast - Colm Meaney, Bruce McGill, Leslie Bibb - are wasted.<br/><br/>Only plusses are that it has a fair degree of intrigue, the action sequences are well done, and the movie is reasonably short."

","Law Abiding Citizen<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is the pinnacle of revenge movies. Tapping into and exploiting the fears of a perceived broken Criminal Justice system, Law Abiding Citizen follows a man who snapped and plots against criminals, judges, defense attorneys and anyone else who he perceives to be part of a system where prosecutors must make deals with violent felons who commit the most heinous of crimes, at the expense of victim justice.<br/><br/>The movie is a cat and mouse thriller between Philadelphia prosecutor, Nick Rice, played by Jaimie Foxx and Clyde Sheldon, played by Gerard Butler, as Foxx remains one step behind Butler as Butler goes about taking out his revenge on people in the criminal justice system.<br/><br/>Butler can be characterized as the judicial systems worst nightmare as his wife and child were cruelly killed, his actions can be rationalized by any victim who believes the system is corrupt and needs to be brought down.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is a fun and entertaining movie to watch, but Butler's skill set for carrying out his executions goes beyond plausible despite being posited as an engineering genius. The list of feats that Butler is able to pull off include hacking into computer system to botch an execution, rig a gun to sedate his victim, surveillance of people from a distance, buy real estate through foreign transactions, defend himself in court, explode a cell phone to kill a judge, dig tunnels and coordinate bombings and shootings by remote control. You may as well add leap tall buildings in a single bound. Clyde Sheldon is Paul Kersey (Death Wish) on steroids.<br/><br/>In the end, as much as the viewer can sympathize with Butler's pain, the lesson is that retribution and vengeance is best left for the lord, and that no one can take the law into their own hands, not even those who are severely victimized.<br/><br/>Movies such as these are cathartic, they help us release our anger and frustration and allow us to check our immediate urges and move on. With just the right composition of theatrical elements, Law Abiding Citizen gets a high grade in the good Popcorn flick category, but not much more."

","There is only one thing you need to know before watching 'Law Abiding Citizen' and that is: how much can you suspend your disbelief? If the answer is, 'Not a lot - I like my films realistic,' then don't bother watching this. However, if you can overlook one plot hole after the next and just gloss over the numerous coincidences which need to occur simply to move the plot forward, then you'll probably enjoy this.<br/><br/>Luckily - for me - I simply allowed myself to get swept along in what is quite a novel and fast-paced story where 'everyman' Gerard Butler's family gets killed, but the killers cannot be prosecuted, thanks somewhat to lawyer Jamie Foxx. Therefore, ten years later, Butler decides to invoke his own style of justice.<br/><br/>What follows is one pretty clever and gruesome way of killing someone after the next. You'll find yourself both sympathising and hating Butler's character, while Foxx isn't to be outdone on the acting stakes, as he comes across as both slick and vulnerable all at the same time.<br/><br/>Basically, if you like your action/revenge/thrillers loud, dumb and full of loop-holes, then you'll like this. If you're expecting absolute realism then you'll hate it."

","I was really impressed with Gerard Butler never heard of him before this film, he did a great job. Jamie Foxx was great in the supporting role. reminiscent of Death Wish in the early 70's our protagonist sees his wife and daughter brutally raped and killed.. the killer after 3 years is set free. well this doesn't sit well with our main character so he decides first that the killer must pay. after that he systematically goes after the judge, the D.A. and anyone else who had something to do with the extreme miscarriage of justice,, this film goes deep into one's mind, I imagine our main character's mind had snapped and he felt that he had no choice in the matter but to eliminate everyone involved with the vicious and heinous crime, I m sure if someone had did that to my wife and step daughter at the time I would have done the exact same thing."

But, then, how was it ever going to end anyway? The protagonist could either have met his death or he'd have been sentenced to multiple, consecutive life sentences. He was never going to be released, that's for sure. So, given those choices, the first wasn't such a bad one.<br/><br/>More disappointing is that the protagonist is turned into the ""bad guy"" toward the end, even though I personally didn't buy it. He may have gotten a bit carried away with his attempt to blow up the mayoral conference, but I'd say his heart was in the right place.<br/><br/>In any event, the movie, including the finale, got us all talking.

"basilisksamuk","7","1","2","20 May 2012"," Absolutely logical so long as you don't expect everyday logic
","If it was from the Marvel stable then everyone would get it. This is a comic book movie from beginning to end. It makes no sense whatsoever to treat this as a believable story that follows the logic of everyday life. Nor is it reasonable to expect a resolution that does anything more than come to an end with a big bang and an easy resolution.<br/><br/>But why is everyone griping about the ending? It makes complete sense in the comic book mentality of such things. If you want to see a message or meaning then the whole thing does make logical sense from beginning to end. You can see the killings coming from miles away when it gets going – the phone, the exploding cars etc. but the logic of the piece is that Butler is trying to teach Foxx a lesson, not that he is getting revenge (something he explicitly denies in the film). Foxx's character only learns the lesson in the last few minutes of the film and does the only thing it makes sense to do. Of course there's no moral lesson about the wrongs of killing to achieve justice – Butler is the superhero character, Foxx is the villain but in the end it's more important that he comes around to Butler's viewpoint than it is adhere to his villainous principles.<br/><br/>Having said all that though I do agree that the recital scene at the end should have terminated in a loud and bloody explosion – now that would still have made sense and given closure to all those who thought the ending let it down."

","Almost every other review of this that I have seen has said that the ending lets the rest of it down...and I'm only going to agree with them.<br/><br/>It's not the most realistic film in the world but if you can suspend your belief system and put up with it for a couple of hours then I think its mainly a perfectly enjoyable film. Quick overview; Man sees his wife and young daughter raped and killed by 2 men and then a corrupt, thoughtless and, frankly, snivelling assistant district attorney lets one of the murderers all but get off with the crime at court just so he can further his own career and of course the rest of the legal system goes along with it. So the Father decides to do something about it using some special skills he has picked up along the way. You cant tell me that you wouldn't at least like to to do something similar in the same circumstances.<br/><br/>The majority of the film is clever, well thought out and different from what I have seen before but then in the last ten minutes you know what is going to happen and it doesn't quite manage to spoil the whole film, but very nearly.<br/><br/>Hollywood seems to think that every film has to end the same way, maybe they think that that is how the audience wants all films to end, with the supposed 'bad guy' losing. Well, I'm telling them now: WE DON'T!"
"Yarayaraman","5","1","2","10 March 2012"," So much potential... wasted
","This film throws you in at the deep end, dealing with some very brutal and unpleasant themes, without prolonging them. In fact, it moves so quickly at times you wonder if it has peaked too early, but it maintains it's grip and intensity. There are weak points, but the film is a revenge movie, so it's about the twists, turns and the action, not Oscar worthy performances.<br/><br/>The ending of any film is always the subject of debate, but if I am honest, for this kind of movie it is far less important. While it is dealing with a serious core subject, the style and execution ensures you never feel like it is trying to make a genuinely serious point about morality or right and wrong, rather using these themes as tools to carry the story and the action, which is fine. Unfortunately, the last quarter of this movie is so trite, so ill conceived, and so utterly ridiculous that for me, it does spoil the movie. I cannot recommend this film, but if you can live with the impeding deceit and insult to your intelligence that will inevitably arrive, then it is an engaging and at times quite original take on the revenge genre."

","Expectations are everything. I went into the movie (shown on Channel 4 this week) expecting gratuitous, ""Saw""-levels of gore and a shockingly bad ending. Instead, I found the violence to be fairly restrained (mainly taking place off-screen) and the ending not nearly as bad as everyone makes out.<br/><br/>It runs as an interesting concept-thriller where the main character is clearly in control every step of the way. Clyde is a lot like Michael Scofield in ""Prison Break"". He's in there because he chose to be there and every little event takes place for a reason.<br/><br/>It also explores themes around the sensibility of the law quite nicely, such as the scene around Clyde's application for bail.<br/><br/>However, here's a fundamental problem with LAC, namely that there's no clear hero. Obviously, the audience is supposed to side with Clyde, at least initially. His wife and daughter have been horribly slaughtered and the real killer receives a minimal sentence. Clyde wants justice and he gets it, exacting torturous revenge on the murderer. Now it's fair to say that Clyde seems fairly demented at this point, despite his careful strategic planning. But then his crusade for justice goes further afield, and it's here that our sympathy starts to wear thin. Are we to continue supporting his murderous campaign against the justice system? Or are our affections now supposed to shift to ADA Nick and his band of legal beagles? A much more interesting story would have been one in which Clyde saw justice triumph through a clever manipulation of the system itself. If that sort of thing appeals to you, go see ""Fracture"".

","~ Very unique, clever story plots that kept me tightly on my seat waiting to see what's going to happen next. A man who is courageous and intelligent in details sought justice for the murder of his family after the justice system has failed him. The ending is just as sad as the very unfortunate murder event from the start, even though the ""moral of the story"" is to advise or warn that one cannot take laws into one's own hand... Loved the movie; wished it could have had a better ending (and a superior acting co-star, say Denzel Washington or even Cuba Gooding Jr.)... It is a great movie worth watching; I've watched it twice and still love it – just be prepared that the ending may not meet your expectation. I wanted to rate it an 8 for the storyline, but I am rating it a 9 because of Gerard Butler's outstanding performance!"
"ajs-10","5","1","2","22 April 2011"," Who's the good guy here?
","The ending of this was slightly spoilt by overhearing the closing moments during one of many conversations about films in my local pub. Fortunately, the discussion didn't involve exactly how this conclusion was reached and so the film wasn't a total loss. An interesting film which raises several questions about justice, but one that also has its flaws. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please prosecute that murderer, and do it right this time, while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>After seeing his wife and daughter murdered in front of him, Clyde Shelton is justifiably aggrieved at the justice system. One of the assailants, Clarence Darby, agrees to give evidence against his accomplice for a reduced sentence. Darby is the one responsible for the murders and Shelton believes he's the one that should pay the heaviest price. When, subsequently, Darby is found brutally murdered, Shelton is arrested. The prosecutor, Nick Rice, stands by the original action against Darby, believing it was the only way he could have obtained a conviction. Shelton sees it differently and has his own brand of justice in mind, not just against the perpetrators of the crime against his family, but against the whole justice system. I'll leave my summary here so as not to vex Shelton or indeed the Spoiler Police.<br/><br/>Decent performances all round, although I feel nobody was really stretched. Gerard Butler was brooding as Clyde Shelton; Jamie Foxx was stylish and sometimes angry as Nick Rice. Nice to see Colm Meaney as Detective Dunnigan and Bruce McGill as the DA, Jonas Cantrell. An honourable mention also goes to Leslie Bibb as Sarah Lowell.<br/><br/>This film gave me a bit of a dilemma; I couldn't decide quite who the good guy was. On one hand there's Shelton whose life has been turned upside down and who you can easily sympathise with at the beginning of the film. The trouble is, when his retribution starts to go a little too far, you're left with Rice to root for. The trouble with Rice is that it was his ambition to get one more easy conviction that caused all of what followed. I'm still on the fence with this one I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is well made with some great shots of Philadelphia and some nice action sequences. I liked the sound mix on the DVD, it's nice when they bother to utilise all of the 5.1 Dolby speakers. Although the film isn't great, it just has enough to keep the audience occupied (if only trying to figure out who the good guy is). I might watch it again, but it would have to be in a while, when I need reminding that Gerard Butler doesn't just do really poor comedies Not really recommended, but if you feel compelled, go for it.<br/><br/>My Score: 5.4/10"
"jotix100","6","1","2","27 January 2011"," An justice for all
","Certain films defy logic, something that in many instances, the viewer does not mind, as long as the story makes some sense. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" was clearly a vehicle for Gerald Butler, who is credited as one of the producers. F. Gary Gray, and the writer, Kurt Wimmer, have combined forces to give us this drama in which a man, the victim of a horrendous crime that resulted in the death of his wife, and daughter, decides to take justice in his own hands to teach a lesson to the the system that did not serve him well.<br/><br/>The confrontation with Nick Rice, a Philadelphia D.A. and Clyde Shelton is something that films of this genre emphasizes by way of having Clyde one step ahead of Nick in whatever revenge he is trying to extract from the man he perceived made a pact with one of the criminals that killed his two loved ones. The hatred is such that it will consume almost one hour and fifty minutes of screen time where all kinds of nasty things will happen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, even fans of this type of film, will see the impossibility of Clyde getting away with most of the things he does in pursuit of justice. Gerard Butler has the best part in the film. Villains almost always offer the opportunity to make an impact on the audience, as Mr. Butler does with his sly ways. Jamie Foxx, on the other hand, is not as effective as Nick Rice as one expected. Some of the supporting players, notably Colm Meaney, a good actor, Bruce McGill, Michael Irby and Leslie Bibb do not have much to do in the film."
"godsmainmanjk","3","1","2","15 January 2011"," I love most of you, I hate this ending.
","I'm giving this a 3-10 just because of the ending. Yes i know it was a great movie. action packed, suspenseful the first time around, lots of good twists, good storyline for the most part, and even some good acting.<br/><br/>I just can't get over the ending so now every time i watch it and think to myself its all going in the right direction for ""Clyde"" to win. The ending never changes. Not even an alternate ending anywhere? I know its hard to believe a master tactician could think so far ahead to kill so many people, but then he leaves all these things around to screw himself over right before the end? With a regular attorney figuring out his plans and foiling his deeds? really? There are just too many ""why would the ""genius"" do that? or leave that there?"" questions, for me to really enjoy the movie even before it gets to its craptastic ending.<br/><br/>So as I see many of you hating this ending as well, I would just rather vote this down in rank so that no one watches it. therefore they do not have to sit through that lame ending. Hopefully a refusal to watch the movie entirely will spur Hollywood to stop ruining the endings to movies and just GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!"

"MBunge","6","1","2","24 September 2010"," A good film that could have been great, with a puzzlingly bad ending
","Law Abiding Citizen is a pretty good movie, right up until the end when it regresses like a 50 year old man going through a midlife crisis. After establishing itself as a provocative and fairly intelligent thriller, the film concludes with all the depth and nuance of a bad 80s action flick. It's almost as though this story was originally conceived as a 6 hour miniseries for television but then it was turned into a big screen project and some doltish studio executive arbitrarily ended it after what would have been the first episode.<br/><br/>The film opens with a vicious home invasion where Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) witnesses the murder of his wife and daughter. The killers are caught but when the DNA evidence is tossed out on a technicality, prosecutor Nick Rice (Jaime Foxx) decides to make a deal. The man who actually did the killing agrees to testify against his partner, sending him to death row while receiving only 5 years in prison. Clyde begs Nick not to do it. Nick, however, cares more about maintaining his high conviction rate than about Clyde's slain family. 10 years after that fateful decision, Clyde returns and launches a brutal string of murders to teach Nick and the whole world a few lessons about the true meanings of justice and responsibility.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about the first 3/4 of Law Abiding Citizen is that the pacing is a bit lax. Director F. Gary Gray does a poor job of creating a sense of constantly rising tension and danger. Outside of that, this is a smart and surprising story that engages both the head and the heart. It asks a series of compelling questions about the morality and ethics of our criminal justice system and the personal accountability of those who work in that system.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the last quarter of this movie is dumb. I mean, really dumb. I'm talking about ""guys who think strippers really like them"" dumb. None of the ethical questions posed or moral dilemmas presented in the first three-quarters of the movie are resolved or even acknowledged by the conclusion. The arguments it advances are suddenly short-circuited, seemingly just so something can get blown up real good. It's like a chess match that ends with someone getting a pie thrown in their face. I don't know if there came a point where writer Kurt Wimmer realized that he didn't have any answers to the philosophical questions he was asking in this script, if he was afraid of answering them or if someone didn't like his answers, so they were removed and a hunk of insultingly cheap and callow crap was inserted in their place. All I know is that the more you like this movie, the more disappointed you'll be in the ending.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Gerard Butler does some fine work here. He plays Clyde Shelton as a man consumed by a cold rage and an unshakable determination to make everyone else understand why he's angry. He never lets the character lapse into easy insanity, nor does he try too hard to make him sympathetic. His performance embodies the challenge the story presents to the sensibility of viewers. This is a film that actually wants you to think about things.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast isn't called on to do nearly as much as Butler but they're all perfectly adequate. Except for Jaime Foxx. He's basically terrible. He gives Nick Rice none of the depth or complexity that Butler grants to Shelton. Foxx looks like he only wanted a paycheck and fakes his way through the role without ever thinking about who Nick Rick really is or what he does. It's like his agent told him he's the hero in the movie and that's all the preparation Foxx did for the job. As good as Butler is, the fact that he gets nothing back from Foxx in their scenes together does prevent Law Abiding Citizen from being as good as it might have been, even with its lobotomy of a finish.<br/><br/>I don't know what went wrong with the conclusion of this film. But even as bad and unsatisfying as it is, the rest of the movie is still good enough to recommend. After about 90 minutes, you might be better off walking out of the theater and making up your own ending in your head. I can guarantee that it'll be better than what you'd see on the screen."
"dromasca","6","1","2","20 September 2010"," how unfortunate lights need to be turned on at the end of the screening
","Here is the genre of action movie that catches you while you watch it, keeps you on the edge of the chair or sofa, but later, when lights are turned on again you start asking questions about credibility and authenticity not only of the action, but also of the characters and the meaning of what you have seen on screen.<br/><br/>The first scenes of Law Abiding Citizen show the hero (played by Gerald Butler of king Leonidas fame in 300 in a very Russel Crowe style) talking with his young daughter while building some amateurish electronics (actually they should be very professional but we shall know this much later). Then hell breaks, bad guys break into the house, kill his daughter, kill and rape his wife. When the DA (Jammie Foxx) closes the deal with one of the murders to be the prosecution witness against the other, so that he gets a lighter punishment vs. death row, our hero gets angry. He actually gets more then angry, he becomes a psychopathic serial killer, who will kill one by one not only the perpetrators of the horrific crime that destroyed his life but also everybody who was involved in the deal. He actually will be more than just a serial killer, he will be a sophisticated serial killer, who is able to kill even while he finds himself in jail, even when he founds himself in seclusion. This we learn because his skills were not really amateurish, but rather the ones of a professional planner of murders. The criminals and the compromise-prone justice people had really chosen the wrong guy.<br/><br/>Does the synopsis look like already-seen-hundred-times at best and stupid at worst? Yes, it does. The surprise is how well it works for the majority of the film duration. The merit belongs in my opinion to director F. Gary Gray whose previous best quoted films (The Negotiator, The Italian Job) were also in the thriller and action genres proving his mastering of the matter. Gray keeps the suspense at high most of the time, he succeeds to surprise the viewer several time with insertions of violence just when the apparent order seems to be re-established, but most than all he knows how to pick his actors. Gerald Butler is so credible that we end as viewers by empathizing with his hero much more than he deserves, but the real surprise is Colm Meaney a great TV actor that we know from scores of series, who gets here an opportunity to make it on the big screens and certainly deserves much more time on them.<br/><br/>It's just after-screening logic that kills this film. But turning on the lights after the screening is unavoidable as we all know."
"MrGoodMovie","3","1","2","16 August 2010"," A Missed Opportunity
","This is one of those movies that starts so well and promises so much, but ultimately disappoints.<br/><br/>It is relatively well made and has an intelligent message but it just stretches believability that little bit too far, before descending into a telescoped and plain wrong ending that just doesn't fit with the dualling pair who have had you vacillating between hatred and sympathy as they reveal their backgrounds and personalities.<br/><br/>What a shame such a serious message about the US justice system descends into a simple, moralistic good guy/bad guy farce (and may well, depending on your opinion, choose the wrong ""good guy"").<br/><br/>Enjoy it for the hokum it is - despair that all involved missed a golden opportunity to make a movie that could have swept the board at the Oscars."
"a2432843","8","1","2","8 July 2010"," Realistic showing of the government
","I think this movie is remarkable, besides the thriller line, by very truthful showing of the 100% evil of the today's US government. Putting aside the plot, which I agree becomes less and less believable as it approaches the ending, it's impossible to miss the fact that all representatives of the government are in fact enemies of the society - be it the prosecutor pursuing his conviction percentage rather than justice, be it the judge who approves what she herself has just defined as blatant violation of individual's rights, be it the mayor who puts armed police on the streets of the city while knowing perfectly well that this is nothing but a show and is absolutely unrelated to the problem, or be it a squad of armed to the teeth SWAT goons attacking and harassing a naked man. The main message of this movie is that it's not some individuals are the abusers who are getting their revenge, but the government itself, as the institution, and anybody who belongs to the government does deserve what is coming to him. With the blatant corruption and evil emanated by the government as their routine daily business, it's just the matter of time and luck until they encounter someone capable enough to strike back. If you will, it's moral justification of what the government itself defines as domestic terrorism - if it targets the government itself."

","Law Abiding Citizen is an engaging off-the-wall thriller, providing great performances and some stone cold violence. Everything is tense even in a plot so ridiculous and although the realism is never quite there, the movie is clever enough to make you feel for the characters and keep you hooked til the ending credits. Gerard Butler has been spewing some off-beat rom coms, but carries this revenge movie making you feel every emotion that he goes through. Portraying the evil and the victim in such an ingenious way that the difference between what's good and what's bad becomes one of the films strongest points. Jamie Fox, although got quite a bad write up does just fine in the support. No extra emotional baggage, but his chemistry along with Gerard Butler really works. <br/><br/>The violence is blood thirsty, the action is tense, although the movie isn't fully justified in its last sections, it delivers making up for the odd slow points in the movie. <br/><br/>Overall: Yes it's far fetched, yes its ridiculous, but this is a gripping and very entertaining thriller supporting some strong leads and providing some god-damn decent carnage."

Everyone that is slightly infested with the disease must be ""cured"".<br/><br/>Motivated by Hubris like arrogance, the corrupt DA, who's lost his way and who's only interested in case winning percentage and money, fails to overcome his corruption. He holds the antibody to his and and justice system's sickness in his hands, but fails to inject it.<br/><br/>At the end, we still have a corrupt justice system, that not only has forgotten about justice, but has failed to realize its faults through the lesson it's been taught.<br/><br/>I think this is what most people didn't understand when they watched the ending. The point of the ending is to show that one man cannot change the system. The system is so blind and works like a well oiled machine with no purpose of justice or without the purpose of justice as a guiding column of fire. I too were disappointed by the end of the movie, like everyone, but if you think about it, having the DA ""winning"" farthest from a happy ending. If our hero would have won, that would have been a happy ending. I don't know if this is what the director wanted us to see, but this is what I get.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would have preferred a happy ending where our hero wins and walks. In my opinion, the DVD should have an alternate ending. I rated this 7. If hero won, it would be an 8 or 9."

","Law Abiding Citizen is a decent film if not for the amateur ending. The story's good and that's something one would expect from the film's writer, Kurt Wimmer.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler plays Clyde Shelton, a family man forced to witness the brutal murder of his family. A flaw in the justice system lets the killer go free and Shelton takes the law into his own hands. Shelton threatens to kill more people if the justice system is not corrected and he makes his demands to Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), the prosecutor who must stop Shelton before more innocent people die.<br/><br/>The movie picks up after Clyde Shelton's first murder. Shelton readily admits to killing the man who murdered his wife and daughter. Now in prison, Shelton makes demands to prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) or he threatens to kill people. While in prison. <br/><br/>Gerard Butler's performance is fantastic and I felt like it was comparable to Heath Ledger's Joker as the movie's bad guy who got all the attention. Butler is very convincing as a cunning madman who only wants to see the world share his misery.<br/><br/>The two disappointments in the film are Jamie Foxx, who is usually reliable, and of course the poor ending to an otherwise good film.

"cadillac20","6","1","2","19 February 2010"," Decent Revenge Flick, But Turn Your Brain Off
","I wouldn't exactly call myself a big fan of revenge flicks, but I am a fan of the concept. Here we have a great concept: a man who loses his family and watches the man responsible for this get a minimal sentence for the crime, blames the justice system and takes revenge on them...while being imprisoned. I groaned when I knew what to expect, someone with another blow-hard message about justice in the U.S. Still, the fact the main character is imprisoned and still killing off people intrigued me. And for the most part, it is a pretty entertaining film. <br/><br/>What makes this film particularly entertaining is its relentless pace. It's almost non-stop. Despite being predictable and the trailers giving away too much, there are several entertaining action scenes here. It help that Gerard Butler once again proves he's a charming action star. This is the kind of stuff he should be doing. Jaime Foxx on the other hand is less entertaining as a success-hungry lawyer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as entertaining as the film is, much of it leaves something to be desired. The writing is mediocre and much of what happens during the action scenes is beyond unbelievable. I understand suspension of disbelief, and believe me I can probably perform such a thing more so than most people, but this film stretched it. And not just in the way the action scenes play out, but in the message of the film. Butler's character is so blood lusty by the end of the film, and Foxx's character seems to have had so little character growth, that you really don't care for any of these characters and their senses of justice. It's a good concept, but one that is DOA.<br/><br/>This leads me to the two biggest problems in the film: the fact that there is no real protagonist and the ending. A film needs a protagonist of some sort, especially and action film. And, in a revenge film, we're supposed to support the character in their quest for vengeance. Here, it is almost impossible to care about Butler's character, as he has killed a number of innocent characters and essentially become the villain that we are supposed to hate. Likewise, by the end, Foxx seems to have learned nothing from the ordeal, or at least has not grown as a character in any satisfying way. And then there is the ending, which is so ridiculous one wonders how it can be acceptable. While the whole thing was kinda cool in a special fx kind of way, the message the film was trying to tell is shot right out the window. Way to go.<br/><br/>Now, I realize there is quite a bit of criticism here, and that's only because, for such a preachy film you'd really have to be an anarchist to support its message. But the cat and mouse games in the film are actually well written and the quest for the truth is interesting enough to sustain interest. Sure, there are huge leaps of logic here (instead of transferring the man out of the city, they keep him imprisoned in it? ), but if you can suspend your belief for a while, there is some decent action here and even a little suspense. It's not a great movie by far, but if you want to kill some time with a fairly entertaining film, this should suffice as the new film of the week."
"cowman57-1","6","1","2","1 February 2010"," Why are we so okay with protagonists who take the law into their own hands and murder to get revenge?
","I probably wouldn't have gone to see Law Abiding Citizen if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor. I didn't think that I would like it based on the commercials, but he wanted to go see it, so we went, and I liked it enough to give it a middle-of-the-road rating.<br/><br/>I think it succeeded in being suspenseful. We constantly wanted to know how Gerard Butler's character was able to carry out his deadly plans while he was locked away in jail, under constant surveillance. The stakes got higher and so did the mystery and intrigue. There were also several ""wow"" scenes that made me jump and say 'wow.' They were mostly disgusted wows, but they were still wows. So that's what prevented this movie from being a one star, because it's fun to watch exciting, suspenseful movies.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Law Abiding Citizen fell into some standard Hollywood blockbuster writing traps. In the quest to make the movie suspenseful, the screenwriter made a few things a little bit ridiculous and unbelievable: like how the mayor of Philadelphia shut down the whole city because she was afraid of one criminal. Secondly, a few lines of dialogue meant to be serious and dramatic came off as majorly cheesy- in fact, some audience members laughed out loud a couple times at what were supposed to be serious moments. Also finally, Butler's character was basically godlike in his abilities and I'm just not so sure one man, no matter how angry or genius he is, could have planned out so many details of this plan. Okay, so obviously it is a movie and we're supposed to remember that in order to enjoy it better.<br/><br/>But I must mention one final disappointment with the film before I critique its take-away message. I was pretty let down by the revelation of how Butler's character carried out his plan while in jail. I won't spoil the surprise, but it was simply too hokey and cliché to fully satisfy the curiosity that built throughout the entire movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>To the overarching theme now. I don't know if it was meant to be ambiguous of if we were supposed to sympathize/side with Butler. Bad men broke into his house and killed his daughter then raped and killed his wife all in front of Butler's eyes, then nearly killed him. When Jamie Foxx, the District Attorney, decides to make a deal with one of the bad guys to really nail the other one in court, Butler feels betrayed by the judicial system, gets irate and plans to get even with everybody ten years later. Anyway, Butler mercilessly tortures the bad guys to death, kills judges, blows up lawyers, and stabs inmates with sporks in jail as payback. The audience in my theater cheered at the torture and applauded when the female judge got shot in the face.<br/><br/>Is it okay to take the law into your own hands when you feel unjustly treated? Is torture okay? Is it okay to kill innocent people to make a point? Do criminals deserve to be put to death? I answer no to all of these questions, but I think it puts me in the minority in my country. (And, according to the reactions of my theater, I know it did in my audience too.) Sure, what the bad guys did was seriously awful and despicable and of course I'm disgusted by it, completely against it. But torture is never ever okay, in my opinion, no matter how bad of a guy the torturee is.<br/><br/>Plus, as Foxx's character says in the movie, the US judicial system is run on the concept that it's not what you know, but it's what you can prove in court. This is the only way that innocent people on trial are protected, and even then we still end up putting away (or executing) the wrong person. Butler's character failed to understand that. In the end, he turned out to be just as messed up and crooked as the people who killed his family, I think.<br/><br/>So I'm skeptical about the meaning behind Law Abiding Citizen and am uneasy with the fact that it made money because people in this country agreed with its principles. Hopefully many moviegoers questioned some of this stuff and thought, like I did, that Butler's character was seriously messed up. Again, morality aside, this movie succeeded in being suspenseful."

","Entertaining action-thriller starring two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, Gerard Butler and Jamie ""Give me that role, I can make pigs fly"" Foxx. With these two playing a cat and mouse game involving the whole city, we're almost guaranteed a good time. Now comes the bad news. Like this review, the movie started out painting a picture we'd be sorry to overlook. Too bad it couldn't sustain its initial momentum of a clever thriller with action which blow your pants off. The middle section and what followed after that was just too over the top. Watch out for an unintentional, laugh out loud scene which wouldn't feel out of place in a Stephen Chow movie. It is still enjoyable though, just don't expect corn to taste like caviar."
"zekakhan","8","1","2","5 January 2010"," Clyde Shelton feels the justice and accepts his own punishment
","I have a lot of comments and only one question: How the hell did Kurt Wimmer's screenplay end up in the hands of F. Gary Gray?<br/><br/>Being an attorney myself, I understand the legal system and the often complex ways of justice. Anyway, when it comes to settlements with the ones who admit committing serious crimes, I absolutely share the resentment of ordinary people. There is no point in justice if the criminal is running free and only the one who should have prosecuted him understands why.<br/><br/>This movie was to be about all of it and more. Much more But then it ended up in the hands of Mr. F. Gary Gray and became only a great music video with the good looking people and massive, expensive scenes of explosions. Dammit, where was, for instance, David Fincher when this screenplay was on the table? Even a pale copy of the directing done in ""Se7en"" would have been satisfactory.<br/><br/>And how about casting? I'm sorry, but Jamie Foxx, Butler? I loved ""Ray"" and ""300"" but that's obviously the limit for these two guys. My God, I swear, this one deserves Denzel or Morgan Freeman and Mickey Rourke, at least! I believe it would even be paid off more than these two guys. Anyway, since the producer of the movie was also Kurt Wimmer, I presume the financial difficulties forced him to do only a glamorous video in order to drag all kind if people into the cinemas and probably, as he thought at the time, to save some money on the casts and the directorI have no other reasonable explanations for these enormous flaws comparing to the essence of the issue hit in the topic.<br/><br/>Anyway, it is how it is. The movie has some shocking scenes, as it should be, to support the power of the characters, of course. The idea of the magnificent ending (instead of poor one, as most of the people unfortunately understood due to a pathetic directing) was the peace of mind Clyde Shelton finally found. He was aware, from the very beginning of the preparations, that he would not enjoy the fruits of his actions in freedom and wealth. He understands his flaw, but he only wasn't expecting to be caught before it's time. Anyway, when the moment came and he saw the change in Nick Rice, he was ready. That's when Butler decided to smile before he set his Clyde back on the solitaire bench expecting his punishment. I loved him for that! To make the long story short, the system should serve to the people and make them safe, not otherwise. <br/><br/>Clyde Shelton made his point, felt the justice and accepted his own punishment."
"followthesiren","6","1","2","5 January 2010"," Sold movie. Not above average.
","Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is a family man with a beautiful wife and children (and coincidentally, a articulate mastermind) when a pair of criminals slaughter his family in front of his very eyes. His case misses the mark and one of the convicts receives a light sentence. His intellect is turned toward vengeance on the corrupt justice system and he makes it his own blood-thirsty purpose to make things ""right"" again.<br/><br/>This movie has solid acting and the plot is clever, with the focus on the conflict between Clyde and his ex-lawyer, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx). The film is credibly unpredictable and watching Clyde toy with Nick is fairly interesting. Unfortunately, he was so far ahead that the plot felt like it was at a standstill, or at least a very acute slope. We're in Nick's shoes, just doing our best to get through it but watching helplessly as we wait to see the master plan. Don't expect to be in awe at the ending, either.<br/><br/>All around this was a mediocre movie. It's fun to watch, but not very engaging. What I will say, is it's worth catching in theaters if it's your 20th consecutive movie ticket and by some god-given miracle you've manage to earn yourself a free one! ;]"

","If the writers would have dared to take the premise a step further than this movie would have made a much bigger impact. Overall it is quite thrilling and entertaining. The biggest flaw however is the ending. The whole time there is a buildup to something grand. But once one twist is revealed you know that it only can end in one way. Only this ending is far too convenient and doesn't make much sense especially in the context of the movie.Also if one wanted to achieve this ending why not make the good guy more sympathetic. (You have to decide for your self who that is). The problem is that I can't go into the specifics without revealing too much. Let's say that calling the ending a letdown is an understatement. But even with this conclusion you should watch this movie for Gerard Butler. He is absolutely cool like Fonzie (and b.d.ss like it said on Jules Wallet in Pulp Fiction). Jamie Foxx is on autopilot and that only magnifies the brute acting force that is called Butler."

"josephdeungria","8","1","2","14 November 2009"," Systems Failure
","God didn't make life easy by giving humankind freedom of choice. Unfortunately for man's finite wisdom, he has more choices than he can handle. Unlike Adam who just needed to decide whether to eat the apple or not, modern day man has too many options: 200 cable TV channels, 10 on-line identities, 10 banks, 3 credit cards and for some, 2 families at a time. Everyday we have to make a 1001 decisions just to survive and yet some of these, we can never take back.<br/><br/>And so man has put up arbitrary systems to put some semblance of order and predictability in the world. Justice, religion, ethics, traffic rules are some of the systems, which help guide man's fatigued conscience classify things as black and white. Will you feel safe if convicted criminals can roam your streets with impunity? Can you imagine the chaos when the 10 commandments are only 10 recommendations? Would you use a highway with no traffic rules? Never, you say. But look around you. These may already be the status quo.<br/><br/>In the movie, Clyde experiences a tragedy when 2 criminals murder his wife and daughter. Nick, the prosecutor, negotiates a plea bargain that gets 1 criminal justice but lets the other 1 through the seams of the criminal system. Nick maintains his high prosecution rating, Clyde gets some justice and the public get their thirst for blood quenched for the meantime. Everybody happy? Not Clyde. Can you blame a law abiding citizen like Clyde if he tries to bring down the system to its knees?<br/><br/>The movie reminds us that it is so easy to use systems to justify our actions or inactions as long as it works for us. We silently applaud systems from afar. But during the life defining moments when the system fails us, then we start bending the rules and looking for system loopholes. We erroneously hope that working for the greater good justifies the often convoluted means we use to achieve it.<br/><br/>Bribe a traffic cop rather than spend a whole day getting back your license? Buy a counterfeit designer shirt at 10% of the price of an original one? Drive 10% over the speed limit so that you don't miss an appointment and lose your job? Don't get a receipt so that you don't need to pay the tax? Do a couple of bad things and then confess and go to heaven? Sounds familiar? Hey, it's not your fault, it's the system's failure.<br/><br/>It's the same unbalanced system that allows a rich kid multiple opportunities to earn valuable degrees in good colleges while denying a poor kid even 1 chance to enter the college door. It's the same laws that encourage pharmaceutical companies to engage in expensive research for life-saving drugs only to deny price access to these to the very people who need them. It's the same religious beliefs that justify killing the guilty one to save the many. It's the same rules that allow lawmakers to pay very little taxes and live in luxurious mansions but punishes the automatically-taxed employee who can't pay their loans on time.<br/><br/>What do you do when the system fails you in a very personal way? What do you do when the system becomes the oppressor rather than the protector? Perhaps God, in his infinite wisdom, saw this too and designed life so that no one can ever be as omnipotent or omnipresent or as smart or as rich as God or Clyde. For when that happens, then Houston we have a problem."

","There's no two ways about it, Law Abiding Citizen is a stupid movie. That's not to say it isn't entertaining, which it is.<br/><br/>This is the classic case of a film constructed on an implausible premise, making use of ridiculous leaps of faith, to tell a story that is jam packed with popcorn munching entertainment.<br/><br/>I know it sounds conflicted, but if you can buy into premises that the dead can walk or an alien from the planet Krypton can fly and be Earth's saviour, then turning off the brain's logic switch won't be a titanic effort to enjoy a movie that delivers such a fun ride. This isn't to say that Kurt Wimmer's screenplay doesn't try to provide a plausible explanation for what transpires, but that it's a stretch by any leap of the imagination.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Clyde Shelton (Butler), a mysterious Philadelphia electronics hobbyist whose life is suddenly torn asunder when his home is invaded by two thieves who murder his wife and young daughter.<br/><br/>Enter Nick Rice (Foxx), a career-minded prosecuting attorney more concerned with blemishes to his conviction rate than actual justice. Fearing acquittal, Rice works out a plea bargaining deal which sees one of the two robbers do minimal prison time, and the other sentenced to death row. Only problem is it's the thief who did the killing who gets off lightly. Thus is laid the foundation for Shelton's epic quest for revenge, not merely targeting the killers, but the entire justice system which he sees as corrupt.<br/><br/>Director F. Gary Gray (2003's The Italian Job) does a yeoman job ensuring there's a good mix of action and story, and the performance of all involved is capable and adequate. My only reservation rests on the decision to make Gerard Butler speak with an American accent, which makes the Scottish actor at times appear as though he's got a mouth full of marbles.<br/><br/>If you like things ""blowed up real good"" and have no trouble with plot devices that stretch credibility, you'll find Law Abiding Citizen a fun ride.

"guoyandao","9","1","3","22 February 2010"," Most din't get the point of the ending
","I feel that most of the reviews here have one common message: solid idea, good plot overall, WORST ENDING EVER! I used to share the same feelings, but after I carefully chewed over it again and after reading one review written in Chinese, I think I can't help but agree that most people are missing the point of the ending. The following is mostly based on that particular review I read.<br/><br/>First of all, vengeance was never (merely) Clyde's intention. Just like he said himself in the movie, ""No Nick, I had 10 years of vengeance, if that's what I wanted....no I could have slaughtered you or your family anytime I wanted!"" Getting this part straight is essential to understanding the film. Many people are hugely let down by the ending because Nick didn't die, but why does Nick have to die? It's because in our view, all this is about Clyde's vengeance. Well, it's not.<br/><br/>So, what else could it be? It's about war, a war that Clyde's launching against the entire corrupted justice system (whether or not it IS corrupted for efficiency sake is another topic), against everyone who is a part of it. So the next question is, why didn't Nick die? He was the one most directly responsible for it. The answer to this might be a little harder to pull together, but most likely, not only did Nick not have to die (since this is not about vengeance), most likely it was also Clyde's intention to keep Nick alive. As he said it towards the end of the movie, ""Maybe I wasn't such a bad teacher after all."" What was the lesson that he was trying to teach Nick? That he ""doesn't make deals with murderers anymore"". An expensive lesson indeed, at the expense of many lives. But that was the whole point of Clyde's campaign, he wants Nick to see what he sees, he's trying to educate, to make a point, to teach a bloody lesson that won't be forgotten. The ultimate objective of his campaign is to change Nick, so that he would live on and go back to who he used to be, the righteous district attorney who would NOT sacrifice justice for efficiency."
"thats-right77","9","1","3","23 November 2009"," Very Good Movie
","I absolutely LOVED this movie; the ending was a little terrible and upsetting, but the rest of the movie (up to that point) was virtually flawless! Aside from the moral tales woven around the killings, the justice system, blind ambition, etc, I always just love a darn good revenge flick. ""Taken"" and ""Law Abiding Citizen"" hearken back to good versions and interpretations of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", outlining detailed accounts of wronged individuals plotting, for years, the demise of those who have done them wrong. I'd also add ""Man on Fire"" in this mix because it really speaks to the heart of the American public in a way that makes it OK to condone and, even, encourage gratuitous violence without the self-righteous and indignant judgment of others. As soon as Darby walked into the house, I knew this was going to be a good flick! I was totally absorbed in Butler's character, Clyde, and never even considered Foxx as the protagonist; he just seemed much too ancillary in this film for that to be accurate. For me, this epic battle of good and evil had Butler on the Good Side and Foxx on the Bad Side with a corrupt system winning out in the end. The cinematography in the final jail scenes was beautiful, I think, but I left the theater sad that the little guy fell, yet again, to the machine of the overbearing justice system.<br/><br/>Loved the movie. Would see it again."

","I identified with Clyde, because I self-represented myself in court during a civil proceeding and was fighting against lawyers and spouting precedents and legal to make my case. Clyde also had me laughing like crazy during the whole movie because he was making a clever mockery of the justice system. It's the craftiness and meticolous attention to detail, with his statements to Foxx that had me cracking in my seat. With me, this movie had a dark humour about it where Clyde was just menacing throughout the whole movie and playing everyone there for a fool.<br/><br/>If you are into dark humour movie that makes a mockery of the justice system with one law-abiding man that loses it then watch it.<br/><br/>Apart from this aspect, I found some major holes in terms of realism or believability, but overall, it's the funniest dark humour movies I've seen. The part with the judge scene, where he first fights against bail, then blasts the judge for giving him bail, and then he is denied bail and held in contempt of court -- cracked me up. Other funny scenes include plea-bargains for ridiculous demands by Clyde that just make you laugh.<br/><br/>If you like this sort of film, there is another movie called ""The Interview"" and it stars Hugo Weaving that sort of has that same cat and mouse game where the accused is making a mockery of the prosecution by admitting to a murder then explaining it away and using technicalities."
"bramb600","8","1","3","3 November 2009"," Pure Dumb Fun!
","Law Abiding Citizen is a hardcore action/suspense film starring Gerald Butler and Jamie Foxx. The movie begins with Clyde (Butler) being portrayed as a family man. His wife and daughter are murdered less than two minutes later. Nick Rice is a district attorney who arranges a plea bargain for one guilty man to be executed and the other to spend a few years in prison. We cut to 10 years later, when Clyde is able to rig the execution, giving him a painful death. He also tortures and murders the man who set free and is arrested promptly afterwards. In prison, Clyde makes a series of demands that must be granted or else he will start killing people. How he somehow manages to kill people while he's locked up is a mystery, but that's what makes the film so damn entertaining.<br/><br/>The intense plot description above would normally sound like spoilers, but all this happens in the first half hour and is all revealed in the trailer. You might also notice that Clyde's intentions are very similar to Dexter's. He is taking the law into his own hands when he's not pleased with the outcome of a trial. I normally wouldn't mind this, but there were a lot of noticeable aspects, such as when Clyde shows the pictures of his family to his victim. At least it had a unique twist on that when Clyde takes his time to torture his victims and leaves everything behind as evidence.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is directed by F. Gary Grey. He did The Italian Job, which I thought to be a high quality remake. Although, he also did the mediocre Be Cool. He doesn't make the greatest films, but they're definitely not terrible. I didn't have a problem with his directing, I thought it was a very well made suspense film. As for the acting, Jamie Foxx has been better in the past. This isn't another Oscar worthy performance from him. Gerald Butler seems to be perfect for this role, though. These kinds of roles that he plays in movies like this, 300 and Gamer are so much better roles than the awful romantic comedies he's been doing recently. I don't understand how anyone thinks that these action movies are ruining his reputation as a romantic lead, when it's exactly the opposite. <br/><br/>As a critic, I think that this is a fairly difficult film to review. On one hand, it's very dumb. On the other hand, it's highly entertaining, even exhilarating at times. It's difficult to know which one is more important here. The critics here clearly have sided on one angle giving it 22% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. I'll have to disagree with the consensus there. When I pay for a ticket, I would want to have a good time. I will try anything to have a good time, but if I can't then I just don't like the film. In a movie like Law Abiding Citizen, you just have to turn your brain off and be genuinely entertained. Just train yourself to laugh at cheesy one-liners and plot holes. Some of the worst films of all time also may happen to be the most fun to watch with the redeeming quality of unintentional comedy. People praise these films for their many flaws and that's exactly what should become with Law Abiding Citizen, but to a smaller scale.<br/><br/>To get an idea of the dumb scenes can be found anywhere in the film. For some reason, Gerald Butler gets naked before he gets arrested, which isn't mentioned at any point in the film. Also, when the film jumps forward 10 years later, the characters either look even younger or exactly the same. It's not believable that they would look like that after 10 years. I also hated the ending. It was just very satisfying and unsatisfying. The ending brought the movie down for me. There was even a scene where they said the title of the movie like they were winking at the audience. Although, I'll have to admit there were some pretty clever plot twists and kills. The movie even made me jump at certain points.<br/><br/>To conclude this review, I'll definitely recommend Law Abiding Citizen for the entertainment value and the fine performance from Gerald Butler. I'm going to give Law Abiding Citizen an 8.5/10."

","This was a great example of how and why the law sucks as it does. To have criminals set free to do a crime again after they are released even by turning on their so called friends, was an excellent example of how the lower life forms have become less than human. But the lawyer's who work with them are just as lowly themselves getting them released in the first place. Gerard Butler was fantastic as a father who lost his family to two thugs who did not give a rats ass to life. And seeing the justice system fail to such a degree, would give any person the right idea to do it themselves. He plays a high level think tank, a person who comes up with the most imaginative ways to kill anyone without leaving traces behind to link him to the deed. A secret operative who more or less retired to live his life with his daughter and wife, only to be erased from existence from cockroaches. But his resolve was to wipe out the trace elements who gave one of the killers freedom just after serving three years for doing the actual killing, and the cohort being executed who did nothing except watch. Yet in the end it was sad to see Gerards character die, it should have been the lawyer who should have been in his place. Though without a family it would be a lonely existence for Gerards Character. This was a great film in many forms, and also a great example of how the law is failing badly to those who really need the justice system to work."

But it's a sacrifice that's understandable.<br/><br/>The acting of all the main characters were excellent. I thought Gerald Butler did a great job.<br/><br/>The story itself, however, was unrealistic. Lawyers having their own interest in mind and not representing their clients properly? Justice not served in the court of law due to technicalities and back room deals? That part does happen in real life. But what the ""law abiding citizen"" was capable of would make him a super villain with ultra intellect in a comic book. Also, the burden of preventing further actions by Clyde fell on the shoulders of Nick, who is only a lawyer. Realistically any clues uncovered should have been handed over to law enforcement. But this was done for the dramatic effect; the two nemesis facing each other.<br/><br/>The ending was a bit anti-climatic.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Gerard Butler keeps his streak alive. He is good in every movie, regardless of whether the movie itself is very good. Not that this one is awful, it was just disappointingly inconsistent.<br/><br/>Director F Gary Gray (The Italian Job) teams with writer Kurt Wimmer (The Recruit) to provide one fascinating character (Butler) and his nemesis - the wasted opportunity played by Jamie Foxx. The Foxx character is so poorly written, at least in the first 45 minutes, that I wanted to laugh outloud almost every time he said something stupid or even just strutted through the hallways of justice. I will admit that Foxx and his character were much more interesting once the cat and mouse game got serious.<br/><br/>Butler's character is terrific throughout. He is one of those sneaky smart guys who just happens to be a pro at killing people in unusual ways. His twisted lecture series for Foxx is a hoot and captivating. Every time he is on screen, you can't wait for what he is going to do or say next.<br/><br/>A big plus for the film is the casting of two top notch supporting actors in Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill - two of the best working these days. It is offset, however, by the totally out of place Leslie Bibb (Talladega Nights and Iron Man) who looks odd and acts even worse. Luckily for her, Oscar nominee Viola Davis (Doubt) takes bad acting to a whole different level with her angry diatribes. Just horrible.<br/><br/>With a better script and a little effort from Jamie Foxx, this could have been significantly better. Still worth watching for Butler and his intricate schemes, but disappointing nonetheless."

Don't you think that's a little too easy? Also, I think the movie would have taken an interesting turn if he had, in fact, had someone helping him throughout. Maybe one of the main characters who identified with him on some level? Overall, I liked the movie and thought the plot was great. I'm still bothered by the ending though. What do you think?"
"finaljustice","7","1","3","17 October 2009"," the movie is good, but is disturbing !
","The movie is good, suspenseful, and dramatic. But, contains torture and disturbing images! I would not recommend for the faint of heart! I felt like the initially good victim at the beginning turned into a true criminal who I wanted somebody to kill quickly! The movie really pushes reality but is very dramatic, and I disagree with the other writer the ending is excellent! I felt like walking out of the movie at the beginning , but if you can make it through the disturbing parts , there is actually a decent theme in the movie. My favorite actors/actresses are the police detective and the young female assistant to the prosecuting attorney."

","This movie, while gripping, is wildly implausible. It falls apart with an incredibly dumb third act. Even in the trailers, it's obvious that this film had structural problems right from the start. It really doesn't know what type of movie it wants to be. It tries to be a mixture of ""Taken,"" ""The Punisher,"" and ""Seven"" but ends up being less than the sum of its parts. It's a revenge flick that turns on itself and the viewer doesn't know who to back and who to root for. I'm sure that's the point, to unsettle the viewer and make them think but the results aren't very entertaining. The ""accomplice"" plot twist is completely implausible if you think about it."

","I was a little disappointed by Mr. Gerard's last movie, so I was a bit hesitant in seeing this one. I will admit to being pleasantly surprised! If I had to give this movie a grade, I would give it an A- (the minus for the blood content). It starts with a familiar storyline...family, robbers, vengeance, etc, but how they pulled the story together was so wonderfully done. I had no idea Jamie Foxx basically plays the lead roll with Gerard Butler playing second fiddle (you're not in my book Gerri!). There are some surprises in there so hold on to your seat. It was definitely worth the money, in fact I am thinking of taking my son to see it. I had no idea that Mr. Butler was in to producing films, but he did a wonderful job with this. It has thrill, mystery, action, and definitely intensity. I have no doubt that this movie will be number 1 or 2 at the box office this week!"
"jboothmillard","5","1","4","1 March 2012"," Law Abiding Citizen
","I may have heard about this film at least once at the time of its release, and as I heard more about the plot I was certainly more intrigued to watch it, from director F. Gary Gray (The Negotiator, The Italian Job). Basically the Shelton family have their home broken into, and father/husband Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) witnesses his wife and young daughter murdered by the perpetrators, Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and his partner Rupert Ames (Joshua Stewart). The police do manage to catch the criminals, both due to face court, and Shelton is represented by prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), but the lawyer doesn't believe their case is strong enough because of lack of evidence that proves they are guilty. Even though Clyde knows that he is a criminal and did do the crime, Darby has a deal made where Ames testifies against him and his partner is allowed to go free, Clyde feels highly betrayed, not by Rice, but by the law system itself. Ten years pass, and Ames is being executed by lethal injection, but whereas the process would normally be quick and painless, with the three doses in a certain order, the order is changed making his death slow and painful, he suffers in death. The authorities believe that his partner Darby is responsible for the botching of the execution, but he has disappeared after receiving an anonymous phone call that leads him to an abandoned warehouse, and there the unknown caller reveals himself, it is Clyde. He paralyses the criminal so that he cannot move, and using power tools slowly mutilates him until dead, and after finding the body, Nick, his assistant Sarah Lowell (Leslie Bibb), Detective Dunnigan (Colm Meaney), Destective Garza (Michael Irby) and the authorities know who did it, and arrest Clyde. He does not deny his guilt at killing Darby, but he says he will make a full confession if he gets a new and more comfortable mattress in his cell, which he does get. In court he represents himself, but Judge Laura Burch (Annie Corley) grants him bail, so he lashes out, and in the heat of the argument he is eventually held in contempt of court. Clyde does give his confession, but he reveals that he has also kidnapped Darby's attorney, Bill Reynolds (Richard Portnow), and he will only reveal his location if he gets a good steak meal and his iPod by 1:00pm the next day. The authorities know he is playing a dangerous game, but Nick agrees to go along with it, but because the meal and iPod arrive eight minutes late, they get to the Reynolds' location too late, while Clyde's cell mate is brutally stabbed by the steak bone, and he is put in solitary confinement. Evidence is found by Sarah that Clyde is a technical genius, with connections in the Department of Defence, and Nick and District Attorney Jonas Cantrell (Bruce McGill) learn more from CIA contact (Michael Kelly) that he can eliminate targets in various unconventional ways. Judge Burch is killed next after a cell phone explosion, and Clyde says that he will kill ""everyone"" if he is not released with charges cleared by 6:00am the next morning, but his demands are not met, and five staff members, including Sarah, are killed in car explosion. Mayor April Henry (Doubt's Viola Davis) knows that the situation is becoming increasingly out of hand, and she assigns protection to Nick and Jonas, but even one of them can't escape an attack, after Jonas is killed at Sarah's funeral by a robot with machine guns. After trying to get out of the situation with fail, the Mayor makes him the Acting District Attorney, but then he finds a lead from Sarah's boyfriend, and he and Dunnigan find a garage near the prison, with tunnels underneath leading to the various cells. Apparently Clyde's next move is to cause disaster at Philadelphia City Hall, where he passes security as a fake janitor, and he plans to kill the Mayor and her security colleagues, so Nick rushes to find the bomb, which he and the disposal specialist discover it is activated by a cell phone call. They are neither unable to deactivate the bomb or evacuate the building without risking the fact that Clyde may be watching on the cameras, he meanwhile has returned to his cell, where Nick is there waiting to reason with him about his actions. After warning him about his choice to activate the bomb, Nick leaves him, and Clyde calls the cell phone to detonate the bomb, only then does he realise it has been moved, it is underneath his bed, and he kills himself, and Nick meanwhile, and his wife Kelly (Scary Movie's Regina Hall), happily attend the recital of their daughter Denise (Emerald-Angel Young). Also starring Gregory Itzin as Warden Iger. Butler gives a great performance with both hidden aggression that comes out, and he has intelligent tactics to create a stir in the law system he is taking it out on, and Foxx is really good as the man who is trying to work out his next move and stop him, the supporting cast do alright as well. You can think of it as a more up scale revenge film, like Death Wish if you like, but with more explosions, I will admit there are predictable moments and I was unsure whether Butler was a good guy or bad guy, because you were meant to sympathise with him losing his family, but I guess it's not important, it is just a crime thriller that's quite fun. Worth watching!"
"Scarecrow-88","9","1","4","13 May 2010"," Law Abiding Citizen
","To be honest, F Gary Gray's Law Abiding Citizen is ultimately, in my mind, a cat and mouse thriller putting the imperfect justice system on trial. We see stories all the time on NBC's Law and Order about how lawyers negotiate deals in order to get a somewhat respectable verdict based on the evidence presented and the strength of the cases involved.<br/><br/>To me, the screenplay is purposely manipulative, specifically designed to prey on our emotions..how could we not sympathize with Gerard Butler after witnessing the opening minutes and the unfortunate result when the real killer is put on trial, getting off on a technicality? We see hot shot lawyer, career on the rise, Jamie Foxx orchestrate a deal with the repulsive rapist/killer of both Butler's wife and daughter. The wrong man is convicted(he was there in the house to rob and his partner, who couldn't help himself and control his deviant impulses, frames him for the crimes)and Butler even looks on as Foxx shakes the hand of the perpetrator who served a mere two years on a measly five year sentence. <br/><br/>Smartly, Kurt Wimmer's script forwards the story ten years later showing us Foxx who has a ten year old daughter. This affords Butler plenty of time to have put together his masterplan. Butler, is far more than just some simple inventor, as Foxx and all included (who were participants, in one way or another, in the release of a despicable cretin after a lousy prison sentence) will soon come to realize.<br/><br/>Bruce McGill is the DA and Leslie Bibb is a lawyer on Foxx's team, and they, among others, will have to somehow outsmart Butler who is, amazing enough, coordinating attacks on everyone who allowed injustice to be carried out..this as he is arrested and imprisoned. Butler wants to ""bring the whole temple down"", proclaiming that the court system is corrupt and immoral as he plans to make a ""biblical"" statement, to leave his mark on Foxx. The mystery is what Butler wants Foxx to figure out. It's all about how criminals are oftentimes treated too easily, while the just are dealt a terrible hand. <br/><br/>The filmmakers are certainly puppeteers..they toy around with our emotions, having us choose sides. Foxx has a more difficult role than Butler..he must convince the audience that his lawyer is someone who doesn't deserve what is meted out to his friends, peers, and associates. You see, we can understand why Butler is in such a psychological state..motivated by the hell that has left him without a family and justice for their demise. <br/><br/>Of course, it's up to Wimmer's screenplay to concoct a way for how Butler can achieve the various traps which kill many associated with Foxx..it's all rather preposterous, but making him some sort of cerebral gadget genius known for designing tools used to assassinate our government's ""bad guys"", equipped with an ability to strategize plots that befuddle and confuse an entire city's law enforcement and legal authority, allows the movie to arrange ingenious scenarios to keep the viewer wondering what would happen next.<br/><br/>I have to hand it to the filmmakers, they really weave together quite a tale, putting Foxx in a sticky situation, his lawyer questioned for letting his egotistical desire to keep his criminal record intact over the possibility of taking his client's advice and engaging the person on trial in a court battle. Butler not only is afforded a chance to win our hearts for what he has gone through, and given a character who is both wily and incredibly intelligent. It's the case of two pros on opposing sides, yielding eventually one victor..who can outwit the other? How Butler is able to coordinate his plan from a prison cell is just extraordinary. I imagine Butler's revenge on his family's killer will be met with applause."

","Gerard Butler and Jamie Fox star in this rather intriguing thriller which has been titled ""Law Abiding Citizen"" by it's makers. I would never have known about this movie (I embarrassingly admit) had my friend not called me up asking to watch it ASAP. It still took me a fortnight to comply with his request and I discovered that this whole build up was not necessary for the movie.<br/><br/>The concept of the story is good. One feels that the movie does throw light upon certain aspects of the justice system which are basically wrong though not completely unjustified. It tries hard to allocate accountability but lets us know that in the real world nothing is black and white. <br/><br/>Not exactly brilliant but the director succeeds in dishing out a decent action thriller which would have been a runaway hit in the first few years of the decade.<br/><br/>The action sequences are OK. <br/><br/>The screenplay needs major amendments to add bite to the otherwise morose dialogues.<br/><br/>Watch it if you have to.

"DonFishies","7","1","4","3 March 2010"," A flawed, but entertaining piece of throwaway cinema
","On an ordinary evening, Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler) watches helplessly as his wife and child are killed in front of him. Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hot shot lawyer with a record conviction rate he is not willing to sacrifice, takes the case and manages to send one of the criminals responsible for the murder to death row. But the real perpetrator gets off with a much lighter sentence. Rice sees nothing wrong with this based on the lack of evidence, but Sheldon does not feel justice is served. Zap forward ten years later, where Sheldon begins his quest for justice and people involved with the case are picked off one by one.<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for Law Abiding Citizen, I was immediately reminded of David Fincher's brilliant psychological horror-thriller Se7en. Whereas Se7en revolved around the investigation of John Doe and his randomly chosen victims based on the idea of the seven deadly sins, Citizen revolves around a wronged man choosing his victims based on their involvement with his case. The film takes away the suspense of trying to figure out who is doing it, and attempts to focus more on the why and how. For the most part, we get to watch every kill and get to slowly piece together how and why everything is happening. There is nothing random about any of the events in the film, and the suspense lies in the comprehension of what is occurring, not in the horrific one-upping randomness of the events.<br/><br/>But the momentum that Citizen has in its early moments is lost quite quickly as the film goes on. While Se7en basked in toying just as much with the two leads as it did the viewer, Citizen seems content at laying everything out rather easy and waiting for the viewer to pick up on the reasoning and eventual twist. I will admit that I was surprised by that twist, but a lot of what leads up to it feels very mundane. There is a very thrilling aspect to the events taking place, but after the first few characters bite the dust, there just seems to be very little life left in the story. It feels like it was an intriguing idea to start that gets tapped out far too quickly. More maddening (albeit very intriguing) is the absence of some things most films would find key. We learn very little about Sheldon (outside of what the trailer already tells us), we learn very little about Rice (outside of how dedicated he and his team are to his records), and we learn almost nothing about the murders that start the film off and are the reason for what happens in the first place. Not all of these things are bad, but they do manage to feel bothersome at times anyway.<br/><br/>Despite all this, Kurt Wimmer (the man responsible for the hideously underrated Equilibrium and the just plain hideous Ultraviolet) manages to still make the story entertaining and interesting enough to sustain the audience for the entire ride. The intensity of some of the sequences, and the sheer bloody and unflinching brutality of some of the murders more than make up for the flawed screenplay. He seems to be a stronger writer than a director, and I can only hope he sticks to writing. F. Gary Gray, a veteran action director, does not exactly bring a distinct style to the film, but competently brings the story out quite well.<br/><br/>The acting, much like everything else, is flawed but still not all that bad. The supporting cast unfortunately gets very little to do outside of attempt to hold their own against Foxx and Butler. There are a couple of cast members who do quite a bit for the film, specifically Leslie Bibb and Colm Meaney (who has been all but missing in action from mainstream films as of late), but the script never really lets their characters flourish outside of being one-note and one-dimensional. Practically everything we try to learn about Bibb's character is either never elaborated on, or brushed off entirely. I would have liked to have seen more of a presence from all the supporting actors, but these two specifically could have done with more material.<br/><br/>Foxx has failed consistently at trying to perform anywhere near the majesty of his Oscar-winning turn in Ray. There is no doubt that he is a great actor, but he has yet to prove since why we all believed he could pull Ray Charles off so well. In Citizen, he seems a bit too muted. In the scenes where the world begins to close in on his character, we can see the pain coming through, but never really get to see Foxx attempt to shine the way we know he can. He just seems to be going through the motions, hoping the lines will do the work and not his acting. It is a decent enough performance, but that is it.<br/><br/>Butler on the other hand does his best work here since 300. He just looks like he is having fun with the role, and chews right into the twisted individual Sheldon quickly becomes. Watching him interact with Foxx's character and running circles around him is reason enough to watch the film. His performance is not incredible by a long shot, but there is more life and depth within Butler at any given moment than there is in the entirety of the film. When the film goes limp, Butler just keeps on putting everything into the role. My only qualm is with his uneven accent, which seems to be a consistent problem for him.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is an entertaining piece of throwaway cinema. It is incredibly flawed, but there is enough value in what is good about it to make it a worthwhile watch. Just do not go in expecting something on par with Se7en.<br/><br/>7/10."

"mtmnpa","10","1","4","26 November 2009"," Excellent Depiction of Good VS Evil
","Gerard continues to amaze me. Yes, I expected the movie to show me why I should believe in his character, and have empathy for what he lost. He cinched it for me. It's not far fetched to think that angry men or victims of crime if given the chance and financial background, could and would seek vengeance on lawyers or any justice system that protects the criminal instead of the family. We have just that in the American court system. Instead of preventing crime and protecting victims, our system and courts aren't doing the job. This is why a writer put forth the idea, the scheme, these 2 actors explore the what ifs? This movie shows good vs evil. Which is the good? Which is the evil? You wonder all through the movie who you can cheer for? And should you? Gerard/Clyde shows his vulnerability by baring it, and that's, really saying, here I am with nothing else to hide behind. Interesting theory. Or maybe he knows he has a nice ass and women should see it in every movie. Who cares? So, both actors step away from other more predictable roles, acting styles, but thats what actors look for. I'm glad that both Gerard and Jamie took a chance, and produced a piece of work that makes, us, the fans think about what we saw. I've seen the movie 9 times, and will see it again on Sunday. Why? I've been there, and seen and felt the way Clyde felt. Definitely worth seeing again if you didn't like it, to view it from a different perspective. Its not a perfect movie, there are cliffhangers, but thats what a movie is supposed to do, interact, entertain, acclimate to where the characters are at mentally, find solace or resolution of the problem/plot, rise to the end or not, dis-engage and talk about what you saw. As far as I was concerned, it was excellent! Gerry should get an Oscar. Hope to see him back on stage in something along the same lines, because as an actor, Gerard has already moved from various genre's, sci-fi, romance, comedy, drama, documentary, short films, singing, musicals, and has the potential to do more at his own pace. He's got a road ahead of good roles, I can feel it. Not sure if I spoiled this or not."

","Gerald Butler and Jamie Foxx are the stars in their newest movie Law Abiding Citizen. Butler plays Clyde Shelton, when the movie starts out his family is getting robbed and then brutally murdered by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and his partner in crime Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart). Shelton talks to the DA assistant on the case Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who has already made a decision for Ames to serve in prison for ten years then will face the Death Penalty while Darby is set free after five years in prison. I have watched Butler grow in his acting career from P.S. I Love You, 300, Gamer, and his latest one before this movie the Ugly Truth with Katherine Heigl. He has shortly become one of the more popular actors. He has proved himself worthy of playing almost any role in a movie that is thrown at him. Without much spare time, i haven't been able to catch him on the tonight shows to hear him talk about his work. Foxx hasn't had as many movies come out since i saw him last in Dream Girls, but when he finds a role which is mostly a serious role in a drama type movie he plays the part well. His acting in Ray was so well done it makes you believe that he is actually the real Ray Charles. Foxx who actually sings too, has made some music off Charles music with him singing instead of Charles himself. Also Butler had a role in a Movie with music The Phantom of the Opera. Although you may have not noticed that the Phantom was him which i did not at first, just goes to show you what his capability has come to as an actor. The special effects if any were well done in this movie, if you call blowing up cars special effects.

"silentcheesedude","6","1","4","26 October 2009"," Cool, but what does it really show in the end?
","No, I'm not telling you what happens in the end. Relax.<br/><br/>So main guy Clyde, played very well by Butler, goes up against society and it's justice system because his family was murdered and one of the murderers goes free. He takes 10 years to develop a plan, and he's going to involve his original lawyer, Nick Rice, played by Foxx. Nick made a shady deal that allowed the criminals to have soft sentences. Somehow, Clyde orchestrates a series of murders, all from his prison cell, and no one can figure out how he does it. At first, Clyde goes after the bad guys, but it's soon revealed that he had a lot more in mind, such as government officials.<br/><br/>What works here is Gerard Butler. He looks like he is enjoying himself as he sits back and watches his plan unfold, teaching people ""lessons"". Sort of reminds me of Saw in that respect. What doesn't work is Foxx, or at least the script of his character. We know that he has acting chops, he played so well in 'Ray', but there's no way he convinces me as a D.A., simply because there are just too many things someone of his intelligence would never do. The movie eventually gets a bit out there in the ""real"" department because this infection of things that are improbable start affecting other things too. Since the movie is taking itself seriously, I have to come to the conclusion that it wants you to believe everything here is on the ball. I'm not sure if I enjoyed how it eventually ended, either. What did we all learn from it? How could anyone have taken the actions and words of something similar to a terrorist to heart as a comfortable life lesson? Unfortunately, we first like Clyde a lot, sympathize with him, then we are forced to hate him. You know how Charles Bronson, Rambo, or any other ""I'm gonna get you"" character is still somewhat likable in the end? Not here.<br/><br/>But let me not hit too hard because I still enjoyed the revenge-but-something-bigger-than-that based story. Some of the scenes were clever, and it did have some cool AH HA! moments. Just don't think about it too much."

It was a good idea, but the movie producers could have done so much more with it. The acting and special effects were good. Gerard Butler was exceptional with the character he had to work with.

In fact, teaching us all a lesson about America's corrupt justice system. And we are supposed to believe this as Clyde continues to murder innocent after innocent. The movie is hardly believable and the schemes Clyde concocts are not too surprising and definitely not worth the price of admission. <br/><br/>If you want to see a good action movie that actually entertains see ZombieLand instead. Wait till DVD for this one."

","Just wanted to say that this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time and is a really fun movie to go see with some friends. Gerard butler is plays his role so well and everything he says is so believable, Jamie Foxx on the other hand not so much his role was played rather blandly. Overall a great movie though and totally worth going to see it while it is in theaters. While i enjoyed this movie this movie is not for the faint of heart there is a LOT of graphic violence that many people will be disturbed by it but if you are able to look past that i think that you will have a really fun time watching this movie. What i don't understand is that why so many critics have been down on it this movie is clever and very suspenseful. Go to your nearest movie theater and see it."

","""Law Abiding Citizen"" Story: a husband/father takes revenge on the DA who let the killer of his family go virtually free. The IMDb synopsis says that the wife is raped and murdered and the husband executes a torture/killing spree, even while in prison.<br/><br/>I'm more of the psychological thriller type, but I decide to go after checking out the screenwriter, Kurt Wimmer, and watching the trailer where a couple cars blow up and flip—always fascinating for me from a crew POV.<br/><br/>But I had reservations. I was looking forward to a Friday night show, then remembered what I was going to see. As a writer, I knew the violent murder scene was going to happen right up front, so I was prepared. In fact, assuming I was going to spend a night watching gratuitous violence probably made me enjoy the movie more, because that wasn't the way the violence was handled.<br/><br/>Sure enough, the sweet dad and daughter scene we start with is interrupted less than three minutes in by the doorbell ringing. I brace myself. Apparently no one in the theater has read the synopsis or watched the trailer because they all jump when dad is cracked in the head with a 2 x 4 as he opens the door.<br/><br/>I was surprised by what they didn't do: obvious choices that would have created more uncomfortable drama. The killing and rape—in that order—was not as graphic as it could have been by a long shot. The sweet daughter is not seen suffering. Instead, they focused on the important setup of the psychology of a killer, his trauma, and the fact that he blacked out which was an integral part of the killer being released after 5 years.<br/><br/>Even the naked butt scene was an important plot point. When Gerard Butler (""300"" but also ""Phantom of the Opera"") gives himself up, and the SWAT team swarms up to his door, he strips and puts his hands in the air, thus reminding you later, that he took nothing with him except the beaded bracelet his daughter made for him on the last day of her life. But you don't forget his obvious strength when he has the opportunity to use it. And when he and the DA (Jamie Foxx, filming in Abq now for ""Due Date"") are alone together, you remember that Butler could easily tear him apart. It also shows you that he is both calm and—in case you didn't get it before—definitely crazy.<br/><br/>A moment in the first third of the movie gave the basic contrast: Foxx's 10-year-old daughter in a cello recital inter-cut with the setup of a state execution: tuning the cello, testing the syringes, etc. Again, not done for purely showing the contrast, but for plot points. <br/><br/>What I found most impressive about the film was the age-old story, the struggle of good vs. evil in a twisted situation: Is the DA evil for letting one killer off? Is the husband good for trying to teach the DA a lesson? I found the twists in the plot I didn't anticipate surprising, and when I knew exactly what was going to happen, I still enjoyed it because no one else in the theater did, based on their jumping out of their seats. <br/><br/>The only disappointment for me was the lack of a full revealing of who this dad really was. I wonder if some background was cut out of the edit, because an important phrase is never clarified, except that it is a red herring, and in this plot of many layers, just two didn't seem enough. It was what my teacher Tom Musca referred to as a refrigerator moment, when you're home from the movie for hours and are perusing the fridge when you suddenly realize one thing that didn't add up. <br/><br/>Finally, as the film winds up, you have to keep asking yourself, how is the DA going to stop this guy? You know if he just takes a gun to the prison and blows his brains out, he will be stooping to the killer's level. And then the mayor suggests he do that. And then he's there, in the cell with a gun. But the end satisfies in a way I didn't expect, yet looking back on is very simple. <br/><br/>In sum, yes, it's a pretty violent movie, especially the first third, but most of the violence is the offscreen/horrific in your mind type. But the mostly superb plot is intellectual and heartpoundingly ""fun"" to experience.<br/><br/>www.melissajwhite.com"
"SubZeroMK","10","2","14","16 October 2009"," This is probably the best drama/action/thriller I have ever seen in this decade...it deserves the IMDb top 10 spot
","WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!! I love this movie! I can't stress how amazing this movie was. It was so unpredictable the whole time. The judge office scene was amazing, I honestly did not expect that. It just adds to how badass Gerard Butler's character is, and how badass Gerard is in real life for being in this movie. This guy can not only do great comedies (the ugly truth), but he can do thrillers and action movies with flying colors (see 300).<br/><br/>Where do I start with this? Well first off, let me get this off my chest. If you decide not to see this movie just because you heard of it having gore in it, then you do not deserve to live. Simple as that really. You can't go on with your life without seeing this movie. I can only hope this movie wins an Oscar, but those only get saved for cheap Oscar bait movies like the reader and benjamin button, it's a shame the Oscars are so biased.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the plot right off the bat at the intro. The cause and effect. The effect is what gerard butler is doing as his character to anyone who let those scumbag criminals get a free pass. You kinda' hate the Jamie Foxx character at first, but then you start to understand his reasons, but you still end up rooting for gerard butler's character till end credits. The ending is great, well executed. Many people compare this movie to the Dark Knight, and gerard butler's character to the joker. I can see why, and frankly, this movie is 5 times better than the dark knight.<br/><br/>I heard of kurt wimmer before, well only when I heard that he will be directing the metal gear solid movie, and now that I've seen this movie, I can't wait to see metal gear solid directed by him, he's PERFECT for that movie. This movie just proves that he can do action espionage action even more. This movie did kinda have action espionage in it, especially Gerard's character, he was trained in that field for whomever he was working for in the past. You can kinda notice it at the opening intro of the movie when he works on something.<br/><br/>All I gotta say is, he's still a hero no matter what he did in this movie. And very badass too. This guy makes the pulp fiction lead characters look like little school girls. I can only hope that whenever I become a successful Hollywood film-maker, I can reach a step close to this movie. This is the best movie I have seen so far in the first decade of the new millennium, I don't think anything else can take the cake. Now, I wait for the day when a movie is made to surpass this.<br/><br/>Not only is this movie badass, but it just proves that revenge is ALWAYS the answer and is very sweet and satisfying. If this happened to a family member of mine, my mother, I would go nuts! I'd kill everyone responsible for it. The lesson here is: Everyone is held accountable for what they do/did. Do not pass on this movie, seriously. This is certainly a blu-ray buy in my books. 10/10 for an amazing plot, an amazing acting performance, and an amazing director with fine directing and creative skills. I really hope to work with Kurt Wimmer some day. And if anyone on the crew of this movie is reading this review, I got some pretty good news for you guys, all the shows were sold out, it was full. I wish you good luck and I hope this movie takes the box office for this, and next month so that we can see more great movies from you, Kurt. I'm really looking forward to Metal Gear Solid."

","On pe of my top favorite movies, could have got a better cast. Wish there could have been a sequel. Clyde Shelton's ( Gerard Butler ) wife gets murdered in the beginning of the movie and justice doesn't prevail because one of the killers is only sentenced for 10 years. Clyde is angry as hell and will make sure the people responsible for the horrible trial of the killers will all suffer and die. So basically you got yourself a revenge movie here. Clyde is killing them and isn't even hiding it, he admits it. Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx ) is the DA on the case and needs to find out what the hell is going on. Now the fun part is that Clyde is performing the kills from within his prison cell, he even has to sit out in solitary and is still killing people, now how cool is that."

","The last we heard from Gerald Butler, the extra-ordinary actor was holding the pass of Thermopylae in ancient Greece against the Persians. Now, he has fast forwarded to playing Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) an innovative inventive genius and a "" Law Abiding Citzen "" in typical American fashion. One day at home he, his wife and child are savagely attacked in their home by two brutal killers. Unlike his wife and child, he survives and attends the murderers' day in court. Expecting both assailants to be convicted and executed, he learns, the ambitious District Attorney Nick Rice, (Jamie Foxx) has made a deal with one of the killers. Vowing revenge, Shelton, a bitter but brilliant and resourceful individual sets a clever trap for the killer who was release and punishes him. Everyone in the District Attorney's office is reflective of their original failure, except Rice. Realizing who the culprit is, Rice now challenges Shelton to a supreme cat and mouse game to see which one will prove the superior strategist. Throughout the entire film, Shelton proves it's he and stays well ahead of the D.A. Failing to beat his adversary within the law, Rice becomes as aggressively despairing in order to win, a notion, Shelton concedes. The movie is an exciting and violent film and one wonders if the adage is indeed true. In order to beat an enemy, one must become as vicious and destructive as he is. A remarkable and undeniable truism if ever there was one. This is a milestone film for Butler and predictably will become a Classic for him. ****"

","This movie is one of the best of 2009. It was a thrill ride through the legal system. I actually feel bad for Clyde, yet this movie isn't scared to rip out your heart for your entertainment. My favorite actor is Gerard Butler and that is what makes it very exciting for me. Not only that, but this movie has great acting all around. If your watching this, cancel your plans because you will watch it, over, and over, and over. It is just that good.<br/><br/>Jamie does a good job as Nick. He was originally going to play Clyde but I am glad the film turned out the way it did. This is a well rounded film with many great actors. Take my advice.

","This movie really wins my trophy. It's focused on a father, Clyde, who gets beaten and his wife and daughter are killed by 2 crooks. However the crooks' punishment was dimmed down because of a deal made by the lawyer, Jamie Fox. 10 years later, Clyde decides to take out the entire corrupt justice system and does so in manners to where he can get his way with the system. This movie is generally aimed at the adult crowd being that there are really no fantasy characters or anything that would call for the younger crowd.<br/><br/>This movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the main character Clyde really makes this movie something memorable and just extraordinary. Clyde devises sneaky and cunning ways by taking down his victims and the whole sense on whether he is the hero or villain also adds to the excitement. My favorite part of the movie is when Clyde calls the crook on the phone and tells him that the cops are after him and lets him know how to get away without being caught. Towards the end of the conversation he tells him to take a police car that is parked near the river because there is a cop sleeping in it. He basically sets the man up because he turns out to be that police officer that is about to murder him. You can compare Clyde to the Joker pretty much, but in my opinion 10 times better. Jamie Fox also does a great job playing his character, a heroic yet corrupt lawyer.<br/><br/>Every scene you will be wondering what will happen next, because you honestly won't know. The movie has a few twists and turns and will always keep you guessing. If you want to see something that is highly suspenseful, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and includes 2 very unique and questionable characters, then you must see this movie. Law Abiding Citizen will not disappoint and I would recommend everyone to watch it."

"minky-mark","9","1","5","18 February 2010"," Great Movie! - let's discuss the ending in a good way
","OK. Well, i thought this movie was great. It had a huge amount of suspense, keeping you at the edge of your seat practically the whole movie. It was a great change for a movie with a mass murder. Instead of the boring classic of a person killing with guns or fists, they spruce it up to a more interesting matter. The acting was fantastic although the F word could have been a little bit used less. It also had some humor as well. My favorite scene was in the court room, where the judge was getting completely owned. I would highly recommend this movie. <br/><br/>now lets go to the ending which quite a few people seemed to dislike. I enjoyed the ending quite well. I don't know what people's opinion of a ""classic Hollywood ending"" is. But i don't think this was one of them. It ended fairly abrupt, but if it got too much longer, people would be complaining about the length instead of the ending. What i find quite amusing is people are whining about the ending, but they don't supply viewers with their opinion of what to change about it. What do you want to happen? - have the criminal blow up the people and the movie go on for another hour with people trying to prove him guilty? and if so, how do you expect the authorities to grip proof it was him? would you allow more people to die instead of having the mass murderer get a taste of his own medicine? I think the ending was very well played out and if people are going to criticize it they should supply viewers with what they would change. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinion, but should back it up with more than saying, ""it ended quickly.""<br/><br/>OK. this movie was incredible and i highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't get offended with violence or vulgar language. It is a great action and suspense movie and THE ENDING WAS GREAT!"

","Shelton gives us a glimpse of some of the many differences between Good and Evil People. Their choice of fantasy or reality, for example.<br/><br/>Good People, if they think about hurting someone, an innocent child, an innocent family, an innocent person of color, a not-so-innocent neighbor, boss, spouse, etc. are eventually satisfied with their fantasies of doing so. Thinking about it is not Evil.<br/><br/>Evil People, well intentioned or not, Sheldon shows us, turn their fantasies into reality.<br/><br/>Shelton is saying, to many of those Good People similarly devastated: 'It's OK to clench your fists and scream Yes!! Yes!! as you feel 'his' blood spurting out of appendages and orifices, splattering onto your appendages, your orifices, like a warm shower on an even warmer night. Yes! Yes!' <br/><br/>However... being Good People they only fantasize. Some for the rest of their lives. Some will, not many, after a while, be energized and inspired by their grief and inappropriate guilt, (never, ever, EVER will either disappear from their daily thoughts) create, in memory of their Loved One, an Organization which is all about Others Not Suffering the very same Immeasurable Pains.<br/><br/>He. Shelton, is only trying to do the same. Something, he works very hard to show, has to be done. He hopes to inspire all, to punish many. <br/><br/>Shelton also shows us, with near alacrity, that our legal system is ALMOST completely, immoral, inhumane, illegitimate. It's basic structure is so broken and flawed, not just by the Clyde Sheltons nor the Clarence Darbys of the world. <br/><br/>In many situations, way, way far too many, it is the Nick Rices, the Judges, the Police, the FBI, the Justice Department, our elected politicians and others who promulgate laws against common sense, for the egregious mechanisms used as Proof of Guilt or Innocence. Based, Shelton points out, not on moral character, rather the lack of it. <br/><br/>Increasing the number of convictions, district attorneys, police, detectives, judges, prisons based on a self-serving agenda which changes the meaning of 'Proof' into something reprehensible: it is now synonymous with, for many of those referred to above, more money, higher office, more 'troops' in the system, more power.<br/><br/>He does this quite well.

","To be honest, when I first started watching Law Abiding Citizen, I thought this was an action film. But it is more of a thriller and a good one too. This film sort of creeped me out since this kind of plot could happen in real life, I think. But, F. Gary Gray made a gritty thriller that somehow many critics hated.<br/><br/>This film is about how one guy systematically murders people while in prison due to a flawed justice system. Does a prosecutor and the city of Philadelphia have what it takes to stop this guy? <br/><br/>I heard lots of bad things about Jamie Foxx in this movie. He wasn't half bad but I wish Denzel took this role. He would have blown the movie out of the water. Gerard Butler is convincingly scary as the madman with the plots.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a time-ticking, great thriller.

","I found Law Abiding Citizen to be a great movie! From beginning to end it has you deeply interested in to what is going to happen next. The movie does a great job showing there is such a thin line between good and evil. Its take on justice is nice because it shows all sides of it when it works and when it fails mainly and how the ""citizen"" has a role in it. I noticed a lot of people are hating on the ending,sure it might not be the best but there really was no other way to end this. The only other way I see it going down was Jamie Foxx putting a bullet in the back of his head as the one guy suggested. But the real ending was much more appropriate because they finally outsmarted the guy and didn't have to stoop to his level to get the job done. I don't think a lot of people really understand the characters and how they were developed. Clyde was by no means a normal citizen he was always a bad guy who hid behind his family and was payed to murder. Now he was motivated to murder and his emotions got in his way eventually getting him caught up. Jamie nailed his role and i don't think people notice that, maybe you haven't spent enough time in a court room to know what a prosecutor is like. I think there are a lot of Jamie Foxx haters but I have always enjoyed him. He has came a far way from his role as Wanda. Nick is the ultimate prosecutor who lives his job and convicts criminals like he's on an assembly line. Weasel-like cause he will make deals with anyone but at the same time his morals are what helps him get the job done at the end of this movie. All in all, great movie! I was really impressed with everything and don't listen to all these people who think they could have wrote it better or cast it better because there was not much wrong with this. Maybe a little unbelievable at times thats why it is fiction."

He is serious and like most of the reviews they are right on target. Jamie's role is serious and very well played, showing to the World that he has a very promising career as in actor in Hollywood.

You are on the edge of your seat to find twists and turns, only to discover that Butler dug tunnels into every cell in prison, solitary cells, to do his evil deeds. The ending had a bittersweet tune to it, when you see Butler locked in in his cell trap while a bomb is trigger by him. It's moving to see him look at the bracelet his daughter made him saying simply 'daddy' seeing he only had 25 seconds to live. He cave in and found that staring at the bracelet to be the best way to go.<br/><br/>The fire flames in slow motion surrounding him before the cell explodes makes you feel a lil sorry for him, making it one of the best death scenes in movie history.

Not really brutal, one decent kill(the one with the steak bone) and everything else was very tame. First killed scene was amped up to be really gruesome, but it was completely off screen.

The pain in his eyes over the loss of his family was so real, you forget he's just acting. And the courtroom scene where Clyde almost walks on bail but then rages at the judge for her hypocrisy is mesmerizing! I think it was the best scene in the movie. My ONLY criticism is that....SPOILER ALERT....Clyde shouldn't have died in the end. Or, if he did, it should have been after he killed Jamie Foxx's (Nick's) family. Clyde's family was brutally murdered, and Nick (the prosecutor) let the killer plead out to a nominal sentence. It was Nick's choice to let that happen. Even though Clyde was able to kill most everyone else involved in his family's case, he wasn't able to take out Nick or his family. To me, it would have been justice for Nick to lose his family the way Clyde did. I hate that they all got to live. Had the ending been different, I would have given the full 10/10 stars."

","The strength of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is the great cinematography and the fine performances. The film is a thriller with the landscape of Philadelphia figuring prominently in the action. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are outstanding as the savvy city prosecutor, Nice Rice, and the mastermind of a set of killings, Clyde Shelton.<br/><br/>While the filmmakers were able to build good suspense in allowing the audience to slowly figure out how Clyde is engineering so many destructive acts from inside a prison, there were some flaws in the screenplay. Clyde was said to have a confederate, but that strand of the story was never resolved. Also, the ending did not seem in character for both Nick and Clyde. The screenwriter's imagination that was ingenious in the dastardly plots of Clyde failed him with the film's ending.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes in the film was the courtroom drama in which Clyde demonstrated to the judge the hypocrisy of the court system. His banter with the judge was spellbinding as he very nearly walked out of the courtroom a free man, then abruptly changed the dynamic to ensure that he would be sent to prison. There was also a certain irony in Gerard Butler's transformation from the apparently mild-mannered Clyde into a monster. It was clear that there were intended moments of dark comedy, especially in the prison scenes that could best be described as ""gallows humor.""<br/><br/>The film was made in 2009, prior to the enormous wave of film sequels and franchises. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" had the potential for at least one good sequel if the film had remained true to the moral ambiguity of the two lead characters. But the unfortunate ending that rendered complex characters driven by competing ethical motivations into a standard good-versus-evil world view ended all hopes for another episode of law and order in Philly."

","The movie starts losing credibility right about the time Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) turns into a killing machine. It doesn't help, once he's incarcerated, that he manages to pull off the deaths of six Department of Justice employees, including lawyer Sarah Lowell (Leslie Bibb) working for the prosecution. Not quite the way one would go about garnering sympathy for the murder of his own wife and daughter. This was almost going to be one of those films in which the viewer becomes conflicted over the inadequacies of the justice system, but it becomes pretty clear that there's no one to root for here. Not even attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), who's own frustration in dealing with Shelton turns him into an automoton seeking revenge instead of justice. Funny how a film titled ""Law Abiding Citizen"" turns out not to have any."

","This movie started off amazing! A father lost in the cause of bringing the murderers of his family to justice, waiting patently for 10 years to make his move on them. And then makes such an awesome move. I was cheering at what happens on the screen when he extracts justice on the one that got away. It was so amazing and even after that on how he plans to point out the loop-holes in the system which prevents from criminals getting what they deserve. I was soo hyped up to see what his big biblical plan will be and then came the scene where his lunch gets delayed by 8 minutes .. and that's it, the awesome movie turn into utter garbage! I couldn't really believe what I was watching. As this awesome movie, where a father fights for justice turns into a psycho-killer mayhem!!<br/><br/>What a shame. This movie was soo promising, I was soo hyped up after stumbling across it on Netflix and checking the 7+ ratings on IMDB. But this is a real let down. Its almost as if the producers fired the initial awesome director after filming the first part of the film and got someone else who unnecessarily re-wrote this into a slasher flick coz he just saw Hostel! Shame.. such shame!! A total waste of an amazing opportunity!"

I actually think Gerard Butler is a terrific actor in a dramatic film..

","'Law Abiding Citizen' has all the right ideas but its on-screen execution is nothing short of a mess. The film starts off well enough and sets up a plausible scenario, only to undo all of its efforts by going down the 'make it up as you go along' route, with the second half of the film being nothing short of silly and amateurish. It jumps from one far-fetched scenario to another, before falling flat on its face with a ridiculous ending.<br/><br/>There's enough going on to hold your attention throughout, but the second half of the film is so unconvincing that it becomes just another comic-book style action flick with zero depth or substance to any of what happens. It's disappointing given the potential that this film had and the promise that is showed in the first half or so.

","Amazing movie with a superb storyline, great acting, and enormous suspense. Many people when they watched this movie say it is also the greatest movie they have ever seen until they saw the ending, but I beg to differ. A smart man with a happy life watched as his whole life fell apart by watching his wife and child get raped. He sets out to get justice by going to the district attorney only to find out how corrupt the justice system is. Throughout 10 years he plots to destroy the corrupt justice system and to get revenge from the two men who destroyed his life. He successfully accomplishes his goal until the end of the movie, when the justice system outsmarted him. Many people again say that this is a terrible ending but in my eyes it was the best ending possible. For the people who said the movie had a terrible ending...what would of happened if he lived?... He would been alone, depressed, with no love in his life. But instead he died fighting for what he loved most, his family. If you have not watched this movie...watch it!!!

"joao-489","5","0","1","9 August 2015"," Great, but yet very disappointing movie
","This is the very first review I make for a movie, at least in any official kind of way...<br/><br/>I'm not gonna spoil the movie per say, but one may consider that what i'm about to write gives something or somethings about the movie, so if you continue to read from this point on, consider yourself warned.<br/><br/>Simply putting it, this movie is brilliant, up to a point. It keeps you on edge for almost all minutes of it, with one not knowing what it's going to happen, to whom or even how it's going to happen. I've watched many movies in my short life span, and I can't remember many movies that had this effect on me.<br/><br/>What I take from the movie is the story of a guy trying to take down a ruined justice system, after his wife and daughter were murdered, and the people responsible for it, being badly convicted for it, one being given the death sentence, and the other one, just responsible, was ""set loose"" over a technicality, most specifically, for being a cooperative witness.<br/><br/>Everything that happens in this movie, keeps you on edge, as I stated, and you see the horrifying brilliance of a man as he begins, and consequently continues his vengeance. From the begin of the movie, he plans everything to the most specific detail, and the movie is built upon his terrific brilliance, and I must say that in the movie perspective, his very good at what his doing.<br/><br/>For me, what completely killed this movie, was the fact that 99% of the time, we have to see that the ""good VS. evil battle"" ending almost always the same way, with the good winning... Not only that, but the way the movie ended, was just awful in my opinion. On one side, we have a guy that's a master mind and the very best of his business, which is, putting it shortly, killing people. On the other side, we have a counselor, that's also the best at his job, but c'mon, when on one side you have a guy that kills the way he does (and if you watched the movie, you know what I mean) and he doesn't plan for what happens in the end? C'mon Hollywood... <br/><br/>If this movie ended the way it was supposed to end, I would've given it a 10, but because the ending is so bad, and I can't even stress how bad the ending is, I give it a 5, because up to the end, the movie is brilliant, but as I've stated, the end and only the end ruined an otherwise perfect movie."

","Law Abiding Citizen is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It boasts two great performances from its two leads, Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx, they both breath life in to these characters and portray them very naturally. It's a very far fetched film, the story goes in a very ridiculous direction and I felt like it simply would have been a much more interesting and compelling film if it had stayed realistic. It is also unnecessarily violent, it was extremely graphic and unpleasant, that's not what this movie started out as and I was surprised, and honestly unimpressed, that it became such a gory mess. It has many flaws, but Law Abiding Citizen is still worth the watch and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. <br/><br/>A man vows revenge after seeing the killer of his family walk free. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jamie Foxx Worst Performance: Christian Stolte"
"Gideon24","7","0","1","16 April 2015"," Watchable despite some serious stretching of credibility
","2009's Law Abiding Citizen is an emotionally manipulative and shockingly violent crime thriller that takes films like Death Wish to a whole new level.<br/><br/>Clyde Shelton's wife and daughter were brutally murdered by a pair of home intruders and one of the killers managed a plea bargain which got him a lighter sentence in exchange for turning on his partner. Shelton, still numbed from his family's death, has his own plan on making sure the other killer gets what he deserves. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning of Shelton's revenge as he plans to punish the entire justice system through the elimination of anyone and everyone involved in the outcome of his case.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler works very hard at infusing the character of Clyde Shelton with sympathy, but he gets no help from Kurt Rimmer's screenplay, who turns the grief-stricken Shelton into a mustache twirling, one- dimensional villain. Jamie Foxx is quietly effective as the assistant district attorney on Shelton's case who brokered the deal that got one of the killers free. I was impressed that despite everything Shelton puts Foxx's Nick Rice through, he makes it clear that he does not regret his decision to broker the plea bargain because if they had gone to trial, both killers might have gone free.<br/><br/>Bruce McGill, Leslie Bibb, Regina Hall, and Colm Meaney score in supporting roles and there is a classy turn from Viola Davis as the Mayor. The film is filled with shocking, over-the-top violence that definitely makes this film for adults and the screenplay is a little talky, dragging it down in spots, but director F. Gary Gray keeps things moving at a nice pace for the most part and if you can accept Butler's channeling of Mel Gibson and some of the things that Shelton is able to do from inside a jail cell, it's a pretty entertaining ride."
"juneebuggy","8","0","1","28 March 2015"," Super entertaining revenge thriller, with a twist
","I enjoyed this one a lot despite the ridiculous ending. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler both do a decent job, Foxx plays it cool as the driven prosecutor/dad and Butler, well I was definitely rooting for the bad guy with his character... up to a point, then he just goes from anti-hero to psycho/serial killer, very violent and kinda scary actually as he is unstoppable. A clever plot in that respect.<br/><br/>""Release me by 6am."" ""Or what?"" ""I kill everyone"" -Hard to have much compassion for ""that"" guy.<br/><br/>The story follows Butler as Clyde Shelton, a family man who takes justice into his own hands after his wife and daughter are brutally murdered in a home invasion and his hotshot prosecutor fails to deliver justice. When a plea bargain sets one of the killers free, he wages a deadly vigilante campaign targeting not only the killer but also the district attorney and others involved in the deal.<br/><br/>I liked figuring this one out. Initially not much makes sense and I was surprised by the 10 year time leap as we try to understand why Butler lets himself get arrested (naked) and how he is able to do what he's doing from behind bars. How is he his own accomplice? (this made a whole lot more sense once it was revealed that he had been a former spy/assassin). <br/><br/>Sure its all a bit absurd at times, more violent than I expected too but an original thriller that tries to make a social statement; the system is corrupt. 3/17/15"
"Christopher91786","10","0","1","28 August 2014"," Moral Compasses Beware! You May Not Leave Unbent.
","I watched this film in theaters. Perhaps, I'm not as sophisticated as the other folks here (or, perhaps, coming from a family of spooks and as a victim of similar circumstances to who I consider the protagonist, anti-hero figure played by Butler), I see this film in a completely alternative light.<br/><br/>The complaints of the to reviews appear to be that the audience sides with the seeming antagonist, Butler. To them, we should never want to side with such a sadistic monster. We should want to feel sexual voyeuristic pleasure/stimulation at the rape. We should NOT praise the antagonist, Butler for the actions against his family, or the people who destroyed a meaningful justice. But, really, who are we kidding, that wasn't the point of the film at all, now was it? The title: Law Abiding Citizen, says something about the character played but Butler. He suffers a grievous loss: his wife, his daughter. When he goes through the process of trusting the system, trusting those sworn to protect, instead of meeting the rightful just ends he and his family deserve, the true monster being punished for his crimes, we see the system break down and fail this family. The audience is intended to feel compassion for this person, to feel sympathy and a sense of comradery with this seeming anti-hero.<br/><br/>The film is indeed dark. It's breaking the expected norms: It's akin to a dark comic book vigilante film, and in many ways takes those dark stories and their characters dark roads of vengeance a step further.<br/><br/>The film asks us a question: When the system fails us, when it drives us to the brink, what might one person do to get the justice the innocent deserve? It's about following all of the rules only to be shafted by what has been reported in recent years: not a corruption of knowing intention, but a corruption of disinterested malfeasance. People do not care enough about rightful justice to see it be fulfilled.<br/><br/>The real ""enemy"" or ""antagonist"" in the film is really meant to be Foxx's character, a prosecutor so concerned with his conviction record that he allows himself to blur the lines between ""justice"" and ""injustice"". We recognize that he's been doing it for a great deal of time. One doesn't suddenly start blurring one's morality chart overnight. It's a long and dedicated process of corruption. It's a slippery slope, and Foxx's character appears to have taken it. He promises, swears to Shelton to bring him and his family ""justice"", but the justice he brings is weak. It's not a failed conviction in court -- it is not two people getting off because the testimony and case against them was not strong enough, we never got that far, he makes a deal with the devil, he takes the petty thief for the true monster. It becomes the story of a corrupt, broken legal system, our system. It is a story making us question our civic values and philosophically ponder the lines of justice. We know who the true villain of the story is: the murderer, the man who single-handedly kills Shelton's wife. The next villain is Foxx's character: the selfish hubris and pride of a man concerned only with his success -- trading justice for personal gain. The victim is Shelton who takes steps right out of a Greek tragedy to recoup his losses, and we find ourselves in final support for the anti-hero, Shelton.<br/><br/>Butler and Foxx provide excellent emotion. You feel yourself becoming affixed to the character. You WANT Shelton to win, but you also feel, the whole time, that you shouldn't be. You know he's in the wrong too, that what he's doing is somehow malfeasance, but you can't stop yourself from caring about him. You want Shelton to teach those corrupt and apathetic figures to suddenly gain an understanding of what pain feels like. Shelton isn't trying to destroy Foxx or anyone else (other than the true villain; aside from punishing his compatriot who should have stopped him), he's trying to teach them a lesson: to care about the victims and not themselves. He's teaching them to feel pain and loss. He's teaching them to hurt and feel pain, to no longer be disconnected from the justice they serve.<br/><br/>In the end, I suspect these viewers miss the underlying theme of the story, a theme going back to Greek Drama and Epics. When the gods of Olympus no longer serve us, when we fight against the terrors of the world and nature, what are we left to do but take matters into our own hands or die? Shelton represents the human desire to not surrender to an injustice, but to be consumed by grief and revenge. It teaches us that our moral compasses can be bent into a truly awkward stance, and we learn quite a bit about our human nature in the process. Perhaps, the reviewers were more terrified with what they found in themselves, than anything happening on screen? This film is for a mature audience (age being beside the points). Go in with an open mind and be prepared for a psychological trip down a hole even the White Rabbit would find queer."

","Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) lost his family to two killers. The guys are caught but the case goes south. D.A., Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is a wheeler dealer who has a 96% success rate. When some evidences get thrown out, Rice decides to do a deal with one perpetrator to convict the other. Years later, the execution is tampered with and goes terribly wrong. The other killer with the deal is also brutally murdered. Rice suspects Shelton but he only has circumstantial evidences. Shelton wants to show the justice system as being too lenient and he's willing to kill everybody in the system to prove it.<br/><br/>There is a problem of where the rooting interest for the audience should lie. Also there is the insane convoluted plot. Obviously one should never root for the crazy guy but why would a selfish lawyer be a compelling protagonist. Butler needs to play his character descending into outlandish crazy lunacy. Then there are all the crazy ways that he kills. It seemed cool and clever on my first viewing. However it doesn't work with more than one viewing. It becomes ridiculous with more contemplation. It's stupider and stupider. It wants to say something profound but ends up making an idiotic action thriller."

","Finally here's a film that really shows the justice system for what it really is, and the frustration of the victims who've lost their loved ones the account of scum. The story puts a new after twist for the catalyst, and for it's originality factor, makes it a film that's super intriguing and exciting, if a little daring. If only justice could be delivered the way, wronged victim (Gerard Butler) who witnessed his wife and kid being slaughtered (and the movie doesn't waste any time, showing this scene) the world would be a better and safer place, or on the flip side of that coin, could make it a world of turmoil and mayhem. This film shows us how justice should really work. Plea bargains suck and in this case they really suck, where the real murderous hand gets off, with an easy sentence, where justice is delivered supremely on this victim, thanks to the methodical and calculating mind ex CIA expert, Butler. The much weaker, younger, and vulnerable killer may turn you off executions, where his equipment is corrupted with. LAC is a purely a vengeance tale, straight down, where everyone associated with Butler's trial the trail, pays, unavoidably escaping Butler's searing vengeance. The way a female magistrate buys it, is a killer. I really hadn't heard of Gerald Butler, thinking that he was a newbie, until this film, realizing he's been around (300, Timeline) the latter a movie I wished I'd never seen. Some of the scenes of vengeance are bloody brutal like that of the main killer, whose remains are a butcher show, plus an inmate getting stabbed by Butler who becomes incarcerated, but still has his people do his work outside. I must say the last fifteen minutes were preposterous, but what's a movie without a bit of escapism, and this is indeed the perfect vehicle for that. Lovers of revenge, this is your type of flick, which will probably satisfy you, the way those Spit On My Grave movies do. I know that main perpetrator, would be a grave, I'd definitely spit on."

The big hitting critics hated it, with comments ranging from it being sub-normal, preposterous, ugly and morally corrupt, to it being a comic book film of moral hectoring! Naturally, as the critics were at pains to point out that it would, it made a pot load at the box office and is generally well liked by a good portion of the action/revenge/thriller loving populace.<br/><br/>There's always a big grey area with revenge/vigilante movies that really brings out the debate crowd, but what rarely gets said is that through the actions of these cinematic waste layers is the chance for many, many, folk to live vicariously. Yes! 99% of the common man and woman do indeed sit back and trust our respective legal systems to do what's right and just, but oh how we feel that given similar circumstances we would want to vent spleen with furious anger.<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is a riot, at its heart it does have something to say, even asking some pertinent questions. Do these social smarts come bursting through the bloody haze to make a point? No, they get submerged in a whirl of kinetic fury and socko violence, but they are there, caustically so. But hey!

","There are dozens of prison dramas where convicts try to persuade their innocence and most of the plot is based on letting viewers to guess are they right and whom to blame - some of them have even got Academy Awards or nominations at least. Law Abiding Citizen is ""plain"" in that sense: viewers are let to know about the guiltiness and the person in question does not deny it. Nevertheless, interesting twists and turns begin, a real cat-and-mouse play between legal personalities and a criminal mastermind. And here, at first, weaknesses of democracy are clearly visible - as solid proof is very hard to obtain. Anyway, the thrill is maintained throughout the movie (well, sometimes at the expense of rather improbable scenes, i.e. escapes and passing through high-level security), although the final 20 minutes are a bit protracted.<br/><br/>The cast is evenly strong, first and foremost the leading performers Jamie Foxx, Gerald Butler and Viola Davis in a memorable supporting role.

","This is a true example of a meticulous complex storyline that really pays off at the end. The way the film is portrayed shows you everything from the beginning and leaves you all the clues, it does not hide the fact that Clyde played by Gerard Butler is the cause of all of the deaths and that he has had everything figured out form the start. Instead we see everything through the eyes of Nick, payed by Jamie Foxx, and he is the fundamental character who we are going to follow through Clyde weird and twisted games.<br/><br/>WIth this in mind I couldn't help but get a feel of some Saw rip off with the part at the beginning with the torturing and with cutting parts off and filming it, which kind of ruined this part of the story line for me, but on the positive Clyde's intense planning couldn't help but give me a sense of the Joker form batman, how he was always one step a head of the game and that ultimately the Jokers planning is one of his down sides was he becomes arrogant and doe snot think to protect himself form every possibility, in this was Butlers character was extremely interesting the watch.<br/><br/>The way that film was portrayed was fairly standard, but what was good was the use of the environment creating scenes which were kind of fake and inaccurate, to portray how synthetic the situation is, and how it is so extreme.<br/><br/>Never the less I enjoyed this film, their were holes in the storyline and unnecessary death but it did what it set out to do and there was no moment in this film where I found myself bored or not properly appreciating the situation.

","Film Review: Law Abiding Citizen (2009)<br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is a crime drama film released in 2009 and directed by F. Gary Gray. A genius inventor, Clyde Shelton, turns vigilante when the man who murdered his family is set free by the corrupted justice system. He seeks to bring justice into his own hands and take down the system.<br/><br/>The main characters featured in the film are Jamie Foxx as Nick Rice and Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton. Law Abiding Citizen is set in Pennsylvania, USA in our current time. Shelton's family is murdered by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and the blame falls on his accomplice in the robbery, Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart). Darby was released because of lack of convicting evidence and Ames was sentenced to execution. Seeing this angered Shelton so he took matters into his own hands.<br/><br/>Soon thereafter, Ames' execution went horribly wrong and Darby was found tortured, mutilated and eventually killed; to quote: ""I took his fingers with bolt cutters, his toes with tin snips, his balls with a hacksaw, and his penis with a box cutter. How's that for specifics?!"" Shelton is imprisoned because the Police think he has become a vigilante and taken justice into his own hands. Rice does not think Shelton as a serious threat; even after his imprisonment, people continue to die left, right and center around Rice. He has to put a stop to these, but Shelton is still in solitary confinement. He told Rice that his aim is to kill these corrupt individuals and eventually bring the whole system to its knees. <br/><br/>This film is a fast-paced thriller guaranteed to keep everyone on the edge of their seats wanting more. I found this film completely realistic and enthralling right till the end. I would definitely recommend this film to adults because - of the MA rating – it gives a chilling insight to the corrupt justice system and how smart-minded criminals can be. In the end, it is up to you to decide who the real hero in the film was. Not all is what it seems on the surface and even top officials can be corrupt. Also, never make deals with murderers."

","LAW ABIDING CITIZEN has all the trademarks of a great film. A non-linear plot, plenty to say about the state of the world today, some tough performances and explosive sequences. Best of all, it blurs the line between good and evil so that you're never quite sure who you're supposed to root for, which guy's the villain and which guy's the hero.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler stars as the ordinary man whose family is killed in a burglary gone wrong. Butler then undergoes a startling transformation as he sets up a campaign of revenge against all those who failed to bring the killers to justice. The film goes from there, starting off dark and becoming increasingly more bleak as the running time goes on.<br/><br/>It has plenty of incident to keep it running along, and some great scenes: Butler's manipulation of the prison regulations, for instance, or the way he manages to wage his vendetta from the INTERIOR of his prison cell. But, along the way, the film's sense of realism diminishes until we end up with a completely ludicrous event at the end which is designed to bring closure. It's not on par with, say, EAGLE EYE for suspension of disbelief, but it's getting there. It's just a shame, as with some tighter writing this could have been a truly great movie. It turns out to be an intriguing oddity, instead.<br/><br/>Butler is good as the 'bad guy', effectively channelling some of that Leonidas rage. But, as usual, Jamie Foxx is completely out of his depth as the lawyer. He's a vacuum of talent, an empty space in the middle of the movie surrounded by other, better, more seasoned performers. It's a shame, as the combination of rubbish actor and rubbish ending scupper this movie's best intentions."

","Apart from the gripping tale, all to the end, it should've ended like this still keeping the audiences thoughts and mind bending towards evaluating that extenuating circumstances, in a man's life cannot be experienced until he is deep under waters. **spoiler alert** they bring back the bomb back to shelton's cell. and he dials the number. It blows up the cell.. blah blah!! not how it should've ended. The whole reason Shelton does all the killings, is to prove one point. That the law should show no prejudice based on the evidence, or the counsel's maneuvering the witnesses, or the prosecutions cutting deals to maintain the conviction rates. Like he said, .. ""it's an imperfect system, and they it's imperfect servants.. "" but two imperfections should make a perfect justice. If they are willing to take the gloves off, when dealing with shelton, just cuz he was a worthy opponent.<br/><br/>Alternate ending: the bomb is placed in shelton's cell.. but he doesn't' trigger that one, but triggers another that doesn't kill the mayor but instead destroy's a room not filled with people.., proving his tact..shelton instead shows a video that if they can play dirty,.. he already did.. (by showing his wife and kid in a room with a bomb next to them, ask him to make a hard choice.. and tell nick to live with it..) , shelton, still two steps ahead of the game, nick admits defeat ..then nick confesses his guilt in public to the press that he cut the deal, to protect his conviction rate.. and that it's an imperfect system where tampered evidences or counsel taking defense for such criminals make this insane society look sane to people's eyes ,.. his wife and kid watch him.. with disgust.. and finally a few years later the media announcements that .. cutting deals for convictions.. would not be part of the law.. and that amendments would be put in practice to make people believe in law... "" that law abiding is also .. law believing.."" .. shelton vanishes.. but watches from somewhere far off .. nick and his family.. now together .. and shelton looks at his family picture and smiles.. !!<br/><br/>The words or the framed sentences might not be perfect but i think.. you would get the idea.. :)"

","I've seen Law Abiding Citizen a few times now and despite feeling that film would be poorer on the second viewing it was not the case. For me it's an intense thriller experience which explores the two main characters (Played by Butler and Foxx) in great depth. Many people seem to complain about how they were expecting more violence, but the style of the film is to emphasise the importance of the scenes of violence in terms of the deep human emotions of the lead character, without making an hour and thirty minutes of grotesque torture.<br/><br/>You sympathise with Butler's character and accept the motives behind his actions; the main themes are morality and the justice system which in my opinion is the enemy in this film. The film does frustrate as the ending is a little 'Hollywood' and unrealistic which detaches itself from the gritty realism of the rest of the movie. It is also very hard to agree on who is the real hero in the film at first we are supposed to back 'Clyde' a man who has everything taken from him but as the story goes on we are supposed to take a more liberal view by backing 'Nick Rice' and the authority figures.<br/><br/>The film is very good at exposing visible flaws with the justice system and taps into the misconceptions of morality. Overall it's a fairly clever, well paced gripping thriller slightly let down with the clichéd ending."
"hypersonic8999","7","0","2","1 February 2012"," Amazing movie ruined by a ridiculous ending
","This film is simply amazing. It shows how extremely far one will go to satisfy his sense of justice, after he was disappointed by a bureaucratic legal system. Basically, Clyde was a victim of a home invasion by 2 criminals who raped and killed his wife and daughter and left him dying. He is also a technician for the CIA, where he invents various gadgets for use by field agents. One of the criminals gets the lethal injection while the other walks free after confessing to the crime and basically blaming everything on his partner, whereas it was him that was the ""brains"" in the home invasion. So Clyde goes on a rampage, first messing up the lethal injection of the convicted-to-death criminal, so he will suffer more upon dying, then torturing the other criminal vigorously and then going after the people who were involved in the trial. At every turn he outsmarts agent Nick, who is trying to stop Clyde. The plot is simply amazing, filled with twists and amazing dialogue, without having the ""bad"" and ""good"" guy, but instead two people who are defending their own values and sense of justice.<br/><br/>Most will find this film amazing, as did I, however the ending is what disappoints. This film could have gone to the top of my list, but instead it lies somewhere in the middle, simply because the whole movie is ruined by the last 20 minutes. In a very weird, unconventional and unrealistic way, agent Nick, discovers miraculously how Clyde was conducting his crimes while he was in a prison cell (the deus machina comes in the form of Nick's assistant/partner who uses conducts in the Colombian government (?) to find out about the purchases that Clyde has done in the past which leads them to an abandoned warehouse, where they stumble upon, again miraculously, on a secret passage going to the prison cell of Clyde). The obsession of writer Kurt Wimmer, with the ""good and righteous guys"" always winning ruins otherwise good films and plots, such as this. My advice is, watch the movie up until the last 20 minutes and then turn it off and imagine your own ending. Otherwise, you'll be bitterly disappointed. Kurt Wimmer does the same mistake in Salt, where the ending is again ridiculously devised in a way that the ""good guys"" will win."
"jack_face","Null","0","2","20 January 2012"," One scene in particular you won't forget.
","It's worth paying for at a good dollar theater. Solid acting, solid plot, graphic in some places, keeps you guessing in others, a good dose of suspense, and an acceptable climax. It could very well have an alternate ending because it could go either way in my opinion. Not gonna spoil anything. It also seems like there's some cut exposition scenes because in some places, they just use dialogue instead of flashback which I think would have been more appropriate.<br/><br/>Foxx and Butler do a good job here. I don't have a whole lot of complaints other than lack of flashback for Butler's character and the ending which I thought was going one way but went another. Like I said, it's acceptable. Maybe on the DVD/Blu-ray we'll get those extra scenes and alternate ending. One scene stands out above all others. Death by cell phone! You never see it coming, you don't know when it's gonna happen. It comes totally out of left field. The auditorium I saw it in had no more than 20 people in it but when that scene happened, everyone jumped and gasped and there was lingering laughter and jovial cussing afterwards. Some of that can be attributed to reacting to other people's reaction. It was one of those movie moments you don't forget. And not just the movie itself but being there in the auditorium when it happens because of the reactions. For that alone, LAC goes down in my history books. It was unforgettable. I give the movie 7 out of 10 stars."
"perkypops","6","0","3","23 September 2011"," Is it such a flawed end?
","My first reaction to this film was to fault what seems like an unsatisfactory end to a story that builds up its attack on flawed judicial systems with their preoccupation with career, politics, anything but justice. I still feel it fails to a point but I do understand the final reasoning a little better. Shelton (Butler) obtains the oblivion he seeks, whilst Rice (Foxx) must live with a conscience that will catch up with him sometime. Perhaps there was justice after all.<br/><br/>Butler plays the ""law abiding citizen"" almost to perfection once he knows the law is no longer abiding to his reality. Bereft of his family, his reasons for being, he has no alternative than to use his flair, his genius, to seek to change others. That he plays his cards so wistfully is unsurprising given the triple whammy he suffers through fate. That he should seek to change such an odious set up as the one portrayed through Foxx's ambitious, duplicitous, and hypocritical character, is wholly commendable. That he commits murder along the way becomes logical within the story if unacceptable in real life.<br/><br/>But there is little morality within this tale, from the failure of the law enforcers, through to the bitterness of the battle between Shelton and the State machinery. Both sides are riddled with flaws. And perhaps that is the central point of the whole picture. Personally I would have preferred an ending where Shelton's character is always one step ahead of Rice and they perish together in the final scene - a real justice given what has gone before.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty strong throughout and makes up for some of the flaws in the storyline. A competent movie but it may just upset people for all the wrong reasons. Six out of ten."

","Gerard Butler who played the Phantom of the Opera in 2004 plays Clyde, one man who wants to clean up the problems in the US Justice system and avenge the murder of his wife and daughter. In a way, this role is not unlike the Phantom. Especially when he gets that murderer and kills him and dismembers him in the most painful way possible. His continuation of a series of people involved with the case is quite a series of killings.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx plays the DA involved in the case who lets Clyde's wife's killer walk free after 5 years in order to get a death sentence to the guy who did not kill them. Foxx is a man who as part of the justice system compromises justice in order to get his own personal conviction records. He is as flawed as the system he is a part of.<br/><br/>What works here is the time clock effect because Clyde is saving the DA for last because he wants him to suffer through all the others deaths before then. The film becomes a race against time for Foxx to save himself, and while the ending is a bit different, Foxx DA does exactly what you'd expect him to do. He figures out how Clyde is doing it and then compromise his principles yet one more time and lets Clyde kill himself.<br/><br/>In a way there is a delicious sequel here as Foxx is so compromised by this ending, should have the story continued on how he continues to compromise the justice system, or will he just let his ego continue the way he has this entire movie? Butler & Foxx perform well in this movie. Their characters are the movie and leaving Foxx corrupt DA compromised at the end makes me wonder if there could be a sequel coming as justice does not win in this one."

","When you watch a movie about revenge, you want to root for the hero all the way thru the movie and feel sympathetic even when the hero has to resort to violence (e.g. The Brave One, Taken, The Fugitive). Here we have a person who has experienced a great tragedy and has every reason to want revenge. Which is precisely the emotion that I'm sure was intended for the viewers as well. In this movie, the villains are not restricted to the original perpetrators. The Law and the lawyers who manipulate it are also villains in this movie. Initially it appears as if the hero, Gerard Butler, is going to enact his revenge on the Law by means of the great wealth of law knowledge that he clearly absorbed during the 10 years since his unfortunate tragedy. The court scene and initial prison interrogation scenes are brilliant and you can really start to see where an intelligent scriptwriter could have taken this movie to a breathtaking level. Instead, the revenge enacted by the hero becomes too bloodthirsty and the hero stops being a sympathetic character in my opinion. This is where the movie quickly got off track leading to the extremely ungratifying ending. The pursuit of retribution should have followed a more intellectual path, which is where it appeared to be headed.<br/><br/>How much better and sympathetic would this movie have been had the hero exacted his revenge against the legal system by staging assassinations of other violent sex offenders who he had researched over the years that were free due to some legal finagling rather than the lawyers and judges themselves? Imagine Foxx and his legal team trying to outwit Butler, while these sex offenders are mysteriously dying while Butler is still in prison. Tell me that's not a better movie."

","What can you learn from this movie?<br/><br/>There is two types of ethics, what you can follow. But only one at the same time. as Max Weber says, the ethic of conviction and the ethic of responsibility. <br/><br/>The ethic of conviction means, that you, for example, never lie. What you feels, is correct and good. The ethic of responsibility means, that, each of your action is being rationally computed caring about all the consequences. See more in Dostoievskij's Karamazov Brothers the conversation of reborn Jesus (conviction) against the Great Inquisitor (responsibility). <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie, Shelton is the man, who is forced to be the man of conviction. I feel sorry for him and understand his behavior. Nick Rice, the working class hero of the system seems like a guy of responsibility. <br/><br/>After 10 years we realize that Nick Rice is forced to be a man of conviction and Shelton turned out to be the perfect responsibility-thinking criminal, a real genius. He spent the last 10 years planning to create a diabolic burning hell to all of his enemies, Rice at the first place. <br/><br/>Shelton exchange his ethic to Rice's.

","""Law Abiding Citizen"", the irony in the title wasn't lost on myself and no doubt will it have been on the movie going audience. But what is ironic about Hollywood execs. Is that they attempt to shovel out films that will have mass appeal and will speak to them on their level but the result can be that they end up insulting the intelligence of their core audience. And no more may this be the case than with LAC. A film that had so much potential considering It's contentious subject matter. <br/><br/>Scots actor and heartthrob Gerard Butler is Clyde Shelton, the ""Law Abiding Citizen"" of the title. A seemingly happy family man who when the movie opens is left helpless in his own home when two thugs break in, incapacitating him while one of them proceeds to brutally rape and murder his wife and kill his five year old daughter. Following the aftermath the two thugs are captured and when their case goes to court the one criminal who didn't commit the brutal rape and slaying s is given the death sentence while the other gets a more lenient five year sentence for testifying against him. Shelton is of course angered by the deal that was made, partially facilitated by prosecuting assistant district attorney, Nick Rice played by Jamie Foxx. Ten years later Shelton wages a one man campaign of terror against those who he holds responsible for what happened to his wife and daughter including those who had a hand in the morally questionable deal that was made in court that has left one of the criminals now a free man.<br/><br/>What is lamentable about LAC is that here we have what might have been an intelligent and maybe even a potentially searing indictment on the American justice system,(or many similar legal justice systems the world over) as well as even the more baser aspects of human nature that bubble to the surface when the demand for justice is so great that it might corrupt our very soul. But rather than aim for offering a film of philosophical substance that might provoke thought and debate, writer Kurt Wimmer the man behind the ponderous, futuristic action thriller ""Equilibrium"" opts more for a slick, routine thriller which panders to those looking for gratuitous thrills. <br/><br/>Firstly though, what Wimmer fails to explore and illustrate is the moral reaction by both the media and the general public. Any attempt at televisual interviews, news reports and vox pops or outside court scenes are brushed aside so we are only afforded an insular account of the ramifications of Shelton's actions so that we only witness how it effect those he targets. None of the backlash against the justice system, the Mayors office etc. is explored to an extent that it seems not only lethargic but ludicrous. While we the audience are left slightly baffled as to who are allegiances are supposed to lie with. Yes, it's supposedly made clear that we're ultimately supposed to be rooting for Rice but when your main protagonist is an egotistical, ADA who initially appears apathetic towards Shelton and his situation and aloof to the point of no-see-um, there seems to be little if anything to empathise with. Foxx an accomplished actor is handicapped with a two-dimensional emotionless role to the extent that even in his scenes where he vents what might amount to any kind of anguish or violent reprisal towards Butler is stilted and never rings true. Butler on the other hand while fine and you initially find yourself feeling his pain. The clumsy handling of his character means that Shelton descends in to being less a man on a mission than a perverse anarchist or serial killer. Picking off his victims more for the hell of it. Any righteous rage or anger even when he confronts his wife and daughter's killer is left subdued. Thus any sense of who has the moral high ground is left indistinguishable from who doesn't. The dubious hero is revealed to be a sanctimonious hypocrite while his opponent becomes an indiscriminate murderous socio-path. Any attempts to attribute any kind of humanity in Rice seem insincere to the point where you find yourself contemptuously uttering to yourself, ""Yeah, right!""<br/><br/>Perhaps needlessly graphic in some of It's more violent scenes, director F. Gary Gray to grant him some kudos somehow manages to illicit some if little interest in proceedings and manages not to let the movie's pace run away from itself. Although any gradual build up of tension or what should be shocking moments when they hit the screen, we're left anything but exhilarated. Everything is so methodical that it's as if it were painted by numbers. Pyrotechnics although decent can't compensate for mediocre orchestration with a plot that in it's final act veers in the to realms of the preposterous with a plot twist which defies any real rationale and laughs in the face of logic. <br/><br/>Solid support from Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill although while it slightly elevates the films slight standards also only serves to highlight that quality actors are being wasted on flimsy material. While it may surprise you to discover that LAC Isn't a total dire mess and It's partially lifted by Grays slick if workmanlike direction. It's lamentably much less that it might have been and will appeal only to those who favour a glossy sheen and tawdry thrills to studious character development and substance of a social nature that made ""Natural Born Killers"" more rewarding."

However, his enemies are strangely falling victim to inexplicable attacks and there is no perpetrator in sight. Inexplicability of the attacks and Clyde's continuously taunting district attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is what keeps the momentum in the movie. It is all entertaining and fun but the end the movie fails to deliver. When you find out how the attacks were actually carried out, you will be like ""What!?? Really??!!"".

Now in ""Law Abiding Citizen"", he's getting the adulation from the smart viewers all the while looking intimidating, carrying that rage that's brewing in him throughout the film. <br/><br/>The opening scene in the movie commences with a break-in in which Clyde Shelton's (Butler) wife and daughter are killed. During the trial, attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) negotiates that the killer will serve five years in jail and his accomplice will get the death penalty. This doesn't sit very well for the angered Clyde feeling that the accomplice was got the worst end of the sentence. Ten years later, we see a vengeful Clyde ready to take justice in his own hands. But Nick is dumbfounded as he tries to elaborate the motives behind Clyde's motives. <br/><br/>What differs this movie from F. Gary Gray's previous project, ""The Negotiator"" the action gets fueled up a notch. And while Foxx and Butler's pairing pales in comparison to Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey, the twists and turns in ""Law Abiding Citizen"" will keep you enthralled. But the motives behind the proceedings take an upsetting backseat. <br/><br/>Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer manages to pull off a handsome solution to the conclusion of the film, but it's unclear of what they were trying to get at. It boggles the mind as to whether Wimmer pondered with more than one conclusion and I have doubts as to whether the one he selected was a wise decision. The premise was well in intentions, but the ending left me with an empty unsatisfying feeling. Others may feel differently about it saying it was the perfect way to wrap up this movie. What irks me is that the justice in the end remains unclear.<br/><br/>Overall it was an honor to watch. The tension brewing between Foxx and Butler was a treat for the eyes. The supporting cast backs up the two leads, but it's the duo of Foxx and Butler that carry the film. Though not as strong as ""The Negotiator"" but the entertainment is well above average."

","This movie is wonderful, I never get enough of this movie anyhow. I think they should make a movie called ""Another Law Abiding Citizen"" only this time a woman should be the law abiding citizen. I think Kathleen Turner is my choice because she played a murderer in Serial Mom. Charlize Theron can be the next choice because she played a serial killer in the movie Monster. Amanda Plummer should have that role because she played an axe murderer in the movie So I Married an Axe Murderer. Shannen Doherty should be good for the part because she is the Beverly Hills 90210 bad girl. Stockard Channing (real name Susan Stockard) makes an excellent judge. Instead of Philadelphia, how about Miami Florida, or Los Angeles California?"

Clyde is very upset the one who did the killing got away.<br/><br/>Jump 10 years ahead and the execution is taking place. Something goes wrong with the lethal injection and investigation begins. Soon they are after Darby, but Darby is a set up. Clyde has vengeance on his mind and takes care of Darby in a very gruesome manner. We now know Clyde is more than an average man. The rest of the movie is a game he plays with Nick. How is he still doing the killing while in jail? And the answer to the whole thing was a really good twist I didn't see coming.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Check it out but don't read any spoilers beforehand."

","The Film starts out our Main Character CLYDE SHELTON is working on a new invention, we get a decent close-up of a necklace his daughter made him, which he wears as a bracelet(this symbolizes his humanity) when getting the door he and his wife and daughter are attacked, his wife raped and stabbed, he stabbed bound, helpless, his daughter is taken to a back room, were all we know is that she is killed, we jump to the trail where Jamie Fox's Character Nick Rice, assistant D.A. for Philadelphia breaks the news to Clyde that he's made a deal to get one of the two men on death row, and the other, pretty much Scot free, Clyde doesn't like that, and tries to reason with nick to go the other way and take it to trial, Nick refuses.<br/><br/>Ten Years later, one of the men who killed Clyde's family is killed in a painful manor, aside from the painless execution he was supposed to be given by state law, they find a lead which leads them to the other man, his name is DARBY, who via Clyde escapes, unknowing to him Clyde is pulling all the strings.<br/><br/>From this point in the movie if you haven't already guessed this is by far the most entertain and most creatively ingenious movie of the year, Pitting Clyde, an EX-BRAIN(which are better killers than spies.), puts his wit and his creativity to the dedication of destroying and re fixing the justice system to put it on a tighter leash, his initial goal is to get Nick Rice to learn consequences for his actions and to be a more severe District Attorney, Clyde admits at one point that this whole thing could've been avoided had Nick taken the case to trial win or lose, but this fails, Nick refuses to see any guilt until it is needed via the death of 6 other Assistant D.A. one whom he has a bonded relationship with as a Mentor and Teacher, who continuously questions her motive for choosing law.<br/><br/>This film pulls no punches, and as said before is a masterpiece of intellect the likes that haven't been seen all year, or even most of last year aside from the epic DARK KNIGHT, this movie in any case a win, never slowing down and makes you feel what it wants you to feel, as an example, there are a few scenes where Nicks daughter is playing at a recital and even though you know this movie is going to be crazy, you can't help but feel a warm heart, as well when Clyde Kills a certain Character with a sniper rifle you feel nothing short of an Adrenaline rush from the sheer shock and timing of this event.<br/><br/>All in all the only downside is the way the film ends, it particularly didn't sit right with me, but that's what keeps it away from perfection, This movie is pretty damn good, it get's all your detective senses working to find how Clyde is doing all of this or if he has someone working with him and who? 4.5/5 9.5./10 stars, i recommend it if you enjoy a good intellectual action movie"

","This grisly tale is full of suspense. It does not pander to the current gross-out lust that permeates many recent thrillers. The story is intense and the sadistic violence is worthy of Hannibal Lector, but most of the ugliness takes place off-camera. Be advised: This is a profoundly intense movie! It will give you the creeps but, unlike many recent gore-fests, it is not a film you will wish you could un-see. It is, rather, a movie that invites multiple viewings. Anthony Hopkins move over! Gerard Butler is quite adept at playing the charming genius monster! That sums it up, but since IMDb requires 1000 words I will press on. Jamie Foxx is unremarkable in his role as assistant district attorney, but his performance is adequate. Gerard Butler upstages the rest of the cast. Bruce McGill who plays the district attorney has been a favorite of mine going back to his role in Animal House. Colm Meany is endearing as he aids Jamie Foxx in pursuit of our diabolic villain.

","There have been plenty of movies with a similar theme and everyone who only has seen Gerald Butler playing the nice (romantic lead) characters might be in for a very big surprise. But then again, he has shown that he can carry action movies (300, Gamer etc.), but this is the first time he goes that dark. Empire Magazine said, that because nobody seemed to want that role, Butler who also is a producer on the movie, decided to take the role and leave the character he wanted to play at first to Jamie Foxx!!! <br/><br/>If you watch the movie you will understand why. You might also get the feeling that there have been many re-writes and that the ending feels a bit ... well rushed. While another director was attached to this, he parted ways over creative differences. And again I'm sure he wanted a different ending. And I also think that there could have been something else at the end.<br/><br/>My other problem was, that someone did spoil me the ending of the movie. Not very nice, but what can you do? She didn't do it on purpose, but I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more, if I hadn't known what was coming (although ""enjoy"" might be the wrong word here).<br/><br/>As stated above, this is not for the faint-hearted, because it is brutal and it is graphic in it's depiction (and that was the cut they showed in cinemas ... on DVD/Blu Ray it's even a bit ""stronger"").

"jacq1413","9","0","2","7 May 2010"," Law Abiding? Citizen
","Law abiding citizen was a fantastic thriller about a man who tries to enforce the law when it overlooks his wife and daughter's murderer. Gerard Butler is seemingly the good guy in this movie. Everyone can sympathize with the man. The murderer deserved to be punished for what he did. He deserved death and all he got was a slap on the wrist. This is just another movie where we find ourselves rooting for the guy shedding all the blood. My problem with this movie is that it provokes the thought in everyone's mind that it is okay to disobey the law as long as it is for a good reason. Regardless of the fact that the law makes mistakes, we as citizens are still called to obey the authority set in place above us. While it is good to see justice done to the corrupt authorities, this movie like many others like it provokes an anarchist point of view. This is a great movie that is extremely well done. However, my caution is that you watch it and don't allow yourself to believe that what Gerard Butler is doing is okay. It is not okay to murder no matter how just it seems."
"TxMike","Null","0","2","5 May 2010"," This is a really good movie, what is ""justice"" all about?
","A trait of a really good movie is it keeps your interest by wondering what is going to be the next development. This one does that really well. When you learn everything there is to learn most would consider the developments implausible, if not impossible, but put that aside and you enjoy a good story with interesting dialog and good acting.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler (who also is one of the producers) is Philadelphia family man Clyde Shelton. As the movie opens his home is invaded and two men bind and stab him and his wife, and take their young daughter. The wife and daughter die, but Clyde survives.<br/><br/>The men are arrested, and the badder of the two strikes a bargain with the DA, in exchange for testimony which will send his partner to the death chamber, he will only get a 3rd degree murder sentence, which means he could be back on the streets in 5 years or so.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is the prosecutor Nick Rice, probably the best in the DA's office, and probably next in line for DA. But Nick is proud of his record, when someone cites his ""95% conviction rate"" he quickly corrects him, ""96%."" So it is clearly established that Nick also has his own image in mind, he hates the thought of losing a case. So that is why he struck the deal and maybe circumvented real justice.<br/><br/>But when Clyde met with Nick, where Nick was trying to convince Clyde that this plea deal was good, because at trial they risk losing, Clyde had trouble accepting that. He was there, he saw what happened, he could testify. Finally Nick told Clyde the deal had been made already, and he had to accept that. That didn't sit well with Clyde who realizes Nick is putting his own interests ahead of justice.<br/><br/>So that all happens early and sets up the real story, what is justice and is our justice system working the way it is designed? Will Clyde, a law-abiding citizen, accept that or will he take justice into his own hands? Well he has to, otherwise there would be no movie.<br/><br/>Good movie, makes you think.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: Very quickly we see the executed prisoner die a very painful death, and then after he gets out of jail Clyde cons the other man into a trap where Clyde, dressed as a police officer, kidnaps him and slowly tortures him as the dismembers him until death. But that is just the beginning of Clyde's revenge. A smartest of the smart, a former best of the best at secret operations, he systematically carries out a plan to wreak havoc within the Philadelphia government, and killing everyone who had even a peripheral involvement in his case. He purposely gets put in jail, then into solitary, to carry out his plans. Everyone is puzzled, how can this man in prison cause these murders?<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS: They finally tracked down that Clyde had bought a number of parcels of dilapidated property, and one of them is adjacent to the prison. In preparation for his revenge he had dug a number of tunnels into prison cells, including one into his solitary cell. Equipped with sophisticated gadgets and uniforms, he would escape in disguise and carry out his deeds. The final one, would take out Nick, the major, and others with a cell-activated bomb, with napalm-like effects. But Nick figured it out in time, and was waiting for Clyde when he returned to his cell. He tried to talk Clyde out of it, don't make the call, don't wreak more havoc. But Clyde did anyway, and as Nick exited the cell, Clyde realized the bomb had been moved and now was under his cot. He dialed his own death."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","7 April 2010"," Slightly over-ambitious, but ""Citizen"" is a solid criminal justice thriller
","There's exploiting the criminal justice system and then there's Clyde Shelton's (Gerard Butler) exploiting of the criminal justice system, which involves killing everyone connected to it. Right and wrong is hardly black and white in any good movie and in ""Law Abiding Citizen"" it's hardly a hundred shades of gray. Shelton is a man who lost is family and didn't get the justice he thought he deserved in the prosecution of his family's killers. Ten years later he not only gets his ""justice"" by killing both guys, but also when he's taken to prison he begins to orchestrate a series of murders seemingly while in solitary confinement.<br/><br/>Shelton is a combination of the vengeful father character and The Joker -- Heath Ledger's Joker, that is. A series of carefully planned murders help him to try and make his point about the inherent flaws in the U.S criminal justice system while the attorney who wouldn't take his case all the way (Jamie Foxx) tries to stop him knowing full well he could be next. ""Citizen"" is not a brilliant deconstruction of American law, but it exposes it impressively and manages to make that concept turn into an exciting thriller.<br/><br/>The harshest critics of ""The Dark Knight"" are liable to have the same problems with this film: plot holes. Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who wrote the Pierce Brosnan remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" and the solid sci-fi dystopia film ""Equilibrium"" is experienced enough to make the film believable for most of the movie, but any film about a mad man concocting the most grandiose and precise murders and not failing is bound to produce skeptical viewers and rightfully so.<br/><br/>It's an ambitious film, but in that sense and also in trying to be both entertaining thriller and social commentary, managing to succeed at one and come awfully close with the latter. The only reason the commentary falls short is because the action takes the film so far away from the original incident of Clyde's family being killed and his first act of revenge that it sets up the conflict and the ""what is justice?"" themes better than it carries them out to their end. <br/><br/>Nevertheless ""Citizen"" is clever and at times brilliant. Butler and Foxx are credible talents and lend themselves to this film very well. Veterans Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill also round out the cast impressively and certainly director F. Gary Gray (""The Italian Job"") has his credentials. It gives a needed boost to Starz' Overture Films, which aside from ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a studio that hasn't had much to hang its hat on just yet.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

It started off fast and adrenaline pumping, but the ending was disappointing, and sort of didn't make sense. Other people have already stated this and more that I also agree with about the ending in previous reviews, that it didn't seem likely and didn't fit Clyde's character or motives, plus, it didn't seem like the authorities would outright murder him either.

","Only once in a rare while do we encounter a movie with two main characters who are both protagonist and antagonist at the same time. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is one of these movies where the line between right and wrong is blurred into an almost invisible line by the circumstances that surround it.<br/><br/>The movie goes directly to the point. Clyde (Gerald Butler) loses his family right before his very eyes. Public prosecutor Nick (Jaimie Foxx) cuts a deal with the perpetrators to get a compromised win. Clyde did not appreciate this, and takes the law into his own hands. He planned not only to kill the criminals, but also to reform the entire justice system with an elaborate plot which he describes to be ""of Biblical proportions."" <br/><br/>This ambiguity of everything that is going on is the best thing about ""Law Abiding Citizen."" I just felt that too little was established about Clyde to convince us that he is really capable enough or even monstrous enough to pull off this Machiavellian scheme of his. If you can just look beyond this gaping plot hole (and the pretty high violence and gore quotient), this film does have its engrossing points. It keeps you guessing to the very moment of climactic revelation.<br/><br/>People who love action and a good mystery will enjoy this film. It is a good film to pump up adrenaline with, and to match wits with the writer. The extreme violence and gore (which at one point gets uncomfortably gratuitous) may appeal to some people, but turn others completely off. You can however shield your eyes at just the right moments and enjoy the rest of the film."

I suppose I have ""one foot off the reservation..."" but at least for me the whole ""good guy - bad guy"", ""right-wrong, good vs evil"" thing was blurred.

Though one of the attackers got death penalty, another got away by pleading guilty. Hero doesn't like it, and decides to take revenge.

But it's not so straight forward as one learns when nothing happens for a good period of time. <br/><br/>Democracies like the US, the UK and Australia lean too heavily on the side of the individual which then adversely affects the quality of life for the majority and community in general.This is aptly demonstrated in the movie. <br/><br/>However much one agrees with the actions of the main character, the fact remains that this is a work of fiction and, in life, people suffer the frustrations of a very flawed justice system.

"Robert_duder","8","0","1","2 February 2010"," A solid action flick, definitely worth checking out
","It seems as though a good old run of the mill action flick is hard to come by. Sometimes you just want to see a Michael Bay things blowing up, mindless action flick (critics just cringed) but its true! Some things are a given with most action flicks. Usually the characters don't get a lot of depth and there isn't a lot of dramatic breathing room but a good action flick will keep your adrenaline pumping and that is exactly what Law Abiding Citizen does. Star power is easy for the film so they carry the story while action is abundant. In my opinion they stuck to the tried and true recipe of action which is just fine but also doesn't set their movie apart from other like it. The story is very simple (in this case all about revenge in an over the top Death Wish type plot), the characters have basic personalities that are mostly one dimensional, but works due to the star power brought on board, and plenty of things blow up. I am happy to say that didn't work hard at PG'ing the movie because you know what? Sometimes an adult wants to see a solid ""R"" rated action flick although I think Law Abiding Citizen was 14A or something.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler seems to be blazing his way to the top as a Hollywood hero and heart throb. In the last year this guy did comedy, romantic comedy, action, and drama. He is versatile and easy to watch and commands screen presence. In his case I would have really liked to have seen a little more depth to his character. This is a devastated father who also happens to be a top notch Government trained killer (similar to Liam Neeson's Taken character who had more depth.) Jamie Foxx is terrific as the struggling Assistant DA who truly only does what he think is best but in the process puts a target on him and everyone around him when he lets one of Butlers' family's killer off of death row. Foxx and Butler are terrific opposite of each other and really do the cat and mouse game well. Essentially aside of a small supporting cast the movie is entirely about Foxx and Butler.<br/><br/>One of the films shortcomings ironically is its best parts. Foxx and Butler do this great mind game cat and mouse type deal and yet I could imagine with a bit of a more intelligent script their interaction and chemistry could have been off the charts. Director F. Gary Gray comes from music as many manic action directors do but fortunately for him his style is not manic because it would not have worked for this movie. Instead he goes for a subtle approach. He doesn't really have a ton of experience so if I'm right he goes in slowly which is a good move for him because he could have taken two great actors and really messed this up for them. At least this way it was reasonably successful and enjoyable. It's the perfect Saturday night flick for the grown ups, plenty to enjoy for both the man and the woman and while it won't likely be many's favorite movie, it will keep you excited and fulfilled for the two hours you watch it. 8/10"

Why the director did this?, it supposes not to give bad message to people?, if you see comments, most say same thing, that end sucks, It good be nice to have another end, like 1408 movie from stephen king, hope it will be included in DVD if possible.<br/><br/>By the way, beyond he ""do not make threats with murders"" what else was suppose to be the message for the society from Gerald Buttler?"

","I don't understand how the ending of this film generated such an unpopular vote. This movie was fantastic. It's hard to compared this film because it involves so much. So for a non-spoiling synopsis: A man and his family are attacked at his house. With the father being left with a ravaged and murdered family, full knowing who the perpetrators are he is left with the leaky American Justice system who find the main assailant with a bargain of a maximum of 5 years in prison and the other man who did nothing but watch with the death penalty (which doesn't find him for another 10 years in the judicial system). The father (Gerard Butler) is left with no real conclusion or relief from the murderers and so for the next 10 years he plans.<br/><br/>The movie unfolds with Butler as a vigilante to then a very intelligent and thought out murderer. Much like SEVEN's Spacey. But without all the religious influence. Just pure vengeance. Gerard's bad-assness is much like Liam's TAKEN's character, but much more passive, but with the same end note: Pure vengeance. As the movie goes on you find yourself trying to figure out the end game to all of this, however, if you read the other reviews, the end is a bit lack-luster of what you would want, however it does end semi-realistic.<br/><br/>All in all, you have to be a bit dormant in the brain to not fully enjoy this movie and wanting to watch it again to see if you can catch the full ending of the movie. I'll give you a hint.<br/><br/>""Don't negotiate with criminals"" or ""Don't make exceptions for criminals"". If you understand this, watch the movie again and you'll see that the end of the film made sense.<br/><br/>Enjoy."
"msmonicatan","9","0","1","22 January 2010"," Gerard and Foxx are a hit-combo!!
","What do you get when you combine 2 of the world's most talented and intense actors of all time? An award-winning performance even amidst a rather ingenious storyline with might I say, more than a few loopholes.<br/><br/>You will be blown away initially, with the gore, violence and pure intelligence of the way Gerard's character, Clyde, a tormented father, mourning the loss of his wife and daughter after 10 years, plays out the murders of the people who were involved in the trial against the murderers of his family. No doubt for a villain, Gerard is captivating, menacing and wittingly charming all at the same time. He is so convincing that at times, he makes you feel his motives for the murders were 100% justified! Foxx definitely kept his end of the bargain up by delivering a cocky, self-righteous, successful lawyer persona when he compromises the trial of Gerard's murdered family by allowing one of the 2 killers off with a light sentence. Throughout the movie, you can see Foxx's demeanour changing, losing his focus and strength after being worn down by Butler's incomprehensible and systematic killings, even as Butler is locked up at a maximum security prison! I won't go into details as to what the loopholes are, cos if we analyse it too much, we tend to forget that this movie, at its core, has an original and compelling storyline, somewhat a mix of Seven and The Bone collector. I DEFINITELY feel this movie was worth every bit of $7 and will DEFINITELY buy the DVD when it's out - uncensored!!"

","I really wasn't bothered about watching this film at first but I'm glade i did in the end.<br/><br/>The plot as a hole is abit hit and miss. Butler's characters wife and child is brutally raped and murdered. The justice system, formally Fox's character lets him down and lets the murderer get away with a 5 year sentence, deciding to take the law into his own hands, Butler goes about killing everyone that screwed him over.<br/><br/>This film i felt had great suspense you didn't know what was going to happen next and there was surprises through-out.<br/><br/>After killing the murderer of his family (i wont say how as it deserves to be watched just for this, its both sick and amazing at the same time) Butler starts to work on killing off the lawyers that let his family down.<br/><br/>The cleverness off the plot is let down with the script and directing at some points but none the less the way Butler plans and executes the deaths is amazing.<br/><br/>The ending has been slated to death but i have to disagree, i think this was one of the best bits of the film as i didn't know who i wanted to 'win'. There was no goody and baddie, i felt for both Fox's and Butler's characters at the end.<br/><br/>I knew that Fox was meant to be the 'Baddy' but i still felt for his for some reason, thats why this film is worth a watch in my opinion, the way it ends."

","What would you do if something happened to your family and justice was not properly served? Well, if you have money and technical know how, you get even and set out to prove a point. I know if anything ever happened to my family, I would feel the same way the father did in this movie. This movie points out the flaws in our justice system and one mans way to point them out. This movie reflects how easily a plea bargain happens without the consent of the victim and how he can make his dissatisfaction known. His techniques are brilliant, but a bit psychotic. This movie also shows us what can be accomplished through modern technology. I'm sure the actions taken in this movie are unrealistic but with the right brain and money, who knows? We we the father go from complete grief and enough time evolves that we see that grief turn to rage and the rage turn to action. I thought it was a well done movie and thought that the ending was the perfect way to wrap everything up."

","Wow. What a film. Every other film has a boring beginning and always takes ages to get to the point. Law Abiding Citizen was phenomenal and had me gripped at the very beginning. Favourite character is Clyde who consistently ensures he gets what he wants after 1 years of living alone and planning his every move .. Although, Jamie Foxx is also great when he is challenged and doesn't know what to expect next from the man who knows him best. This film is guaranteed to have you talking & i think this is the best film of 2009!<br/><br/>In this film, you never know what is going to happen next.

"dilbharadwaj","5","0","1","31 December 2009"," Decent revenge thriller with the dumbest ending in movie history
","I had minimum expectation from this movie after seeing the promo. But for the first half of the movie, it was quite interesting. It increased my curiosity a bit but second half ruined it all. And the ending is so lame that even a 10 year old boy will laugh at its stupidity.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Clyde Shelton( Gerrard Butler), a scientist whose family is killed by robbers and he fails to get justice when the assistant DA Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx) makes a deal with one of the accused to witness against other innocent robber against the will of Clyde. Then comes the usual revenge action drama where in Clyde takes on not only the robbers but everyone involved in the case.<br/><br/>There is nothing new in the story but pacing is good in first half.. in fact till the climax it is a good thriller. The main plot derives heavily from Dark knight where in the protagonist stays in the jail and operates his master plan. Even the killing are somewhat like SAW. But for me the problem with this movie was lack of surprises. I mean this kind of action/thriller needs a good element of surprise to keep audience glued to the movie but this movie lacks it.<br/><br/>Coming to my main problem- the ending. I will not spoil anything but this gotta be the lamest ending i have ever seen. The little curiosity build from the beginning is ruined in the end and you feel like you have wasted 110 min of your life.<br/><br/>Coming to performances, Gerrard Butler does a good job and Foxx has nothing to show in this movie. Leslie Bibb is hot(as ever). The movie does emphasize on how lame our judicial system works but it needed some good writing to make that effective.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has major flaws. Give it a try on DVD if you like the genre or else skip this junk.<br/><br/>Pluses: Decent first half with good action<br/><br/>Minuses: Predictable plot with no thrills and the dumbest climax<br/><br/>5/10 from me..."

","Wow, seen many good movies in recent weeks, this one, a little unexpectedly, takes the 'biscuit'. A touch of tim robbins and shawshank redemption in this one, but how different Gerard Butler is in this one from Dear Frankie and another love story thingie I cant remember the name of. first class, give him the Oscar now for best actor, I loved jamie Fox in the Soloist and I liked him in this movie also but Gerard Butler as Claude is absolutely brilliant, you will want to watch this movie from beginning to end, its very climatic though I do agree that the ending is a little on the weak side but the real good guy had to live and poor Clyde had to be out-thought sooner or later. God save the Mayor! Felt a bit sorry for the two criminals at the outset, Darby and Ames, how unlucky to stumble upon the household of such a genius as Clyde Hamilton. this is not my favourite movie but its the best movie for all round things. You cant watch this film and be disappointed, surely not. Chester was a mysterious connection for me, so called boyfriend of the blonde haired assistant. Terrific film, yes it has flaws like the ending but all the best movies do and take the rough with the smooth. Enjoy!"

"hyperbart","6","0","1","11 December 2009"," How trailers can ruin movies!
","The strenghts of this movie are also its flaws. The problems of this movie have been mentioned in many comments. It's a nice plot but it has serious realism problems and an ending that makes you wonder how bad the alternative endings the writer came up with must've been. These are the writers that wrote the script for the Recruit. It's hard to see how they fell so deep this time.<br/><br/>However, I want to mention something new, and that is how trailers can ruin a movie for you. The trailer of Law Abiding Citizen is what got me to the theater. Of course a trailer shows you something of the movie, but this trailer kind of blew every surprise for me there is in the movie. At the start this is not much of a problem, but if at about 2/3 of the movie I still know that the cars are going to blow up as soon as the justice people leave the prison, then that kind of spoils the movie! Didn't they think of something like that?"
"alphantom","10","0","1","8 December 2009"," why this film deserves a ten
","first off... let me start by saying the ending to this film was not awful, in fact nowhere close. i think people fail to understand why it ended the way it did. clyde (gerard butler) takes revenge on the justice system for allowing the murderer of his wife and child to walk free. being a genius inventor and tactician clyde devises all sorts of nifty little traps to kill the people responsible for the death of his family. regardless, he is killing people. near the end in clyde's cell nick (jamie foxx) says he is no longer making deals with murderers and lets clyde make a choice. the point is that clyde himself became a murderer and nick came to realize his own mistake. i don't think the movie could have ended a better way. clyde had nothing to live for and would've undoubtedly become a serial killer fueled by nothing but hatred and vengeance. in the end nick understood what clyde had felt and knew right from wrong. so please don't underrate this movie because of its ending.<br/><br/>anyway, gerard butler does a fantastic job playing his role. i didn't expect this from him at all. i always picture him with a long beard yelling ""this is sparta!"" but this was just something else. i don't think anyone could have done a better job. as for the action, it really is a ride. it keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. very interesting and entertaining, haven't seen a movie like this in a long time. the story was the most surprising to me. i walked in the movie theater with very low expectations thinking it was going to be some typical Hollywood fairytale but i was wrong. very well written and thought out, nothing predictable or cheesy. i recommend this movie to everyone who is above the age of 18 and enjoys a good action film."
"neil-476","8","0","2","2 December 2009"," Enjoyable but morally questionable
","Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton sees his wife and daughter savagely murdered by a pair of burglars. Jamie Foxx's Nick Rice is the DA who plea bargains a short sentence for the worst of the pair to turn State's evidence against the other. It turns out that Shelton is a former covert specialist in planning and executing sudden and secret death for the Government, as Rice finds out when the two murderers met highly unpleasant demises, following which Shelton turns his attention to the flawed system which failed to hold them properly to account.<br/><br/>This is essentially a revenge movie, albeit dressed up with fun but unlikely trappings, none of which bears examination in the cold light of day. It's full of action, holds your attention, and even engages you from time to time with issues which require some thought. Having said that, there is some very muddled morality in it - given Shelton's actions, and notwithstanding the murders which catalyse him, is he fundamentally any more moral than the murderers? But if you remove your thinking apparatus and simply get aboard for the ride, there is much to be enjoyed here."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","0","2","31 October 2009"," I do not stand up for the substandard characters and the ludicrous premise, but I did enjoy the movie on the fact that I could not predict what was going to happen next
","Perhaps a movie as needlessly violent, preposterously staged, and nonsensically ludicrous as ""Law Abiding Citizen"" deserves the negative publicity that it has already received. Yet I did find some mild movie pleasure while experiencing it. No, I do not stand up for the overly vulgar screenplay, the substandard characters, the unbelievably harebrained plot, and the eye-rolling banal clichés that I spotted here and there, but due to the fact that I could rarely predict what was going to happen next, it kept me mildly interested despite its rational complications and I give the movie a marginal note of recommendation.<br/><br/>""Law Abiding Citizen"" stars Jamie Foxx as a Philadelphia district attorney who finds himself the central point of a series of brutal killings when a deranged vigilante (Gerard Butler) takes out his anger on his family's recently-released killers and then upon the entire city. Foxx captures Butler and imprisons him, yet chaos ensues and it becomes a race against time to discover what accomplices, if any Butler has on the outside, and to stop him before it's too late.<br/><br/>In a basic plot description, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" sounds like the standard vigilante movie and in a way, I guess you could say it is. It's just as harebrained and lopsidedly silly as the many I've seen recently. But on the other hand, I guess you could say it's not on the same level. It's a step above because again, it's nearly impossible to tell what's going to happen next. The tone, spirit, and style of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" reminded me of another, much better gloomy vigilante thriller, ""Se7en"" from 1995. As Gerard Butler's character shocks the other characters with his scene-chewing performance, we too sit and wait for what he's got under his sleeves next.<br/><br/>But the problem that costs ""Law Abiding Citizen"" its potential status as a truly great thriller is the fact that it does not have a feeling of connection or personality or conflict between or in any of the characters. I like Jamie Foxx and I think he pulled off an on-par performance, but he was just playing the same old, stand-up-for-the-right-thing flawed protagonist that I've seen a thousand times over. I've seen enough of the man who spends all of his time at work and not enough at hope with his wife and children and then ponders over that as he risks his life doing his duty. Gerard Butler, too, I like him and his performance, but he doesn't have any fresh or startling personality as a villain. His character's personality is also the same old vigilante we've seen before. His actions aren't, but his manner is. While his schemes did surprise me, the way they were alerted to me by the character did not. Whereas say the actions of Hannibal Lecter from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are along a similar line, but they dropped my jaw and sunk with more impact because of the development and the fleshed-out personality of the villain who was carrying them out. After all, every big moments needs a good lead. In addition, Foxx does not have any real connection to his wife or friends and fellow investigators, they just stand around and serve more or less as props. Mostly, the scenes between characters are just time-fillers. A minor complaint I also have concerns the screenplay, which is packed with vulgarity. Now, I have no problem with foul language in thrillers, for it has become rather formula in Hollywood now, but when it's thrown again and again where intelligent, thought-provoking dialogue could have been placed, it runs a few scenes down.<br/><br/>I have been rubbing the flaws of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" into its face pretty hard during my review. But again, although these flaws as marring and do cost the movie a lot, I did enjoy it, but not because of the characters or the screenplay or the story—the three elements in a movie that matter the most. Simply because I could not predict (most of the time) what would happen in the next scene, I enjoyed it. But it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>And one footnote, I personally am getting a little bit tired of the action movie cliché where a character sets of a timed explosive, walks away from it, the bomb goes off, and the character doesn't even flicker an eyelash as flames and debris fly around him."

"moviemanMA","7","0","2","23 October 2009"," Butler brings down the system
","It stars Butler as Clyde Shelton, a man who survives a home invasion only to lose his wife and daughter in the attack. When his attorney Nick Rice, played by Jamie Foxx, decides to make a plea bargain due to some questionable evidence, Butler is completely destroyed. The man who killed his family gets a 3-5 year stretch while his accomplice who didn't do the killing gets a death sentence.<br/><br/>Flash forward ten years and the man sentenced to death finally meets his fate, only during his lethal injection something goes wrong, and what is normally a painless death turns into an excruciating and incredibly violence execution. Suspects are pursued, including the man who got the lighter sentence. When he runs he winds up in Shelton's hands. Shelton has big plans for bringing down the system that left him by the wayside.<br/><br/>One of the trends with thrillers lately has been the idea that one man or group is killing people without being there, much like the Saw movies. The idea that a person is so intelligent that they can not only kill without being there, but also predict what other outside forces will do to interfere. It's a scary idea, and a fun one to watch unfold on screen.<br/><br/>As far as story goes this one is somewhat predictable. Although we want Butler's character to have his revenge, the things he does we cannot support, making Foxx the unlikable and likable hero. In order for us to like him he has to learn a lesson, such is the purpose of these killers. Like the Saw movies and even David Fincher's Se7en, the heroes are meant to learn something or realize what they are doing and who they really are/should be.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, Butler does a surprisingly good job here for a film of this caliber. It's not a fantastic performance, but his delivery is just right for his character and the story. Foxx does an adequate job in playing the inquisitive attorney and the supporting cast fills in nicely. The action and the suspense is the driving force of this film, but it's nice to have something else to like.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, doing just what it needs to do. It doesn't go too far to try and wow you with a story. Sometimes movies like that fall flat on their face, like Gothika. I try to limit myself to a small amount of films like this as they tend to copy one another and offer very little except a tired, old storyline with star power thrown in to try and boost up the box office count. I think most people will enjoy this, though there is some nasty violence at times. Still enjoyable."

","The movie opens on two burglars violently breaking into Gerard Butler's home, raping his wife, and killing her and their child. Butler's out for blood, but up and coming prosecutor Jamie Foxx is more concerned with keeping his 96% conviction rate going than administering justice to both robbers. He makes a deal with one of the burglars to turn over on the other; one gets the death penalty, one a minor sentence. Butler's devastated. <br/><br/>Fast forward 10 years. Butler goes on a bloody rampage, dishing out his own vigilante brand of justice, first with the two robbers, then moving on to those in the justice system he holds responsible. Foxx, now a major player in the justice system, quickly realizes he's behind it all. After being arrested and locked up, Butler still somehow manages to manipulate outside events, causing a number of further deaths. Foxx is puzzled but determined. What ensues is a mysterious and gritty revenge story. As the death toll rises, Foxx comes closer to figuring it all out, but Butler always seems to be one step ahead. <br/><br/>By the end the audience is allowed access to Butler's secret. Ebert said in his review it was something of a let down, but given the 10 years Butler had to plan his revenge, it didn't require that much suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>Where the movie falters is in the lesson Butler attempts to teach. He's a little like John Doe in Se7en, preaching a bloody and violent sermon. But unlike Doe, we're supposed to sympathize with Butler, and despite his hardships I don't think his message was necessarily true, let alone able to justify the body count. <br/><br/>Law Abiding Citizen is still a good thriller. I enjoyed it. If nothing else, it at least delivers what it promises. <br/><br/>7/10"
