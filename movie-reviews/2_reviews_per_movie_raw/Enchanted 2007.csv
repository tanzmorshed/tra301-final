"bigbillythefish92","9","165","182","25 November 2007"," This isn't just a movie...it is a time-machine to the glory days of Disney.
","I'm a teenage boy, and the reviews for ""Enchanted,"" along with some friendly persuasion from my sisters, moved me to give this live action/animated combo. a chance. In the first fourteen minutes of Enchanted, there were two things that caught my attention: 1)The never-ending, sugar-coated, sing-along tune and 2) The grainy style of animation that Disney lavished upon the screen(a tribute to the Disney classics, such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty); in this time span, I felt truly embarrassed to be sitting in the theater with the older couples clustered around me. I mean, what kind of boy in his right mind would want to watch a movie with musical numbers and pretty princesses? And yet, there was something about it...the aire of it almost took me back to the days of my childhood when I would smash my face up to the T.V. screen, when Belle and the Beast were having their unforgettable ball dance or when Ariel was brushing her hair with a fork. It was these sorts of memories that surfaced to my mind as I kept watching Enchanted. And it kept getting better and better. When there was a sudden switch to live-action, my heart was captured by Amy Adams, who seems to be, in my opinion, the finest choice for Giselle. Prince Edward and Robert also had their perfect fits (James Marsden and Patrick Dempsey). Even though this movie is close to perfect, it still has its problems. There is an aire of predictability in the storyline, as well as the fact that it's swamped with clichés (some of which are fresh, and some of which are flat). Yet it flows on, innocently, with its strong actors/actresses, decent-enough screenplay that gives you a warm feeling in your heart (which is what Disney is supposed to do, right?), spectacular music numbers that have charm, and the fact that it is suitable for all ages. There is a little something for everyone in this film--and it's not just a film either--it is a time-machine back to the golden era of Disney's animated films, and its live-action ones as well. And it helps me look forward to the new Disney: one that keeps surprising me more and more every single day."
"Jay_Exiomo","8","106","117","21 November 2007"," That good old story with a modern twist
","Combining elements of modern day Manhattan with romanticized fairy tale settings, ""Enchanted"" tells the story of Giselle (Adams), your typical Disney leading lady living in a cottage, singing with innocent creatures, awaiting the day she would meet her prince charming. He turns out to be Prince Edward (James Marsden), a dashing debonair who happens to be the stepson of the wicked witch Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon). They meet, fall in love in a whim, and decide to marry the next day.<br/><br/>Problem is, step-mom wouldn't allow anyone to take over her throne so she poses as an old woman and pushes a clueless Giselle into a well that transports to - ahem - our world, where her quixotic perspective sets her apart from everyone else. Her city misadventures eventually lead her to Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce lawyer separated from his wife and trying to raise his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) by himself.<br/><br/>While awaiting to be rescued by her Prince Edward, Giselle bonds with father and daughter, with him teaching her a thing or two about dating, and her teaching him on the positive aspects of love.<br/><br/>While obviously an attempt to satirize the genre it carved its name on, this Disney flick helmed by Kevin Lima does it in a way that's not in a mocking manner as Dreamworks animated films usually are. Rather, they are handled with affection that makes the fairy tale angle a rather sweet and funny affair. The interweaving elements of live-action and animation blend alright and don't feel unbalanced.<br/><br/>Of course, you can say that this movie really belongs to Adams, who with her cheerful nature, makes it easy for one to feel for her character by providing depth and giving an additional dimension to Giselle. The supporting cast pale in comparison although they do have their moments, especially Sarandon who easily hams it up during a climactic event.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" doesn't necessarily mark a return of the old fairy tale magic conspicuously absent in recent Disney films; but it has the charms and clever wit - not to mention star Amy Adams bubbly charisma - to win over audiences outside the target demographic."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","240","273","25 November 2007"," I loved Enchanted!
","I first saw the trailer for Enchanted in the spring, from the moment it ended, I knew this was a movie that I wanted to see. I finally saw it today and it's everything that I hoped for and more. It was nice to finally see a Disney movie that wasn't computer animated, the beginning was almost a forgotten memory of the old fashion animation that I miss so much. But Enchanted is without a doubt one of the most fun films of the year and so perfect for the whole family. I though the plot was so extremely clever, what if the cartoons with the fairytale stories met into today's world? Especially in New York City? The cast just looked like they had the ultimate blast making this movie and really brought it to life. They each held their own and were a perfect choice for the comedic role they had to play. Enchanted is a clever twist on the classic fairy tale.<br/><br/>Giselle has just met the prince of her dreams, he's saved her from a troll and asked for her hand in marriage, everything seems to be going good for them. But Prince Edward's step mother has other plans in mind when she doesn't want to give up her crown and let Giselle take it. So she sends Giselle to another world, one where there is no ""happily ever after"", cut to New York City 2007. She's in human form and needs to get back to her land, she meets a man Robert and his daughter, Morgan, she stays with them and ends up falling for Robert. Just in time since Prince Edward throws himself to the other dimension to save her, but it's definitely a life changing experience for both of them, especially when the queen arrives to take care of Giselle herself.<br/><br/>Enchanted is one of the year's best movies and one of Disney's best, I guarantee it'll be a true classic down the line. The whole story was charming as well as funny and just a great time to watch, I don't know if I could pick a favorite part, there were so many to choose from, but I think the part where the prince first arrives to New York, how determined he is, he even takes on the city bus because he thinks it's a beast. For me, I think James Mardson stole the film as Prince Edward, he just played it off so perfectly and was such a pleasure to watch on the screen. Enchanted is one of the year's best films, I would highly recommend it for you or the family, it's a definite treasure of 2007.<br/><br/>10/10"
"schwanna","10","141","158","14 November 2007"," Adorable Family Film
","I had recently seen a screening of this movie and was pleasantly surprised that it had completely exceeded my expectations. The theater was full of laughs from the beginning throughout all ages. In the beginning I was worried that Amy Adams would make Giselle seem like some obnoxious daytime children's television character, but instead she managed to please the audience during the entire movie. There was also enough humor to keep the older viewers entertained from hilarious allusions to popular fairy tales and even some ""adult"" themes insinuated, while still keeping the film Disney clean. Overall I completely enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all families."
"jaredmobarak","8","156","176","22 November 2007"," The steel beast is defeated peasants, you are freeEnchanted
","In honor of the Thanksgiving holiday, I will post a family film review. Who better to deliver in that genre than Disney with their new animated/live action hybrid Enchanted. This movie is very cute and quite good at being both wholesome for the kiddies and tongue-in-cheek for the adults. You need to appreciate a studio being able to poke fun at itself. By using the classic stories of Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty, all made famous in their own right by the Mouse House, we are given some big laughs. The acting is very self-referential and broad as far as the fairy tale roles that make the journey into our world's New York City go. Screenwriter Bill Kelly gives the cast some great lines and set pieces to play in, ultimately showing us that the storybooks aren't always right. True love does exist, but not necessarily with the one you first think. The message is good, the songs are good, the animation and acting are goodDisney came through with this one. Along with Meet the Robinsons, Mickey and friends may be turning the ship around into a new renaissance.<br/><br/>We are ushered into the story with some 2D animation of Giselle, a pretty girl looking for her Prince Charming. That man is in fact Prince Edward, recently being led by his stepmother's henchman to battle ogres and partake in adventure to keep his mind off a wife. You see if he marries, Queen Narissa loses her crown and he becomes King. She is having none of that and will cross into evil stepmother/queen/hag territory to trick Giselle into falling through a portal to our world. Now a fish-out-of-water, she must find her way back to her love, that eventually comes looking for her along with her best friend Pip the squirrel and the evil witch's lackey Nathaniel. It is on this path that she runs into divorce lawyer Robert Philip and turns both his and her life upside down.<br/><br/>I love how the fantasy world comes into ours so awkwardly. Giselle's ability to call on all the animals of her meadows allows her to do the same in NY, only the creatures she gets are rats, pigeons, cockroaches, and fliesyet they all do the work anywayit's priceless. Also, when she breaks into song, all the people on the streets join along and have a blast being part of the huge choreographed numbers. Her innocence is very precious and trying new things always gets her new lawyer friend in trouble, yet helps those in her wake. Patrick Dempsey plays that friend to great effect. He sees what she is doing and can't help but fall for her joyful, inability to see cruelty in the world. Playing the straight man to her craziness leads to wonderful moments of laughter as well as those full of poignancy and compassion, giving the kids in the audience something to think about and lessons to learn.<br/><br/>While Dempsey's evolution as a man is something to appreciate, it is the transplants that shine. Amy Adams and James Marsden play Giselle and Prince Edward respectively. They bring the happy-go-lucky mentality of Andalasia to our disenchanted realm. The over-acting is great and the culture shock fantastic. Adams is gorgeous and has the chops to make the aloofness work, but also change later on into a human being that sees what reality brings. When she tells Edward that she was thinking instead of singing, his reaction really hits home on the vast void between storybook fantasy and the real world. As for Marsden, his childish actions are truly funny; a borderline simpleton, he believes in chivalry and when he is told a suspected villain is really a friend, he just flips a switch and is OK with it. His smile is infectious and his vacant expressions indispensable to the film working on the dual levels it does.<br/><br/>Everything works here to bring a wonderful family-friendly story to life. Complete with its pop-up book bookends, Enchanted is truly magical. I don't know how it could ever have worked as a complete animated work, as I have read it originated as, so thankfully they took the plunge to expand it with live action. Crossing between the two worlds is seamless2D characters turned into humans or 3D computer generated animals. With many instances ripe for a wrong turn, the filmmakers seem to come to all the right decisions. Working in older Disney yarns and playing each story thread to its effective conclusion leaves us with a tale that could become a classic amongst the ones it appropriates. So, if you are looking for a way to spend a couple hours with the whole family, Enchanted is definitely a great way to go."
"Rachel-368","9","76","85","21 October 2007"," Brilliant - something for everyone!
","I went to see Enchanted at the premiere on 20/10/2007 and I was really pleasantly surprised. I had expected all the usual Disney trademarks to be included; singing, animation, animals that talk, a prince and an evil stepmother, all these was there but also so much more! I was not expecting the film to be as funny as it was; it's packed with jokes; quite a few were aimed at adults, so went over the children's heads, but the weren't rude or distasteful enough to offend the children. This film is an 'all rounder'; it contains all the Disney elements that children and adults love, but also enough to humour to make it an enjoyable comedy for the adults.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is brilliant as the innocent Giselle, she embodies everything that a Disney character should; from her musical ensembles to her sunny view of the world. Patrick Dempsey plays the cynical lawyer, who isn't sure if Giselle has banged her head or is just crazy! James Marsden is perfect as the classic Disney prince; suave and arrogant, while Susan Sarandon obviously relishes being the evil witch. Timothy Spall plays the bumbling, and occasionally annoying, side-kick, but he also provides the basis for many of the jokes.<br/><br/>Disney knows what works, and have included many of their much-loved formulas, but they haven't been afraid to venture away from their traditional 'girl meets boy, they get married and live happily ever after' narrative. And that's what really makes this film stand out. If I were to sum up this film, I'd say 'a brilliant fusion'. It fuses animation with actors, Andalasia with New York, pigeons with chipmunks, Prince Charming with a Divorce Lawyer, humour with love, modern dilemmas with traditional values and Disney past, with what I hope is Disney future.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch, and the best part is, you won't even need to use your children as an excuse to go!"
"greggandkristi","10","294","356","3 November 2007"," Practically Perfect
","The movie is quite simply, the best Family movie in the past few years. From the beginning, the movie sucks you in with narration from a Disney Legend. You fall in love with the characters right away and it's quite simply a return to the greatness that Disney can deliver. The cast led by Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden and Timothy Spall (Wormtail from the Harry Potter movies who gives an inspired Oscar-worthy performance) is impeccable. Rounding out the cast is Susan Sarandon who is part Evil Queen, part Maleficent and pure EVIL and the adorable Rachel Covey who is the perfect ""mini-princess"" for Giselle to play off of. The music by Stephen Schwartz and Alan Menken (in a return to brilliance) is terrific. The original songs are the best to come out of Disney since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The story, quite simply is part fish-out-of-water, part romantic comedy, part animated and all fun. The live-action portion of the movie feels like your watching animation. The way that Giselle infects those around her with her innocent ""Princess-esque"" demeanor is really at the heart of what makes the movie so great. Of course, it wouldn't be Disney without a few scene-stealing animals who don't take over the movie and really are what they are meant to be, supporting characters. There are a few nods to the past as well. I won't share them here, but let's just say they are subtle enough not to be distracting, but still there enough to bring a smile to your face. The violence in the movie is nothing more than what you would see in any other PG family movie, and really aside from being live-action, isn't anything you wouldn't see in movies such as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White."
"Dviitale-1","9","273","339","2 November 2007"," A great, fun, Disney classic!
","First off, I want to say that, there is a comment on this thread where someone calls Enchanted disturbing, should be rated R, etc. It is obvious she did not see the film. This reviewer is high, and, this review should be removed.<br/><br/>Enchanted was a surprisingly great, fun modernized Cinderella tale, including 3 show- stopping musical numbers where the test audience applauded after each song.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is perfect, James Marsden, once again, as he was in Hairspray, was very appealing. I felt Patrick Dempsey was good, if not a tad old for the part, and, his fiancé was OK, nothing spectacular. (in fact, I feel this movie would have worked a bit better if Dempsey had a good girl ""friend"" vs a fiancé).<br/><br/>That being said, I loved the message this movie teaches to children, that is, get to know someone before saying ""i do"" (as is the message with way too many princess movies, and is the reason why too many suffer youthful failed marriages.<br/><br/>Enchanted was great fun, and very funny! A must see!"
"Rcwilkinson123","7","11","11","17 February 2008"," Can a guy like this movie? Actually, yeah
","'Enchanted' looks like a movie that a guy would never be seen at. C'mon, it's another Disney princess, and just looks pretty girly, right? Well, this is true. But it is funny enough to make both males and females enjoy a film where Disney pokes fun at their own masterpieces in the form of a Cinderella, Snow White, or Sleeping Beauty.<br/><br/>Princess Giselle leaves the cartoon world for the real world, and has a whale of a time adjusting to the harsh realities of a life other than ""happy ever after."" This is where the movie is at its best, as Amy Adams is very funny and cute playing a princess who must adjust to life in New York City while bringing her very own charm to the real world, and teaches lessons about true love while also learning important aspects of relationships from the man who is lucky- or unlucky?- enough to have found her.<br/><br/>The ending is kind of weird, but that's not to spoil a movie that is for the most part refreshing in its premise and delivers plenty of genuine laughs. 3/4 stars"
"roddmatsui","8","28","32","22 November 2007"," An enjoyable romp.
","This is really the definition of ""light entertainment,"" and seriously, I am still smiling about it now. After getting in the way of an Evil Queen, a fairytale princess is cast into an alternate reality--the real world as we know it--and must survive there until her rescue by her Prince Charming. Hmm! From the trailer I saw, my guess was that ""Enchanted"" was a one-joke show, a series of gags about how fairytale magic falls on its face in the real world. That Disney has managed to squeeze at least four or five good jokes out of the idea, and mixed in a few sprinkles of profundity on top of that, is something of an achievement. As a romp, it works fairly well, and it delivered quite a lot more than I was expecting. <br/><br/>This is a risky film to make, and Disney gets points for having the guts to unleash this oddity on the holiday season. It's a fun film that isn't afraid to go, occasionally, in weird and startling directions. <br/><br/>The intersection of the two worlds--the world of faith and magic, and the world of disillusionment and hard reality--creates the expected comedic drama at first. Then the two opposing realities begin to influence and change each other in unsettling and stimulating ways that may surprise the audience. The ideas aren't fully developed, but a crucial detail was attended to at the wrap-up that satisfied me--the main characters succeed mainly because they are able to grow beyond their previous conceptions of themselves.<br/><br/>Along the way of telling this story, we get to see a very challenging film production featuring two distinct worlds and their accompanying designs, and the intermingling of these two worlds. It's occasionally heavy on visual effects and animated sequences, but the effects are always story-driven and never gratuitous--a surprising enough thing nowadays that it's worth taking note of. Strong film-making skills, with an old-school sensibility, are at work.<br/><br/>My rating gets an extra point for an audacious, overblown MGM-style singing/dancing sequence, the kind that is rarely seen in theatres nowadays. Go see it!"
"mariam215","10","242","319","17 November 2007"," In love with this movie!
","My husband and I received tickets to this movie as a gift. My husband was just going to take our daughter, but we decided to all go. We took my 11 year old son and my 10 year old daughter to this movie thinking it would just be something to do since ""we had the tickets anyway."" It was supposed to just be a fun night. We had no idea how ""in love"" with this movie we would all be! We laughed out loud, I cried, and the kids had the best time. We were actually holding hands and singing on the way back to the car. It's a must see! Dads, you'll laugh, I promise! We can't wait until it comes out on video! It's Great family time. Go go GO see this movie."
"adsum85","8","37","44","20 September 2007"," Hilarious Comedy by Disney
","I was lucky enough to see a preview of ""Enchanted"" yesterday, and I am really glad I went. The big appeal in this movie is , I think, the fact that Disney seems to be making fun of itself. From the one-day romances, to the spontaneous singing, this Disney movie delivers all of the classic plot lines but with a humorous and decidedly fresh panache. Amy Adams makes a sweet princess, and James Marsden plays Prince Charming (or Prince Edward in this case) as an innocent and ditsy hero. Susan Sarandon is witty as the evil witch, and Timothy Spall makes an endearing henchman. Patrick Dempsey makes for a great anti-hero. But in my opinion, Pip the squirrel was the most hilarious character, especially when communicating Spalls true intent to the oblivious Prince Edward. From the musical numbers to the CGI, this movie is definitely worth watching with the whole family."
"crisisbrown","9","9","9","6 February 2008"," Not what I expected...
","I was invited to see this film with my girlfriend, her parents and her little sister. Her dad and I where hesitant about seeing this film as we where both under the impression it was going to be a girlie flick or just another kids film. We where wrong! I don't think I laughed as much the first time I saw Jack Dee live as I did with this film! I think the very few blokes in the audience where actually laughing more than the women who wanted to see the film in the first place! Genius. This Movie caught me completely off guard! For the few blokes who are willing to put there masculinity to one side for an hour and 30 minutes, get some mates round; rent this movie and you will all be crying with laughter by the end."
"sourcegamer","8","16","18","8 November 2007"," Very very good!
","I just got home from an advanced screening at my local theater, and all I can say is WOW! I must admit, when I first came into the movie theater, I was quite skeptical as to how good it would be, considering it's a modern Disney movie and all, but boy was I wrong. This was one of the best family oriented films I have seen in years. The entire theater applauded with vigor at the end of the movie. Truly an essential family movie-going experience.<br/><br/>I was following this movie for a while admiring the very interesting concept and wondering if Disney could pull it off. They did that and much more. This movie was a refreshing taste of comedy and the ""happily ever after"" love story. It did not follow the usual outcome however, I won't reveal what happened because you need to find out for yourself. I personally very much enjoyed this twist to the typical plot for this genre. The comedy seemed like it could appeal to all ages. They packed in many jokes perfectly into the plot. Not once did the comedy seem cheesy or even queer, almost every joke was funny. Very many parts of the old fairy tales were used in some parts of the plot, such as Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. However they were used in such a stylistic manner that it all seemed to seamlessly blend together with the rest of the story. The villains were very hate-able, and the good guys were very lovable. Overall the plot was very solid and very well written. It carried all the magic and the entertainment factor of all the classics before it. 8.3/10<br/><br/>One thing that struck me upside the head, was the acting. The acting I felt was top notch for Amy Adams, the actress who plays Giselle. Her performance as a lost and confused princess from another world was very realistic and seemed to posses a pleasant flavor to it. I think I could see a potential Oscar nomination for her. Only time will tell though. The acting for the rest of the cast was very good. I don't have any nitpicks worth noting. 9/10<br/><br/>The sound mix was surprisingly good considering the film's Genre. Once again, another engrossing quality of the film. Skywalker Sound really does a good job with every film the do the sound mixing for. There were many ambient effects from all around the theater perfectly placed, which added a sense of depth to what was on screen. 8.5/10<br/><br/>My one big nitpick was the Music. I had no problem with the orchestral arrangements supplementing the vocals, (they were quite good in fact) but what killed me was the seemingly weak voice for Giselle. There was one musical number that took place in Central Park towards the middle of the film where I felt her character had to do a lot of strong singing, but it came across to me that the Music behind her vocal was stronger and more filled with emotion than the vocal that was supplied. However everywhere else I have no real problems. It was just that number that prevented me from swaying a little in my seat. 6.8/10<br/><br/>The Visual effects were very well done. (POSSIBLE SPOILER) There was one sequence that involved a massive dragon roosting at the tip of what I think was the Chrysler Building. The dragon seemed very believable, and the digital rain and lightning in the scene reflected very well off of the dragon's scales. I have no nitpicks here. 8/10<br/><br/>Overall this film was a magical ride fit for all ages. It houses comedy, fantasy, magic, and lots and lots of entertainment all in one reel. Definitely a movie to bring your family to this thanksgiving. Remember to buy lots of popcorn and candy! Nothing like making a movie which is already a great treat even better.<br/><br/>8/10"

","First of all, I'm going to tell you that I'm a 16 year old girl, so this review may be a little biased in your opinion. For the most part, the reviews for Enchanted have been stellar. I enjoyed reading them, and agreed with most of them, until I got to the end where a few wet blankets decided to ruin the rave reviews. They think there's too much marketing, the marriage/divorce issues aren't appropriate..the list goes on.<br/><br/>I don't know about anyone else, but I thought Enchanted was so cute. Sure, it was really glammed up and glitzy, but it's a Disney princess movie. What else could you expect? As far as the marriage/divorce issue goes, I really don't believe 6 year old girls are sitting in the movie theater to watch anything but the princess and listen to the music, etc. I really think some people are reeling too far into the issues of this movie, instead of simply enjoying it.<br/><br/>Enchanted was one of the best movies of the year in my opinion. It was funny, romantic, and just plain good. It even made me cry at the end! I really enjoyed it, and I would recommend it for kids of all ages."

","New York City divorce lawyer and single dad Patrick Dempsey chances to meet distressed storybook princess Amy Adams, a once-animated maiden who has become mortal after being pushed into the real world by a wicked queen. Instead of a fish-out-of-water fairy tale from Walt Disney Pictures, we get a cartoon character turned three-dimensional...add songs, homages to Disney classics, plus a computer-generated squirrel (for slapstick value) and you've got the makings of a pleasant, if top-heavy, romantic comedy for eleven-year-old girls. Some of the humor is a bit too outrageous (I could have done without the bathtub-scrubbing cockroaches), but Dempsey and Adams really put their hearts into this sugar-coated scenario and give us an attractive, appealing couple worth swooning over. The animated prologue is fun, and Susan Sarandon is a perfect villainess, although Bill Kelly's screenplay is a little short on genuine supporting characters: the entire picture seems to take place in a vacuum, with the Big Apple residents (minus one ticked-off bus driver) under some sort of catatonic spell. **1/2 from ****"

","I'm not in this movie's target demographic. I'm a guy aged 24-30. Yet the preview sucked me in, and I'm glad I did. Why? It's a movie that tells us a little about ourselves, and makes fun of how we distinguish fantasy from reality and why we hold onto our dreams.<br/><br/>We all want the fairy tale to come true, but as we get older, we learn that reality is much less beautiful than the idealized world of Disney fantasy. This movie plays to that duality expertly, examining what we believe, asking us why, and making us laugh along the way.<br/><br/>Giselle the would-be princess will win you over with her idealist naiveté. She steals scenes with her energetic personality, and makes you wish you believed how she does. Her musical scene while cleaning house will have you laughing along as fantasy and reality clash in a brilliant mockery.<br/><br/>Prince Edward will have you rooting for the wrong guy because he's just so likable. He's played by James Marsden, aka Scott from the X-Men (who was a dick), which really showcases his versatility. He can sing, dance, and play naive romantic to a T.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey once again removes himself from the limelight with a too low-key performance, but he's the straight guy that grounds the film, so that's the point. He still changes as Giselle's giddy make believe world intrudes on his life and the way he thinks, so you get to feel for him as if he were you.<br/><br/>By the end of the film you'll find yourself wondering if you still believe in the fairy tale style romance, or if you're a modern realist. The best part is, this movie gives you that choice.<br/><br/>Everybody comes out a winner from this film, including the audience. It's a perfect date movie, unless you don't like who you're dating, in which case it'll be really awkward, because this movie is unrelentingly romantic."

","There is little more I could add to the stellar comments and reviews for this film. While it is not perfect (probably some expository songs were cut out to reduce time, particularly in the case of secondary characters), it left me smiling and happy, and I even bought the soundtrack on iTunes. One thing I didn't notice mentioned (probably it was noted elsewhere) was that in the beginning Giselle and Edward defeated an evil troll. Isn't this a reference to the upstart Shrek? I love how, instead of making fun of Disney lore this film gently nudges it and updates it. I hope the very tired Disney fairy tale mocking genre is slain by this film."

","Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):<br/><br/>Enchanted's opening moments serve as a wonderful hark back to the classic animation of yesteryear, and even as someone not terribly fond of grand musical interludes, I was frankly taken aback and very much, dare I say, enchanted by this film.<br/><br/>The premise is such - Giselle (Amy Adams), soon to be Princess, is on the lookout for love in Prince Edward (James Marsden), whilst the evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) wishes to foil this plan to retain her prestige. The setup for Enchanted is unoriginal, but it has been so long since we have seen this dynamic in any sort of animated form that it is an instant win for director Kevin Lima.<br/><br/>Whilst the opening animated sequence borrows from Snow White (among other Disney classics) in many ways, the meat of the film is unlike anything else that Disney have cooked up over the years. Through the Queen's meticulous scheme, Giselle becomes banished to a world where there are no happy endings  the ""real world"".<br/><br/>As the film transforms from animation to live action, enter the gloriously dolled-up Amy Adams, traipsing around New York City in a gigantic white dress, entirely oblivious to what is going on around her. Enchanted is a classic ""out of towner in the big city"" story with a fantastical twist  the real world is a colossal culture shock to Giselle, as she learns upon being mugged (in hilarious fashion) by a homeless man.<br/><br/>Soon enough, she meets Robert, played by Patrick Dempsey, who, along with the majority of the cast of the horrendous Grey's Anatomy, I had near enough written off. Nonetheless, Giselle, who is simply looking to find her way home, becomes embroiled in Robert's life, and frankly, with her high-pitched voice and snazzy dress sense, who could blame Robert for thinking that she had escaped from the local asylum? In perhaps one of the film's few weak points of development, Robert allows Giselle to sleep at his place despite his previous trepidation, although this is very much his character all over  he buckles to her charms, and says more about Robert as a character than any sort of weak scriptwriting.<br/><br/>From this point, Prince Edward and his trusty chipmunk sidekick arrive on the scene to rescue Giselle. It becomes evident from James Marsden's first live-action scene in this film that he had great fun with this role, hurling himself into it completely with a rare energy seen nowadays. As with his memorable turn in this year's Hairspray, Marsden shows his knack for these melodramatic, charismatic roles, and moreover, who could resist that smile? Enchanted is not without its curiosities, such as how Giselle knows quite what a vacuum cleaner is as she sings about it, but that's probably one of the less ridiculous things about this film, considering it has vermin scrubbing a toilet with toothbrushes. The film is full of such divergences, but they are forgivable, and more to the point, acceptable ones.<br/><br/>As can be quite predictably expected, all of this chaos causes an upheaval in Robert's personal and professional life. Robert is given a number of opportunities to get rid of Giselle, and under normal circumstances, I would become irritated when he doesn't, but given how this is a live-action fairytale, and an ironic one at that, juxtaposing the real life and the transcendental, I can show some mercy. Also, let's face it  Amy Adams is just that charming  she adds a bravery to her role by adding a face to the would-be animated voice.<br/><br/>The film generally does well to steer clear from irritation, although it is not without its instances of unadulterated cheese, such as an impromptu dance number in the middle of Central Park. In its defense, it isn't anything more over-the-top than you would see in a normal Disney film, and it is just as well telegraphed.<br/><br/>The course of the film envisions a dichotomous change for our characters  Giselle becomes humanised, employing an air of rational thought (even at one point, quite hilariously, feeling anger), whilst Robert begins to exhibit a fresher, more romanticised outlook on life. Giselle's influence on not only Robert but the world around her is profound, her magic aura touching many lives, whilst all the positives of the corporeal world rub off on Giselle and her Prince.<br/><br/>Aside from the evil Queen arriving on Earth to take care of Giselle herself, the film posits a veiled question of morality, love and relationships. Regrettably, the answer didn't really seem within the ironic vein of the rest of the picture, instead leaning towards a clean, fairytale solution rather than an authentic one. I'm not sure if it sends the right message to the youngsters of 2007, but again, it hasn't done anything that Disney hasn't already been doing for the last seventy years, and like classics such as Mulan, Enchanted, by its end, presents us with an exceedingly strong female protagonist. Heck, the film even puts in a good word for stepmothers everywhere! All in all, I didn't expect, but merely hope for a more complex solution to the issues that Enchanted raises, rather than the syrupy ending we're treated to. Still, this is a solid urban fairytale with electrifying performances, namely from the wonderful Amy Adams, but also from James Marsden, and the surprisingly tolerable Patrick Dempsey. The film serves well to remain tongue-in-cheek right up until its final moments, and even despite the problematic third act, it is difficult to hold a grudge against a film where the term ""feel good"" has rarely been more apt."

","Let me first preface that I have a predisposition for enjoying Disney animated films. I'm not sure if its the child in me, or the fairy-tale stories, or what; but for whatever reason, I have a rather large soft spot for them. Enchanted is no different and has not swayed me from my position a bit. It left me wanting so much more. At first I was concerned with how the transition from animation to live action would really look like on screen, but my fears soon faded away the first time I saw Amy Adams pop out of a sewer in a giant wedding dress. How marvelous and enchanting she truly is, I thought; and how animated! How absolutely animated she is! It's really as if the cartoon has come to life--as if the New York City backdrop is just that, a fabricated, foreign backdrop. And then she started talking... And her voice, her facial expressions, everything: completely animated. After the film, David and Yen told me I absolutely had to see Junebug, and I certainly will after this performance. She shined the entire time on screen and she sold me. I actually believed she was really from some fairy-tale, animated world where dreams come true and everyone lives happily ever after. I loved her so much, I'm not even going to mention the other performances other than to say they were adequate and took nothing away from the film. I'll also note that the Central Park musical number is to die for.<br/><br/>I will, however, take a brief look at the story as well. I know what you're thinking: some cheese ball romantic-comedy mush that's over-the-top and kid stuff, right? Well, think again. This story is all grown up, philosophically and realistically. I really liked the existential observations the characters made, being in this odd conundrum. Both they and we learn something about love and fairy-tales; about reality and fantasy; but above all, we learn that it's ultimately a compromise between the two that finds us all true genuine happiness, forever... and ever."

","I'll make this quick as Enchanted has already been discussed to death on IMDb. And quite honestly, I've got nothing much new to add. But I did want to post a comment and add my voice to those praising this movie. I am absolute stunned at how much I enjoyed Enchanted. It's just that  enchanting. And it may be the best thing Disney (without Pixar) has done in years. I love the way Disney uses Enchanted to poke fun at itself  something that quite honestly I didn't thing they would ever do. The song in the park is an incredibly inspired moment that works on two levels  one as an entertaining throw back to a time when musicals were acceptable forms of entertainment  and two as a spoof of all of those musicals. Finally, the casting couldn't have been better. I didn't know who Amy Adams was before I watched Enchanted, but she is awesome and plays the part of a Disney princess to perfection. It's just a fantastic movie!"
"Troy2Slick","10","12","15","30 December 2007"," Amy Adams Is Definitely Enchanting!
","I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I read the plot and was a bit intrigued as to how they were going to pull it off. Of course Disney always has a way of bringing charm and smiles to the big screen and this time was definitely no exception either.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of musicals, but this did win my heart over from the get go. We start of with old school Disney animation. Come to think of it, I had forgotten what a regular animated feature looked like that didn't include CGI, it seems like it's been so long since we've seen that. In any event, fast forward about ten minutes and you have Amy Adams propelled into a real life world in New York, a far cry from her fantasy world.<br/><br/>Amy Adams brings a lot of charm, energy and cartoonish mannerisms to the real life character. The acting is brilliant and she is definitely a delight to look at. She is very funny in the opening half an hour and some change into the movie. Not only that, but she has a very nice singing voice and I felt like jumping out of my chair and singing along with her.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the end, as I don't want to give anything major away... I've never seen so many people applaud during a movie in all of my life. I've been to hundreds of movies in my thirty years on this earth and the crowd absolutely ate it all up like a big steak dinner. When the chipmunk was playing charades, a boisterous round of applause came to fruition. When the credits finally rolled, after many oohs, ahhs, bursts of laughter and genuine smiles, many of the audience clapped, it was quite a movie experience for the holidays, one I'll cherish for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>If you want an enchanting evening, I suggest you take your loved one, if you have children, take them as well, because as a huge movie buff, I promise you do NOT want to miss this one. Go see it at all costs... ON THE BIG SCREEN!!! 10 out of 10, anything less would be an insult."

","Enchanted, Disney cartoon meets New York City a fantastic combination making this a 'laugh for all the family' film. This seemed to me as a classic Disney film modernised in a tasteful way. With such a good plot and characters I found myself completely absorbed into the film and was not disappointed as it held enough singing, dancing, romance and glitter to keep me happy and remind me of what a fantastic Disney creation I was watching. Starting in a typical fairytale cartoon immediately the plot became the usual true love tale until Giselle enters the real world of New Nork City she discovers and realises new ideas and emotions which change her mind about her true love. Amy Adams proved a great performance as 'Princess Gabrielle' as did James Marsden and Susan Sarandon as Prince Edward and the evil stepmother Narcissa. A* production."

Until now it's still sticks in my head. You can really jive in to its music, you can laugh and will make you dance to its tune, with a live musical, you'll definitely be alive, you'll sure have fun. It's really unusual to happen that a girl from a different world, where they believe there's a happy ever after is, would come alive in New York City?! Then comes a handsome divorce lawyer and a father to spice up the whole thing. They are about to learn different things from each other. i really can feel the romance in the air especially at the kings and queens ball.

","(58%) A good fun fish-out-of-water family comedy. The overly purposeful sweet elements offer some decent laughs, and the Simpsons-esque song routine with the rats and flies cleaning the apartment is very clever, a true highlight. The only issues for me are the sweetness levels going a bit too far at times, and Amy Adams character losing her identity and usual characteristics towards the end of the film for little reason why like an on/off switch had been pressed between scenes. Little girls will love it, while everyone else over the age of 12 will be surprised they aren't hating every second of it. A worthy Disney offering for the good pile."
"retroguy02","9","4","4","24 September 2008"," A stellar cast dazzles up this otherwise alright live-action fairytale
","What happens when the archetypal Disney princess is thrown from her blissful animated world into the no-nonsense world of modern-day Manhattan. That's exactly what ""Enchanted"" wants to show you, and in, uh, a family-friendly manner. Although the premises of Enchanted are fairly interesting, it's the amazing cast that is arguably the movie's most powerful asset. Not only the actors' performances, but the casting choices are also top-notch across the board.<br/><br/>One may not be sure if a 33-year-old would be able to pull off the archetypal Disney princess in the real world, but Amy Adams left me smitten throughout the movie; with her cute innocence and wide-eyed optimism, within moments it becomes hard to imagine anybody else in the role of Giselle. Her transformation from a near-stupidly optimist into a real-world woman over the course of the movie is also handled very well and smoothly, which prevents Adams' aptly over-melodramatic acting (for most of the movie) from coming off as cheesy.<br/><br/>Timothy Spall is also fully believable and downright hilarious as the evil queen's bulky lackey Nathaniel. Patrick Dempsey - who plays the hardheaded divorce lawyer Robert - and James Marsden, playing the archetypically handsome but egotistically dimwitted Prince Edward, are also enjoyable in their respective roles. Giselle's talking chipmunk friend Pip, who can't talk when he's in the real world and has to communicate by acting, is also a drop-dead hilarious CG character; his imitation of Nathaniel in particular cracked me up.<br/><br/>However, Idina Menzel was fairly unconvincing and overacted as Robert's pragmatic girlfriend Nancy, while Susan Sarandom - who is perfectly casted as the evil Queen Narissa - is disappointingly misused (more on that later).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie's strength drastically weakens once the evil Queen Narissa shows up in the real world near the movie's ending. Not only is Narissa farcical and not menacing at all in person, but even the CG dragon that she transforms into during the climax looks like a 3D character with cartoon proportions and comes off as more humorous than menacing. There is also no proper explanation of why Narissa still wants to kill Giselle even after she knows that Giselle's true love isn't her stepson (Edward). The climax, where Giselle dispatches the dragon, should have been better defined and more developed.<br/><br/>Carrie Underwood's ""Ever Ever After"" at the end lent the movie at bit of Disney 'plasticness', but I won't complain much about it because after all, it's supposed to be a feel-good ending, complete with cheesy dancing from Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams; the movie itself is rife with colorful musical numbers that resemble a Broadway musical on steroids, in classic Disney fashion; not to mention the staple ""and they all lived happily ever after"" narration.<br/><br/>All in all, despite a bogged-down ending, Enchanted is a thoroughly entertaining feel-good family film that sincerely honors its not-so-believable homages rather than ridiculing them. However, along with some wonderful performances, the biggest reason that Enchanted is so memorable is its undeniable feel-good charm. RATING: 9/10"

I should not have liked it, and I curse the day that my sister called me and said, I gotta work today, and your niece is out for The Thanksgiving Holiday, she wants to go see ""Enchanted"" Suffice it to say, I tried to talk her into BEOWULF, but no, she had her heart set on Enchanted, so in i ushered her into the theatre, and well... DARN IT! <br/><br/>Amy Adams plays princess Giselle, a young woman, who meets her prince in a day, and in the same day sings to him and agrees to marry him. Then she gets thrown down a wishing well, and she appears in New York City, where she meets a divorce lawyer, played by McDreamy and his young daughter. (doesn't this description want to make you vomit?) Me TOO? RIGHT! but then, somewhere between the Happy Working Song, and the point where Giselle starts questioning what real love is. I fell in love with Fairy Tales all over again. I used to love these films from Disney when i was young, I had my best years watching The Little Mermaid, and consider Beauty and the Beast one of the best films ever made, but they became old, tired, clichéd,... things to poke fun at as the first Shrek movie did so well.<br/><br/>But ""ENCHANTED"" is that pendulum swing in the other direction. Frankly, i'm tired of the cynicism, and this movie gave me back that magic that says, hell, yeah, i want to believe in all the good things out there, I want to sing out that I love someone, and hell, I want to find that other person that is your other half and damn it all to hell, I want to be a romantic. Haven't we had enough darkness in this world? Well, Amy Adams is perfect! she's not only a revelation in this film, in what i call the Best performance of the year, in the most unlikely movie, ENCHANTED is the kind of joyful, pierce the movie screen performance that can lead to a surprise Oscar Nomination simply from the pure force of magic she is able to wield.<br/><br/>I hate myself for loving this film that much, it's going to force me to re-watch all those Disney Movies all over again, to fall in love with Belle all over again, to wish they were made again...

","My friends and I are big Disney fanatics, so we went to see Enchanted with open minds.<br/><br/>The movie's playful satire of the age of classic Disney animation is the best part. Even the title is written in the Gothic style shown in Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. The animation and score (composed by Alan Menken...see The Lion King and numerous other 90s Disney movies) are simply the icing on the cake at the beginning. In the animation world the kids will be entertained and the teenagers and adults will chortle as they remember the overly-enthusiastic naiveness of the protagonists of early Disney films.<br/><br/>Giselle (played superbly by Amy Adams...this woman walks, sits down, does EVERYTHING in character. The innocent vitality she has for life at the beginning of the movie never wavers even when she experiences reality) is super excited to get married to her cliché Prince Charming (James Marsden, also wonderful. His range is incredible...I still can't believe he is also Cyclops and Corny Collins). Conveniently, Charming rides up on his white horse and saves her from a troll, and upon meeting her for the first time decides to get married the next day. But alas, the evil queen(Susan Saradon, who has a regrettably short part so I can't comment on her performance) knows that once Charming, her stepson, marries Giselle she will have to give up her throne to her stepdaughter. So she decides to trick her into a play ""where there are no happily ever afters"" by way of a magic well.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey plays a lawyer who grows skeptical of the subtle fantasy of living thanks to his own corroding marriage, but thankfully he meets Giselle who reminds him (through turning a daily stroll through Central Park into a musical Howard Ashman would be proud of) of the Disney magic in everyone! The movie is rather cute, but the singing and the happiness and the flowers get annoying (although still bearable) after about an hour. The score is better than the forgettable script...the jokes come from the performances, not the writing. I was mostly disappointed in the holes in the plot. Events that shouldn't have happened in reality were never explained (how did the queen's henchman keep disguising himself? How was Giselle able to swing herself up on a building after the queen?)...I know the movie's supposed to be a fantasy but the screenwriters should not completely alter the rules of reality when the point is to show the differences between the real and animated world.<br/><br/>The script is the biggest flaw. Frankly I think the cinematography could have been better too, especially in Giselle's scenes (more sweeping tracking shots of the scenery would have maintained the realism of the fantasy). But whatever. It wasn't a waste of a movie. Take the kids, and Disney fanatics will appreciate the attempt to recreate the classic animation age...but will notice some elements missing that makes this movie feel like it has less heart than it advertises."

","Excellent. This simple, sweet, family film is the best motion picture that I have seen in a long time. I am a natural born cynic, and yet I loved this movie! Amy Adams is wonderful as Giselle and deserves an Oscar nomination for the role. Her acting is fantastic, from the voice over cartoons in the beginning, through the fish out of water scenes, through the production numbers, through the emotions displayed and the dancing at the ball, to the kick butt action in the climactic fight on the outside of the skyscraper. She was wonderful! The second star, and big scene stealer, was the chipmunk. The scene where he plays both the princess and the overweight side kick to pantomime what is going to happen is hilarious.<br/><br/>The other characters are magnificent in their parts. The prince has the required charm along with the inflated ego (Think Gaston from Beauty and the Beast). He stays in character the entire movie. The lawyer puts just the right amount of confusion and frustration into his role. Susan Sarandon shows that she could also be Cruella DeVille brought to life.<br/><br/>This is the best family movie since the original Shrek, without all of the adult jokes from that film. It may also be the best overall movie of the last three or four years.<br/><br/>It was strange, but the vast majority of the audience that I saw this movie with were adults.

","I had a blast watching Enchanted!<br/><br/>Not only is it a hilarious parody of the Disney fairytale formula, it also brought back well known names from Disney's heyday in the 90's. Yes, I'm talking about the masterful duo of Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz who created the music and wrote the songs, so no wonder the film was nominated for three academy awards for best original song.<br/><br/>The animated parts of the movie were also a welcomed return to the traditional animation with colourful backgrounds and great character design. But the strongest aspects of the movie were in the sharp and witty dialogue and the wonderful performances by the hilariously over-the-top but still controlled James Marsden as prince Edward and the main character, princess Giselle, played by Amy Adams. The fish-out-of-water story about Giselle and Edward coming to the real world and still acting like fairytale characters was hilarious. Timothy Spall and Susan Sarandon also made a great villainous duo as the classic evil sorceress and bumbling sidekick.<br/><br/>If you know your Disney, you'll also spot many references to classic animated movies from the company, some more obvious than others. Several watches recommended just to focus on that alone. I spotted references to Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Lady & the Tramp, The Lion King and Snow White during my watch for this review.<br/><br/>The only thing to put a finger on is that by today's standards the computer generated animal character at times look obviously fake, but not to a distracting degree. The CGI used in the big climax is still rather impressive.<br/><br/>I hope other people will find Enchanted as entertaining and wonderful as I did, because it holds high entertainment value and stands well on its own as a Disney parody and a Disney movie at once."

","The first time i watched this movie, i did not enjoy it. The reason: bad quality (hence poor movie experience). I heard it was good but because of my mistake, i did not like it as much as the others did. That was then. Until the television showed this movie recently, i was all in to watch it again, in better quality, and i smiled after watching. Lesson learned.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Prince Edward meeting Giselle in a fantasy world, Andalasia, and proposes to marry her. However, his evil stepmother tricked Giselle- as she does not want Prince Edward to marry Giselle and take her throne, into a well which connects to our world, in New York. Unlike her fantasy world, Giselle tries to find her way back to Andalasia to return to the arms of her, then, true love. She meets Robert and soon learns the real meaning of love. In a 'boom' ending, since this is a fairy tale, expect an all's well closure.<br/><br/>The cast of the movie is great. Amy Adams has the ideal princess look. The development of the story is well- intertwined with comedy and music. The score and soundtrack is good listen too. The costume is stunning- especially Giselle's. In short, nothing could go wrong with this movie if one looks for an escape into a true fairy tale type story- and if you believe in happy endings!"

","""Enchanted"" pulls off an interesting duality. It deftly and entertainingly punctures the twee conventions of one heavily-genrefied type of film with one hand, while with the other it drives full-speed into the conventions of another. While the parody of the children's fairytale cartoon is effective and very funny in its own right, it also casts a bit of ironic, non-normative light on the ""romcom"" clichés that ""Enchanted"" simultaneously engages in. <br/><br/>It's a very witty movie with a clever script, and more than the requisite number of funny lines and situations are drawn from the innocent-abroad conceit of a cartoon fairytale princess (and, secondarily, prince and villainous lackey) transplanted into a complex modern world. The wit of the script is complemented and in many senses the film is really made by a very good lead performance from Amy Adams as Giselle, who has superb comic timing and does an excellent job of treading a difficult line -- giving her character the requisite level of exaggerated innocence and saccharinity while keeping the character well- rounded well-rounded, interesting, and likable enough to carry the film.<br/><br/>The musical numbers as well are very well done -- fully-fledged large- scale production numbers admirable in their own right and as clever as the rest of the script in their contrasting of old-fashioned over-the- top musical styling with real-word cynicisms and banalities. <br/><br/>When that same real-world resolves with a storybook ending all'round, the film succeeds in being as sweet as it likes, but something doesn't settle right in terms of tone and the stability of the worlds that have been established. On the whole, though, the film is pulled off with a lot of panache and a well-written script that does its concept justice."

It may be a plain fairytale but critically, one can get a lot of learnings. plus, the soundtrack is also nice.<br/><br/>Enchanted shares to its viewers that ""happily ever after"" does not happen in fairy tales only but it is also possible in real life. This is what's interesting about this movie. Its simple to understand but with much deeper implications. <br/><br/>Excites the kid in us, at the same time, stir the positive side of reality.

"danjakubik","8","3","3","28 May 2008"," Another success for Disney self parody. This time in both live action and animation.
","Newcomer Amy Adams as Giselle is really the star of this film. Disney has had success before with self parody: ""Aladdin"" (1992) and ""Hercules"" (1997), but never before with a live action film. The Disney self parody works most of the time, but what really carries the film along is Amy Adams' performance as Princess Giselle. Immediately, she is lively, charming, spunky, likable and very much a Disney style fairy tale heroine. That's the first thing I noticed about this film. In my opinion, Disney does not have a good track record of live action films, with the notable exception of ""Mary Poppins"" (1964). So, I'm pleased to see a better than usual live action film from Disney.<br/><br/>I thought Disney's self parody idea, used here in a live action film, would be the star of the film, and bring out, as before, more lively and creative screen writing. In parts, it does, more or less throughout the film. With the return of Academy Award winning Disney composer Alan Menken, the songwriting for this film seems to have had a very good inspiration, I think, partly due to Disney's return to it's fairy tale story roots. The self parody is mostly ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" without the dwarfs at first and later uses ""Cinderella"" for more references.<br/><br/>The story idea of self parody, which can be very insightfully funny when done right, works well for most of the film. Whenever it falters a little, there is always Amy Adams charming and sprightly acting performance to hold one's interest and keep one believing in the magic of Disney's fairy tale stories all over again, for a new generation.<br/><br/>Received 3 Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song."
"BeautifulSinner","10","3","3","6 March 2008"," The title of the movie speaks for itself!
","I'm totally in love with this movie!! The combination of animated scenes and the real world works like magic in this one!! It has a great cast (Amy Adams being the best among them), a good storyline, stunning visuals(including the animation in the beginning), catchy songs and beautiful music that fit the style of the film. You can say Enchanted has it all! The story might be slightly predicable for it ends the way most fairy tales or modern romantic comedies do, this however didn't bother me even a little bit cuz the movie was so fun and entertaining that it made you forget those tiny little problems. It's been a long time since Disney has come out with anything so refreshing and brilliant! And not only did this film live up to my expectation, it exceeded it! I was totally amazed and impressed!! One of the best movies in 2007!"
"ignavum","9","3","3","29 November 2007"," Believe the positive comments!
","I don't watch much television, so I went to this movie knowing very little about it - only that a Disney heroine is suddenly ripped into the real world. I made assumptions. I expected to laugh while the real world defeated all the foolish sensibilities of a fairy-tale princess. ...you know, the usual. The ""reality"" stuff. I feel a little guilty and ashamed now.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic; they chose charming and brilliant actors (or actresses) to fill each respective role - from the real-world every-man (Dempsey), to the bumbling mook (we love Spall; he knows how to work his 'look' and totally own a role). What really stands out, however, is Amy Adams's 'Gizelle'. The actress completely nailed it. I found it actually kind of amazing that she was able to bring the MOVEMENT of an animated Disney heroine to live action - with all the swaning, flouncing, and over-done hand gestures. Watching an actress attempt this could have been too embarrassing to watch, but she managed it while looking completely unintentional - and it really, really worked.<br/><br/>The story itself is typical, and virtually every element is formulaic - but the ""magic"" is in how it's presented. This is Disney at it's best, reworking all the tried & true methods to create something new and fresh, without the risk of disappointment. You get drawn in, you care about the outcome - and you get your money's worth.<br/><br/>Wonderful movie. Go see it!"
"zennikku_10","10","3","3","24 November 2007"," A Disney Classic
","The first thing I have to state is that I am a big Disney freak. I grew up watching all the classic Disney Princess movies. My favorite movie of all time is Beauty and the Beast and in my home I have a collection of all these films from Sleeping Beauty to Pocahontas. So I might be biased in my review because this movie is made for people like me.<br/><br/>The movie has a simple story line. Giselle (Amy Adams) is about to marry Prince Edward (James Marsden) until his evil stepmother (Susan Sarandon) throws her down a well and she ends up in New York City. She befriends Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter and they help her on her quest to return home. Anyone who's seen a Disney film can probably figure out the rest. The movie starts out classic Disney style with the old animation that just isn't around anymore. The music and characters are all reminiscent of those movies I know by heart. I didn't feel Enchanted makes fun of these movies but is a sort of homage to them.<br/><br/>The performances of this film are all stellar. Amy Adams is wonderfully charming in her role as Giselle. She is truly enchanting and it's practically impossible to not to fall in love with her performance. She is flawless just like you would imagine every Disney Princess would be if you ever met them in real life. James Marsden is the same way, he plays Prince Edward like a true Prince Charming. Patrick Dempsey isn't known as ""McDreamy"" (as nauseating as that nickname is) for nothing. He is truly dreamy and plays Robert perfectly, he may not be the typical Prince Charming but he'll make you fall in love just the same. Susan Sarandon is fine but isn't really the stand-out in the movie.<br/><br/>I'm completely geeking out over this movie but if you enjoy watching an uncomplicated love story with no cynicism whatsoever, just some laughs and great musical sequences. Then Enchanted is the movie for you. It's been a long time since I have fallen so head over heels in love with a Disney film so I am very happy this movie came out. See it and fall in love all over again."

","I loved this movie! I went and saw it tonight with my best friend, and we kept alternating between laughing hysterically and saying ""awwhh!!"" It had plenty of funny moments (The woodland creatures are the best. Just wait until you meet Pip!) and it had some great life moments and quotes as well. ""But dreams DO come true!"" My friend and I love our Fairy tales, and it was fun to pick out each one from different parts of the film. We're also both hopeless romantics, and we loved that ""Enchanted"" brought those fairy tales into a ""reality"" setting. They really can happen, they can! Don't ever settle! I liked the way the cartoon and real life scenes were melded together. The actors were great as well! Gisele is beautiful and there are no complaints about the men either! =) This was a nice way to modernize some of the greatest (In my opinion) stories ever! I think the way the movie is presented makes it do-able for guys too. Take your girlfriends to see it! Ladies, go out with your girls and see it! I don't care how old or young you are. It was fantastic. It was-enchanting!!"
"ViveLaNeige","9","3","3","23 November 2007"," An excellent Disney parody of Disney, and heartwarming, too!
","As soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was excited: a Disney movie where they parodied Disney fairy tales? Genius! I saw the movie today, and it did not disappoint. From the traditional animation-style beginning to the live action (the majority of the movie), the story was excellent. Without spoiling any plot details, I will say that both Amy Adams and James Marsden have excellent singing voices, and play their fairy tale characters in the real world with the perfect mixture of magic and ridiculousness. Patrick Dempsey is also surprisingly good as the man Giselle (Amy Adams) meets and whose life she turns upside down.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the old Disney princess movies, and also can appreciate laughing at them (in a way that is also a loving tribute to them), this movie is for you."
"obi1-1","10","3","3","22 November 2007"," Best family film of the year! I highly recommend it.
","Looks like Disney's done it again; I am sure this movie will become an instant classic. I went in to the movie with pretty high expectations, and I must say I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Amy Adams as Giselle was simply a joy to watch and James Marsden as Prince Edward was hilarious. Susan Sarandon as Queen Narissa was appropriately sinister and vile. Alan Menken's music was beautiful and, in a word, enchanting. Adams has a lovely singing voice, which I found a pleasant surprise. I especially enjoyed the tongue in cheek humor. Disney did a great job parodying their typical style, but at the same time, it was not overdone. Some of my favorite sequences were done as a parody. I found myself laughing (out loud) harder during this movie than any movie I have seen in a very long time. I especially enjoyed the over all clean-ness of the movie. There wasn't anything that I would be uncomfortable letting a young child see, which is a breath of fresh air in today's entertainment world. The story was engaging, the ending was happy but not over the top sappy, and the song and dance numbers were so much fun. I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie!"
"TBear6000","10","3","3","22 November 2007"," Excellent Film
","I just saw this film last night and absolutely loved it. Much as the plot would suggest, it's everything you would expect of a Disney fairy tale come to life, with a bit of a modern twist. Amy Adams had the difficult job of portraying a character that could have easily been very two dimensional and clichéd, but she was fantastic, making Giselle a character the audience could sympathize with and root for. The film really has something in it for everyone. The women, men, children, and teenagers in the audience I saw it with all seemed to truly enjoy it. It is an excellent romantic comedy, but also wonderful family entertainment. While it does have moments of humor and subtext meant for the adults to appreciate, this is a film you don't have to be afraid to take your children to see. It contains positive messages for both the young and old - even hints of female empowerment that are so lacking in many of the classic fairy tales. I highly recommend this film."

I can't imagine anyone not loving this movie. It has all the qualities of a classic picture. I think this movie has appeal for all ages. I can't seem to watch it enough.

Now, I'm not saying that Disney movies are bad, it's just that live action movies (or non-animated) usually, well... suck<br/><br/>But this one... as I watched it, magic went on, through my eyes and in my head. This movie is the reason why movies were created in the first place, to entertain. And with amazing music, I was impressed how catchy the tones were.<br/><br/>Also, Amy Adams was completely amazing, I fell in love! She's definitely one of my favorite actresses now! Patrick Dempsey was great too and his daughter in the movie, one word = WOW! This is her second movie and she was fantastic! Can't forget James Marsden, he was great and his comedic timing is great too. And the animals were so adorable too. This movie is pure entertainment, I really recommend it.<br/><br/>One of the best movies of the year AND probably the best ""fairy tale movie"" I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I also want to cheer this movie because of its originality. With bright heads in Hollywood at the time there are very many remakes and only a few movies that are able to impress.<br/><br/>Go see it if you haven't already! 10/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","9","6","8","22 June 2009"," Sweet, funny and charming, one of the most pleasant surprises of 2007!
","I loved Enchanted, by all means it isn't perfect, but it is a sweet, fun and charming film, that to me was a huge surprise. The animated sequences were lovely, with bright colourful backgrounds, and the live action ones are beautifully shot. The music, by surprise surprise Alan Menken was surprisingly good, taking inspiration from Disney classics like Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. I particularly loved the production number in the park. The script is fresh and funny, and the actors look as though they are having fun, making the film refreshingly irreverent, if perhaps a little silly. I also thought the performances were excellent, Amy Adams was beautiful and perfectly charming as Princess Giselle,(sounds like something out of a ballet), and James Marsden was actually tolerable here as Edward. Sure, he mayn't be the most likable of all the princes ever, but he was funny at times. Patrick Dempsey was also good as Robert, who Giselle meets in New York, and in some way he falls in love with her. Timothy Spall has his moments as Nathanial, and while I personally wouldn't associate Susan Sarandon with villainous roles, she was great as the villainous Narissa, who banishes Giselle to New York. Though, my favourite character has to be Pip the chipmunk, he was not only sweet but absolutely hilarious. The scene when he tries to tell Edward of Nathanial(and impersonating him), culminating in him swaying about singing the love theme, had my whole family in hysterics. I loved Enchanted with its quirky performances, fast pace and engaging dialogue, though I will say the film in't without a flaw. (yes almost every single film I've seen has at least one)The film's only flaw is that the CGI Dragon finale was slightly overblown. Other than that, a simply delightful film, that kids and adults will enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox."
"Deveousdevil","10","6","8","24 April 2008"," I was surprisingly ""enchanted"" by this movie, it was actually very good.
","I was forced to watch this movie by my girlfriend who is really into chick flicks unlike me, who is mainly into crime dramas and action movies, however, I ended up thanking her for it. At first I was opposed to this movie because I figured it was another lame attempt by Disney to ruin its classics that were unparallel in uniqueness and greatness to other children's movies, by making sequels, and making cheesy, corny romance films. However, my assumption was pleasantly proved wrong when watching this movie. This movie is actually pretty sweet and heartfelt. It isn't the typical cheesy romance you would expect walking into the theater. It is actually a very good and pleasant movie.<br/><br/>The music is very appealing and euphonious. The lyrics are very good as well. It is the fact that nothing was done over the top that stopped the movie from killing itself. Demsey, playing an uptight single father, does a good job of being real and not going over the edge and turning the movie into a sappy pathetic disaster. Meanwhile, Adams, does the best job with her character. She's a great symbol of happiness and love and is perfect with every word and facial expression throughout the movie. She adds a great deal of humor to the movie by acting very nonchalant while embracing her childlike and innocent role.<br/><br/>In short, for someone who would put this movie as your bottom 100 movie to watch, i put it on my top 10. It was a really good movie and would be time well spent when watching just to get some enjoyment and childish emotion while watching a movie."
"MartinHafer","9","6","8","3 January 2008"," Heart-warming, but probably not for everyone
","I finally saw this film nearly a month after its debut. Because of this, there are oodles of other reviews and many of them encapsulated the plot very well, so I won't even try. Instead, from the standpoint of a middle-aged man, I loved the film. Some of this might also be because I took my teenager with me and since she got such a kick out of the film, I couldn't help but like the film. I thoroughly enjoyed ENCHANTED and am glad I saw it. However, after it was over I thought to myself how would others like the film? After all, I am a real softie and like romantic films--what about teenage boys, guys who only cry at John Wayne flicks or rabid feminists? I seriously doubt these audiences would have appreciated the film nearly as much, say, a group of young girls or people who just love the Disney cartoons it parodies. Still, for the right audience, this is a sweet and magical film that is sure to please."

","Yes, I totally agree. I didn't expect it to be this good, but afterward I realized I haven't been so easily moved by a film in a long, long time. The acting was exceptional, the story priceless, and the effects superb. When a movie makes it so easy to suspend my disbelief I can't help but enjoy it. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! We too were singing and dancing all the way to the mall (for Christmas shopping). ;) I am a film major with emphasis on screen writing, but I'm studying all aspects of film-making. This movie is hitting on all cylinders, so to speak. I kept thinking back to when I first watched Titanic and how moving and believable it was, but to capture that feeling in the ""fairy tale"" genre, really seems to be an impossible feat. This movie made the girls (4 and 8) and the adults (mid forties) laugh out loud, almost cry, and smile a ton throughout."
"datmfnp","10","4","5","28 November 2008"," I can't believe a 22 year old man likes this movie...
","I was completely caught off guard. I had heard of it when it was coming out in theaters and everything, but I didn't pay any attention. Then, this Thanksgiving it was just my aunt and I by ourselves and my mom left us the movie to watch. I thought, ""okay, whatever. Sure."" This movie was a big surprise. I don't know if you'd consider some of my comments spoilers exactly, but whatever.<br/><br/>I'll tell you why this movie was so great. For one, it's a marriage of reality and fairy tale, of course leaning for towards the fairy tale side, but whatever. At first you get a sense of how ridiculous the whole Andalasia world is. By the way, I liked the old, more grainy, animated 2D world of Andalasia. The artwork is admirable, and it's awesome to see CGI hasn't taken over EVERYTHING. I kind of missed the old school way of animation. Anyway, so they completely play up the whole fantasy, fairy tale world with a combination of Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Giselle sings and has animal friends. Everything is so stereotypical and childish that it's funny. I laughed my .. ah-hem... butt off. Then, when Giselle gets to the ""real world"" of Manhattan, it's hysterical. She has NO clue where she is, what she's doing, or who she's dealing with. She's too beautiful and innocent. The funny part is I didn't expect her singing and beauty and kindness to work, but it does! She ends up making some.. ""new friends"" with the animals of NYC, having sing-alongs with people in Central Park. It's crazy.<br/><br/>That brings me to my second point. Amy Adams.... WOW.. DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, especially at the end. I don't think I've ever seen her before, but she is fantastic. She plays the part of Giselle so well. She eventually starts to learn about how the real world is and begins to feel emotions she's never felt before, like anger and falling in love with another man when she's ""supposed"" to marry prince charming. She, of course, ends up falling in love with Robert (Dempsey), but HE ISN'T the romantic, charming prince. What gives, right? I thought her character really grew throughout the film, but only in a way that made her much more appealing, beautiful and strong. She maintained her innocence and kindness, but not to the point that she seemed like some naive, one-dimensional princess. She became a character that you could feel for and like. Move over, Dempsey! I'm on it, baby!<br/><br/>Anyway, Prince Edward is funny as hell. He's so out of place, and unlike Giselle, doesn't learn any new things really. He's stuck in fantasy, prince charming hero mode. Really funny scenes play out with him in traffic in Times Square, in a motel, watching TV, etc. He's such a fool. Once he was out in the real world, I actually thought he was going to end up being a real jerk who was conceited and more or less just interested in having a beautiful princess because it's what he wanted.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey, as Robert, played his part well. He was a charismatic, sarcastic and funny, but polar opposite of Giselle. A single dad who is a divorce attorney meets a fairy tale princess. Trust me. It's funny. From a neutral perspective, and I don't mean to sound... well, whatever, he really is a likable, good looking character that you can also empathize with and feel for.<br/><br/>Some of the morals of the story I came out with are that you can find love in unlikely places when you least expect it. You can actually be a optimistic, kind hearted person in a sometimes cold world and live happily. Also, what hit home for me is the sense that you may not be ""prince charming,"" even he is far from perfect, and you may even need a beautiful girl to rescue YOU sometimes, but you can still be a beauty's true love. Nice, right?<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was great. At first, I was apprehensive, and I didn't want to seem like a real wuss for watching and getting into some fairy tale Disney movie. You know what? I DON'T CARE. It's a feel good, unrealistic, happy movie that will make you laugh a lot, and learn to care and root for the protagonists. I have no shame in liking this movie.<br/><br/>Amy Adams, I love you...."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","4","5","19 May 2008"," 'You've Met Your Match, You Foul Bellowing Beast!'
","Disney comes up with a charming little movie. 'Enchanted' starts with the old fashioned animation that was evident in Disney classics. This animated sequence cleverly parodies other Disney fairy tales. Then after about 20 minutes or so into the movie, the characters enter our New York City. What follows are hilarious events of culture shock, discovery, singing, love and friendship.<br/><br/>Bill Kelly's writing and Kevin Lima's direction are technically very good. The lines are great and the way the actors deliver them only highlight the humour. I only had a problem with the love angle. It just didn't engage me as a viewer. Perhaps it's because of the chemistry between Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey. Amy Adams is lovely and transcendent. She shows her characters transformation brilliantly but Patrick Dempsey is hardly convincing. At best, he's strictly okay. I didn't know that Timothy Spall was in the movie but when I saw the animated version of Nathaniel,I was thinking how much he resembled Spall and of course, he is Spall. James Marsden steals the show. I'm starting to like this actor very much as he really gets under the skin of the characters he plays and does nothing short of a fine job. A barely recognizable Susan Sarandon rounds it off with her strong presence and she pulls it off with ease. And, of course Julie Andrews lends her welcoming voice as the narrator.<br/><br/>The animation is impressive and it reminds one of the classics Disney used to gift. The special effects and visuals are stunning. The songs are funny to watch. Cinematography is good.<br/><br/>'Enchanted' works well as a family film. Kids will surely love it. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was Giselle and Robert's love story. Otherwise it was a pleasant viewing."
"xx-o-xx","2","18","34","22 July 2008"," Complete nonsense.
","I love Disney movies, really, I do. Lion King and Aladdin are amazing, and I was hoping with Enchanted we might get a bit of that same greatness. I wasn't asking for Enchanted to be as good as Disney's old animated movies- I was merely asking for something substantial.<br/><br/>And I didn't get it.<br/><br/>The thing with Enchanted is is that it is a brilliant idea, and when I began watching it I actually liked it. When Giselle leaves the animated world and comes to Manhattan the movie starts to become another clichéd nightmare.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey did not do well, in my opinion. He was too old for Amy Adams and I did not believe his acting at all. Amy Adams, while doing fantastic, was not given a good enough script to work with- same with James Marsden.<br/><br/>I am aware that it's a children's movie and it deserves to have a fairytale ending, but the thing that irked me the most was that this movie gave us a moral- Love takes time, love takes getting to know somebody - and then defy it ten minutes later. I was actually appalled with how it double-crossed its own expectations. Idina Menzel (Nancy, I think, in the movie) was with Robert for FIVE YEARS. Five years- there has to be substance there. Even if the child didn't like her (which was a half-hearted attempt to get the audience to do the same) the point was that Robert did. He had to have if he was with her for so long and proposed. How can he- who tells Giselle that it's not even thought of to marry within days- fall in love with Giselle in three or four days? She does nothing spectacular but yet there's TRUE LOVE. Ladies and gentlemen. To add salt to the wound (and to give us the false hope that every romance can end perfectly) Nancy marries the prince hours after she meets him! How a movie can be so inconsistent? The only reason I am giving this movie a 2/10 is because of the song ""So Close"" by Jon McLaughlin and James Marsden. I absolutely adore those elements of the movie, but unfortunately they are not enough to redeem the entire thing."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","5","7","3 December 2007"," The Possibility of Happily Ever After
","While scarfing down some mushroom chicken and having a conversation with 3 and half year-old Jack and his dad Vince before seeing Disney's ""Enchanted"", excited Jack told me that ""Enchanted"" has a princess, a prince, and an evil stepmother that transforms into a dragon. Well, before finishing lunch I was thoroughly enrolled in ""Enchanted"". ""Enchanted"" is all about the possibility of happily ever after. Director Kevin Lima and Writer Bill Kelly tell an enchanting fairy tale that still resonates in this often time cynical world. Why not the possibility of happily ever after? Amy Adams emerges as a bright star in the role of Giselle, the fairy tale princess trapped in the real world of Manhattan, New York. Lima and Kelly seamlessly transition from the animated fairy tale world to New York City with measured disbelief. But then again, we kind of know what we are getting into when seeing this movie. ""Enchanted"" is a musical albeit tongue-in-cheek at times. The songs and music by Alan Menkin (""Beauty and the Beast"") and Stephen Schwartz (""Wicked"") are exquisite and classic homage to Disney films past. There is the spectacular musical number in Central Park with Adams singing as Giselle. She asks divorce attorney Robert (Patrick Dempsey), how does he know that he loves his fiancée Nancy (Idina Menzel), then bursts out into song.<br/><br/>What really entranced me was the simple story. When Giselle asks Robert about true love, he argues, ""It's complicated"" There is a surprisingly touching scene in the park when Giselle tells Robert, ""I wish you find every happiness in the world."" Amy Adams is wonderfully earnest and genuine as Giselle. ""Enchanted"" is both a hysterical twist and homage to the fairy tale. Although at times blatantly cheesy, ""Enchanted"" is all about wonder and heart. Patrick Dempsey is great. He brilliantly plays the straight man in this collapsing of real and fairy tale worlds. He and Adams have amazing chemistry which is the foundation of ""Enchanted"".<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" begins in the fairy tale world of Andalasia where Giselle awaits her true love. Until then she spends most of her days singing with the animals of the forest. Her true love would be Prince Edward (hysterically pompous James Marsden), who spends most of his days conquering the ogres of the land. This is the diabolically constructed strategy of Edward's wicked stepmother Queen Narissa (evilly camp Susan Sarandon) to keep him from marrying Giselle; thus, replacing herself from the royal throne. However, Giselle and Edward are fated to marry. On their wedding day Narissa, disguised as an old woman, banishes Giselle to the world of ""no happily ever after""New York City. Fortunately Edward's loyal chipmunk Pip clues in the Prince of this conspiracy. Edward then follows his beloved Giselle.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey plays Robert, a single father and divorce attorney. Robert is at somewhat of a cross roads in his life. Though apparently good at what he does, he is unfulfilled. He is raising his daughter Morgan (cute Rachel Covey) by himself, and about to marry his fiancée Nancy (hilariously uptight Idina Menzel). And we all know that she is not the one. As fate would have it Robert and Morgan take in Giselle, who occurs as total nut job. Being more perceptive of these sort of things Morgan tells her Dad, ""I think she is a real princess."" Robert soon wonders whether he is going insane or that Giselle is really who she says. All the while, Robert wonders if he has found his true love in Giselle. Meanwhile, Queen Narissa journeys to New York with a poison apple for Giselle.<br/><br/>It's good versus evil with a surprising heroic twist. The other surprise in ""Enchanted"" is the innate good in its characters. Well, except for Sarandon's Queen. However, Sarandon brilliantly balances the menace and camp for hysterical effect. James Marsden infuses a playful compassion in Edward. Patrick Dempsey embodies Robert's nobility. Amy Adams's bright spirit also radiates courage and character as Giselle. ""Enchanted"" celebrates the possibility of happily ever after in a very entertaining and special movie."
"reedlaw","Null","15","29","4 October 2009"," Mockery, not parody, of classic Disney tales
","If you've ever seen Disney films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella, you may appreciate the many references to these classic tales in Enchanted. However, if you enjoyed the older films for what they were: timeless fairy tales with archetypal characters, battles of good versus evil, and a moral, you will be greatly disappointed with this film. <br/><br/>Enchanted is by no means a traditional fairy tale. It starts off with an animated story of a maiden, Giselle, who is the archetypal Disney princess. She is rescued by Prince Edward from a ravenous troll and the two fall instantly in love. Before the couple is married, the wicked Queen Narissa transports Giselle to the ""real world"", New York city, where she gradually becomes modernized. The way in which she loses her storybook likeness is subtle, but it involves meeting unfriendly types, seeing a couple on the verge of a divorce, and going out on a ""date"" at a pizza place with a divorced lawyer who has taken her under his wing. When Prince Edward finally locates her, instead of being thrilled to go back to her animated, storybook world, she has one request. She asks to be taken to a real-world ball, where her lawyer friend and his fiancée happen to be going as well. At the ball, the evil queen intervenes, giving Giselle a poisoned apple. After taking a bite, she falls into a deep sleep, only to be awakened by true love's first kiss. In what seems like an unbelievably out-of-character twist, Giselle's true love turns out to be the lawyer and not Prince Charming. How she could have been so thoroughly transformed after only a few days in New York city so as to disdain her former life and fiancé is a mystery.<br/><br/>Besides having to swallow this strange plot twist, we also witness the lawyer's fiancée, Nancy, falling for the prince. This is after Giselle has heard countless warnings from denizens of the real world against love at first sight. Apparently, Nancy has never heard these warnings, because she falls madly in love after hearing Prince Edward introduce Giselle as ""my heart's true desire"". ""So straightforward. Not a hint of irony"" is her response, and that's all the reason we're given to believe she will leave her life and career and go back to fairyland with Prince Edward. Finally, when all hope of a reasonable ending is lost, we must witness a chipmunk single-handedly vanquishing the evil queen who has transformed herself into a dragon.<br/><br/>Besides these atrocities, there is also much mockery of the traditional fairy tale. The Compact Oxford English Dictionary defines postmodernism as ""a style and concept in the arts characterized by distrust of theories and ideologies and by the drawing of attention to conventions."" Enchanted fits this description by making a fairy tale character gradually wake up to the conventions of her fantasy world. If you're looking for a dose of reality, you may enjoy this film. But the film's title and animated introduction are misleading. The story is not Enchanted, but Disenchanted. It forces us to see the traditional world of make-believe from the modern, grown-up perspective. It is not a story for children, or those who truly enjoyed the earlier Disney classics."

Tangled was us bursting through to the other side with the contradictions reconciled, but until then, we NEEDED this movie reflect on our relationship with the Cinema of rushed courtship, gender based characters and feeling sorry for Feudalists.<br/><br/>As a comedy of culture clash, the urban and the fantasy play mystically well against each other and we have one of the few really convincing romances in disney where idealism meets jaded adulthood and the two bring out the best in each other.<br/><br/>I really feel all ages can get something out of this as well as both fans of the Princess movie and those who love to mock it, even if the latter might have to just read a bit of Greer during the lovey dovey moments (which I'm totally into as much as I love Germaine)."

Enter an amazingly good Amy Adams as Giselle, ready to face filthy New York with optimism. Other characters follow her from the animated world to the ""real' one and they are all equally amusing.<br/><br/>Thanks to James Marsden acting chops, Prince Edward is strangely endearing, with his vacuous smile and silly bravery. Pip the chipmunk is adorable and the baddies of the story are suitable despicable. <br/><br/>While Dempsey is suitable as the alternative love interest, Adams is really the heart and should of the movie. The way she moves her hands is impeccably artificial and strangely natural (for an animated character).

"davispittman","8","2","2","16 March 2017"," Very entertaining Disney film
","Disney's Enchanted (2007) is a very entertaining well thought out movie for all ages. Amy Adams is a perfect pick to play the lead here, she's bubbly, endlessly cheerful, and fits the princess perfectly. Patrick Dempsey is great in his role as well, he plays the widowed successful divorce attorney father raising a young daughter. He is very distant and detached in the beginning of the movie but as the film progresses and as he falls for Amy Adams, he starts to break from that and become more warm and we get to learn a lot more about his character. The character depth in the movie is very well executed and is more satisfying than most run of the mill family oriented films. And then we get to Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, which in my opinion was the best casting decision in the whole movie. She is so effortlessly evil and deliciously wicked. The visual effects are masterful and very cool to see, it's obvious that a large amount of effort was given to special effects, which is a very necessary thing for a film like this. You get an overall good feeling while viewing this movie, and the well written good hearted characters and great actors to play them are largely due to that. The movie incorporates different classic Disney animated films in the monumental ending. Such as leaving behind a glass slipper (Cinderella), a fire breathing dragon (sleeping beauty), and others, which was neat. I suggest this film as good well done entertainment. 8/10."
"ericrnolan","Null","2","2","25 September 2014"," Yes, I actually watched this. (A review of ""Enchanted."")
","Because while I have a love of horror movies, I also have high school friends with small children.<br/><br/>She REFUSES to let me show her three girls the whimsical magic of ""Donnie Darko,"" even though that film is clearly appropriate for children. (It has a talking rabbit.) So the five of us watched 2007's ""Enchanted,"" and I liked it a lot. Because the laughter of little girls can be infectious after a long day.<br/><br/>If you're an adult, you can have good fun watching Disney lampoon its own clichés, all the while avoiding them — the gently spurned would- be stepmother here, for example, isn't ""wicked."" The fish- out-of water humor of a Disney princess inhabiting the ""real world"" is accessible to adults. And Susan Sarandon is a pleasure to watch in any film — I actually never realized before what a great voice she has until I heard it connected with her animated equivalent here. (The movie is bookended by animated segments.)<br/><br/>You can also have great fun trying to recognize the genteel characters as actors you've seen in other movies. The bubbly, clueless princess here is none other than the reserved, highly intelligent Lois Lane in ""Man of Steel"" (Amy Adams). I spent the whole film trying to figure out who the prince is, until I realized it was Cyclops of without his visor (James Marsden). And the character of Nathaniel is none other than Timothy Spall, who every film fan will recognize as Thomas Tipp from the priceless ""Vanilla Sky."" Spall is also in another group of movies  apparently there is this really popular film franchise about a boy wizard? (It might be based on a book series.)<br/><br/>Seriously, this is a fun, safe movie for small children that you can also enjoy with them.<br/><br/>Since the girls liked this so much, I am going to screen ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" for them if my friend lets me babysit. That's a fun, fish-out-of-water story with a strong female protagonist too.<br/><br/>http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"
"lesleyharris30","8","2","2","5 June 2014"," A Great Modern Take on Disney Princess Films,
","Enchanted is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a great cast.Amy Adams and James Marsden are certainly the best in this movie,they both played characters that were nothing like any characters they played previously and it seemed like a risky career choice to be playing real life versions of a fairy take prince and princess,but it didn't effect their career in any way and they did a fantastic job.The movie pokes fun at several Disney animation films throughout that are really funny and that the whole family would get.My favourite part about this movie was the music,every sing was stuck in my head until the next song came along and it's no surprise three of the sings were nominated for Academy Awards,the best song definitely being ""That's How You Know"".Enchanted is a very enjoyable movie that I would highly recommend as a family film. <br/><br/>A girl living in a fairy tale world's life is turned upside when an Evil Queen transports her to New York City.Her future prince comes to save her,but she begins to like the real world and the people she meets there. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Amy Adams Worst Performance: Rachel Covey"
"A_Different_Drummer","9","2","2","4 January 2014"," real ""magic"" is Hollywood getting it right
","Everyone's got a job. You do. I do. Hollywood does. For over 100 years Hollywood's job has been essentially matching actors to the roles they are supposed to play. It is called ""casting"" with 10s of 1000s of experiments under their belt, you would by now expect them to get it right by now. Problem, they don't always manage it. See for example what happened when they tried to cast Kristen Stewart as Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman -- if ever there was a fish out of water, it was Stewart in this role and, yes, before the emails start, I am aware there is sequel in the works, but Stewart has so many unquestioning fans (most of whom need permission to stay up late) they would pay to watch her do laundry. (Sometimes it is not Hollywood's fault as for example when major stars control a production and cast themselves -- see my review of Jack Reacher). Anyway, to the point, here they nailed it. Remember that ""close"" only counts in horseshoes. But here they did not have to worry, they nailed it. Adams is pitch-perfect, one of the few actresses who could sell you a storybook character in the real world. She is a gem. And Sarandon as the wicked witch is simply a guilty pleasure. Great movie."
"MaximumMadness","10","2","2","31 July 2012"," Disney's ""Enchanted"" is a delightful, adorable and very fun film that has great humor (and parody/satire) for kids and adults!
","From time to time, I find myself watching the career of a single actor or actress, watching pieces of their work throughout their career. After having come across the delightful and extremely talented Amy Adams in films like ""The Muppets"" and ""Sunshine Cleaning"", I decided to watch some of her previous work, eventually coming to the Disney release ""Enchanted"", which I'd always intended to watch, but never have gotten around to.<br/><br/>This film is one of the best comedic family releases of the decade, if not the single best example. It is a loving homage (and at times, seemingly a parody and borderline satire) of classic Disney and family fantasy. Following a classical animated Disney princess who is transported to modern-day New York City by her soon-to-be wicked stepmother, the film is extremely heartfelt, hilarious and joyful.<br/><br/>Adams stars as Giselle, a fairytale princess from the magical (and animated) kingdom of Andalasia, where she spends her time pining for true love's first kiss with her woodland animal friends, including a talking chipmunk named Pip. When the valiant and vain Prince Edward saves her from a troll, she becomes convinced that she's found true love, and plans on marrying him the next day. However, Edward's evil mother Narissa fears losing her thrown to Giselle and tricks her into falling down a magical portal, where she emerges in (live-action, real-world) New York City. After being confused by the cities lack of mysticism and light-heartedness, she is taken into the home of handsome divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey), where she learns more about the real world, while teaching Robert to lighten up and believe in goodness and fairytale logic.<br/><br/>Narissa (played in voice and live action by Susan Sarandon) sends her henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) to find Giselle and stop her from getting to Edward (James Marsden), whom has traveled to New York with Pip to find her.<br/><br/>From there, it becomes a culture clash story as Giselle realizes Robert may be her true love, and feels torn between Andalasia's charms and Edward, and the real world.<br/><br/>The film is remarkably well-made. From an opening prologue that is so cliché Disney, it's almost painful to watch (in an ironic, charming and quite funny way), to the culture-clash of Giselle and Edward's transportation, a lot of conventions of Fantasy and adventure are bent and played with.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely wonderful. Adams basically is the film, and plays the role to perfection. There isn't more to be said, other than she is the beating heart of the whole thing, and she's the only actress who could have done this role justice. She deserved all of the praise she got, and honestly could have (and should have) won an Oscar for the role. It's a daring, wonderful performance. Marsden is also extremely notable and is just as good as Adams. Parodying the concept of a Prince Charming, Edward is charming and vain to the point of being likable-yet- unlikable all at once. Marsden walks a fine, fine line, and balances the character quite nice. Dempsey is good as Robert, bringing a realism to the fantastical proceedings, and grounding the film. It's also a nice touch that he's a divorce lawyer, acting as an antithesis to Giselle's visions of true love. Covey is charming as his daughter Morgan, and will melt the heart of parents and children with her innocence. Sarandon is a lot of fun as the villainess Narissa, and she plays the role well, but as the focus is mainly Giselle, she doesn't get much development. Much better is Spall as the semi-villainous Nathaniel, who is a bumbling, lost henchman with more complexity than one might think. He is able to succeed as a villain and a character where Sarandon is somewhat unable to due to their uneven screen time.<br/><br/>In terms of production, this is a gorgeous film. Kevin Lima's slick direction adds a lot of character, and makes you forgive some of the lesser scenes, and the script by Bill Kelly is a lot of fun, and loaded with hundreds of Disney references. The score by Alan Menken is very decent, though not as big a focus as one would think for such a silly film, and production and costume design is top-notch. Songs and lyrics by Menken and Stephen Schwartz are wonderfully meta and self- referential, including a song literally entitled ""Happy Working Song"" and a hilarious and beautiful song about how to let someone know that you love them.<br/><br/>This praise being said, there are some minor faults. For starters, the villain Narissa is extremely under-developed. She's a classic case of a character who is evil simply for the sake of being evil. Times have changed, and it's hard to accept a villain who is evil for no reason these days in a film. There is also some minor flaws here and there in the animated sequences. The opening prologue does drag a little bit, despite being too quickly paced. It tries to do too much with the opening animation in terms of parody/satire, making it feel a little indulgent and bloated. Some of the humor, while funny, is geared towards adults a little bit too much, which could cause parents watching the film with children to get into awkward conversations trying to explain the adult jokes. Finally, the film really does paint-by-numbers during the third act, which was a bit of a letdown after how wonderful the first hour was.<br/><br/>However, these faults, despite being fairly significant, cannot diminish the fact that most of the film is completely flawless. Featuring a lovable, endearing cast and some first-class filmmaking, this one is easily a perfect 10. I love it, and I think it's a great film for families, or even adults looking for a hilarious, nostalgic rush. Check it out!"
"teamedward167","10","2","2","2 May 2012"," How this good this is
","I think this is a really good movie because the animations are very good and the actors are better. I never thought that taking one small idea from other old stories (like snow white) and making them into a awesome movie like that was. I really enjoyed all of the movie and it shows that true love always wins over evil, sometimes you may not even notice it though. This movie is funny, romantic and also has a lot of comedy in it. There is no swearing so this movie is best for kids and for adults to watch to. Nothing is violent so I think that this should be one of the top movies of all time, and the animations can go along with it. It may seem good at the beginning but it gets better at the end but I'm not going to give it away because the ending is to good for anyone else to know about it without watching the movie. The actors and songs are the best thing to this movie because they can sing really pretty and the songs will get stuck in your head if you don't be careful."

","Enchanted is one movie that presented a fairy tale in a realistic manner at present in modern-day New York.It stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Timothy Spall, Idina Menzel, Rachel Covey, and Susan Sarandon. The film was produced by Disney,written by Bill Kelly and directed by Kevin Lima.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around a story of Giselle, an archetypal Disney Princess, who is forced from her traditional animated world of Andalasia into the live-action world of New York City.Giselle (Amy Adams) lives in Andalasia, an animated fairy tale world with talking animals, characters breaking into song and ""happily ever after"" a foregone conclusion. Prince Edward (James Marsden), her designated true love, saves her from a troll and they plan to get married the next day. Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), Edward's evil stepmother, schemes to protect her throne, which she will lose once Prince Edward is married. She throws Giselle into a portal that transports her to a world where there are no ""happy ever afters"", also known as New York City.<br/><br/>Giselle emerges in the middle of Times Square. After a number of misadventures, including causing a minor car accident, accidentally being caught in a crowd and getting on the subway, and having her tiara stolen by a homeless man in the Bowery, she meets Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), a hardened, yet friendly divorce lawyer. At his daughter Morgan's (Rachel Covey) insistence, Robert lets Giselle stay at their apartment. Following the ways of her fairy-tale world, Giselle recruits urban animals (of the breeds generally believed to be household pests) – pigeons, cockroaches and rats – to clean his apartment while she fashions a dress out of his curtains. Robert's girlfriend whom he was going to propose to, a fashion designer named Nancy (Idina Menzel), misunderstands the situation and runs off after arguing with Robert. At Robert's law firm, his secretary Sam (Jodi Benson) tries to find Giselle transportation home, but cannot locate Andalasia. Deciding he must part with Giselle in Central Park, Robert offers her some money. However, Giselle almost immediately gives it to an old woman who remembers Edward stabbing an MTA bus in Times Square (while under the delusion that the bus was a giant steel beast). Deciding that Giselle needs his protection, Robert rejoins her. While walking through the park, Giselle questions Robert on how he displays his affection for Nancy, before launching into a big song-and-dance number that gets the whole city singing and dancing. Giselle eventually helps Robert reconcile with Nancy by sending flowers to her, along with tickets to the King's and Queen's Ball.<br/><br/>The story ends when Edward finds Giselle's discarded shoe and places it on Nancy's foot àla Cinderella. They happily leave for Andalasia to be married. Giselle uses her magical dress-making talents to run a successful boutique shop, assisted by both humans and animals. Both Nathaniel (in New York) and Pip (in Andalasia) become successful authors, writing self-help books based on their experiences. The last scene shows Giselle, Robert,and Morgan playing and living together happily ever after.<br/><br/>The movie is one original and refreshing movie that still in the Disney tradition that both kids and adults will appreciate alike.It contains witty lines and great animation.Aside from that,the character of Giselle and her story will make people from all ages appreciate and relate to her.For adults it will bring out the memories of their youth into them.I attribute that to Amy Adams' excellent portrayal of Giselle.She is one hell of an actress as she is realistic as a live- action fairy.In terms of the other performances,special mention also goes to Patrick Dempsey as the lawyer and James Mardsen as the prince.Also,the music,the direction and the story also makes this film highly-recommended for everyone.In summary,everything works in all level for this movie."

She meets divorce lawyer Patrick Dempsey who is divorced himself and can't figure out why these marriages don't have ""happily ever afters."" Meanwhile, the evil queen sends her goons to kill her, and her prince follows her too. The sexual innuendos turn out to be fine for a Disney movie. I loved the allusions to other Disney films too as Giselle (Adams) tries to adjust to this totally unfamiliar world-the real world- and Dempsey tries to adjust to her, figure her out, and explain things to her. Adams's delightful, wild-eyed performance is perhaps this movie's main highlight. I also loved the ball scene and animated scenes. This movie is a must-see, especially for kids. I loved the chipmunk.

"Rodrigo_Amaro","10","2","2","10 May 2010"," A Enchanted Tale Of Our Times
","""Enchanted"" is another great fairy tale about a princess that must be rescued by his charming prince. But the difference starts when we find out that this story begins in a sort of classic Disney cartoon and it evolves to a motion picture with real actors and placed in the current time, in New York City. This idea really works showing the contrasts of real life when many things go wrong versus fiction life where everything ends with a happy ending.<br/><br/>Giselle (Amy Adams) is the princess that wants to find his true love, the man who'll finish her love songs duet. And Edward (James Marsden) is a handsome knight that happens to be her true love in vice-versa. But the witch Queen (Susan Sarandon), also Edward's mother, fears that his place in the castle will be taken by the beautiful Giselle and so she pushes the poor princess into a dwell that led her to recent times, most precisely at 21st century, right in the middle of the Times Square. <br/><br/>Now Giselle's is totally lost in time and in the city but she insists to the other people that she needs to find a castle in order to get married with his prince. During one of those walks into the city she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter (Rachel Covey). He's gonna help her to find his way back home and of course find her prince. But there are more many complications on the way: Robert is getting married with Nancy (Idina Menzel) and Giselle's sudden appearance may ruin the 5 year engagement of the couple; a man loyal to the queen was sent to impeach that Giselle returns home, the funny and deadly Nathaniel (Timothy Spall, excellent), the Queen herself also appears to put her plans in the right direction and Edward seeks for her, to rescue her once again. The funny thing in this story is that she's a happy princess that always believes in happy and romantic endings, and Robert is a lawyer specialized in divorce, and he knows that in real life not always couples stay together. This kind of playful and paradox dynamic worked very well in this film.<br/><br/>Another great thing about ""Enchanted"" is the comparisons between the two worlds. Robert presents to Giselle all the differences of the real life but it's not a bureaucratic movie when the character finds many different things and starts to ask what everything's for (this happen only in a scene when Giselle is in the shower and she wants to know where the water comes from). The scenes and the dialogs about what is true love, and the reasons of why or not believe in happy endings and fairy tales are very well written and many times it's the best thing in the movie, working way better than the funniest scenes and the musical moments. <br/><br/>All actors are good here (most notably Amy Adams, James Marsden and Timothy Spall), there's comedy and romance, funny situations, well, it's a very entertaining family movie. And of course like in almost every Disney movie, there is a happy ending!"

","Amy Adams is brilliant. The live incarnation of a true Disney animated princess. She is the reason this movie works. It doesn't hurt that Patrick Dempsey is a convincing confused pessimistic divorce attorney, and James Marsden is a stereotypical send-up of all the Disney princes. Disney pays homage to its history of fairy tales lightheartedly (unlike Dreamworks, which goes for the cynical skewering). It's easy to be cynical for a cheap laugh, it's much tougher to be funny and gentle about it and still get away with it, and Enchanted does that.<br/><br/>The Happy Working song had me laughing so hard, I was crying. I've seen this four times and it keeps getting better. Bravo, Disney, for making a truly fun film that we can enjoy for years to come. How often can you say that? Amy Adams is a gem."
"jcajka","8","2","2","4 February 2009"," A self-satirical spoof of past Disney cartoon masterpieces.
","I have been amazed at the comments of those who hated this movie. They complain of the bad music, the syrupy plot and do not realize that this is Disney's parody of itself. All the characters from Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bambi, animals and humans are brought to non-cartoon life as dirty pigeons, rats and roaches. If some viewers cannot get this, they lack a sense of humor. I am not an expert on music, but one of the tunes was catchy enough to have me humming it for an hour, and the fact that the three songs were nominated for an academy award should say something. I though the musical production was typical Disney, what you would see at a Disneyworld production, lots of glitz, costumes, color and movement. Watch it again in the right spirit this time."
"vip_ebriega","8","2","2","18 October 2008"," 'Enchanted' Amy, and the movie is a fairy tale come true!
","My Take: A very familiar fish-out-of-water Disney musical, but with great tunes, loving touches and an appealing performance by Amy Adams.<br/><br/>The Disney studios has done a long strain of mediocre to terminally bad works for such a time. Be it the banal THE WILD or the insufferable CHICKEN LITTLE, Disney might have hit rock bottom as far as the studio is concerned. But, after a long exhausting line of ""Oh, boy!"" efforts, I approached ENCHANTED with very low expectations. When I saw the posters for the film, I let out a small sigh of hopelessness that Disney will ever get out of its mediocre status. But when the film started to stir up a buzz, I was forced to get sucked into this immediately. The critics praised the film as ""sweet"" and ""refreshing"". The Tomatometer at Rotten Tomatoes.com ranked it with, not just a passable, but a high rating of 93%. Pretty high for a simple film like this, but I took the time to see this film on video after missing it on the big screen.<br/><br/>The film opens with an animated sequence, which was just as awful as I'd expect. The animation sequence was lacking in anything I liked about Disney. By this point, I was about to give up. I was glad I didn't! After the tiresome animated opening, the movie evolves into a sweet, funny and often refreshing rom-com, in fact much more entertaining than most I've seen in years. It's also satisfies as the best Disney movie in a long time, and it's really been a long time, so it's worth seeing.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the main reasons why the movie makes a terrific return to form is the return of Academy Award-winning composer Alan Menken, who serves up a series of energetic and lovable musical numbers and lavish songs to come along with it. Other than that, the real star of the film is Amy Adams as the fish-out-of-water Princess Giselle. Fans might remember her from her Oscar-nominated performance from JUNEBUG, which earned the hearts of critics. Her performance here is another winner. In fact, she carries the entire movie right along her winsome and blissful performance as a clueless princess, kicked out from her candy-coated paradise and transported into the world without any happily ever afters, modern New York City. Patrick Dempsey plays the divorce lawyer who comes to her aid, much to the insistence of his princess-loving daughter (Rachel Covey). On the other hand, Giselle's true husband-to-be Prince Edward (A surprisingly joyous James Marsden) goes down the same well and arrives in New York in search of his beloved (in one scene, Edward points a sword to a construction worker and says ""I seek a beautiful girl!"". The worker replies ""I'd like to find one of them too!"") Supporting performances by Timothy Spall as Edward's right-hand man Nathaniel who apparently happens to work with an evil witch (a rarely-used Susan Sarandon), who also happens to be Edward's evil stepmother who wants to prevent her son to get married. Among the other pleasures of the film is the twists on their old fashioned fairy tales. Like, for example, Nathaniel tries to poison Giselle with three poisoned apples in many of outrageous ways (namely, caramel apples on a stick, apple martini). The good thing about the film is that it's so joyous and blissful that audiences are guaranteed to smile at the thing for it's entire running time. And if that's all I can ask in a movie like ENCHANTED (I guess it really is), then Disney delivers immensely. <br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."
"MrGKB","7","2","2","8 October 2008"," A pleasant diversion from typically bland Disney fare...
","...that I probably wouldn't have even commented upon but for the somewhat unusual breakdown of IMDb user ratings. As of this writing, nearly 2 out of 5 voters are female--a bias not totally unexpected, but still seemingly out of the ordinary on this site. Also unsurprisingly, the ladies liked ""Enchanted"" more than their male counterparts, by a full half a point or more, with the interesting exception of the 45+ cohort, who for whatever reason (no patience for sappiness?) liked it less than their male counterparts to an equally significant degree. I would bet you someone could write a decent term paper on the situation, given the chance to do further research and/or surveys/interviews with the voters.<br/><br/>No matter. ""Enchanted,"" the brainchild of screenwriter Bill ""Premonition"" Kelly and director Kevin ""102 Dalmatians"" Lima, is a decidedly on-target send-up of formulaic Disney product that takes a great premise (how would the inhabitants of a typical Disney animated fairy tale fare in the ""real"" world?) and gently satirizes the genre and its conventions while still delivering a very standard Disneyesque message (true love isn't blind, but thrives with mutual understanding and respect). Well-acted by a fine ensemble cast, and gorgeously produced in every aspect, ""Enchanted"" is meant to appeal to all ages, just as many of the old classic Disney films were, animated or otherwise. Amy ""Psycho Beach Party"" Adams is all naïveté and saccharine goodness as the misplaced Giselle, James ""The Notebook"" Marsden is perfect as her well-intentioned but utterly boneheaded Prince Char--I mean, Edward, Patrick ""Grey's Anatomy"" Dempsey is winningly vulnerable as Giselle's real world swain, while Timothy ""Sweeney Todd..."" Spall, Susan ""Joe"" Sarandon, and Idina ""Rent"" Menzel all have great turns in support. There are plenty of in-jokes and tributes and what-not, amusing product placement (what, you expected anything else in a Disney film?), and a script that refuses to treat its audience like brain-dead consumer units. ""The Princess Bride"" this is not, nor is it as funny as, say, ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action,"" but ""Enchanted"" is still highly recommended by this viewer as quality family entertainment that adults can enjoy without blushing."

","Rarely do I go to the theater and see a movie as enjoyable and great as this one. Disney made ""Enchanted"" as an effort to recycle some of the classic formulas and poke fun at them at the same time. It tells the story of Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) falling down a well and landing in the real world, and while waiting for Prince Edward (James Marsden) to rescue her, she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter and both ends up learning from them and touching their lives. Not only was it hilarious watching the characters try to adapt to these situations, but the film ended up being incredibly romantic and touching. ""Enchanted"" has quickly become my second favorite live action Disney film, next to ""The Parent Trap."" See this film, or you may miss out on a real treat.

","Please read this only if you've seen the movie which is absolutely wonderful. See it. Stop here if you have not seen it. I just wanted to add a bit of trivia that I believe is accurate but welcome corrections if it is not as I am no expert on fashions. But I noticed that Giselle's dress at the King & Queen's Ball has a snug fitting frill at the bottom of it. I believe the style is called a mermaid's tail or something closely similar to it. With so many other incidences & references to the Little Mermaid throughout the movie, I thought this would indeed be highly consistent. Did anyone else spot this? It's nice to see such sweet movies still being made. Congrats, Disney. You've made yet another winner."
"doctorsmoothlove","7","2","2","3 May 2008"," Surprinsing and perky but never boring
","To say this isn't a film I would usually see is a vast understatement. I have had little interest in Disney films and musicals since I became a teenager. Combining the two would appear to ruin any chance I would have of viewing this film. I'm also an 18 year old male accounting student, so I'm far from the target audience. Despire all of my original uneasiness, I enjoyed the film and recommend it. Enchanted is a somewhat original picture whose greatest asset is its lead actress. It also benefits from high production values and actual character development, regardless of how clichéd it is. It is an enjoyable film nevertheless and a memorable return to traditional animation.<br/><br/>As I'm sure most others have already mentioned, this film takes the traditional Disney princess and prince archetypes and places them in the real world. Amy Adams is the real star as Giselle and brings the same naiveté to her role as she did in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. She is so over-the-top that her live-action role as Giselle is more damsel-in-distress than Snow White or Sleeping Beauty were in their respective films. However, unlike those two, Giselle's predicament means that she must mature and leave her ideal world behind. This presents a rarity in Disney animated (well in this case, partially animated) features: a female protagonist that the audience wants to ""live happily ever after."" Patrick Dempsey also makes a triumphant return to the big screen but isn't as memorable as he perhaps could have been. There is nothing wrong with his acting but it lacks the emotional variety that Timothy Spall, James Marsden and Amy Adams have in their roles. I've not seen Idina Menzel enough to access her performance but it was adequate given her role. It was not memorable.<br/><br/>Like the forgettable fantasy Stardust, Enchanted also shows its character development via costuming. Giselle's clothing becomes more realistic as she becomes more aware of actual romantic relationships. Robert's clothing stays the same until the ball scene when he assumes a fantastical garb, which shows his progression from a cynical businessman to an idealistic paramour. In the end, both characters have a balanced personality but the film focuses more on Giselle's development than Robert's. In contrast, Prince Edward shows no change at all and his clothing remains the same. <br/><br/>Where this film succeeds is its seamless unity of CGI effects, traditional animation, sensationalized acting, and homage to earlier films. The astute viewer will notice the obvious reference to Snow White, Bambi, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and a subtle reference to King Kong. The film does lose some marks for its episodic plot structure which has little logical coherence. Characters seem to float around various places with no objective in mind. It is as if the situation is supposed to develop the characters instead of the characters actually changing themselves. This is most obvious in the Central Park song. Speaking of songs, the few in this film aren't particularly memorable. They won't have the legacy that The Nightmare Before Christmas and The Lion King, among others, have had. They aren't unwatchable, but they present a great opportunity to fast-forward your DVD or Blu-ray. Also, the ending is unnecessarily awkward. Why must Queen Narissa (interesting pun) turn into a dragon? It's like Suburbia and Sunshine morphing into slasher films. If she had been arrested or somehow detained, nothing would have changed. Fortunately, the film is nearly over before the catastrophe begins, so it's forgivable.<br/><br/>While Enchanted isn't a film for adults, parents and reluctant dates will still get some pleasure in watching it. It presents an interesting concept that is both homage and a parody of itself. It also stars Amy Adams, and there is a bathroom scene nearly identical to the one from Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. The film is, on occasion, genuinely funny due to PG-laced innuendo. Also, despite what some critics have said, I see this movie as a feminist critique. It shows that the idealistic wife/girl/unmarried woman may begin life sheltered due to consequences over which she has no control but can emerge from these and be a productive person. If that doesn't persuade you to watch it, then perhaps it's similarity to The Princess Bride will. Both films create an effective fantasy romance with spectacular distinguished acting. While this film isn't on par with The Princess Bride, it is much better than Disneys' latest Pirates film and last year's other romance/fantasy Stardust."
"departed07","8","2","2","1 May 2008"," Amy Adams will enchant your heart.
","I've had little expectations about the film ""Enchanted"" since I'm not one to follow the Disney princesses from Jasmine of Aladdin, Ariel of the Little Mermaid or Belle from Beauty and the Beast. But when I bought the film on DVD after hearing numerous people saying how wonderful it was prior to being a box office hit, I just knew this was going to be a delight.<br/><br/>The film starts in animation form where the animals and trees sing while Princess Giselle waits for true love from Prince Edward before meeting with his mother (the wicked queen) where she kicks her into a well that takes her into another part of the world.<br/><br/>The other world is none other than New York City, the city that never sleeps, where Giselle (Amy Adams in human form) is wandering in the streets all alone dressed in a white wedding gown and is not used to the mean and dangerous world compared to the sweet enchanted life. She confuses a short man for a dwarf while a homeless man steals her tiara leaving the princess all alone. It isn't until she's spotted by lawyer Robert Philips (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) where they have no idea what she's doing on a billboard. Morgan considers her a princess while Robert thinks that she's just lost and needs to go home.<br/><br/>It isn't until the next day where things start to get a little strange for Robert where he starts seeing dancing cockroaches and birds while Giselle is singing her way in his home like a fairy tale.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Prince Edward (James Marsden) is in human form where he takes his companion Pip, a talking chipmunk, and his faithful servant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) to find Giselle just as The Wicked Queen, Narissa, played wickedly by Susan Surandon, wants Giselle dead and wants Nathaniel to finish the job.<br/><br/>While this is a Disney film aimed mostly at 5 to 12 year old girls, as a grown male I was impressed to see that this film was enchanted with delight. But the real reason to see this film is none other than good girl Amy Adams who plays the character of Giselle so blithe and wonderful that not only will she be another princess in the Disney lineup, but she's someone that we wish we could have in the real world who only wants people to be happy."
"Spondonman","8","2","2","30 March 2008"," Snow White Redux
","Snow White being one of my favourite films ever I felt I had to see this parody of it and themselves by Disney, nor was I disappointed. It's probably the best piece of non-violent non-heavy entertainment made in the last 10 years, updating Disney's roster of fairytale films with a bit of gentle mocking, respectful homage and a touch of worldly cynicism and getting away with it.<br/><br/>In cartoonland a beautiful girl is transported out of the way to the real world by evil Queen desperate that her stepson Prince shouldn't have the chance to marry her and thus become King. However he and a chipmunk follow her to bring her back while a friendly young girl and her father Patrick Dempsey look after her  to my daughter he was the most enchanting thing about Enchanted! Chaos is brought to the streets of New York as well as smiles to the faces of all of the denizens of Central Park participating in a spectacular song. Does Love conquer Cynicism or does Love conquer Singing in the streets? There's some nice songs , some smooth dancing, clever referencing and witty dialogue along the way to savour. You know you're in the modern film world however when the cartoon chipmunk inadvertently dumps - once upon a time Disney's animators used to spare us such crudities. Be sure too that you know your Snow White, Cinderella, Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty And The Beast et al - even King Kong - to get the most from this. The ending was a bit hurried  but just like Snow White's was! <br/><br/>Ultimately it's a refreshingly entertaining little film and cheerfully indifferent as to whether it has any faults or not."

","Enchanted is how Disney used to make live action films. There is enough whimsy and fun in the film to keep the kids involved, but there is also the elements that keep the parents in the seats with their kids. This really could have been a mess given the wrong leads. Amy Adams delivers a fantastic performance, she will be working in many films to come. Her performance is the cornerstone of the film. James Marsden once again shows a penchant for comedy (anyone checking out the ""making of"" docs on any movie he has done has seen his wit in action). McDreamy steps back into the big screen with success. Susan Sarandon and Timothy Spall are pitch perfect on the villain side of the house. Back on Adams, she is an absolute pleasure to watch, doe-eyed and all. The musical number in the park is worth the price of admission alone. It hearkened back to the heyday of when Disney did live-action musical comedies in grand style. They now have a new entry to go a long side the classics. <br/><br/>Movies are all about the story and the actors you have to pull off the story. Disney hit a home run here with a self-parodying effort that could have failed, but with an excellent cast, the film rises to the top of Disney live-action comedies."

Too say the least, I went to see this movie thinking I would merely think it was just an okay in my book.<br/><br/>Oh my, was I wrong!<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed ""Enchanted"" more than I thought I would. It was a truly magical, adorable, and sweet movie that will be enjoyed in years to come.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" tells the story of a soon-to-be princess named Giselle who is to be married to her prince, Edward. But when Prince Edward's wicked stepmother, the Queen, hears of this, she quickly worries that her throne will be taken away from her. So in an attempt to save her crown, the Queen banishes Giselle into the real world where ""there are no happy endings."" Giselle ends up in the heart of New York City where anyone is anything but friendly to the confused and frightened princess. While trying to find her way back to the castle, Giselle encounters Robert Philips and his six-year-old daughter Morgan. The two take in Giselle and help her try to find her way home to her prince. Unbeknownst to the trio, Prince Edward and Pip, Giselle's best friend chipmunk, have already begun their adventure in rescuing her. But with just a few days in the real world, Giselle begins to experience what real life love truly is.<br/><br/>The cast was rightly chosen. Amy Adams portrays Giselle with such innocence and beauty that she makes what could have been an annoying character into a very likable and adorable princess. Patrick Dempsey is very much the prince charming and quite dreamy in this film. I found him much more likable in this film than I do in ""Grey's Anatomy"", but that is simply my opinion. James Marsden is a wonderfully funny Prince Edward and is a very remarkable singer. Timothy Spall is adorably comical in his role as Nathaniel. Susan Sarandon is wickedly marvelous in her role as the Queen. Idina Menzel, although not much screen time, did wonderfully with her character of Nancy, I especially adored her first appearance in the film. And lastly, Rachel Covey plays little Morgan and she is very delightful in her role.<br/><br/>The music was also great! It was mixture of many original classical songs that each Disney princess movie would likely have. One memorable scene that sticks out is the musical number of ""That's How You Know"" sung by Amy Adams herself. It was a wonderful, funny scene. The only thing I did not care much for was the dragon scene toward the end, simply not my cup of tea.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this film to anyone that is a Disney fan or who is just looking for a good time. I must admit, I walked out of this movie feeling quite happier than before and I couldn't stop smiling. This one is not to be missed!<br/><br/>8/10"

","Just got home from seeing this on a rainy night when the electricity went out 3 times during the showing, and yet, the movie still hit its mark! Unbelievable! Who in their right mind would try to make this movie? Actually, even more daunting, who would try to cast this thing? I remember being impressed by Amy Adams in the movie Junebug, but this is different, almost as if she's being asked to go higher and farther with the cheerful goodhearted woman thing than anyone has ever even tried to go. I've heard some say Amy's the new Julie Andrews, but really I think she quite surpasses Julie for the simple reason that her character here is so unreal, you can't help thinking the actors are running on sheer guts and imagination. I can't imagine this movie having been possible even a couple of years ago, they had to have been waiting for the appearance of Amy Adams especially.<br/><br/>But the important thing is everyone in this movie does a magnificent job. From the director, to the animators, to the supporting cast members and song writers and choreographers. This is a genuine tour de force and a real triumph over the incredible unlikelihood of putting the pieces of this movie together. There were many children in the audience when I saw this this afternoon and, surprisingly, it seems to have worked quite well for them. I would have thought the storyline a little too pleasing to adults to be able to reach kids as well but they squirmed for about 2 minutes out of the entire flick."

All the hilarity and potential complications occurring from a clash between Fairy tale land Andalasia and it's un-streetwise inhabitants and present day New York city make this a must-see movie for everyone.

A very cute CGI chipmunk makes the movie fun, as it did in ""Over the Hedge"".

She is spellbinding in her ability to stay so ""up"" and in wonderment, as if she were, in fact, an animated Princess thrown into a live-action world.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised at how one actress can overwhelm a picture and captivate the audience. This is what they mean when they say "" an electrifying performance"". <br/><br/>See it for the fun, see it for the family.

"askmike1","10","2","2","24 November 2007"," Enchanted is just that
","My favorite Disney fairy-tale-type movie since Hunchback, best non-Pirates Disney movie since Monsters Inc and funniest Disney movie since Bringing Down the House.<br/><br/>This movie was just so great. Seeing a musical again was fantastic and it felt like a true Disney movie. Of course, Alan Menken's score was as good as ever and the songs really are memorable. The animation was very good and the story itself was great. I love how not once in the movie did I get the feeling of Shrek-like mockery. Obviously there was plenty of parts poking fun of past Disney titles, but unlike Shrek, this movie embraced the Disney past. Not once did any of the people go out of character or break the 4th wall. And with the exception of that unnecessary phone joke at the end, all the jokes were very funny.<br/><br/>Overall, the major two things I can say about this movie is that A) Alan Menken proved he still has it and B) Disney has set the bar high for both Rapunzel and The Frog Princess.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW <br/><br/>--------------------- <br/><br/>First off, the opening was brilliant. Having them zoom into the castle and have the traditional story-book opening (this time enhanced by pop-ups) was great. And having Julie Andrews narrate was the cherry on top. The entire beginning animation felt like it was right out of Snow White (or any of the other early Disney movies). The entire beginning was enchanting.<br/><br/>Unlike other movies, this one did not drop during the middle act. Seeing Giselle react with Robert and ""reality"" was fantastic. My favorite part was the show stopping musical number in the park. Amy Adams' recreation of the famous Beauty and the Beast/Gone with the Wind run up the hill scene was done perfectly. And at no time did I feel sponsorship in the movie. Obviously it was filmed (at least partially) in New York, so the billboards were there. But I was very surprised (and happy) that they didn't overlay other billboards with their own (ie, not putting a Mary Poppins sign instead of the Mamma Mia sign). Also, at no point did it seem as if the movie would date itself (except of course for that unneeded cell phone joke at the end).<br/><br/>And of course, the final act was as epic and as Disney as any past Disney animated movie. Once again Amy Adams was great as the heroine and Susan was great as the evil dragon. I think my second favorite scene in the show was the Ball (especially once the stepmother arrived). Susan Sarandon played a perfect mixture of The Evil Queen, Yzma and Maleficent. And the final montage I thought was a very nice way to end the film.<br/><br/>Amy Adams fit the Disney princess Giselle perfectly. I honestly don't think they could have gotten someone better than her. And it wasn't even that she was a plastic doll of glee. She really felt real and had moments where you can really sympathize for her. Patrick Dempsey fit the prince charming role great, James Marsden provided great comic relief as Edward and of course Susan Sarandon was a fantastic Disney villain."

","Gisele (Amy Adams) lives in a little cottage in her animated world. Her only friends are the tiny woodland creatures who help her around the house. Yet Gisele insists that a handsome prince will come, as she sings about her ""true love's kiss"". Prince Edward does come soon after and they fall in love, fairy-tale style. The next day, as Gisele is coming to the castle in a wedding gown, ready for the ceremony, her soon-to-be mother-in-law, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) disguises herself as a hag and pushes Giselle down a ""wishing well"" to the land where ""there are never any happy endings"". That would be New York City, of course. (The Queen does this so she does not have to give up any regal power). Gisele comes up through a manhole and into heavy traffic and confusion. But, someone soon comes to her rescue, a handsome lawyer named Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his little girl, Morgan. Robert is about to marry a no-nonsense lady named Nancy and he is utterly befuddled by Gisele, who breaks into song on a walk in the park and who does not even have a driver's license. Even so, he can't help but notice her beauty and her sunny nature. Can fairy tales happen, even in Manhattan? This is an enchanting, lovely movie from the talented Disney company. First, it has a nice combination of animation and real life that works seamlessly well. Secondly, it has some new, wonderful songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, including ""True Love's Kiss"", ""Happy Working Song"", and ""That's How You Know"", some of which should be nominated for Oscars. And, thirdly, the cast members are very well-chosen, too, with Adams making a beautiful, songbird princess, Dempsey showing he is a natural choice for a ""real world"" prince, and Susan Sarandon giving a great turn as the evil queen-stepmother. Naturally, the production is enchanting, too, with gorgeous costumes, scenery, and cinematography. Therefore, if you are seeking a nice, family film for the little princesses at your house or are one of the true romantic souls of the earth, do not delay another afternoon. Some ""enchanted evening"" is here this holiday season, just for you, at the nearest cinema multiplex."

","** May Contain Spoilers **<br/><br/>My wife and I took our 10 and 8 year-old boys to see this movie, and I was concerned that it wouldn't hold their attention (or mine, for that matter). I was TOTALLY wrong - the movie is funny, smart, and entertaining for both children and adults. Amy Adams is incredible as Giselle, the princess. She is amazingly believable as a Disney princess come to life (think classic Disney such as Snow White or Cinderella). Patrick Dempsey seems to enjoy his time spent in the film as Robert, the New York divorce attorney with very practical ideas about love and relationships. The entire movie is very tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at many past Disney characters and their actions, while at the same time incorporating them into the story line. Although there are twists on the ""prince saves princess and they fall in love and live happily ever after"" formula, Enchanted follows that basic theme of so many Disney films, right down to wicked witches, poisoned apples, and helpful mice (and rats, and cockroaches...). Overall, I would say that we chose well, seeing this movie instead of Bee Movie, Beowulf, or The Game Plan. If you have children under 12, this is a great movie to see as a family."

","My family always goes to a movie Thanksgiving Day, so it has to be something that all the kids can watch. Most of the time we see something like the Cat in the Hat, or some other dumb animated movie that drives me nuts the entire time. However, this year we got a real treat with Enchanted.<br/><br/>I thought it was just going to be another sappy cartoon story, but it really made me laugh and almost cry even. This is story telling on the level of Disney's The Lion King, or Beauty and the Beast, or others of the great animated classics. For a family movie, this is a must see.<br/><br/>Also, it is completely clean. Other shows, like the Shrek series, try to make a funny animated movie, while inserting crudities, but this was clean enough for the entire family to enjoy.<br/><br/>I especially liked how Disney poked some fun at itself, and some of its corny moments from movies past. Instead of being ashamed of those things, this movie really embraces them and allows the watcher to laugh at the same things they have enjoyed for years. Consequently, this is a must see for a family movie, and one that I will want to buy as soon as it is out on DVD.<br/><br/>Note: The Music and Graphics were also very good, so it might be one that is best enjoyed in the theater."

","The move starts with a small bit of classic Disney animation which I found nice to see, given that most animation has gone CG. Since this move is based on the classic Disney tale, it fit well into the move. The cast in this movie could not be better chosen. Amy Adams' performance is worth going to see this movie if for no other reason. She deserves an award for her performance. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The acting is perfectly played, blending humor without being too silly and pokes a little fun at the Disney genre but still holds true to it in the end. I am not a fan of musicals, but there is one musical number in middle of the movie that is thoroughly enjoyable. Bravo! This is one of my favorite movies and destined to be a Disney classic I am sure. I highly recommend this movie."

","How can I describe the awfulness of this movie? Cliché-ridden? Yes. Dull? Yes. Unimaginative? Yes. Predictable? Yes. Unfunny? Yes.<br/><br/>But it is even worse than that. After about 40 minutes of this inane story, I looked at my watch, and we were only about 10 minutes in this dragging film. After about 30 minutes, my wife said to me ""I am so relieved that YOU picked it!"" <br/><br/>What else is awful about it? The music! A pale, pale, pale, pale attempt at imitating a 1950's musical. Sorry, I was around when the 1950 musicals came out, and they were nothing like this uninspired version. Who would want to listen again to ANY of the boring lyrics of ANY of the songs in this movie! Pity the poor sound editor of this movie who had to listen to them again and again.<br/><br/>What else is awful? Well, many things. The chipmunk scenes, for instance. Who wants to spend any part of his or her time on Earth watching a chipmunk do a charade ? And then later in the film, do ANOTHER one! <br/><br/>A critic wrote that Walt Disney would be proud of this film. This is what made me suggest to my wife that we should see it as our Friday-night-at-the-movies selection. Au contraire, there is nothing of the genius of the original Disney films in this very limp version of a fairy tale. I think he would be appalled. <br/><br/>Incompetence must not be rewarded.

","I am trying to think of a family film that I enjoyed more than this. There isn't one. It was that good. Disney has a huge hit on their hands. Acting was great all around. It was Amy Adams' film though and her portrayal of Giselle was wonderful. I hated her in ""Junebug"" and she got an Oscar nod for that. Of course I thought that whole film stank, but she has done great work since. This is going to be the role that brings her to A list status and make her a household name. I can't imagine someone not liking Enchanted. Well actually I can, but I feel sorry for them, cause they would have to be a troubled soul. James Marsden gets some of the best lines as a totally narcissistic Prince.I have always liked Patrick Dempsey and he does great work as a straight man to Amy Adams princess shtick. (I have to throw a plug in for ""Some Girls"" an underrated classic that he did in his early 20's. If you have never seen it, rent it. It is hilarious. R-rated for a good reason though.)"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","3","4","20 July 2008"," Overly charming, camp-filled fun
","Bravo to Walt Disney Co. for having the guts and brains to make fun of itself and then go ahead and make lots of money off of it. This is a really fun comedy that combines both the magic of Disney pre-21st century with a 21st century sense of humor. It's also not too heavy on any one of the things it tries to be: it's not too musical-heavy, romance-heavy or joke- heavy--it really caters to all ages and both genders (though girls are more likely to appeal to it at first). This is one of the first things Disney has done in awhile (other than stay with Pixar) that deserves applause.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" is a live action/animated mix that attempts to show what happens when Disney's animated ""happily ever after"" world collides with modern-day ""never happy"" New York. It's a clever concept that unlocks a mostly fresh set of jokes to be made. Combine that with a few first-rate songs written by Disney master Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, the genius behind ""Wicked,"" and you have something special. <br/><br/>Giselle is a typical ""Disney Princess"" from animated land Andalasia looking for her true love who is Prince Edward. The evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) of course wants them never to be happy and banishes Giselle to New York where she is played by Amy Adams. Edward (James Marsden) goes after her as does Narissa's squire Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and a chipmunk named Pip. Giselle is discovered by a divorce attorney played by Patrick Dempsey who has some relationship issues of his own and both our way of life and Giselle's love-filled naive way of life clash.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is the far and away standout of the film, though Dempsey does do well as your pretty standard ""i don't believe in fairy tales"" kind of guy. Adams convinces you so easily she's from an animated world. Marsden does this well too, but Adams runs away with your affections. Her characterization never cracks and she beautifully shows us her character's inner transformation as she falls for Dempsey and subsequently our world. Her skill makes a pretty cheesy romantic-comedy plot seem special and different.<br/><br/>This is a really feel-good, fun story that even though it plays out like any fairytale formula, still works and doesn't turn you off to enjoying the end. It is a very clear-cut we learn how to believe in love more and the fairytale characters learn to be more realistic and that both can live in harmony...all that good stuff. It's just a really positive way to spend 100 minutes."

It is a great traditional fairy-tale story mixed into a funny romantic comedy for the whole family!<br/><br/>Others have described it in so many good ways so I'm just going to say this: I am as far away from the intended audience as you can get to this movie. I mostly like gritty, realistic movies where romance usually ruins it all for me. But this IS a fairy-tale/romantic comedy.

Its impossible not to fall in love with her! I don't recommend this movie to anyone who like real movies with realistic issues, with this movie you have to just go with the flow and think of all the other Disney movies!! Do not question anything and you will truly enjoy this! Also another thing about this movie is it REALLY funny. On many occasions i found myself laughing out loud(but really loud).

However, Queen Narissa plots to get rid of Giselle, and with the aid of Nathaniel sends her to another world - ours. Can Prince Edward and Pip, a chipmunk(!) save her?<br/><br/>Bill Kelly deserves immense credit for his script. It's packed with subtle references to previous Disney animated movies, but is also very, very funny.Kevin Lima directs well, the highlight being a big musical number in the park done in typical Disney style as Giselle starts singing, leading to everyone joining in. My own favorite scene though is the cleaning of the house. Showing from Giselle's point of view, it's done like a typical Disney scene, a-la Snow White. When Robert Philip, whose house it is enters the room all he can think is his house has been invaded!<br/><br/>The cast enter into the spirit of the movie brilliantly. Susan Sarandon, despite limited screen time, is suitably evil as Narissa, Patrick Dempsey does well as a cynical lawyer slowly changing as Giselle's spirit and attitude wear off on him. James Marsden as Edward is heroic, but best of all is Amy Adams as Giselle. Her performance is funny and charming. I think it deserves an Oscar nomination at least, it is that good.<br/><br/>The animation at the beginning is done in the style of Snow White, Cinderella, etc. which brings back memories of growing up with those movies. The CGI used for Pip in New York is fantastic. The musical numbers are worked well into the movie. Yes it has a typical Disney happy ever after ending, but so what? It is still a fairytale.<br/><br/>This is a movie the whole family can enjoy over and over again and might, in time, become a true classic."

She definitely has the potential and skill to be the next A-list actress. Also James Marsden and Patrick Dempsy demonstrate that they are star material and have a bright future ahead of them. This movie was also really funny. I went in thinking it was gonna be another lame parody of fairy tales (cough*Shrek the Third*cough) but it was more then that. Instead of making fun of it it paid tribute to the old Disney movies. I'm a teenage boy so people would think this movie wasn't aimed at my demographic but it didn't matter because i still loved it and you will love it.

Soon after her arrival, Princess Giselle begins to change her views on life and love after meeting a handsome lawyer. Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?<br/><br/>I was quite embarrassed to see myself in a crowd of mothers and children while watching the film. Still, I wouldn't mind since I knew this was going to be a good movie. Was I right? Yes but it did fell below my expectations. The whole concept felt like another film released this year. It was called ""Happily N'ever After"" and that had a much better sense of humor because there were some jokes the adults could enjoy.<br/><br/>The jokes in this film were pretty basic and childish and maybe a few that were laugh-out-loud. But this film in't about the comedy, right? Well, for the most part, this is a very cute, entertaining, although sometimes dragging a bit, and for the whole family to enjoy.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is predictable but the main reason why this movie worked, and I know people would agree, is because of Amy Adams! If another actress would take her spot, it wouldn't have been much successful as it is right now. She is just magical in her role, which was really good. James Marsden, Susan Sarandon, and Patrick Dempsey all played their role really well too.<br/><br/>The songs in here are a bit cheesy and overly cute, although it wasn't anything special.

"susansmoose","10","3","4","26 November 2007"," A Different Ever After
","This is the story of good, evil, trust and betrayal. It is about a young prince, his bride, the evil stepmother and her henchman. It is Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty (with a little King Kong) all rolled into one. But this is not your typical Disney film.<br/><br/>Enchanted is all about Giselle who, apart from belting out a song; can cook, clean, and sew all with the help of her best friend, Pip (who just happens to be chipmunk) and the rest of her little forest friends. She lives in the kingdom of Andalasia and is searching for her one true love. Prince Edward, with help from his valet, Nathanial, has just rid the fairy tale world of another troll, hears her song and rushes to find her. The two fall in love on the spot, he proposes, and a marriage is planned for the next day much to the dismay of his evil stepmother, Queen Narissa. She wants to keep the crown all to herself and will go to any lengths to stop this strange woman from marrying her stepson. So on the day of the wedding, as Giselle rushes to get to the palace on time, she is pushed by the evil queen into a place where, as Queen Narissa puts it, there are ""no happily ever afters."" Giselle winds up in the middle of Times Square in New York City where she happens to be stuck until Prince Edward comes to save her. Along the way, she is rescued by divorce lawyer, Robert and his little 6 year old daughter, Morgan who give her temporary lodging. Will the Prince finally show up? Will she find her true love and will it turn out to be Prince Edward? And will she finally find her way back to Andalasia? The first half of this film is fun, while the second half is very predictable, but go with it.<br/><br/>Three standout scenes include Central Park, Let's Clean the Apartment and the Kings and Queen's Ball. This is Disney spoofing on Disney with three of their all time classic films, with many hidden references to other Disney notables. Amy Adams has a wonderful voice and she fits into the Giselle role perfectly. James Marsden of X Men fame, hams it up in his standout performance as Prince Edward. Susan Sarandon looks like she's having a great time as Queen Narissa. If you love Disney as much as I do, this is the film for you."
"Nick1000","6","4","6","13 January 2008"," Amy Adams hides the flaws
","Firstly let me be clear that I'm not a kid and I didn't watch this movie with kids so, although I personally found the movie too flawed to give more than a 6, my comments are really only relevant for adult viewers.<br/><br/>Whilst watching I mostly enjoyed it apart from the huge inconsistencies in its message about ""one true love"". Of course I don't expect serious philosophy in a children's film but you wouldn't have to be the brightest kid in the world to get a vague feeling that something doesn't quite add up. The other weak point was the rather poor scripting for the villain: Traditionally the villain is one of the strong points of a Disney cartoon but the wicked step mother's ideas for how to get rid of Giselle are so feeble they carry no menace whatsoever.<br/><br/>The more I think about this film afterwards the more I see it as a perfect performance by Amy Adams covering up a third rate script. The scene where the ""real"" animals clean the apartment was also very good but with hindsight it just seems as though it was bolted on."
"charchuk","6","4","6","10 December 2007"," Light entertainment
","Yeah, I saw it. I wasn't expecting much, apart from some light entertainment, and that's just what I got. It's pretty funny, and surprisingly witty at times, and I enjoyed all the nods to prior Disney works, but it's just too corny at times. I would have liked it if it had played more on the Disney formula instead of falling into it. The songs are fine, though the one at the ball is completely out of place and took me right out of the film. Marsden is probably the highlight, as he doesn't take his role too seriously and looks to be having a lot of fun. Amy Adams is great to look at, but her 'aw shucks' performance eventually got on my nerves. I didn't find it as charming as everyone else did, apparently. Overall, the film's not terrible, but it's nothing special."
"thebraintrust76","5","7","13","21 March 2008"," An Enjoyable Letdown
","Before I go into detail let me make a disclaimer: I was expecting a LOT out of this movie--I was expecting this to be the great Disney comeback.<br/><br/>Now, that said, you could imagine my disappointment when it wasn't the perfect movie. I'd heard great things and I was expecting them. And in the first scenes I got them--Amy Adams is precious in this movie. She plays the part pretty much flawlessly and really puts forth a great performance. In fact, all of the scenes with just her (and many times with Patrick and the kid) are great. I found my self laughing and remembering all of the great Disney moments I haven't lived in so long.<br/><br/>But the script really fell apart as they started transplanting more fairy tale characters into the real world. They stopped making light of old stereotypes from the classics and started applying new stereotypes from some of the worst examples of Disney animation. The script started to fall apart as they tried to work on comedy and get characters into scenes where they shouldn't be. And while it could have worked in the animated world--it doesn't in the real world and they lose the whole edge. Instead of just transplanting characters (many of which they didn't write very good parts for), they started transplanting typical gimmicks used in animated movies. They should have been making the characters funny: focusing on how they didn't fit in in New York, how things were no longer perfect. But once we got past Princess Giselle in New York City, all of the transplanted characters forgot they were in a different world that wasn't perfect (unless they were making a chincy cultural reference to bait the adult audience) and everything went exactly as it would have in the animated world. It wasn't really a great achievement in any technical areas either--it was pretty bland, typical family Disney movie.<br/><br/>So the kids will definitely enjoy this, and if you don't care too much about acting, plot continuity, editing, cinematography, etc, you'll probably enjoy it for what it is. But if you are critical at all, if you couldn't sit through the latest remake of Cheaper By The Dozen, this movie is not for you. Do yourself a favor and just look up the Amy Adams scenes on Youtube (especially the Central Park scene, the apartment clean up scene, and the intro).<br/><br/>Hears to hoping that Disney's magic will come back with the upcoming 2d animation flicks."

","What is a film studio to do? Romance movies make money, so you've got to keep making them. This and the beat-up genre are the foundation of the industry, and the product has to keep flowing.<br/><br/>But at the same time, the audience is not only becoming more and more hardened, they like to see this represented in their film product which is the one place in their lives where most do sophisticated abstract reasoning. What do you do? Well, if you are the world's most mature studio in terms of narrative engineering, you'll try something like this.<br/><br/>Its a romance movie that first tells you what the formula is, shows it to be a cartoon of life. Then it layers ""real life""  what I call folding  on it. There's a character that is told by our fantasy girl about movie love and expresses shock that such love is expressed ""without irony."" The idea is that somehow this fantasy world of movie love penetrates into our real world of rude New Yorkers and bad marriages. The roughness of the real world isn't all that rough though, and our visitor from a pure land does in the end change those around her. There's a child involved but her agency in the business is downplayed; she's less important than the curtains. <br/><br/>So the formula is to first make fun of the formula by putting it in the first movie, the one within, and then let it seep into the outer movie, the one we are presumed to inhabit. At the end, we more consciously buy into the notion of movie romance.<br/><br/>It didn't work so well for me because the ""real"" world was presented in an inadequately real way. There were construction workers, a rough bus driver, a homeless thief, rude passersby. But none of them had enough edge to count as real. The real world, in fact, was nearly as pretend as the cartoon world. So this breaks Ted's law which states that in order for these nested constructions to work, the distance between us and the outer world has to be the same as that between the outer world and the inner one, here, Andelasia.<br/><br/>In keeping with best character engineering tradition, the girl here is redheaded. There's only one funny bit, a pantomime chipmunk.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","This is a slightly amusing movie, but it certainly doesn't deserve 8 stars. The concept behind the story is an excellent and very original idea, but the final product could have had a little more thought and effort put into it. The relations between characters are rarely believable. The story seems as though it wants to be taken seriously (it throws in a few little plot twists to distinguish it from the typical straight-forward fairy-tale), but it's difficult to do so because the writing, directing, and acting leave much to be desired in terms of believability. There are a few redeeming moments of brief hilarity though. Don't miss the scene in which the squirrel, lacking his former ability to speak, attempts to mime an important message about a poisoned apple."
"Mr_W","5","8","17","1 March 2008"," Just mediocre
","I'm only writing this review because most people, including critics, seem to like this movie, and I'm just wondering why. The idea of the film is quite good, although far from original, this kind of themes have been dealt in numerous films. You'd think the script writers could pull off some really good laughs from the situation of a fairytale princess having to deal with reality, but sadly because this is a middle of the road Disney movie, it newer happens. There's not a single laugh in this film, unless you're very easily entertained.<br/><br/>The songs are horrible, trying to mimic their 50s/60s counterparts, but failing. They only stick to your head because they're so bad. The number of plot holes is appalling, even though this is a fantasy film, I'd except at least some suspension of disbelief. How does the fat guy get to work as a cook not once but two times without any of the other staff noticing? Why does no one seem to find their costumes weird? What's with the squirrel, it was badly animated and not funny at all.<br/><br/>Even though I hated the film, I've seen worse, but this just doesn't get above mediocrity."

","Reading the reviews on this page I was surprised. Am I the only one who really thought that the movie plot was weak?<br/><br/>I saw the movie two days ago in New York, and without any expectations I entered the theater, waiting to be surprised. And I was indeed surprised, a hybrid fairytale, a mix between animation and real time movie. This is the most refreshing and original idea I have seen since Moulin Rouge. <br/><br/>Thinking back of my younger days, watching the Disney fairy tales, I was pleasantly pleased about the plot. At the beginning that is.<br/><br/>There is a sudden point withing the movie when the fairytale turns into a milked out, B-ranked feel good love comedy. The magic is lost, and I was suddenly not watching a original Disney fairytale anymore, but a bad love comedy. Everything got too real. This was when Giselle says to prince Edward that she wants to go on a date.<br/><br/>So what was the point in this movie? Because of the ending, Disney threw away the chance to create a masterpiece. After the ending my sister, who watched the movie with me said:<br/><br/>""It was really funny, but I'll probably never watch it again.""<br/><br/>My words exactly. I am no movie-maker, but this movie had so much potential to be GREAT. <br/><br/>The fairytale should have remained a fairytale. This could have been achieved when Giselle and the prince learned something from the real life experience and go back to their fairytale world while the real humans learning something from their singing sunny philosophy. or something like that.<br/><br/>Now with this ending the prince is an idiot, Giselle is an equivalent of a naive rich girl who learns about the real world and Robert Philip is an old divorced lawyer who cheats on his fiancée. <br/><br/>So much for the magical elements. <br/><br/>I guess Disney was chasing two rabbits here: both the juvenile and the adult audience. They certainly did create an amusing film, but I was disappointed again by Disney's inability to keep a movie cohesive and interesting until the end.<br/><br/>It was at the most, funny from time to time."
"co234","3","21","60","24 November 2007"," Not likely to enjoy it if you are recently divorced or separated
","Getting past the pretty wrapping (beautiful characters and decent acting), the message is hard hitting about divorce. Not necessarily a feel good movie in that case and you are not likely to enjoy it if you are recently divorced or separated and seeing it with your kids. Or if you were wishing you are divorced or separated. Fathers squirmed uncomfortably all over the theater during the true love discussions and how if there are problems at the beginning of a marriage they never get better and you ultimately divorce. ""I should get extra daddy points for having to sit through this fine film,"" said the father sarcastically to the mother and family in the row in front of us.<br/><br/>The movie fails to poke fun at Disney fairy tales and the adult humor is lost on the kids. Could send troubled moms over the edge. Kids will half laugh and be half bewildered as adults laugh and sometimes just groan at humor only they can really understand. For example, when the cartoon-princess-turned-human-princess summons fairytale creatures to help her clean the apartment of her savior in New York, woodland creatures are not available. So instead, roaches happily scrub the tub in unison. This is the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Then there is the not so hidden message: Divorce/separation is a reality and sometimes you are just with the wrong person. This is a reality that even a fairytale princess must learn and accept. Not a bad message in general but see note above about seeing it with kids while contemplating or recently separating. Will a holiday movie the best place to learn that lesson? <br/><br/>But wait there's more ...<br/><br/>As with all Disney movies, the mom is nowhere to be seen. But she didn't die this time. No, Mommy had deserted the family. See, moms sometimes leave and never say why. Dad raises 6 yr old daughter alone. Daughter doesn't like Daddy's girlfriend who tries hard to impress daughter. Daddy is a divorce attorney and talks openly and often about the reality of divorce. All the while an annoying little chipmunk does cute jokes that makes kids in the audience laugh. A little sugar with the medicine. Then new woman enters picture and Daddy promptly dumps current girlfriend/fiancé that he's been dating for 5 years for new woman (aka princess from cartoon story) that he's known for a day because he has finally fallen in love. Daughter prefers new woman anyway because she acts like a sweet innocent princess. Princess's handsome prince comes to find her and finds that she is in love with the attorney and decides to fight for her. In the end, he decides that he really wants the attorney to have the princess since the princess and divorce attorney are truly in love. Since the rest of it was so unreal, why not?"

","I'm really sorry to all those who really enjoyed this film. I went to see it with my boyfriend and a friend and I literally CRINGED the whole way through. I didn't make it to the end, I had to leave about twenty minutes before it finished as I just couldn't take any more of the sheer joy and happiness.<br/><br/>I am not a discerning film critic and enjoy many films of many different genres, and that is only the second time I have left the cinema before a movie finished. I was expecting a chick flick with an evil twist (in Susan Sarandon), I was completely unprepared for the songs and ever smiling and wondrous Amy Adams.<br/><br/>Despite there being a good cast (unfortunately I was not won over by Amy Adams though), I thought the movie lacked any kind of storyline. Yes, she is a cartoon character who has been banished to the real world and is trying to find her prince, will she, won't she? To be honest, I stopped caring.<br/><br/>Despite me and my friends not liking it, I still think this film would be enjoyed by young girls, full of songs and kiddie humour. It just wasn't for me."
"kusko44","8","3","5","29 November 2007"," Whats not to like?
","First off my favorite movie is Predator. While in town I went and watched 4 movies in the theater. No Country for Old Men, The Mist, Beowulf, And Enchanted. Enchanted was my cousins girlfriend's idea. I would have to say I enjoyed Enchanted the most. So this is a recommendation from a sci-fi, violence loving, movie goer. Watching the Animated scene in the beginning was something else. I thought I was laughing just because it was so over the top fairy tale BS, and there was no way I could last through much more of it. Then I realized that it was just all ironical humor. Kids will never realize this and enjoy the movie for all its fairy-tale goodness. But adults will love it for all the stabs it takes at fairy-tale goodness. Just a great movie! PS Beowulf left me disappointed, No Country For Old Men, although great, left me wanting finality, and The Mist,although enjoyable, left me a little bit depressed and disturbed.<br/><br/>No matter who you are or what kind of movies you like, you probably should go watch this one."
"jcganz","1","17","49","29 December 2007"," Dreadful
","Yes the cast can sing. Yes they can act. Yes Disney is a powerful commercial force. Yes Disney has given us much we treasure. But please how can this film work? It has no story. It allows no access for its stars well known and documented talents. It has a Central Park song and dance routine where characters of no relevance to the movie arrive to no purpose and disappear thereafter. There is absolutely no MEMORABLE song. Remember this is the studio which gave us so many not least 'Wish upon a star'. Quite frankly Disney studios seem to have sunk into the same abyss into which SAS the Scandinavian Airlines seem to visit periodically. They forget that any service industry must please its public before it can please its accountants. So as an elderly vague admirer of the considerable talents shown in the High School movies, this is a terrible disappointment. Even Disney should be careful of a world view provided solely on the advice of their marketing department. Remember! Sales sell. Marketing spends."

","This is one confused movie. All along we, the audience, are told of the power of ""love's first kiss"" and yet, the climatic moment of the movie, the moment when Nancy tells Robert at the ball, ""it's OK"", is a complete repudiation of what Disney/Hollywood has been trying to hammer into us for the better part of 90 minutes. We have been told over and over again that romantic love is what it's all about and yet, the truest love expressed in the movie has nothing to do with romance, but everything to do with making a conscious, rational decision to put someone else's happiness above one's own happiness. Without Nancy committing this act of true, selfless love, the movie would have no ""happy ending"". It is only through Nancy's single act of true love that all characters are allowed to become truly happy. Despite Giselle's large amount of screen time, Nancy is the true heroine of this movie, and the makers of this movie are guilty of muddled film-making and muddled thinking."

The two parts in the movie I enjoyed myself were when the queen reminded me of so many power ranger bad guys and when leaving the cinema.<br/><br/>I can not fathom why this movie has been called ""ALMOST PERFECT"" by others, I wonder if these people have a mind of their own or like every movie with a beginning, middle and end.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would say this movie was a about as entertaining as a broken slinky."

Patrick Dempsey seemed distracted from the story until the lifesaving kiss. <br/><br/>Why the abrupt editing cut with Giselle in the background of Nancy's clothing design shop? It's an important story line, finished without explanation at the end of the story. The cut goes to a relatively minor story of the reconciliation of the divorcing couple. There were several other abrupt cuts where the story was not so interrupted, but nevertheless rough cuts.<br/><br/>At the Kings and Queens Ball, Giselle's formal dress is beautiful, but out of context of other dancers in historic costume.

","(My Synopsis) Giselle (Amy Adams) lives in the fairytale kingdom of Andalasia and is dreaming of her prince charming, so she can share her ""true love's kiss"" with him. Prince Edward (James Marsden) hears Giselle singing in the forest and knows that she is his one true love and rides to her to take her hand in marriage. They will wed the next day, but Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) has other plans. Queen Narissa doesn't want Giselle near her throne; she banishes Giselle to the real world where she becomes a real woman in modern-day New York City. Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce attorney, comes to Giselle's aid. Giselle makes friends with Robert and his six-year old daughter, Morgan (Rachel Covey). Giselle begins to fall in love with the charming, but imperfect Robert, but she is promised to Prince Edward who is far, far away. Prince Edward, along with Giselle's chipmunk, Pip, arrives in New York City to find Giselle. His servant, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall), is the next to go through the portal to help the prince find Giselle. They are about to experience something new and completely different than their storybook world they left behind.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is one of those cute fairytale family movies to which you can take the whole family. It is a lot of fun to watch, and you will fall in love with the characters. The movie is part animation and part live-action. You don't really notice the change, because it feels like it is natural. You will love the scene stealing chipmunk, Pip. Amy Adams does a great job of being the beautiful and innocent princess who is like a fish out of water in New York City. You will be completely absorbed in the movie, because Disney knows how to make fairy tale movies. Disney incorporated small details from old fairy tales, such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty into the movie's plot. This is one feel good movie that has, of course, a happy ending.

"OldAle1","9","2","3","25 July 2009"," A perfect title for the best Disney musical in years
","Giselle is a simple girl living in a cottage in the middle of the woods in the beautiful country of Andalasia, where she is friends with all the furry little animals who come and joyfully help her keep her cozy little home neat and tidy. One day the handsome, brave and rather stupid Prince Edward comes across her as he's engaged in his favorite activity, troll-hunting, and after saving her the two immediately fall in love. But alas, Edward's stepmother, Queen Narissa, has other designs - she doesn't want Edward to ever marry and have a child to take away her throne, and so when Giselle comes to the palace to marry, the Queen tricks her into falling down a deep well, eventually to land in....Times Square. And to leave the world of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty-style 50s Disney animation and enter the world of ""reality."" Kevin Lima's film attempts to walk an almost impossible tightrope - being a film that is both a parody of the traditional fairytale-animated film that has been Disney's bread-and-butter for 70 years, yet also holding onto the fairytale charm and warmth amidst the mockery. Somehow, he comes very close to perfection. No small part of this is due to the absolutely radiant presence of Amy Adams as the real-life Giselle, walking, dancing and (wonderfully) singing her way into the home of divorce lawyer and single father Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his young daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) - who of course believes that the princess is everything she in fact turns out to be, while daddy takes a little while longer to accept this mad, magical girl.<br/><br/>Life is further complicated when our handsome prince (James Marsden) appears on the scene as well to rescue Giselle and take her back to Andalasia to wed. By the time he finds her though, Giselle has started to learn that our reality is as interesting and wonderful as - if far less simple than - her cartoon homeland and when the evil queen (Susan Sarandon) finally makes an appearance in the flesh, it's clear that Giselle's human mind has started to dominate her animated heart.<br/><br/>I haven't experienced so much sheer joy and delight in a film in a long time; why oh why did I miss this in the theater? Adams is spectacular, funny and naive but so utterly convincing and ""real"" in her ""unreality"" - she really feels like an alien being through the first 2/3 of the film, so solid and literal and deliberately one-dimensional, and it makes her eventual transformation into a more real woman all the more special. Her songs are mostly wonderful - ""Happy Working Song"" is the best movie song I've heard in a decade at least - and the rest of the cast is more than solid. It's got all the adventure and thrills that the best of the Disney classics had, with loads of references both subtle and overt to such films as Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and especially Snow White, but it never feels particularly derivative or lacking in enthusiasm and verve despite all the cobbling it does from other sources. The soundtrack is mostly terrific, the choreography solid, the animation makes me long for the return of traditional Disney pen-and-ink work. I had a feeling I'd like it, but I didn't expect anything this excellent. If there's a flaw, it's that the ending feels a little too rushed, and some of the CGI just looks a bit weak compared to the traditional animation. But these are small issues, and I suspect I'll like this even more on a second viewing. Just wonderful."

Enraged when he finds the love of his dreams, she dresses up as the old witch and throws the unsuspecting girl down a river leading her to Manhattan.<br/><br/>It really becomes a riot when the prince, a queen's subordinate, a chipmunk and the Queen herself all follow her to New York.<br/><br/>In N.Y. the animated characters come alive as our girl meets widower Patrick Dempsey with a 6 year old girl. He is ready to marry again to the lovely Idina Menzel.<br/><br/>The merriment caused by the singing and dancing are wonderful. Everyone in the cast does so well. The ending where the wicked Queen gets her is just fabulous. You wonder why Menzel's part wasn't larger, but you come away with such a positive feeling after seeing this film for the young and adults as well.<br/><br/>A truly wonderful imaginative idea in motion picture making.

","I loved this in the theater, but loved it even more on DVD. This has been a year of really heavy and depressing films and so I find myself appreciating movies like ONCE, RATATOUILLE, and this one all the more. Mind you, I'm not knocking the serious movies this year. There have been so many of them, though, that movies like this which are so perfectly crafted to be happy and positive movies stand out and are quite welcome.<br/><br/>The cast of course is great and I'm one of those who truly loved Amy Adams and am looking forward to seeing more from her.<br/><br/>Most of all, though, I loved all the subtle (and some not so subtle) allusions to the world of Disney. For instance, the bus driver's Mickey Mouse ear hairstyle was priceless. The little remarks about singing in inappropriate circumstances, and everyone in a crowd knowing the song nobody's heard before are little details that added to my overall enjoyment.<br/><br/>I will say one thing about the songs. Although they were good, they were purposeful send-ups of typical Disney songs, and as such, I didn't feel any of them deserved the traditional automatic Oscar for best song that Disney usually gets. I was Happy to see that Oscar go to a more serious and meaningful song.<br/><br/>However, all in all, I consider this movie to be an absolute delight.

The mime is the funniest thing I have seen in ages. James Marsden as the prince raises at least a smile in every scene he appears in - his 'peasants' line never gets old. I laughed, and I cried, too - I can't remember WHY now, but it is that kind of film, you get totally caught up in it. There were even gasps from the audience I watched it with (when the pigeon gets snackish...).<br/><br/>I thought Stardust was very well done and now Enchanted comes along and possibly tops it in the feel-good stakes.

They told me that the trailers were really eye catchers. The jokes and humors were like 30 years ago and stuffs like that. So that's enough reasons not to see it in theaters so that I won't regret about it afterwards...<br/><br/>But my regret is, I shouldn't have let it get to me. I should have seen this in the theatres ages ago... If only I've let the movie speak for itself rather than listen to those who doesn't appreciate good quality movies... Well, personally, my friends' view in movies: If they don't see any tits and ass, it's worthless and pointless to watch..<br/><br/>Well, OK, on with my comment... This movie is great for kids and for adults as well! This is a real family movie! OK, this movie starts off in the wonderful kingdom of Andalasia. We have the beautiful maiden, Giselle, an angelic woman with a heart of gold. She dreams of the day when she would receive True Love's Kiss. Fortunately, convenient Disney Destiny thrusts her into the arms of the handsome and dashing Prince Edward... and the happy couple are engaged about ten seconds later. All seems well in Andalasia, until Giselle was pushed down into a waterfall by Edward's own mother. Giselle was sent into a horrible, dark place where no one lives happily ever after. That's right. New York City.<br/><br/>I can go on with this but that is a little surprise I'll leave for those who haven't seen this yet!!!! My advice, don't listen to anybody who tells you what you should do, eat or watch in the theatres. Do what you like!

"antipas2000","10","2","3","29 December 2007"," A lovely Disney film, a classic in its method and really enchanting...
","It begins with the classic opening of the story book, a decorative book entitled ""Enchanted"". The opening plot is revealed by narration and the animation begins. You have Gisele, an innocent, fragile Princess who is lovely in almost every way. Sweet singing and helpful animals ensue. But the Queen of the land, who is the Prince's mother, does not want him to marry for fear her crown will be taken from her. To prevent this, on the day of Gisele and her son's wedding, the wicked Queen throws her down a wishing well. And so begins Gisele's transaction from her home land to a strange, strange and scary world - ours. There is a bit of a ""Wizard Of Oz"" feel to the film in many ways. Gisele, now a turned in a human form (the lovely Amy Adams) finds friendship and kindness in the city of New York. Now, the Prince (Edward) and Gisele's friendly chipmunk friend - Pip, venture down the wishing well also, intent on looking for his bride-to-be. Hilarity ensues as he, like Gisele, is confused about this place and who the people are, referring to many people as noble peasants etc! And all through the film until she decides to finish off Gisele herself, the Queen watches through any liquid form - her face appears in water bottles, pans of water, a glass of martini and a fish tank etc. It is the way her magic can see in to this ""realm"" etc. And eventually, the Queen does come to our world, flashing with the green energy of her magic and dark power. The film collides the good and evil at a ball. How could it not - this is Disney after all. Their are lots of Snow White similarities in this film, but those who know the classics, and I mean the classics - Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella etc, will see the little touches that make this film a joy to behold. After true love's kiss causes the Queen to fail, in the centre of the ballroom, she casts a spell and in a fiery boom of magic, transforms herself in to a dragon...<br/><br/>I won't give away all of the fun, but a few things about the film though. Amy Adams's energy for the character of Gisele is absolutely captivating and lovely to watch. The dancing, singing and the way she acts as the innocent, poor Princess is lovely. She really looks the part too. James Marsden is classic comedy as the slightly dull, slightly ego-centered Prince Edward. Susan Sarandon makes for a really good Queen, but her role is diminished a bit too much I felt, when watching this. But this film is really lovely and there are some really funny bits in it that really make you stand-up and laugh. Disney have made a great comeback to the film world with this film - it has been a while since such a good film from them has approached us. And the idea and plot of the story is absolutely genius in its design. This must be seen on the big screen! I cannot emphasize that enough - like seeing the very first Star Wars - it had to be on the big screen. So what are you waiting for? If you have just read this review and have not seen then go, hurry! Before the clock strikes midnight :)<br/><br/>Enchanted, enchanting and adorable, you will want to take your loved ones to see this, no matter how old you are..."

Everyone in the cast is practically perfect. The more familiar one is with Disney animated classics, the funnier the film will be. I couldn't help laughing out loud at many of the digs and references to earlier films. What really makes the film work is that it has that elusive quality, ""Heart."" My only observation is that many may consider this simply a children's film. The final conflict between the prince's stepmother and Giselle had a few of the children in the theater in tears, it was so intense. For those aged 12 or older, it's an excellent film.

From the cartoon world to the real world is real fun and magical to watch, the songs and dance numbers are perfect for this type of movie and Amy Adams gives one of the best comic performance in along time. Its got a good message for kids, ""get to know someone properly before you marry them"", a mistake that adults keep making on a daily basis. One of the best Disney films in ages."
"seawalker","8","2","3","20 December 2007"," A Disney movie for people who hate Disney movies
","Oh, my... ""Enchanted"" is just fantastic. So good and enchanting (see what I did there?) that when the movie was over I practically floated out of the cinema.<br/><br/>Seriously, ""Enchanted"" is a really great family movie, and this is from a man who hardly ever watches family movies at the cinema. If you like, ""Enchanted"" is a Disney movie for people who hate Disney movies. Comedy for the kids, knowing in-jokes for the adults and a brilliant central performance by Amy Adams as Giselle, cartoon ingenue come to life, all wide eyed innocence and fluttering hand movements. If you see a more game and better comedic performance this year, please let me know, but I doubt if you will. Amy Adams is just wonderful.<br/><br/>Great supporting performances from cynical divorce lawyer with a heart of gold, Patrick Dempsey, more square jawed that any man in history, James Marsden, villainous hag and evil witch queen, Susan Sarandon and snivelling henchman, Timothy Spall. Not to forget the comedy chipmunk. Or was it a comedy rat?<br/><br/>I think that ""Enchanted"" is well worth the trip to your local fleapit."
"mimbaxter","8","2","3","20 December 2007"," Very Disney and watchable
","I enjoyed this. It has plenty of jokes and references. It flows well, and there is a joy in New York which is nice to see.<br/><br/>One thing I did like was that the stereo type of getting what you want is to bully and be nasty. They have turned this into being nice and not leaving the other characters able to response to do what they want rather than what they are being asked to do. Very Disney, but played well and believable.<br/><br/>The one odd thing was that the animation was in HDTV format and the live in 35mm, which felt to me a little odd. I can't really think of a reason for it unless they where wanting to cut back on the rendering time?"
"Neenee-b","10","2","3","20 December 2007"," Enchanted - you will be
","I grew up with Disney movies. I am now 22 and still love them so when I heard of Enchanted I couldn't help but be excited.<br/><br/>It is just a fantastic movie - it took all the usual Disney clichÃ©s which work in their own wonderful way in cartoon form such as signing beauties, dashing princes, housework loving animals and introduced them to the real world of people.<br/><br/>I loved the little shout outs to the Disney classics, such as Giselle appearing in the bubbles as she was cleaning the floor and the chandelier moment during the ballroom dance.<br/><br/>The cast were fantastic - Amy Adams and James Marsden just went for it and gave it their all. I do think that James Marsden stole the show from everybody. It was fun to watch Patrick Dempsey's stern lawyer finally give into the fairy tale happy life that Giselle lived by, however I do think that Susan Sarandon was under used as the wicked step-mother and she could do very little with the character with her very limited scene time.<br/><br/>What made the movie great was Disney making fun of itself. It if had of been another company making fun of Disney it wouldn't have worked just as well.<br/><br/>This is a very limited review but I would give the movie 10/10. I haven't enjoyed a film as much at the cinema in a long time - it was fun, happy, colourful - everything you would expect from a Disney movie - Kids will love the film for what it is and adults will appreciate the irony. A thoroughly enjoyable movie all round"

"Danusha_Goska","8","2","3","9 December 2007"," Had a Smile on My Face the Whole Time
","I had a smile on my face the entire time I was watching ""Enchanted."" Well, maybe not the whole time ... a chipmunk is sorely mistreated and I did worry for him.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" is something special. It will be remembered as a movie that proved how even today's jaded audiences can embrace a film with no graphic sex or violence, a movie with a truly sweet soul.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" does include special effects, but its real special effect is Amy Adams' performance. I fell in love with this girl. I don't know how long it's been since I fell in love with an actress. I'm really tired of the trampy style that rolled in with Madonna's career.<br/><br/>Amy Adams conveys genuine sweetness. You really want this girl to live next door, to be your best friend, to marry your son. About how many tramp-style starlets can we say any of these things? ""Enchanted"" lets you know it is something special with its very first scene. A rich, warm, blessed voice narrates  Julie Andrews! I knew I was in good hands. The opening animation is . . . well, enchanting. I was swept off my feet by this lovely animation. I had read very positive reviews of ""Enchanted"" and here I was loving the very first scene, and I thought, ""This is too good. It can't keep being this good."" But it did, largely thanks to Amy Adams. Magic turns Giselle from a cartoon character to flesh and blood Amy Adams. Adams finds herself dressed in a fairy tale princess gown, but stuck in a Manhattan sewer. Adams moves her fingers and arms like a ballet dancer, in order to express . . . enchantment. I was enthralled.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey is very good as Robert, a cynical, 21st century lawyer. Dempsey plays against his ""McDreamy"" good looks. He conveys real burnout. Competing for Giselle's hand is James Marsden, utterly perfectly cast as Prince Edward, who gallantly saves a busload of midtown Manhattan peasants. Rachel Covey is adorable as Morgan, Robert's motherless daughter. There is a talking chipmunk who all but steals the movie. And Susan Sarandon, or someone, shows up with hag make-up that curls your toes.<br/><br/>There's an exuberant dance number in Central Park, reminiscent of Disneyland's ""Small World"" display, and of Vincent Minnelli, MGM musicals. It just got better and better as it went on.<br/><br/>So, why haven't I given ""Enchanted"" a ten? The script. Fantasies work best when they tell truths about real life. Classics like ""I Married a Witch"" made the fantastic believable, and told us something about reality that a more realistic movie couldn't tell. ""Enchanted"" could have been a tad more plausible, and it could have given Robert and Giselle more developed scenes where her naivete and his cynicism, and her change from a cartoon character to a creature who can feel anger . . . and another response she's not ready to give words to, and his change from a man who wants to get rid of her by handing her some bills to someone quite different, were more emphatically dramatized. There are those scenes  Giselle's response to Robert's work as a divorce lawyer, for example  I just wish they had been better crafted with studier writing.<br/><br/>But no criticism should keep you away from ""Enchanted."" It really is a movie I'd recommend to anyone, and if you don't smile the whole time you are watching it . . . maybe the only cure is to watch it again."
"refresh_daemon","8","2","3","4 December 2007"," A surprisingly enjoyable take on an old genre
","One of the few perks for being an employee of the Mouse was getting to catch a free employee screening of this film, a film that I wouldn't have otherwise gone out to catch in theaters (or perhaps even on the small screen). I went into the theater with a wary eye, but, in the end, found myself pleasantly surprised and generally not miserable as I usually am when I watch films of this type.<br/><br/>I think the thing that kept this film from sinking into the saccharine mess it could've become was a touch of reflexivity and meta-humor as well as a well woven script that does a really good job of weaving themes and story points into a coherent whole. The plot is pretty simple: a Disney princess from a fairytale world gets sent to the real world to prevent her from marrying her Prince and therefore displacing her Prince's evil stepmother/sorcerer. Of course, the real world is no fairy tale. And you can imagine what happens from there, especially if you've seen the trailers.<br/><br/>I really liked that there was noticeable character development and the crossing of the perspectives of pragmatic realism and fantastic idealism. I liked how the cartoon characters in ""the real world"" continued to move and emote like cartoons. I liked watching the change in Giselle as she becomes more and more real from spending time in the real world. I liked how absolutely cartoon the villain and her stooge (especially the stooge in disguise) could be. I wanted to see a little more of the chipmunk and wished that the Prince could get more development, but they're ancillary characters, so no biggie there.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the film pokes fun of the Disney romantic musical tradition, it's still quite steeped in it. While making light of the musical singing, there's a real song-and-dance number present in the film, which I felt was the only misstep of the film (don't get me wrong it's a great number, but it sort of grinds against the mechanic of the real world setting). Another issue with the film is that even though it's billed as a children's film, I can imagine that the youngest of the youngsters will get bored during the middle section, where there's a lot of drama and not a lot of stimulating action. Kids were shifting in the theater.<br/><br/>Good production values, good writing, excellent musical/acting performance from Amy Adams and the rest aren't bad either, and a good pace. It's not deep--it's a Disney children's film--but it's one that I imagine adults will enjoy as well. A nice surprise, I'd have to say. Recommended for kids and adults who can come up with a good excuse to see the movie, even without kids around. 8/10."

","Well I did not want to see this movie me and my girlfriend were standing at the booth this was the only one playing. So we bought tickets for the show she was more then happy to have conned me into seeing this film. At first I was watching the movie and saw that it was animated and there was a lot of singing and was rather annoyed. I am 21 years old lol and not my thing, but a sudden turn of events they became human and they started joking around. But the singing was still there I became used to that very fast. Any way the acting was rather nice kinda reminded me of the whole robin hood men in tights thing, but it was not. Kid will love this one and you will to you will find your self humming or nodding your head to the songs or tunes I did some how.

","I have just saw Enchanted which was fantastic. I'm also glad that 2D is coming back to Disney, because as I said it, I grew up with the 2D Classics and I'll always love them for years to come. I mean 3D's great and all but it's fascinating as 2D. The animation for the scenes in Andalasia is beautifully done, and the characters (animated) are REAL dead-ringers to the actors in the film: Amy Adams, James Marsden and Susan Sarandon. I love Giselle, and I also love the pink dress in the beginning. You know, if she had wings she could have been a ""fairy"" princess. Admittedly in a way, Giselle is kind of like me: I believe in ""Happily After Ever."" The film was a direct montage to the three Classic Disney Princess movies: Snow White,Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty, and I love the Disney Princesses. I DO consider Giselle as one of them and Mrs. Adams has been getting rave reviews. I have also bought the new doll wearing the pink outfit of course. So I think she deserves to be added to the list of Disney princesses, though she's in between worlds - animated Andalasia and real-life New York. My favorite song from the soundtrack is ""True Love's Kiss,"" just to let you know."
"kleeben","9","2","3","30 November 2007"," Fun movie
","This was a fun flick to watch. It kept me entertained and was definitely worth the price of admission. I especially liked the work of Amy Adams, she was a gas and very engaging in her role. I have always been a James Mardsen fan and have been impressed with his recent work here and on Hairspray. Susan Sarandon is juicy in her role as the evil step-mother/witch. I liked her tone here. Patrick Dempsey and the young girl were quite good, but the film really belongs to Amy Adams. I have to admit though, I heard women around me swooning every time Patrick Dempsey did something, so obviously some of his female fans may disagree with me on that.<br/><br/>As far as the film goes, it is a comedy throughout, with some kinda lame computer-generated action towards the end. For the most part is uses effects very well, but the stuff towards the end looks kinda fake and tacked on. It was the only part of the film that seemed forced or out of place to me. The good news is that it turns it around at the very end and has a satisfying, if a little predictable ending.<br/><br/>Good all around. Recommended!"
"LeonardKniffel","9","1","1","4 May 2020"," Perfectly Hilarious
","I was enchanted by Disney's ""Enchanted,"" and I didn't expect to be. This has much to do with the performance of Amy Adams in what could have been a ridiculous role. Instead, she turns it into a very funny modern-day fairy tale in which an evil queen (Susan Sarandon) sends a storybook princess out to contend with a modern New York City, where she meets a handsome lawyer, played by Patrick Dempsey.

","Enchanted: A Fairytale Brought to Life With its ten year anniversary just around the corner, Enchanted continues to spark the imagination of children and parents alike. This movie is able to create a bridge between fantasy and reality, connecting them in a way that reconfigures previous fairy tales. Not only is this film a classic for the whole family, it's also a wonderland full of fruit for the imagination.<br/><br/>Amy Adams, who portrays Giselle, does a phenomenal job of portraying an animated character brought to life. She comes from an animated fairytale world where she is living a fantasy, and she carries that mindset through her transition to New York City. Her emotions lead you on this journey of experiencing life for what seems to be the first time. She is able to separate her character into two different identities and then ties them together in the end. Patrick Dempsey, who portrays Robert Phillip, is the charming knight in shiny armor that comes to rescue Gisele from the streets of New York in the beginning of the movie. He is able to captivate the reality of a hero, beyond the glorified fairytale version. Together Adams and Dempsey create a platform in which they continue to build up and the whole time they are drawing in the audience with their chemistry and emotional connection.<br/><br/>The music is what bring the movie to life. It's playful and entertaining while telling an important story. The songs mostly speak of love and the person you're meant to be with for the rest of your life, very fitting for a fairytale. The meaning of the lyrics progress from fairytale to reality as the movie continues. Starting with dreaming of a true loves kiss all the way to loving someone you can't have. It's a powerful progression which enhances how the audience feels, how I felt. Adams does an excellent job singing and performing with great vocals and exceptional dance moves. The performance of ""That's how you know"" is a joyful one which brings all the people of New York together to sing about love and telling the girl of your dreams how you feel. It's exciting and by the end of the song you'll be trying to sing along.<br/><br/>Another element which progresses throughout the movie is Giselle's costume designs. They begin as poufy, cliché fairytale ball gowns and slowly slim down into an end product of a tightly fitted, mermaid style gown. These dresses directly tie into the different stages of Giselle's journey to reality and greatly highlights that. They were bright and elegant and made Giselle the center of attention at all times.<br/><br/>Enchanted is a must-see movie with a charming spin on a classic fairytale, making it into something people can relate to. This is not only impressive but captivating. The emotional and joyous acting of Adams and Dempsey, the reconfigured classic fairytale plot, stunning outfits and the perfect music all come together to evoke the idea that fairy tales really do come true. It leaves the audience with hope that they could one day walk alongside a princess on the streets of New York."

","Amy Adams is great as Giselle a princess sent from her fairy tale land to New York by Prince Edward's (James Marsden) evil stepmother (Susan Sarandon). Edward, Giselle, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and the evil queen start out as cartoons but turn into flesh-and- blood characters when they all end up in New York. Joining them is Pip, a cartoon chipmunk who talks clearly in the fairy tale land but squeaks in New York. The singing and dancing Amy Adams and others do is catchy and the dancers are awesome! I laughed at Clara the little old lady on the bus Edward nearly stabs and she says dramatically to Giselle, ""He tried to kill me!"". Susan Sarandon is a scream as Edward's stepmother who wants Giselle out of the picture. The queen is mean to poor Nathaniel who is just trying to help her out and she greets him with, ""Hello, worthless."". I highly recommend ""Enchanted"" and Giselle proves to be a wonderful stepmom to Robert's (Patrick Dempsey) 6-year-old daughter, Morgan (Rachel Covey)!"

Then it turns a live-action movie. In the movie, it sometimes turns animation and then turns live-action movie again. I think it is a great technique. The people in the movie come and go animation world and reality world. Animation characters and actors look like same. It is so great.

"rapariel","8","1","1","15 June 2016"," Different from other princess true love
","This film is different from other Disney's princess movies in many points. First of all, it is constructed from animation and real picture. What is more interesting is that at the end of the movie, some characters live in different world. The animation character lives in real life, and the real world's character lives in animation world. Second, the characters in this film fins out what is their true love. The important point is, not only the lead character but also the others around her finally realize their true loves. It is not romantic like other princess's stories, a kind of the love of princess and prince. However, it brings sympathy to audience. Third, the princess's character is typical of a princess in the beginning,(for example, she can talk with animals, and she likes t sing) but she learns many things in the real life and grows gradually. And this growth lets her realize her true love. One of the elements I like in this movie is it includes many songs. It is like a musical somehow, and music gives us a great impact. This movie's main theme is love, but is concludes humor and family love, so everyone can enjoy this film."
"lewiskendell","8","1","1","1 February 2016"," Charm and humor to spare.
","Enchanted begins as a typical, Disney-animated princess story. But after a gorgeously animated intro, it shifts to the real world, and suddenly all the cartoonish clichés and fairy-tale staples are unleashed upon the real world. If that doesn't sound interesting to you, clearly you're childhood was devoid of Disney or you don't have any young relatives in your life.<br/><br/>Enchanted is funny enough for any lover of (clean) comedy, charming, and...pretty much enchanting. All the fairy-tale characters fit their roles perfectly. Amy Adams perfectly captured the voice, mannerisms, and wide-eyed naivety of a real-life Disney princess. The Dashing Prince, Evil Witch, Comic Animal Sidekick, Inept Lackey, they're all present and accounted for. Disney did an excellent job of gently lampooning itself, but in such a way that it comes off as more of a loving tribute than any kind of mockery.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of positives, and few negatives to speak of. I was slightly disappointed by most of the songs, none of them besides ""That's How You Know"" were really that memorable. How weird is that for a Disney movie? And occasionally the lovey-dovey factor went a little high for anyone that isn't an eight-year-old girl to be comfortable with. Hmmm, but it is a fairy-tale. so anything else could hardly be expected. <br/><br/>Enchanted is clever, sugary sweet, and amusing. Any past or present Disney fans owe it to themselves to see it. And the rest of you (if there's anyone left) should do yourselves a favor and watch a movie that's guaranteed fun."

","This is an animated-meets-live action movie where Princess-To-Be Giselle (Amy Adams) is prepared to wed Prince Edward (James Marsden), to the dismay of his evil stepmother, Queen Narissa, because she will lose her throne. She banishes Giselle faraway to New York, where she ends up befriending a lawyer (Patrick Dempsey).<br/><br/>This is a nostalgic movie that brings back memories of animated Disney classics. When these animated characters run into the real world, you are asked to let your imagination run wild as these animated characters turn into real life - a very clever touch and concept. What results is a well-paced story from start to finish as we follow along the magic, fun, adventures and music - from Giselle trying to adjust to her new surroundings in New York to Prince Edward searching for her in the city, with the Queen and her henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) in hot pursuit.<br/><br/>Amy Adams does an excellent job portraying Giselle, having the personality and traits of that of a fairytale princess - graceful, prim and proper, as does James Marsden in portraying Prince Edward - gallant, brave and strapping. Alan Menken brings back the musical magic of Disney with his score, and the songs he and Stephen Schwartz wrote were delightful (I especially like the catchy and top-tapping dance number, That's How You Know).<br/><br/>Kevin Lima did a great job directing and included in the film just about everything that makes a classic Disney movie: beautiful hand-drawn animation, magic, songs, prince, princess, evil queen, talking animals, castle, sword-fight, just to name a few. I love how it references past Disney movies, from casting actresses Jodi Benson (voice of Ariel), Paige O'Hara (voice of Belle) and Judy Kuhn (singing voice of Pocahontas), to including the song ""Part of Your World"" in the soundtrack and having a restaurant named ""Belle Notte."" I just wished we saw more of the Prince Edward character, as I thought he could have contributed more to the plot, and would have liked to see more of Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa character in the city, spewing magic spells everywhere on unsuspecting people.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is a perfect film for the entire family that delivers all the fun, innocence, charm, adventure, drama, romance and friendship that lets you forget about your worries and enjoy what life has to offer.<br/><br/>Grade A-"

","Giselle, a beautiful young peasant woman, lives in the animated fairy tale kingdom of Andalasia. She dreams of finding true love. True love finds her when the dashing Prince Edward saves her from a giant troll. Yes, this is one of those animated kingdoms with giant trolls. Talking animals too but more on them later. It's also one of those animated kingdoms with an evil queen. Queen Narissa knows that she can not allow her stepson Edward to marry. If he does his new bride will take Narissa's throne. So when it's love at first sight for Edward and Giselle, with a wedding to take place just a day after they met, Narissa has to take action. She banishes the naive, all too trusting Giselle to...New York City? Good luck finding true love there sweetheart.<br/><br/>Giselle has not just been sent from Andalasia to New York. She's been sent from an animated world to a live-action one. So out of the sewer and into Times Square steps Amy Adams. And Adams proves to be an absolutely amazing living, breathing, real-life Disney princess. You wouldn't want to imagine any other actress in the role, Adams is as perfect as perfect can be. In this ultimate fish out of water story the challenges Giselle faces are enormous. But as any good fairy tale princess would she faces those challenges with a smile on her face and a song in her heart. It is impossible not to be charmed by the relentlessly upbeat, positive-thinking, romantic idealist Giselle. And so much of the credit for that has to go to Adams who is stunningly brilliant in the role. She certainly looks the part of the fairy tale princess and her personality shines through to the point it's almost a little overwhelming.<br/><br/>Of course modern-day Manhattan is really no place for a naive, idealistic fairy tale princess. Luckily for Giselle she is taken in by a single father, Robert, and his young daughter, Morgan. Robert was just about to propose to his girlfriend Nancy but Giselle's presence causes complications. Meanwhile, because this is a fairy tale after all, Giselle's Prince Charming must come save her. Tipped off by Pip, Giselle's talking chipmunk friend, Edward learns where Giselle has been sent and comes to New York to save her, chipmunk in tow. Unfortunately in the real world animals can't talk so Pip faces all kinds of problems of his own as he tries to help Edward find and rescue Giselle. While animals can't talk here Giselle does find a way to put the local wildlife to use. No cute little chipmunks here though, in Manhattan it's pigeons and rats and cockroaches who Giselle puts to work. Quite funny that. Anyhow Narissa knows she can't let Edward bring Giselle back to Andalasia so she sends her henchman, Nathaniel, to New York to finish the job with, what else, a poison apple. Edward is oblivious. It's only our fearless, though now unfortunately speechless, chipmunk who realizes the danger Giselle is in. More hilarity ensues as prince and chipmunk seek to find Giselle.<br/><br/>Enchanted keeps a smile on your face throughout. The story is so engaging, the characters so embraceable. Adams is the obvious standout but the rest of the cast is excellent as well. Patrick Dempsey is perfectly cast as Robert, a guy all too grounded in the real world to believe in fairy tales. The exasperation Dempsey shows as his character deals with the impossibly chipper Giselle is priceless. Whereas Giselle begins to adjust to the real world she finds herself in Prince Edward never changes. He's a swashbuckling fairy tale prince brought to life and James Marsden captures that wonderfully. Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, Timothy Spall as her put-upon henchman and Idina Menzel as Robert's girlfriend are all great too. It's such a lively, energetic, flat-out fun film. The film looks fantastic, a fairy tale beautifully brought to life. There are some great songs too, the standout one being That's How You Know which is performed as a gigantic, breathtakingly brilliant Central Park production number. You may think this would be a very predictable story but the movie has some surprises for you, the quest for true love not as straightforward as it seems. If there is any little quibble with the film it may be that it goes a little over the top at the end where the villain becomes, quite literally, too big of a presence. But all in all it's hard not to love this movie. Such a charming movie, with a performance from Adams which is as good as it gets. Adams creates a character who anyone, fairy tale prince or real-world man, would fall in love with. If you love her, and you will, you'll love this movie."
"ThatEightiesGirl","10","1","1","30 December 2013"," A very beautiful and warm-hearted film of the 2000s!
","As a believer of true love and love at first sight, I was fascinated by the beauty, magic, charisma, and that warm feeling it gives off. This movie teaches you that life is not always a fairytale, and there isn't always an ""happily ever after,"" especially when it comes to falling in love. Believe me, there is always someone out there for everyone, so if you watch this film you'll realize that you shouldn't give up hope if you don't find love. Instead, let love find you at the right place, right time, right moment and with the right person. Sure, not all movies that come out these days are the best, but this one is just perfect and has nice acting and incredible singing by Amy Adams. I recommend this to anybody."
"Stompgal_87","9","1","1","11 December 2013"," Truly enchanting with a fine mix of 2D animation, live-action and CGI plus several references to other Disney films
","I've rented this film a few times and have thoroughly enjoyed it. While it's a little overlong for my tastes, it was swiftly paced and had plenty of scenes to enchant me. It was also the first time I'd ever heard of Amy Adams, who was sweet and full of determination as Giselle.<br/><br/>The opening animated sequence, which makes up the first 10 minutes of the film, is fluid and brightly-coloured with a style that is reminiscent of Disney Rennaisance films such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'The Little Mermaid' and I enjoyed watching the characters from Andalasia in live action form trying to get used to New York. The dialogue is mostly original for a fairytale-themed film with some clever perceptions of certain objects such as Giselle thinking a billboard advertisement is a castle and Prince Edward believing the TV in his hotel room is a mirror. I was amused by spotting the many Disney film references, particularly 'Snow White,' 'Cinderella' and 'Sleeping Beauty' as well as the name of the Italian restaurant being a nod to 'Bella Notte' from 'Lady and the Tramp.' As for the musical score, it is very fitting for the film's theme and beautiful, especially when Pip the chipmunk tries to act out Nathaniel trying to poison Giselle with an apple and the orchestral versions of 'True Love's Kiss', whimsical and has the odd use of haunting choral vocals, particularly during Queen Narissa's live action parts. My favourite songs from the film are 'True Love's Kiss,' 'Happy Working Song (reminiscent of 'Whistle While You Work'),' 'That's How You Know (the catchiest of them all and reminds me of 'Under The Sea')' and Carrie Underwood's 'Ever Ever After' that plays towards the end. The cinematography is creative and I especially like the camera work when Giselle's arm drops to the the floor, the poisoned apple rolls down the stairs and onto the ballroom floor - a very dramatic shot indeed. Further to the apple, I liked the brief running gag of Nathaniel offering Giselle a caramel apple and an apple martini in disguise. The cast did a great job with playing their parts and I liked how they used their actual voices for the voice acting in the animated segments. I also liked the pop-up book segments and it reminded me of a technique used in the 'Longman Video Classic Nursery Rhymes' video I watched a lot as a child.<br/><br/>Like 'The Princess and the Frog,' this film uses the Disney fairytale formula with modern twists perfectly and is the best film combining animation and live action since 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' 9/10."

She who was in love with Robert in reality swings him around, but he cannot hate her.<br/><br/>The second point is a song sung in a work. It is good for Disney work and is a musical style. The music that I in particular like ""is Happy Working Song"". Giselle singing happily is very pretty and I love it.

Next is a beautiful and luxurious costumes of the princess. Girls and Women are fascinated by them and they could feel as if they were a princess. Third, Enchanted is a funny story.

They promise to marry, however, they are separated each other by Queen Narissa. They come to human world and look for them each other. Actually, I love Walt Disney's films and I often watch them. But this film is a little different from other films. This is half an actuality film and half an animated film. This point fascinated me so much.

"Gideon24","8","1","1","22 July 2013"," Disney Magic with a Contemporary Spin
","The 2007 film ENCHANTED is a deft and imaginative musical/comedy/fantasy that breaks several cinematic rules in its execution of a richly entertaining story that intrigues and delights the viewer. <br/><br/>The film opens as an animated fairy tale where we meet Giselle, a princess who, shortly before her marriage to Prince Edward, is magically transported to modern day Manhattan, thanks to Edward's mother, the requisite Evil Queen, where she is befriended by an attractive attorney and single dad. Giselle's fish out of water experiences in Manhattan blend seamlessly with the arrival of Prince Edward, the queen's henchmen, and the Evil Queen herself, who also arrive in New York to return Giselle to the kingdom of Andulasia. <br/><br/>The story takes most of the turns it's expected to, but the journey there is the fun here, as the the old cinematic chestnut of the fish out of water, is dusted off and refashioned into a contemporary fantasy filled with child-like imagination and adult sensibility. <br/><br/>Amy Adams is perfection as Giselle, the princess transported to modern times who believes that love is everything, animals clean house, and pigeons deliver flowers. Adams' wide eyed sincerity and clear as a bell singing voice help to make this performance the flawless marriage of actress and character. <br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden are attractive as the single dad who Giselle falls for and her fairy tale prince who want her back. Timothy Spall provides some funny moments as the Queen's henchman and there is a brief, but fabulous scenery-chewing turn by Susan Sarandon as the Evil Queen. Tony winner Idina Menzel (WICKED) also scores as Dempsey's girlfriend (BTW, note to continuity dept: during the course of the film, we see advertisements for WICKED and for RENT, two Broadway shows supposedly running at the same time, that both starred Menzel, but I digress). <br/><br/>The film is energetically directed by Kevin Lima and the surprisingly clever song score is provided by Alan Mencken (THE LITTLE MERMAID) and Stephen Schwartz (PIPPIN; GODSPELL). Top it off with some top-notch visual effects and cinema's most durable sidekick, Pip the Chipmunk and you have all the ingredients for a first-rate adult fairy tale that provides some big laughs in addition to the expected warm-fuzzy feelings."

A nostalgic return to Disney's golden age with a refreshingly new twist, it leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling about the world. Unabashed sentimentality abounds in this fish out of water romantic comedy that combines the best of 21st century animation and Walt's original magical touch with the kids and adults alike. I love this film and Amy Adams was a perfect fit-wholesome with a capital W. I reminds me of two unforgettable words from my childhood: always believe."
"flyingamon","9","1","1","10 May 2011"," Great mixture of fairy tale and modern world
","I always thought that mixing fairy tales with our daily life would make for a bad and cliché movie that only romantic comedy lovers would appreciate. I have no problem with this genre but often they tend to be boring, predictable and uninspired. This movie had indeed its overly cute stuff but that doesn't get annoying at all as it has so many funny moments that you can't find anything to complain about (at least I didn't). I thought setting the fairy tale world of Andalasia up as an animation and having its inhabitants to be real humans when they are in New York was a fantastic idea and I can't think of other movies who do such a good job at that. You will recognize references to other fairy tales such as Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However this story and its characters is standing very strong on his own. It's not the typical fairy tale where you know who is going to end up with who. It is something completely new. This movie is definitely worth a lot of re-watches."

"Tweekums","9","1","1","22 April 2011"," A great modern fairytale
","Even though I'd heard good things about this film I wasn't sure what to expect as I haven't watched an animated Disney film in decades, aren't that keen on romcoms and dislike it when film characters break out in song... in the face of it I should have hated this film but as it turned out I loved it! Starting in a saccharine sweet animated kingdom we are introduced to Giselle; a princess attended on by a variety of overly cute forest creatures; one day she is attacked by a troll but luckily she is saved by Prince Edward. This being a fairy tale they fall in love and are due to be married but Edward's wicked step mother pushes her into a magical fountain and she finds herself in New York City. As she wanders round looking for her prince Robert, a divorce lawyer, and his young daughter help her. Edward follows through the fountain to find his beloved.<br/><br/>As I watched the opening scenes I was fairly sure I wasn't going to like the film but once the action moved to New York where everything became live action I really enjoyed it and laughed often even though I'm sure I'm not part of the target demographic. Amy Adams was an utter delight as Giselle; making the character a naïve innocent without being irritating. James Marsden hammed it up in an entertaining fashion and Timothy Spall was fun as his less than trustworthy sidekick. Also of note was Patrick Dempsey who played Robert; it can't have been easy playing the one normal main character amongst a group of fairytale characters. While this is a fairytale it is rather nice that for once the heroine wasn't just a damsel in distress; when there is danger Giselle is quick to get stuck in. This is a film that adults and children can enjoy equally and I heartily recommend it to both."
"Imdbidia","8","1","1","3 March 2011"," Utterly enchanting
","Disney is back, in full bloom!<br/><br/>A very entertaining and funny family movie, with a story that will engage and amuse both adults and children. This is, of course, a movie about prince charming, but twisted, satirized and modernized. The movie mashes up all the archetypes of Disney fairy-telling and old-glamor musicals and revamps it by using a contemporary script and modern New York settings.<br/><br/>The movie departs from a 2D old-Disney-style movie, from where princess Giselle, prince Edward, servant Nathaniel, Hip the chipmunk, and Queen Mother Narissa will jump into New York, with their nonsense talking and schematic stereotypical behavior. In the human world they meet Robert Philip, a single lawyer good-hearted man who doesn't believe in romance or fairy-tales, and his young daughter Morgan, a lonely girl who wants magic in her life.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is truly terrific as Giselle, with the innocence, matter of fact behavior, and warmth that you can expect from a fairy-tale book character. Her face is very expressive and makes you believe anything and everything; she's is also great as singer of most of the songs in the movie. In fact, it is thanks to her that the movie is believable and carries on so well.<br/><br/>Really great is Timothy Spall in her Woody-Allen-ish Nathaniel, twisted between his love to the queen, his duty as his servant, and his increasing personal worry about self-love. Perfect in their roles are child actor Rachel Covey and Susan Sarandon, whose powerful physique is perfect for her role of witch-queen. Patrick Dempsey plays McDreamy once again, but, Oh well, his role suits McDreamy. The same can be said about a cartoon-ish and very handsome James Marsdem.<br/><br/>I loved the musical numbers, so very much in Mary Poppins and Sound of the Music's style. I loved that the different types of animation and special effects -2D, 3D, animal, and book style-, very cute and perfectly integrated in the story. I surprised myself laughing out loud and smiling wholeheartedly during most of the movie, which is the movie's merit.<br/><br/>A modern classic from the best possible Disney."
"purple_fairy111","9","1","1","1 January 2011"," Modern Enchantment
","Enchanting—a word that will rightfully describe the entire movie. The movie's elements were good, from the cast, visual effects, soundtracks, and production. It brought dreamy fairy tales to modern/50%-possibility-to-happen-in-the-real-world fairy tales.<br/><br/>The sensation I felt seeing it for the first time last 2008 was never different every time I watch this movie. It still manages me to sing along to Giselle's songs, to cry in every dramatic scene, to get butterflies in my stomach, to laugh at all madness and to screech with insanity over the evil queen. Not to mention I watched this movie for a couple of times already. Indeed, an enchanting movie that will bring back your love for modernized fairy tales again and again.<br/><br/>Magic tricks and spells did not just remain in the pixelated screen but the magic struck and traveled beyond our naked eyes. It struck the..heart. Values and lessons were also manifested. That made it extra fascinating to the audience. But there are also things that I disregard about this movie. Reality checks! It might be modernized fairytale but there are also scenes that are too much to believe in that it could happen in the real world. (Referring to the real world they manifested, not the whole movie itself as fantasy.) They could have made it more natural and real. Following the flow of a real modern day princess' life.<br/><br/>But I must say that this movie is one of the most heart warming movie of all time. It embraces all people from all ages. My mother, whose 52, can even belt out some lines of ""How Does She Know."" Thumbs up, Enchanted!"
"katie-sirles","10","1","1","27 December 2010"," Enchanted is enchanting
","Enchanted was by far my favorite film of 2010. This is funny for many reasons, but mostly because Enchanted came out in 2007. Being the Disney movie buff that I am, I can not fathom why I did not see this sooner. I was on my way home one day listening to the Alan Menken station on my internet radio and suddenly I'm practically dancing down the sidewalk. The Enchanted Suite by the brilliant Mr. Alan Menken is bursting into my ears and I can't help but smile.<br/><br/>Just days later, Enchanted was sitting in my mailbox in a bright red envelope. I popped it in the old DVD player expecting more of what I love in Disney movies: A beautiful princess faced with a problem and lots and lots of cheese. Musical numbers, lovely dovey stuff the whole nine yards.<br/><br/>What I got was so much more. The movie begins in classic Disney style with a voice over and a shot of a castle window. The camera takes us through the window to a giant storybook sitting on a pedestal. The pages magically flip by themselves and we are entertained briefly by a pop-up book illustrating an evil queen who doesn't want her son to marry, because she will lose her crown. We are then introduced to Giselle (Amy Adams). She is pretty and dressed in pink. She is chilling with her forest-dwelling friends and creating the prince that she saw in her dreams. The song ""True Love's Kiss"" is fun and sweet and describes Giselle's desire to meet the one and share true love's kiss. It's the most powerful thing in the world. As if it were magic – which is something one might find a lot of in a Disney movie – Mr. Perfect, Prince Edward (James Marsden) happens to be slaying trolls not too far from Giselle's place. He hears her singing and he and his white horse Destiny are off to find this fair maiden. He finds her and they decide to be married in the morning. His mother has other plans.<br/><br/>In an act of divine intervention, the evil queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) finds Giselle before she can marry Prince Edward, and sends her far away.<br/><br/>In a somewhat rapid turn of events, Giselle finds herself crawling up through a manhole cover onto the streets of New York City. Thrust into a world she does not know, she searches for her perfect prince. Alone in New York City in the rain, she quite literally falls into the arms of the hunky Robert played by Patrick Dempsey. As Giselle spends her days searching for Prince Edward, she manages to initiate a flash dance in Central Park to the song ""That's How You Know"", summon the rats, pigeons, and roaches of NYC to dance and hum to a ""Happy Working Song"", make three new dresses out of curtains and carpet, max out Robert's credit card, and bond with Robert's daughter played by the adorable Rachel Covey.<br/><br/>Amy Adams was a perfect choice in the casting of Giselle. Her whole demeanor just screams real-life Disney princess. James Marsden as the dimwitted but lovable Prince Edward is a stitch. Susan Sarandon is phenomenal, as usual, as Queen Narissa. Also as usual, Patrick Dempsey plays the hunk. Duh.<br/><br/>Enchanted tickled my fancy so much because it was original and fun and the original music was done by Alan Menken. He also happened to do the score for the best movie ever according to yours truly, The Little Mermaid. This movie has so many references to The Little Mermaid. For instance, Robert's assistant Sam is played by Jodi Benson. The same Jodi Benson who voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid.<br/><br/>Watch Enchanted and invite your 6-year-old self to come out and play. This movie is sweet and funny. Particularly enjoy Pip, the chipmunk, as he is in New York City. I happily give this movie two thumbs up and five stars.<br/><br/>(Please check out this review and other fun stuff in my blog -- www.mssilverscreen.wordpress.com)"

","This is one of the best kids movies I have seen, as well as one of the best Disney movies. This is the kind of movie Disney should produce more often. First off, it is a strangely simple, yet amazing concept. When I was watching the trailer and it said ""No other story has taken you to a land as strange and terrifying... as ours,"" I almost exclaimed ""THAT IS YOUR MILLION DOLLAR IDEA, Disney!"" It's so great because Disney is actually parodying themselves. It looks as though it might be a flop when you first see the typical, clichéd Disney princess, but then you see that she's going to be placed in our world! Not only does that sound strangely unique, but also it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen (and that's saying something considering it's a Disney movie!)! All of the actors and actresses are PERFECT for their roles, especially Amy Adams (who captures the princess role perfectly), James Marsden (Same thing), and Susan Sarandon (Same). Patrick Dempsey is also perfect for the typical, normal guy living with his daughter. It is such a comedic piece and I recommend this film to anyone who has lost their faith in Disney. I know it may seem like it can't be restored with a lot of the movies they are coming out with today, but it will give you back some of your faith. It did for me."

Even the songs are ever-so-gently over the top.<br/><br/>The performances are all fantastic, with Adam's charming fish-out-of-water princess never losing her belief in fairy tale happy endings taking the honours by a short head.

It's Disney's charming 2D animation combined with a modern love-comedy...so what do you get when you do that? AWESOME of course! The acting is superb...particularly Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsy. I have to say Amy outshines everyone. She plays her ""adorably innocent and naive virgin princess Giselle"" role SO naturally that you'd swear she's really like that. Her antics are so over-the-top and she's a just a little ray of shiny sunshine so combine her with the most cynical guy in New York, Robert, and you have one hilariously entertaining duo through the whole movie. And the chemistry between Adams and Dempsy is H-O-T without needing to be inappropriate for kids. They just have it! Yes, there is some subtle innuendo but young kids won't pick up on it. The other characters are just as fun...and I can honestly say I had no problems with ANY of them. They're all likable!! (Prince Edward is a riot!) Add in a brilliant script, songs worthy of Broadway, witty laugh-out-loud humor and beautiful animation scenes and you've got one of the best movies Disney has made in a long long time...and in my opinion, the BEST Princess movie ever made as well. So...why only nine stars? Well.....the villain herself is little weak compared to other Disney villains. Let's just say Sarandon makes a much better actress than a voice actress. Her animated character is eh. She works as a live character a great deal more. But even this doesn't stop me from watching my Enchanted DVD over and over again. XD This movie is amazing. Absolutely perfect for mothers and daughters to watch together as young and old couples alike. The only audience I'd be iffy on are little boys. Might be a teensy bit too girly for them.^^"

","""Sire, do you like yourself?"" <br/><br/>""What's not to like?"" <br/><br/>It is the simplest exchange of dialogue in the movie. But underneath it, whether the director intended it or not, lies layers of meaning. Nethaniel, suddenly seeing things in the light of the real world, asks this question to Prince Charming, whom is looking for Giselle and still stuck in the magical-happy-go-lucky state of mind. Prince Charming is the representation of the old-school Disney, the very simple, clean, wholesome, lovable Disney that every single child grows up with. In the old-school days, dreams come true, the heroes and villains are defined, and beauty runs deep within the main heroine.<br/><br/>Nethaniel is new-school Disney, unsure of itself, lacking any posture or ability to stand up and become known. Enchanted is quite possibly the greatest meshing of old-school with new-school, and while Disney self-mocks itself, it also statuses itself as the last main white hope in the dreams of children and adults. In a world full of cynicism, disappointment, and uncertainty over the actions and motives of other people, we all need a little bit of pixie dust to continue life. The question is can an old-school princess survive in a new-school world? Or would the new-school world consume the hopes and mannerisms of our princess? Enchanted stands as one of Disney's best family movies outside the Pixar realm this decade, and ultimately is an amazing celebration of the Disney image and reputation that it has sustained (in roller coaster fashion) for nearly a century.<br/><br/>Enchanted is about a princess (Amy Adams) whom is flung into a world where ""dreams don't come true"" according to our main villain Narissa (Susan Surandon). The reason for this is so that Narissa can remain at the throne and Giselle and Prince Charming don't marry. Giselle (in real-life form) winds up in New York City, where she runs into a pessimistic divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) and his curious daughter. While waiting for Prince Charming to arrive to New York to save her, Giselle learns that her new setting is full of people that do not have hope in life and do not believe in a happy destiny. What's worse is that Prince Charming isn't the only one that makes his way to New York from the magical land.<br/><br/>The script, written way back in 1997, went through a major series of changes before the final product was unleashed. And my what a script it is. Full of Disney references that could open up an amazing drinking game and full of bubbly fun, the story and dialogue remain crisp, clean, and despite predictable, contains plenty of unpredictable curves. However, the script doesn't make the film: Amy Adams does. Her performance is one of the few in film history that should quality for an Academy Award win, but won't get the nomination because of the content. It's definitely hard to praise the performance of a Disney princess, but Adams does spectacular as Giselle singing and acting-wise; infusing a jolt of energy and spirit rarely ever seen by anybody out there. Beneath her beauty is a bubbly personality that's impossible not to like. Everyone else did a grand job, including James Marsden and Timothy Spall as Prince Charming and Nethaniel respectably.<br/><br/>Enchanted's charm comes from its celebration and references to past Disney princesses, and its message about finding hope in a lost world. Just like in the movie, we as a generation of people exposed to the negativity of the world on a minutely basis lose all sorts of hopes in all aspects of life. The Flapper era and the Baby Boomer saga are two eras that just might not be duplicated for a very long time; the care-free, happy-go-lucky, positive time period in which all is well with the world. Walt Disney Studios used to be able to bank on this sort of happy time period. After all, Cinderella, Lady and the Tramp, Peter Pan, and Sleeping Beauty all came out in the 50s alone. Disneyland came out in 1955. That time has passed, this sort of eventual happiness nowadays passes off as clichéd. Even Enchanted itself was tough to watch at first because films nowadays just doesn't have that happy feeling throughout all 90-plus minutes. Even modern-day Disney flicks have a bit more gloom than before: see Lion King, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pocahantas, Aladdin, and dear goodness Fox and the Hound.<br/><br/>The film's greatest strength is more than its humor, charming characters, and ridiculously happy ending; it's the message of hope and finding sunshine in a cloudy day that's screaming out to you within the first, second, and even final acts. Old-school Disney values are flung into New York City and the payoff is grand. Then there's the adorable musical numbers and nice choreography. You just want to hug the movie for being so cute. Even a bitter cynic like me couldn't help but smile throughout the entire thing, no matter how ridiculous it might be.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Disney's old-school allure can be found here, as the celebration of works past and present are sprinkled throughout a creative story full of easter eggs and adorable performances. Amy Adams runs this optimistic show as the film opens up a can of happiness to anyone that sees it; no matter how bitter you claim yourself to be. The film isn't absolute perfection, but easily one of the best live-action Disney works this entire decade. Despite the childish outer look, you must see it for the deeper messages of hope and love. Highly recommend, and its great fun for the entire family. Kudos to Disney for heading in the right direction after years of questionable decisions.<br/><br/>""Everybody has problems. Everybody has bad times. Do we sacrifice all the good times because of them?"" <br/><br/>Not in Disney's watch."

","Ironically, the beginning of the film, which is supposed to mimic the ""glory days"" of Disney animation pales compared to the true classics and points out how the most recent animation (one thinks immediately of Ariel in the Little Mermaid...who I hate for stealing my manly name! Heh-heh...by the style of the drawing is inferior to classics like Snow White, etc.). However, you quickly get into the movie. Just the ""peeking"" into the Disney castle icon's window is a hint that something special is going on, and the ""pop-up book"" animation and ""live action"" animation later (animals and special effects) all combine to make this a Disney classic to rank right up there with the best of them. it's sure to be a memory maker, especially since the song ""True Love's Kiss"" is of that classic style that will have you humming it after the film is over. (I noticed that this is no accident since I realized it is very similar to the opening bars of ""Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", the lead-in that goes ""Christmas future is far away, Christmas past is past;Christmas present is here today; Bringing joy that will last."" It's seldom sung so the writers of the ""True Love's Kiss"" may not even have realized the similarities, but I caught it and you will too if you know the original ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" song. But the point is, the movie starts you off in a good mood and engages you. And those happy memories from Disney movies past continue throughout the film.<br/><br/>There is almost sense of disappointment when you think of the princess and prince not getting together in the end. But all ends happily ever after, as it would have to, though in unexpected ways. There is also a great message about needing to know the person you think you ""love"" before committing to them, even to the point of kissing. I think parents, especially of girls, will appreciate this. Of course there is the Disney-liberation theme of the female helping the male out along the way and tips of the hat to homosexuality, which frankly surprised me. It's a good-natured humor but still surprising from folks who have a high rate of homosexuality in their employees.<br/><br/>I must admit that even though the film is meant for children and women, men will get a chuckle or two out of it. And as I say the live-action animation is good enough to keep adults involved.<br/><br/>A very good family film that is not as heavy-handed in the liberal doctrine as most Disney movies have been lately. Watch it with your family and be reminded that the love you find with each other is no fantasy but has a magic all its own. The film is simply fantasy-tic."

","What fabulous fun 'Enchanted' is! A welcome return to form for Disney. Amy Adams is blissfully sweet, yet slyly self-aware as the cartoon character caught in the real world. She and Patrick Dempsey make a sweet couple. The comedy routines and songs are the stuff of legend, specially a great Broadway musical in a park. A CGI chipmunk steals the show. Susan Sarandon is a trifle miscast as the evil queen and seems slightly out of place. The climax is a partial letdown. The first ten minutes comprise a clever Disney self-parody as they poke fun at their older romantic cartoons. A charming surprise indeed.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10"
"cchase","9","1","1","17 January 2009"," Disney Does The Unexpected...
","It is VERY, very seldom that I go out of my way to watch a PG-rated movie, let alone a Disney film, unless it happens to be one of the classics I grew up with, or it presents something completely fresh, new and unexpected. NOT three words I would usually associate with something from Disney these days, but now I stand forcefully corrected. Not only has Disney taken that time-honored, road-tested (and considerably worn-out) concept of ""Happily Ever After"" and completely subverted it, but they've done it in a way that's shocking, surprising and incredibly entertaining!<br/><br/>ENCHANTED is, I promise you, like nothing you have ever seen from ""the Mouse House"" before! Taking everything we've known about fairy-tale scenarios about princesses, handsome princes, evil stepmothers and ""true love's kiss"", it presents it all in a bright, shiny, delicate, bejeweled package with which everyone is more than a little familiar...then drops it off the Empire State Building!<br/><br/>Part-animation, part live-action and CG, and definitely part old-time musical, it's the wonderful story of Giselle, a fair maiden longing for her handsome prince, Edward, and the wonderful state of ""happily ever after"" bliss in which they'll live once they meet, fall into each other's arms and are immediately married.<br/><br/>You know what's coming next. Edward's mother, The Wicked Queen, isn't about to let some little ""forest rat"" take over her throne, so in a disguise that will be more than a little recognizable, she tricks Giselle on her wedding day and with one of those evil magic spells that every witch keeps handy, she sends the poor girl spinning into a place she never expected...THE REAL WORLD. But not just any part of it. TIMES SQUARE IN MANHATTAN!<br/><br/>I could go on for at least a dozen more paragraphs about how great, brilliant and hysterically FUNNY it is when Fairy Tale Land and the Real World come crashing together, complete with the truly startled kind of reactions you or I would have when faced with a princess, a handsome and slightly dangerous prince and even a ""talking"" chipmunk, but I will leave these wonders and the rapture of a tale well-told for you to discover yourself. <br/><br/>In the meantime, I have to give crazy props to the performances of all the actors who not only voice the principal characters, but play them in the ""Real World"" as well. Amy Adams is nothing short of perfect as Giselle, as she completely enraptures us with the arc of change she goes through, transitioning from fairy-tale princess wanna-be to a real woman with true feelings. James Marsden is hysterical as Edward, and Timothy Spall hits every comedic note just right as Nathaniel, Edward's sidekick and the Queen's lackey.<br/><br/>But these stories are only as good as the heroine and her nemesis are in them, and Susan Sarandon has a ball as Evil Incarnate. Channeling every wicked female figure in Disney lore, she owns the screen every time she's on it - in both real and animated form - and it's 50% because of her that ENCHANTED has a thrilling third act. <br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel and the supporting cast are all great, but this story definitely belongs to the leads. But most of all, dear moviegoer, it belongs to you, because without our suspension of disbelief, who would even care about what happens in the beautiful, ""ENCHANTED"" realm of Andalasia or even its not-so-moondust sprinkled counterpart, good old N.Y.C.?<br/><br/>Disney never stopped making family movies, but it's good for once to see one truly made for the ENTIRE family - kids and adults alike."
"aimless-46","9","1","1","4 December 2008"," Very Amusing
","Think of Disney's ""Enchanted"" (2007) as part ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937) and part ""Prince Charming"" (2001), with a bit of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) thrown in for good measure. But its real predecessor is Walt Disney's very first production ""Alice's Wonderland"" (1923). Contrary to popular belief Walt's first sustained character was neither Oswald the Rabbit nor Mickey Mouse. It was a six-year old real life girl named Alice. While working for an advertising agency in Kansas City Walt altered a concept from Max and Dave Fleischer's ""Out of the Inkwell"" series and mixed a live actress (Virginia Davis) with animation.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" is all about the juxtaposition of the real world with the animated world. Animated characters become their real life counterparts, and then turn back into pop-up book scenes. As in ""Prince Charming"", a storybook prince finds himself dealing with modern day Manhattan. But this time he is has come to this strange world voluntarily.<br/><br/>It seems that his stepmother (Susan Sarandon playing a high mileage version of Snow White's Evil Queen) has transported his future bride Giselle (Amy Adams) to the real world. Adams is quite simply amazing in this role. She has no trouble selling her character's wide-eyed innocence (this is literally true-just watch her eyes). Giselle works her magic on a cynical divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his six- year-old daughter. Although the film has no weak scenes I found myself trying to hurry along the portions that did not feature Adams. <br/><br/>There are some relatively subtle sight gags; watch for the difficulties Giselle has maneuvering her huge Princess gown around the real world. Also watch for Adams' two musical numbers, ""Happy Working Song"" and ""That's How You Know"". These are absolutely priceless and compare favorably with the cinema's best musical moments.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" might have the decade's widest target audience as it has almost universal appeal. My only criticism is that the effects loaded climatic scene is not nearly as entertaining as the sequences that precede it. <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

"sddavis63","8","1","1","10 July 2008"," A Truly Enchanting Movie; Disney At Its Finest
","In many respects, I think ""Enchanted"" will hit home more powerfully with adults than children, although there's really nothing here that children wouldn't love too. It's just that this movie seemed to be a step back in time for Disney, to the stories and animation that I grew up with. While it will represent good entertainment for children, for me it was wonderful nostalgia; Disney the way Disney was meant to be. There are references throughout to the classic Disney stories (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella) and yet the story is refreshingly original with new characters and a plot that is both truly enchanting and hilarious at times.<br/><br/>The story starts in the animated story-book land of Andalasia, where Giselle meets her fairy tale Prince Edward and they prepare to be married. Unfortunately, Edward's stepmother Queen Narissa wants to prevent this, as once he marries, he becomes king, and so she banishes Giselle to modern day New York City. Here the movie becomes live action, and follows Giselle (now played brilliantly by Amy Adams) as she tries to come to terms with being lost in this mystifying new world. Here she meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey) - a divorce lawyer who doesn't believe in fairy tales but slowly becomes - well - enchanted with Giselle's sweet innocence. Eventually of course, Edward (James Marsden) comes to find Giselle, followed first by Narissa's henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) and then by Narissa herself (Susan Sarandon). Let's just say that these three animated characters who come to life (along with Pip the Chipmunk, who also makes the journey) turn 21st century New York City on its head.<br/><br/>There's little not to like here, although I thought some of the charm was lost once Giselle started to lose some of her innocence and began to accept that life isn't always a fairy tale. That's true, of course, but in all honesty I liked her better as a straight fairy tale character come to life. The song and dance routines in this movie are exceptional, the scenes in which Giselle interacts with New York's wildlife (including pigeons, rats and cockroaches) are delightful and the interplay between the cast members is flawless. You basically know how this is going to turn out pretty early on, although I liked the final twist between Edward and Nancy (Idina Menzel) - Robert's girlfriend. Apparently both Robert and Nancy needed some fairy tale in their lives. It's a great Disney movie. 8/10"

","One cannot but be cheered by the magic of Enchanted. This is a Disney film that does not falter and delivers without disappointment.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is outstanding as the lost princess in New York who rightly was nominated for a Golden Globe for this role, and should have got an Academy nod. Her cheery smile and flamboyance make Enchanted an all encompassing, entertaining, fun film. All the cast are very good along with some catchy tunes, 'That's How you Know' and 'So Close' particularly memorable, together with excellent choreography and cinematography.<br/><br/>Enchanted is a beautiful piece of work and I love the way it has been delivered to the screen - It's just Magical cinema."

","Its Amy Adams movie, the audience knows it the cast knows it and Amy herself knows it. She blissfully steals every scene with her wonderful wide-eyed princess Giselle. Its just a real shame Sarandon's (perfectly cast for the wicked which) could of stayed around longer, and when she does show her face she is quickly transformed into a poorly designed GCI dragon. One of the very few problems with this very good family movie. That small children will find magical and teenagers and adults will find heart-warming.<br/><br/>It's true, I doubt I have ever smiled this much whist watching a film making it the most enchanting outing of Christmas 2007. Stuff The Golden Compass, bin St Tinian's. The best family movie out there has to be enchanted.<br/><br/>Its been along time since we have had an all round Disney classic. And though enchanted may not be an all rounder (putting several spins onto this worn out story) it has definitely earned the right to be called a Disney classic and Giselle a Disney princess.<br/><br/>An animated fairy tale meets modern, live-action comedy. The beautiful princess Giselle is banished by an evil queen from her magical, musical animated land and finds herself in the gritty reality of the streets of modern-day Manhattan. Shocked by this strange new environment that doesn't operate on a ""happily ever after"" basis, Giselle is now adrift in a chaotic world badly in need of enchantment. But when Giselle begins to fall in love with a charmingly flawed divorce lawyer who has come to her aid - even though she is already promised to a perfect fairy tale prince back home - she has to wonder: Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world? There is no better feeling than when Giselle breaks out into dance half way through the film, you mouth may in fact be sore afterwards from all that smiling.<br/><br/>The kids will plead to go see it again and you won't be reluctant to take them. It's true that Sarandon's character isn't very good, and the horrible computer generated dragon at the end is rubbish. But such criticism will disappear from your minds once the feel good ending comes into view, and the smile will reappear. For better or for worse the days of your average Disney tale are over. This isn't your usual fairytale. Its better, tanks to Amy Adams mostly.<br/><br/>Though not without its flaws. Enchanted manages to be the biggest and best of Christmas 2007 outings. A big cheer for Adams who steals the show with Giselle. Enchanted has earned a place in our hearts, you will be more than happy to revisit this film. Truly Enchanting! There's just enough might and magic with a outstanding amount of warmth to allow enchanted to make you smile for hours on end. So much so also that its almost impossible to not forgive it for its flaws and misuse of Susan Sarandon.<br/><br/>Enchanted takes a poll position on 2007 children's films. It's brilliant that Disney have final getting their own back on DreamWorks Shrek. What with Shrek the third being so painfully average. Bravo."

","Loved this story. As I watched this thoroughly entertaining movie, it occurred to me that it is almost better watching for the adult audience--recalling the fairy tale princesses of our childhood, lost and confused in the reality of New York, still portraying her sweet charm and innocence of the animated stories of old in spite of the cynicism of reality. Of course children will love the movie, too, but adults will view it from a whole different perspective than the kids do. Before going, I wasn't' too sure about what I would see, and was actually pretty skeptical. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised.

","I think that after watching Julie Taymor's ""Across the Universe"" you start living with the idea that you may not find music, dancing and acting so perfectly combined in a film these days. But if you haven't watched it, you will have plenty of things to find in ""Enchanted"", the real life fable of all the Snowhites, Sleeping Beauties, Ariels, Cinderellas but not Anastacias. <br/><br/>Here the magical world of Walt Disney brings a film that brings everything back to life again. I like it because it's such an uncompromising film; so simple and predictable, and it knows it. However, it also knows that it's a film that had to be done and had a reason for existing (in case anyone had thought differently): making the viewer remember. Whether you are 10 years old, 25 or 50 or more, you'll get something of this movie that will stay with you forever. <br/><br/>The 10-year-olds will be astonished by the musical sequences in the best ""Mary Poppins"" style, the songs (they may not have shined at the Oscars, but Alan Menken's melodies are as sharp as ever and you can't help to smile while watching people in the middle of the street singing ""That's how you know""; look for the video if you don't believe me), the animals and the always winning tale of the princess looking for his true love. <br/><br/>The 25-year-olds will recognize every moment taken from another animated classic (this is Disney on Disney people) and the parallels established with the film's characters and some of the most beloved Disney villains and heroes of all time; while the 50-year-olds will just experience a short ride in a time machine, which I'm guessing it's no so bad. <br/><br/>""Enchanted"" is short, direct and targeted like no other Disney film this decade. The young girls will get it to see Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden (the latter one truly delivers and proves to have a natural singing talent); the whole family will get it because it's Disney, movie lovers will want to see Susan Sarandon doing a villain and, believe it or not, the boys will eventually watch it because everyone will be talking good things about it; and about Amy Adams. <br/><br/>And why wouldn't they? She's lovable and manages to control her performance so that it never becomes annoying, something that could have easily happened. The movie rests on her natural gift, her singing and on her smile and on the commitment of director Kevin Lima, who once directed the animated classic ""A Goofy Movie""; a film that everyone should watch once more. <br/><br/>Oh, and just in case: ""Bridge to Terabithia"" this is not."
"sseungni","10","1","1","13 April 2008"," Enchanted! (Spoiler!)
","In fairy stories and legends, to enchant someone or something means to put a magic spell on them. There is a movie whose name is ""ENCHANTED"". This movie tells about destiny and realistic love. This movie starts with Giselle's singing. In Andalasia, Giselle, who enjoys singing a song, has a beautiful mind. She hopes to meet a prince charming. One day, a dream comes true and she meets a prince. At that moment, they are supposed to marry. However, a wicked queen, who is a stepmother of a prince, worries that she will become a nothing after their marriage. She tricks Giselle and makes her fall down a well. Giselle turns into a human and comes to New York. Even though she asks a favor to other people because she doesn't know anything, nobody helps her. However, Robert and his daughter, Morgan, decide to help her and Giselle's New York life begins. Although this film borrows a lot from earlier Disney animations, it has a difference message than animation.<br/><br/>At first, they borrow many scenes from their animation so we can see many similar scenes from an opening. For example, in the first scene, Giselle sings a song seeing a prince that she made and dancing with an owl, rabbit and squirrel. It looks like ""Sleeping Beauty."" That a sleeping princess opens her eyes from a real kiss is from also ""Sleeping Beauty."" The glass shoes and to ring a bell at 12am are from ""Cinderella"". The poisoned apple is from ""Snow white. When Giselle comes to Manhattan and she sees a dwarf. At that moment, she says ""Grumpy!"" because she thought he was one of 7 dwarfs in ""Snow White."" It is one of the funniest scenes to me. The scene that can be called a highlight is when Giselle sings a song in Central Park while boating. It looks like ""The little Mermaid."" As you can see, there are a lot of scenes from other animations. To people, who enjoyed Disney's animation in their childhood, it can evoke old memories. Also to find these scenes in this movie is interesting.<br/><br/>Second, when it comes to a story, this movie is different from their animation. In the beginning of this movie, Giselle falls in love with a prince at first sight in a tale. On the other hand, she falls in love with Robert by dating in real life. In a fairy tale, there is only one prince but it can't happen in reality. We can fall in love with many other people and we have to make a relationship by knowing each other. The interesting scene is when a prince finds the princess and he sings a song to her as an animation. In animation, a princess has to follow him singing a song but she doesn't do that in this movie. She even suggests a date to the prince. In fact, the real love of real life is what we make it. Destiny depends on our deeds and effort. In animations, princes usually save princesses and servants follow their queen at the end. While in the end of this movie, the princess rescues Robert and the servant leaves his queen. The princess in this movie is not like previous princesses who wait for a prince who can help her. In this movie, the weak are not weak people anymore. They become stronger than before. Through these scenes, they show right story to people who have a fantasy about a prince and destiny. We can learn that if we want something, we have to go for that.<br/><br/>To sum up, we can see a lot of scenes that come from animation and remember our childhood from this movie. Also the important thing is that we can make destiny like Giselle. We can make real love like a movie if we do our best. If we make an effort, we can live happily ever after like in the fairy tales."

","This is one of my favourite Disney productions for a long time. And how could it fail? Enchanted takes all the most magical ingredients of a fairy tale and mixes them with a few modern truths like divorce, dirt and OTT publicity stunts.<br/><br/>Sparkling Amy Adams easily steals the show. A princess, she is pushed down a well by her evil soon-to-be stepmother (Susan Sarandon) and finds herself in the heart of New York City. As she searches for her Prince Charming in Manhattan's grimy streets she never stops smiling and makes friends  and dresses- along the way.<br/><br/>Far from being nauseatingly smiley, Adams is utterly believable and had a room full of critics laughing throughout; and even prompted applause at the end. My favourite part has to be the Marry Poppins inspired cleaning scene, where cute bunnies are replaced by urban rats and cockroaches! Being from the generation of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and given the advancement of special effects, I found the occasional animation somewhat unnecessary. However, I have no doubt that director Kevin Lima has created a movie that will put young and old under a glorious, candy floss spell, restoring everyone's belief in happily ever afters.<br/><br/>The Fan Carpet - www.thefancarpet.com"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","1","10 February 2008"," Quite enchanting
","Enchanted is built on two special premises, neither of which is completely novel. First, we have seen in ""Kate and Leopold"" the situation comedy of plunging into the modern world historical characters. Enchanted is a variation of the same theme, with storybook characters in stead. Secondly, challenging the ""happily ever after"" myth is best exemplified by the musical ""Into the woods"". These two themes, however, are blended in ""Enchanted"" with a fresh flavour.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" very wisely refrained from over-exploiting the comic situation of fairy book characters finding themselves in Manhattan. Once the appropriate amount of laugh has been generated, it moves on to more important things. Regarding the ""happily ever after"" theme, compared with ""Into the woods"", this movie is simpler and more focused. The interesting thing is that in ""the city where there is no happily ever after"", things eventually work out, but with a little twist.<br/><br/>Whether this movie makes or breaks depends entirely on the character Giselle, and Amy Adam makes it work. It is not easy to play someone with story book innocence (Giselle doesn't even know what the emotion ""angry"" is like). Nine attempts out of ten will end up looking ridiculous at best, and probably a lot worse. To play it so winningly and convincingly as Amy Adam did is close to being a miracle. Patrick Dempsey (the ""bad guy"" in the ""Sweet home Alabama"" triangle) handled his complementary role well. James Marsden (veteran ""the other guy""  ""X-men"" series, ""The notebook"") is more like a continuation of his character from the animation opening, a challenge of a different sort. Ditto Susan Sarandon, but it's good to see her anyway. Worth special mention is Rachel Covey who plays the 6-year-old daughter.<br/><br/>One last note of interest is on the use of songs. There are not too many. The interesting thing is rather than having the song break out naturally as in musicals, we actually have one character telling another not to sing, explaining that it looks rather ridiculous to break out in a song in ordinary daily life. Finally, one particular shot references the opening of ""The sound of music"". Wonder if that has anything to do with Julie Andrews being the voice over narrator."

","This innovative and original idea manages to interweave the Classic Walt Disney fairy tale themes with the reality of contemporary New York. The establishment themes of the film present us with a Princess Giselle who in reality is (played by Amy Adams who was the secretary in ""Charlie Wilson's War""). The Evil Queen Narissa is played by Susan Saradon in the reality scenes and James Marsden plays the Charming Prince Edward. <br/><br/>In an almost surrealist theme and scene Queen Narrisa pushes the Princess through a sort of a ""worm hole"" in order to banish her to the flip-side of the animated world which is Contemporary New York. Soon most of the animated characters find themselves in the real world in their real life flip-side state of being. <br/><br/>Whilst many of grew up wishing we were part of the fantasy worlds these guys must feel pretty tripped out at finding themselves in the real world. <br/><br/>Princess Giselle is adopted by a single Father and his young daughter who become absolutely enchanted by her. In fact you almost feel drawn to to the Princess by her overwhelming innocence and beautiful charms. <br/><br/>I absolutely love the Walt Disney Classics and this is now one of them. A beautiful and enchanting story for all of all ages. <br/><br/>Where are my mouseketeer ears?<br/><br/>If you have children take them to this one its a really good and funny feel-good film."

","With Enchanted, Disney returns to really good family film-making. More recently, the studio has been releasing dumb very immature ""comedies"" such as The Game Plan. Enchanted does what some were beginning to think Disney could no longer do: appeal to the adult audience coming with the kids. <br/><br/>Giselle is an animated princess-to-be on her way to her wedding to Prince Edward when his Stepmother Queen pushes her into a black pit in a desperate attempt to hold on to the crown. Giselle is sent into the most terrifying world of all: Ours. She is rescued by Robert, an engaged father who doesn't believe in love- but Giselle must of course fix that. Problem: our Princess is soon followed by her lover Prince, his servant, and eventually the Queen herself... and New York will never be the same.<br/><br/>Amy Adams stars as Giselle in this fairy tale with a twist, and star is indeed what she does. Her energy flows from the screen in an irresistible and delightful way. There is talk of an Oscar nomination for Ms. Adams, and I must say I would agree with it. She pokes fun at the classic Disney princesses at the same time as respecting them and becoming an icon herself. The rest of the cast all supports nicely, James Marsden sticking out particularly as Prince Edward. Mr. Marsden is one of my favorite comedic actors, and he's at his best here.<br/><br/>And of course it's a story about love, promoting happily ever after blatantly. What makes Enchanted special, though, is that the characters debate the reality and even need for happily ever after in today's world. Giselle is thrust into a modern day that doesn't instantly accept true love as natural or even possible and she can't understand this. Where she comes from, chance romance equals true love. ""Let's be married tomorrow!"" cries her Prince two minutes after she meets him. In this new world, though, people aren't so easy to believe. Giselle is desperate to convince everyone around her that love is forever, though they're very reluctant to accept it- and that's what makes it brilliant. For the first time, Disney isn't all instantly happy endings and true love with a prince. For the first time the Princess begins to realize that love is flawed and imperfect; but that doesn't make it any less of love. <br/><br/>At heart, Enchanted is a light-hearted comedy/musical that fits nicely into Disney's other such films. It's filled with good morals, good-hearted characters, and good clean humor. But it also discusses what real love is all about, a subject Disney has been a bit overly optimistic about in the past. That's a lot to pack into a little kid flick. 7/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","Thoroughly delightful for kids and grown-ups and wherever in-between you might be. Wonderful tongue-in-cheek send-up by Disney of its own iconic characters, without being cynical or ironic. Real modern-day fairy tale.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, everyone spontaneously burst into applause. I think boys and girls both will enjoy the story - there's love and romance, and action and adventure too. <br/><br/>The characters are all well-acted. Amy Adams is the embodiment of believable innocence, and Patrick Dempsy plays the world-weary yet still caring dad with the perfect mix of modern man and prince charming. <br/><br/>The musical numbers are so over-the-top that you can't help but enjoy their nod to the classic Disney fairy tale musicals. And the Princess vs. Evil Stepmother battle is given enough time and space to develop and resolve without overtaking the movie's other charms.<br/><br/>It's the perfect holiday treat...light, sweet, satisfying."

","I can not believe all of the good reviews I keep seeing on this particular movie. Personally, I absolutely hated it. I went to the theater to see this movie with a really close friend, mostly because Patrick Dempsey, Mr. McDreamy himself, would be staring in it. However, that alone was not enough to keep me or my friend even remotely interested. I know that the movie is supposed to be targeted to a younger age group and people of ages seventeen and eighteen shouldn't even consider watching a Disney movie, we did. And we regret it.<br/><br/>The plot alone was terribly unconvincing and there were too many plot holes to even start saying. The acting, with the exception of Mr. Dempsey, was just too horrible for words. And the special effects were just awful. All in all this movie was a seriously big disappointment to me. It literally shocks me that I am probably one of the few people on IMDb that found this particular movie horrible. It was a terrible waste of money, and an even bigger waste of time.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, if you happen to get the urge to go out and buy this movie because of the pretty title, and the pretty guys, just do me a huge favor and don't. This was one of, if not the, biggest letdown after all of the hype about how great and perfect it was. Perhaps Disney should make a remake of this movie with better acting, better graphics, and a plot that isn't so predictable it's almost like you know what is going to happen from the second the theater goes dark."

","Enter a standard Disney cartoon. The cartoon section of the film is supposed to be a homage, or a reference, or a poke at classic Disney cartoons. Instead, it is practically a complete lift from Sleeping Beauty, one of the better early Disneys. This does not come across as intelligent, but as a rip-off, as if it is okay to laugh at Sleeping Beauty because post-modern cartoons have taught the modern audience that the old cartoons weren't very good. Well, mostly they were very good and so far, the post-modern versions haven't touched them in quality.<br/><br/>Edward's stepmother doesn't want Giselle to usurp her throne, so sends Giselle to the live-action real world. Amy Adams plays human Giselle bizarrely, while she clearly isn't a normal person, she doesn't particularly come across as a cartoon. The first part of the film follows Giselle closely, and then suddenly cuts to new characters Robert and his daughter Morgan (who may as well have been cut for the little she does) for no reason, breaking the feeling of continuity, which irritatingly sets how the rest of the film flits between so many characters that none get a good enough set up or development and scenes are endlessly resolved by simply not existing any more.<br/><br/>The romance, the crux of the film, is boring, obvious and has been done too many times before. For a brief moment it seems as if Giselle will help Robert propose to his long-term girlfriend Nancy, while her own love Prince Edward fights to rescue her. However, the film quickly kills this interesting premise after suggesting it, by going back to the dull getting-to-know-you plot and having Giselle randomly state she is on a date with Robert, and proceed to steal him off of Nancy. It is slightly sick that Robert fancies Giselle, since she is basically a child, and she never learns anything about reality, other than dates and hot dogs, because this is a children's film and children aren't allowed to know about reality, which really defeats the point of the film. It would have worked better written for adults, but then wouldn't have done so well at the box office.<br/><br/>The ending, apart from emphasising the bad plot of Robert and Giselle getting together, involves the evil queen turning into a giant dragon to kill Giselle, despite her whole reason for sending Giselle to the real world being to break her up with Edward  well, she has succeeded! The Queen wins her evil aim, so what is with the awful dragon stuff? So poor Edward loses the love of his life and Nancy loses her five-year relationship despite telling Robert that she trusted him (she shouldn't, because he runs off with the girl she thinks she can trust him with), but don't worry, no broken hearts for them because they get together for a nice neat, nonsensical ending. They don't know each other at all, she doesn't know he comes from a cartoon and the two scenes which could have helped their relationship feel like it was destined to happen were cut by some idiot editor. That's if it is possible to hear the ending over the blaring music.<br/><br/>So it's a horrible disappointment of a film. Elements of the film that really work are the swashbuckling Prince Edward, brilliantly performed by James Marsden, who is sidelined again (seriously man, get a better agent), and the two moments in the film when Giselle manages to bring her cartoon magic to the real world  when she decides to clean the house with the help of local animals (rats, pigeons, flies and cockroaches) and when she starts to sing a song and hundreds of people join in. If these elements had been more central, and the forced romance had been axed (it's yet another they get together because in the course of the film they don't spend any time with anyone else) then Enchanted may have been worth watching, even achieved the classic status it was aiming for, but instead it is vapid and spirit-crushing and an annoying waste of time."

","I saw this in a preview on 11/08/07. I'm writing this review today because I really needed to digest what I saw that night. I will admit, I read more and a few reviews here today that are glowing with praise and in many of the cases it is justified. The overall good feeling and sweet taste that you are left with after watching this film is quite palatable, by design.<br/><br/>I fear that the overall public has taken another clever marketing ploy, hook, line, and sinker! If you read even a few of the other reviews then you have had more than enough of a good thing and I will refrain from adding to the drooling... Instead I will tell you I laughed when Disney wanted me to laugh, cried when they wanted me to and watched their practically subliminal messages roll across the screen like waves of cotton candy, eagerly gobbled up by all who witnessed....<br/><br/>OK, Movie starts in a fairy tail classic that Disney does so well, ( the CGI mapped and converted humans coupled with the classic animation was not very good) then we thrust a Juxtapostion of 2 of the most unlikely elements, with loads of potential for ""what ifs'"" New York and a Naive cartoon fairytale character. This hes been done so many times before in Hollywood but never on this scale. After a while I was sitting thinking to myself,""Hmmm what else can we make these lovable innocent characters do in NY city that would illicit a good laugh...""? well the studio found most of them! Moving on to Children and adult relationships... Do we really think Disney is the most qualified party to be giving our children suggestions on how to deal with divorced/ing parents? I was very disturbed to realize that any child who is old enough and sees this film will be asking for his divorced/ing parents to get back together for Christmas..( Poor Santa and all those wish lists!) it clearly made 2 suggestions with it's plot;<br/><br/>1). Parents don't really need to divorce, they can work it out with just a little help of some fairy tale smoke blown up their collective....(which kids will try to do..)<br/><br/>2). Money can solve many of your problems in life or love...<br/><br/>The above #2 statement killed me to write. I liked where the movie was going until Amy Adams ( who can sew up any dress she desires, fit for any Queen,from any fabric in the house overnight) Tells the little girl (Rachel Covey)that she needs a really great dress for the ball tonight, and this is where I suspect there was some board room drama at Disney, and the little girl advises Giselle that she has this Gold card for 'emergencies' and this is an 'emergency'! Well I suspect the writers had envisioned a moment of bonding where the two make a dress together by hand from some special fabric, but Disney saw an opportunity to whore this film out to pay for its budget but letting the naive princess to be go shopping for enough clothes to fill a wardrobe for a year! and in the end she shows up looking lovely as Amy Adams always does but paling in comparison to the dresses she had made herself! Product placement strikes again... and again... and again...<br/><br/>What are we teaching our kids... Yes I can see the point that on one level the film can pass along the message that we need to take time to get to know someone before getting into a serious relationship, but I don't think that is one of the messages that kids will come away with.<br/><br/>p.s. ""Dear Santa all I want for Christmas is a shiny Gold Card"".... <br/><br/>p.p.s. The acting was OK, Wormtail is typecast as wormtail here.. and I found James Marsden to be the most believable and likable of all the cast.<br/><br/>Go see it for your self... someone has to pay for all that product placement!"

I didn't get it.<br/><br/>While the premise is a clever one they have done the cross over between alternate worlds before, and done it better.<br/><br/>The cast themselves were on the whole good, but the best, Sarandon just wasn't on screen enough. Spall added the comic relief and was value but the rest just seemed to be going through the motions. I know it is a children's film but they should still be trying to be believable.<br/><br/>The best of Disney's recent releases have all come by way of Pixar. They seem to put the time and effort into their scripts and set pieces and they always deliver something that is aimed at children but has enough in to keep the adults entertained as well.<br/><br/>That is where enchanted failed.

We were surrounded by families with little girls and they were all smiling/laughing/giggling... this was a Home Run for Disney! ""Enchanted"" is a Disney movie about a cartoon fairytale princess, Giselle, who is sent to real-life New York City by the evil step-mother/witch of her prince. Giselle was all the Disney Princesses rolled into one. Her encounter with the human world was fun, comical, and wholesome. There were a couple ""adult"" jokes, so to speak, but they were done so tastefully they'd completely go over a kids' head.<br/><br/>I am VERY picky about movies (I don't allow ""Shrek"" here because I find the humor too crude and don't want my kids repeating the lines.)

It was worth watching once (and for free, I might add since it was shown on a cross-country flight), but not worthy of purchasing unless you have little girls that are obsessed with the ""princess"" ideal. <br/><br/>Furthermore, most of the film is terribly predictable and unoriginal- although I suppose anyone who views this movie out of any actual desire to see it probably expects this. On the other hand, when the storyline finally reaches beyond the scope of predictability, it becomes ridiculous. And as much I would like to commend Disney for the reversal of gender-roles at the end, it seems to be more of a mockery."
"preppy-3","6","5","12","14 December 2007"," Didn't really work for me
","The first 20 minutes or so of this are fantastic. It's a cartoon where Gisella meets handsome Prince Edward and wants to marry him. However, his evil mother Queen Narissa doesn't want her to become queen. So she sends Gisella to the real world (New York City). She is followed by Prince Edward, a spy named Nathaniel and Pip--a chipmunk. Will Edward find Gisella there? The idea is a good one and this has a lot of things going for it: the opening cartoon is wonderful--it's like a whole Disney film running at top speeds and going WAY over the top in an amusing way. Amy Adams is just wonderful as Gisella. She doesn't overplay her character's naivety too much and avoids becoming too goody-goody. Also Pip is a CGI animated chipmunk here and he's just hysterical. His facial expressions and body movements had me laughing. Also the movie looks great--tons of bright color and great special effects. But that's it for the good things.<br/><br/>The bad: James Marsden overplays Prince Edward to a degree that it becomes annoying. Susan Saradon is badly underused as Queen Narissa (her role is little more than a glorified cameo). Patrick Dempsey looks miserable (and acts it). But, most of all, the story has leaps of logic that are just impossible to ignore. There are so many of them that I don't have enough space to list them. A few: how does Gisella get on a subway-with no money? Why is Nathaniel in a kitchen to contact Narissa? Where does he get the various costumes and disguises he wears? How does Gisella get back into Robert's apartment after she left? That's just a few of the problems.<br/><br/>So I really wanted to like this but the story inconsistencies kept annoying me. I might be being too cynical about this so use your own judgment. Kids will probably love it but, be warned, there is a somewhat scary sequence at the end."
"WhenUPlayTheGameOfThrones","5","5","12","4 December 2007"," I thought it was going to be better
","Let me start with the introduction. Seeing the oh-so-not-interesting trailer I had no expectations nor intent in seeing this movie. I thought it looked cliché, unoriginal, and totally not funny. Maybe thats how I should have went into seeing this movie? Well, my choice in seeing this came from my aunt, uncle, and two cousins saying it was hilarious and an overall good movie. My thoughts had changed and I was going to see ""Enchanted"".<br/><br/>Mostly everyone has seen the trailers/previews for this movie so they know whats going down when they hit the movie theater (if you don't I almost don't feel sorry for you). Basically put, its an old Disney fairytale that meets live action. The cliché princess Giselle is banished down a well by the evil queen who oddly resembles that of Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. So pretty much she needs to find her prince and somehow survive in the strange world that doesn't work the way she is used too. Can she do it? The movie focuses around one thing, taking every Disney idea and clashing it with well thought out comedy to create a slow moving kids movie that will more than likely will appeal to adults rather than what it aims for. The character of Giselle is extremely lovable as well as all the fairy tale characters but the Manhattan characters seem somewhat dull and uninteresting. The opening scene in the movie almost tries to hard to be funny and the song is just over done to the max. It was nice at first, but oh my god can you say dragged?! The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what audience it is aiming for. The kid behind me kept saying ""Mommy, I don't want to be here."" The movie needed to make up its mind halfway through and never does. With the pattern of good lined scenes being ruined in the previews, this movie has no spunk when its finally shown to you. Every single line was out before the movie so I didn't chuckle once. Another major problem I had with the movie is the moral. There seemed to be one at the midway point but then it just dissolved and seemed to dismiss itself. I mean, is it don't love someone until you know them? Be yourself? I'm not quite sure. The relationship between the daughter (so forgettable I don't even remember her name) and Giselle seemed rushed and just there to make the movie ""heartfelt."" We saw them together maybe once...and Giselle never even taught her that dreams do come true. I hate to be coming down on a kids movie, but I wouldn't feel as bad if it was aimed where it was supposed to be. Like I said, maybe I should have seen it thinking it was going to be horrible..."
"DICK STEEL","8","3","6","21 November 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Enchanted
","How does she know, you love her?<br/><br/>Probably by bringing her to watch Enchanted, a movie with the words ""chick flick"" rubber stamped all over it. I've got to admit my friend offered to hook me up on a blind date with a hot chick because she wanted to watch this movie, and I had unsuccessfully persuaded him to bring her out on this movie date himself. Anyway if you're reading this, you should, because it has a winning formula!<br/><br/>The trailers would have suggested that this was going to be a madcap time, with a Disney movie poking fun at most of its classics, drawing inspiration from, and then taking a mickey out of it. You have a princess-wannabe Giselle (Amy Adams), an animated character modeled quite generically from beauties like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty et al. Thrown in a Prince Charming named Edward (James Marsden), and his evil stepmother The Queen (Susan Sarandon), with evil hag disguise to boot. And with her greed to hold onto the Kingdom, she prevents the love-at-first-sight/song couple from marrying, and banishes Giselle to The Big Apple.<br/><br/>With zero help and all the wrong moves and polite demeanor, she finds herself in the unlikely friendship of Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey). And here's when the movie starts to come alive with its inane scenes drawn from the Disney archives to bring on the chuckles, down to full blown musical numbers that are just plain charming. If Disney animated movies of yester-years have lovey dovey songs (listen carefully to the background music to spot some recognizable Disney tunes), poisoned apples, dragons, henchmen, magic mirrors (ha!), witches, glass slippers, gorgeous costumes and cute furry animals, this movie has them all. But aside from the predictable elements that make a Disney cartoon a Disney cartoon, it boiled down to what's core in such fairy tales:<br/><br/>True Love's Kiss. The one thing that every Disney female character yearn for from their hero. It's a typical fairy tale plot, but in its fish out of water storyline, it offered a clash of two different worldly views on the notion of love. For Giselle, it's always been happily ever afters after a shotgun meeting - boy meets girl, girl loves boy, they get married and live in a huge castle. In the real world we're so familiar with, Robert epitomizes the modern day notions of long drawn courtships, the trying to find out everything you can about the other half, for compatibility reasons, the contemplation whether you can live forever (which is such a long time) with the other half, and the option to divorce always hanging overhead when things don't work out. It's a clash of two different perspective from different worlds, and needless to say opposites do attract, henceforth providing a sort of dilemma as both parties are to be married to their respective partners.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is Enchanted, without whom the movie will fall flat. She sings the songs, dances the joyous dance, squeals in delight at every new experience, and is the typical bambi-eyed beauty who finds positivity in everything, even when they are heading south. I guess I'm attracted to optimism, and no doubt, her character of hope had naturally struck a chord in me (same thing goes for Kirsten Dunst's Claire in Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown). When she opens her mouth and sings to invoke the innate powers of all Disney heroines, the ability to charm animals from afar to do her bidding, you've gotta see this one as it just cracks you up with the type of beings she conjures in New York. In her own ditzy manner, her Giselle will undoubtedly find a soft spot in your heart.<br/><br/>Playing her two leading men are Patrick Dempsey as the world-weary divorce lawyer whose pessimism is soon to take an hard knock from Giselle's infectious attitude towards love, and James Marsden as the very himbo-like Prince Edward, all brawn, a naturally glib tongue, and perhaps a hint of an airhead (Is it me, or are female characters these days becoming more Alpha-typed?). Susan Sarandon got top billing too in this movie, and while she looks quite the part as the evil Queen, it's a pity that her screen time had been severely limited, lending more of her voice instead rather than appearing in the flesh. Throwaway characters include Timothy Spall as the no good henchman Nathaniel, and an animated chipmunk Pip (noises by the director Kevin Lima himself in the NY version) which seems to be the precursor to more of the same once Alvin and the Chipmunks hit the screen next month.<br/><br/>In true Disney fashion, Enchanted goes back to basics with its message, that there must always be hope that one day you'll meet your true love, whether they drop in from the sky, or crawl out of the sewer. Almost a no-brainer choice for dating couples looking for fluffy chick flick entertainment."

","This was a pathetic attempt, despite a couple of quirky and fab moments. Enchanted was an utter disappointment, and I am in complete shock at its high rating on IMDb. This film had a fantastic and original idea, I must say, but sometimes things don't work out. The film at times was too cheesy it made me cringe, and it got so terrible, that I walked out of the theatre with my friend near the end of the movie (So I did actually see basically all of it). There is a fine line between good cheesy, and too much cheese for one film. This was too much. The acting was rough, and alright. Nothing which made me go wow. Some of the ideas though turned into catastrophe. For example, the over the top dance numbers which made me what to throw my drink at the screen. The film was just dreadful, to say the least. <br/><br/>Although, I am sure there are little girls who would enjoy the film, basically only because there is a pretty little princess in a pretty little gown who had to marry a hunky prince, and has a squirrel friend who talks. Other than that, I suggest you stay away from this film. 4/10."

Apparently, gone are the priceless glory days of such classics as ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""The Black Cauldron,"" and ""Robin Hood."" Now, the studio has resorted to recycling characters from some of their most undeserving cash cows by relocating them to a modern-day metropolis.<br/><br/>The ""Grumpy"" joke wasn't even funny in ""Elf."" The painfully interrupted musical number is an absolute waste of effort. The performances are more lackluster than anything you could possibly imagine. And the absolute waste of Susan Sarandon is a crime too often committed and never forgiven.<br/><br/>This would have been a good film if they had decided to make fun of themselves. Instead, they insist that their hokey fantasies are simply ""classic cinema."" However, as is proved quite often, a classic is generally something that's old and liked by everybody except yourself.<br/><br/>But face it-- ""Enchanted"" has absolutely no redeeming value.

Usually when a movie is this bad we stop watching the movie, as we feel it is a waste of our time, but for some reason, inertia most likely, we stuck it out. We also thought that maybe it would get better. We were wrong. Other than when the dragon appeared near the end of the flick, the rest of the movie was painful to sit through and sickeningly sweet. Even the special FX we thought were sub-par. And the chipmunk, when in NY, was not that cute or funny. Not when one compares talking animals from other flicks."

","As if regular life isn't tough enough...and expectations for men to be Prince Charming aren't demanding enough, now women have movie-inspired notions of a supposedly more realistic fairy tale prince....if of course, your supposed real-life savior is Patrick Dempsey from Grey's Anatomy. Supposedly this is how things would play out if someone came from a fantasy land to NYC. (Seriously...haven't we seen enough of NYC? Why not Topeka? Or Louisville? Or Milwaukee? Or Pierre...anywhere but NYC) Only this person doesn't know, or doesn't seem particularly concerned with trying to figure out, or explain where this fantasy land (titled Andalusia for the movie) is. This girl, played with the fairy tale airiness of a princess quite well by Amy Adams somehow emerges in New York and doesn't seem even to have any worry that she can't get home or that her family might be concerned or that she can't call them, or other mundane concerns. All she is concerned about is that her prince Edward find her. I won't give away any more of the movie, but this mixing of fantasy and reality is really insidious. To suggest that New Yorkers would treat people running around, quite clearly without any irony, fighting chivalric fairy tale battles, wearing faux-medieval garb and stabbing people-or that such people-if indeed they were people, would not be a bit more concerned about their immediate safety and how to get back to where they came from, is idiotic. And now, supposedly, we have a recipe for a ""more realistic"" fairy tale. We have no such thing. There is no such thing and women should come to terms with it...this just raises expectations. Yeah, you can say I'm taking this too seriously, and that's fine, maybe in some ways I am, but let's not pretend that entertainment doesn't have an effect on young tweener and adolescent girls. This just muddies the waters further and confuses expectations for young girls...and really, how can men compete with McDreamy? Yeah, I didn't like this movie."

","and people wonder why women have this fantasy about ""prince charming"" - i understand the desire to live the fantasy but at the same time, can we please get real and stop growing our children to believe in these ridiculous little fairy tales about relationships? Life is not like these movies. Not even close. Even if you DO find an amazing relationship, it's still NOTHING like this. Real life isn't always flowers and butterflies and gorgeous, rich men sweeping beautiful women off their feet into never, never land. Get real.<br/><br/>here's another ridiculous stereotype that keeps being perpetuated by films like this: step-parents aren't always horrible people. I understand this is a movie with the element of being an old fashioned fairytale but why make the step-parent out to be this grotesquely selfish, money-grubbing psycho? good way to make all young kids automatically believe that step-parents are mean and awful.<br/><br/>movies like these are why so many women now have these impossible standards for men. so many women now will waste so much of their lives pining away for that imaginary prince charming (who never appears) that they may miss out on a great relationship with a REAL man. it's disappointing that we continue to make these false ideals OK in today's society. it's bad enough women can't ever be perfect enough in their own eyes because they're living up to images of women who represent less than 1% of the female population (models, actresses) - but then throw on top of it this fairytale model of a relationship.<br/><br/>and men wonder why so many women are so completely obsessed with the big wedding and the white princess wedding gown... this is where they learn it."
"indymom810","4","11","41","22 November 2007"," I really wanted to like this movie but..........
","First off, let me say, I love Amy Adams. I think she is a wonderful actress, and she was a large part of why I wanted to see this movie. She was wonderful in this role, as well, without being annoying -- which could easily have happened, were this role put into the wrong hands.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Patrick Dempsey (what the heck is the big deal over him, anyway?) and felt like there was very little chemistry between him and Miss Adams. His performance was very wooden, early in the movie.<br/><br/>This movie had everything in it that I hate about Disney: product placement, product placement, product placement. I could tell you, from the opening scenes, where the marketing was.<br/><br/>And it didn't make me laugh. So sad. It could've been a good film."
"TxMike","Null","2","4","28 March 2008"," Very entertaining fantasy romantic comedy.
","This movie starts with traditional, old-fashioned Disney animation, and continues this way for about 10 minutes. Julie Andrews is the Narrator. It is about a fictional kingdom where mean Queen Narissa wants to keep her stepson, Prince Edward, from the throne. She especially wants to keep him from falling in love. When it appears that he has found his true love, Giselle, she is lured and thrown into a magical well, and she emerges from a sewer in the middle of a busy Manhattan street.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is perfect as naive Giselle, lost in this bewildering land. She catches the attention of a New York divorce lawyer, Patrick Dempsey as Robert Philip, who was in a cab with his young daughter Rachel Covey as Morgan Philip. They come to her aid and a friendship begins.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Prince Edward finds out what happened and he jumps into the well to find his true love and bring her back. James Marsden is good as the not-too-bright Prince Edward. They are eventually joined by Timothy Spall as Nathaniel, and much later Susan Sarandon as the mean Queen Narissa.<br/><br/>What else can I say, it is a fantasy, an animated Disney movie come to life with real actors. Amy Adams does her own singing and reveals a nice, stage musical type of voice. There is nothing much new here that hasn't been done before, but the actors create a nice entertaining movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: As all the characters encounter each other in New York, Giselle finds that she doesn't really love Prince Edward, instead is falling for nice guy Robert and his small daughter. They end up staying together in New York. Meanwhile Prince Edward is falling for Robert's girlfriend, and they go back through the magic well and get married as cartoon characters back in the fantasy land after the mean Queen Narissa is disposed of in New York."
"Ddey65","7","2","4","31 December 2007"," So sweet, you'd think it would make you sick... but it doesn't.
","When I read that Harry Knowles, the founder of ""Aintitcoolnews.com"" apparently never heard of Amy Adams before this movie, I was flabbergasted, because a known movie-geek like him with his own website rivaling IMDb never heard of her, and yet I still remember her as the sex-starved Marvel Ann in ""Psycho Beach Party."" I also remember some trailers & promos earlier in the year indicating she was going to play the princess in this movie, and from what I heard about it, I thought it was going to be mildly amusing. What I didn't expect was to fall head over heels for her character, her movie, and her.<br/><br/>The evil Queen Narissa(Susan Sarandon) of Andalasia wants to do everything she can to keep her son Prince Edward(James Marsden) from finding love, because that means he will marry the girl of his dreams and she'll have to give up her throne. Gee, I can't imagine why, since Queen Elizabeth II hasn't given up her throne whenever her kids got married. Anyway, in the fairy-tale world of Andalasia, couples can fall in love in a day, and sweet girl like Giselle can summon animals with a song to her hollow tree-house, and land in the arms of the prince of her dreams while trying to flee from a troll that was going to eat her. Also, wicked queens can transform themselves into dragons or old hags and trick blushing brides into making it easier to push them into seemingly bottomless water fountains.<br/><br/>The Queen tells her minion, and would-be lover(Timothy Spall) that she sent Giselle to a world where there are no happy endings... ours. Specifically contemporary Times Square in New York City. What a wimp! If that queen wanted to send her to a real nightmare, she should've pushed Giselle into the Times Square of the 1970's! Either way, when she arrives in the no longer animated world, she finds out just how rotten things can be. Meanwhile, a single father named Robert Phillip(Patrick Demsey) who works as a divorce lawyer tries to convince his six-year-old daughter Morgan(Rachel Covey) that she should accept the upcoming marriage to his girlfriend, Nancy(Idina Menzel). Suddenly, they stumble upon this apparently disturbed young woman in a funny-looking outfit trying to get into a billboard shaped like a castle. Yes, I'm talking about Giselle, the pretty young thing who was on the verge of marrying into Andalasian royalty. Originally, he just wants to call a cab to send her to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, but something about this kooky-lady intrigues him, so he let's her stay for the night.<br/><br/>The next morning, our would-be princess decides to tidy his apartment up by summoning rats, mice, cockroaches, and pigeons, inadvertently convinces his would-be fiancé to think he's having an affair with another woman, makes a new dress out of the man's curtains, and upon learning about the concept of divorce, desperately convinces a splitting couple to get back together. Fortunatley, this couple doesn't have a violent relationship, because if they did, one partner would be in serious trouble. At the same time, Prince Edward and Giselle's squirrel-friend Pip dives into the well to rescue the Princess, and Narissa coaxes her minion into trying to stop them. And all three have as hard of time adjusting to the real world as Giselle. When Robert tries to send her into Central Park with some money for a trip to wherever, she gives it away to an old lady feeding pigeons, and he joins her for a stroll to discuss the way love really works. From there, Giselle bursts out into song on cue. When a calypso band joins her in the song, Robert's reply is ""How do you all know this song? I've never heard this song before!"" If he came to my house, he'd hear a lot of songs he never knew existed before, and so would you. Soon enough, all of Central Park joins her performance. And to think last night, they were writing her off as a crazy lady in a funny costume, like Robert is. After all, the girl is certifiable... certifiably adorable.<br/><br/>In a flop-house apparently in Harlem, Prince Edward & Nathaniel discover television, including soap operas with former Disney characters as members of the cast. I like how a line from the soap makes Nathaniel doubt the morality of the mission the queen sent him on. It's also hard to ignore how the real world rubs off on Giselle, and some aspects of Andalasia inadvertently begin to effect Robert's fiancé Nancy.<br/><br/>Still, it's Amy Adams that makes the movie worth watching, despite the fact that her cutesy voice is as fake as hell. Very little can be said about her as Giselle that hasn't been said before. She's so sweet, she makes Stacy Rowe look like Sandi Griffin(I just can't get away from those ""Daria"" references, can I?). Whereas Jennifer Garner was a delight in a non-delightful movie like ""13 Going On 30,"" Adams is a delight in an equally delightful movie. Absolutely not to be missed."
"albert-wayne","7","2","4","30 December 2007"," I was ""Enchanted""
","Disney's magic is finally back. After so many inane, by the numbers movies by the once great studio, they come up with a wonderful, simple, poignant musical romantic animated comedy spoof, I know, all those genres wrapped into one might sound like a messy stew, but it's anything but, it is altogether wonderful.<br/><br/>When I first saw the campaign for the film I though like many out there ""Gee, what will Disney think of next to squeeze bucks out of parents with small kids and girls that go gaga over Princesses?"" After a couple of months, I've seen the film 3 times, and was ""Enchanted"" with it, from start to finish.<br/><br/>Probably the two best elements in the film are the screenplay, which did a wonderfully clever spoof on all the Disney mythology we've grown with since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Kudos to newcomer writer Bill Kelly.<br/><br/>The other fantastic element is the tour De force performance from it's leading lady, Amy Adams. A great actress in the making, sort of reminds me of Diane Keaton, for her corky choice of characters, and the corky choices she makes with her characters. I first came upon her in Spielberg's Catch Me if You Can, she caught my eye as an interesting actress. Years later, with already an Academy Nomination under her belt, she is proving herself to be a great actress. Her comedic timing, her range, her screen presence, and her surprising vocal and dancing skills amazed me, and totally locked the film, she might be the most important cog of the whole production.<br/><br/>The cast was altogether fantastic, Grey's Anatomy Patrick Dempsey was a smart choice, James Marsden was brilliant as Adams counterpart, it's always a pleasure to see Susan Sarandon, and Timothy Spall was a delight, surpassing his apparent character actor persona, established by his collaborations with Tom Cruise. Idina Menzel was slightly underused, being the great Broadway vocal she is, she could have had a musical number, or record a song, but she was great nonetheless.<br/><br/>Speaking of Broadway, they really hit the spot on me with all the Broadway locations, displaying such signs as Hairspray, Chicago, The Color Purple and The Producers. The film does play out as a wonderful Disney Broadway musical. And though the film is not as mesmerizing as Beauty and the Beast(I leave that price to Brad Bird's Ratatouille), Enchanted is wonderful on it's own terms.<br/><br/>Kevin Lima also did some clever directorial choices, like changing film format from Academy Ratio to Widescreen, to classic by the book Jerome Robbins choreography and staging(that comes full force with the showstopper ""That's How you Know"").<br/><br/>The score is the cherry on top, it's was fantastic to hear, finally, a new score from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, they were connected with Disney's Golden Era of Late 80s, and 90s, we owe many of the classic Disney scores like Beauty and The Beast, Aladdin and The Little Mermaid to them, it was amazing to have them back, with a killer score, that shows they have not lost their touch for music and lyrics, all of the themes are inspired, and the songs stick with you, Kudos you masters, you guys pulled through yet again, I smell a classic.<br/><br/>Although it's early, I would definitely call Enchanted the surprise of the year, a film that from it's campaign seemed dull, predictable and by the numbers, but showed me and many people wrong.<br/><br/>Disney and Pixar seem to have trouble with their marketing team, Ratatouille had the same problems with it's campaign, let's hope they can learn from this year.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Enchanted, let's hope it will ""enchant"" you as it did me."

"sinncross","8","2","4","16 December 2007"," Surprisingly spellbinding...
","'Another Disney movie?' Lets be honest, who hasn't yet made this phrase in complete awe as to why Disney still continue to slowly butcher the masterpieces of many years back, with features that are simply substandard in comparison? But on account of Disney's latest venture, it appears as if the animation-dominated company, is finally shifting its gears with the deliverance of the suitably titled: Enchanted.<br/><br/>Living in the fairytale world Andalasia, Giselle (Amy Adams) is filled with thoughts of a dashing prince, later found to be Prince Edward (James Marsden) and the chance to share that one true kiss with him. When both unexpectedly meet, a marriage proposal is suggested and after merely a day of knowing one another, both Giselle and Edward are to be wed. However, Edwards's step-mother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), has no inclination to allow her throne to be given to another, so she decides to be rid of Giselle by sending her to another world which is devoid of the characteristic happy endings of fairy tales. Giselle ends up in the real world, more specifically, New York City. Here the harshness of social life begins to tug at her, but an unlikely friendship with divorce lawyer, Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), helps her to adjust.<br/><br/>Enchanted portrays a story where some of its main characters are transported from a realm of fantasy into reality. And it's this fantasy/ reality exposé which guides the film along. For Giselle, the real world lacks the sparkle, optimism and goodness which dominated her beloved world. Instead she is presented with self-centeredness and social dismay. This is what makes Enchanted an interesting watch: the contrasts and similarities of two opposing worlds. A noticeable scene involves Giselle attempting to clean an apartment with the aid of animals; however she is presented with rats, fleas and roaches: a complete change from the doves, deer and chipmunks she expected. The film goes about negating negativity by providing reasons as to why the world should be filled with more optimism and hope, but thankfully never to the point of being numbing on happy pills. And this is the films greatest achievement: keeping everything seemingly realistic and thus tangible for the audience.<br/><br/>The film also has its fair share of humour, containing the likes of self-parody, which does a good job of making you chuckle and keeping a smile upon your face.<br/><br/>The film does becomes stated in its meaning, in respect for younger children, but luckily there are drops of symbolism, and references to a few other Disney titles, which help deepen the experience for the older generation. An aspect which must be highlighted is how Enchanted breaks the stereotype of the fairytale maidens. We are presented with females who aren't merely subservient but have self-control and are willing to be assertive. Yet this happens only towards the end and comes out of nowhere. This is my main complaint: the film is a few minutes too short. There is not enough time to sufficiently enhance the characters attitudes and emotions, and the opening animated sequence is far too quick in its aim. The everlasting love between Giselle and Edward in the beginning of the film only comes across as emotionless as it lacks the necessary buildup. Also, I felt the ending was far too predictable. There is a good chance that you will guess the specifics of the ending about three quarters through the film. As well, the ending is far too brief and basically throws out the reality notion the film does well to convey.<br/><br/>Like all Disney animation, the voice acting in the few animated sequences of Enchanted is handled superbly. Best yet, the actors translate nicely into live-action where the acting ability is noticeably strong. Whether it is the carefree innocence of Giselle, simplemindedness of Edward, seriousness of Robert, or even the evilness of Narissa, every actor brings a realistic approach that works within the framework of the films context. The supporting characters of Pip (Jeff Bennet in animation; Kevin Lima in live-action) and Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) prove just as capable as their leads. The film also expectedly sports a musical aspect, with both Giselle and Edward being the forerunners of this department, and they both deliver great performances, with a piece by Adams as a high point in the film.<br/><br/>It is, however, a pity that the love interests of Giselle and Robert, Edward and Nancy(Idina Menzel)respectively, get a bit too little screen time. While their participation within the story is not nearly as important as the characters of Giselle and Robert, by the end of the film they are given a major story arc, but little characterization to support it. Also, while a minor issue, Giselle's character appears as being a hint too childish in her naivety in the live-action segments, while her animated self is aptly suited. It would have also been a nice addition to include a bit more singing but what is provided is, at least, sufficient.<br/><br/>As a Disney film, one can expect content that is appropriate for the whole family. There's no sex, nudity albeit a scene with Adams in a towel after a shower and a nude statue. There is also minimal non-offense language use, and violence only rears itself in a small quantity towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Enchanted is easily one of the best family films to grace cinema in the last few years. Regardless of your demographic, there is bound to be very little any movie-goer can find wrong with this experience. Yes, it falls short of being ranked amongst the top-tier, but it just makes for such a compelling case study of our world, and is just so fill of love that it almost breaks my heart not to add another point to the overall score. Enchanted will make you feel exactly so, and thank goodness for that.<br/><br/>-- Full version available at http://cruizd.blogspot.com --"
"writers_reign","8","2","4","15 December 2007"," Twelve O'Clock High
","Any movie that can quote King Kong and The Sound Of Music without stretching has to be doing something right. It's the ideal film for this time of year, a perfect blend of live action and animation welded together seamlessly and chock-full of references from Alice In Wonderland to Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and more. Amy Adams was denied the big award for Junebug and she'll probably lose out again yet she is magical in a part that requires the kind of naivety of Leslie Caron in Lili, or the two Audreys, Hepburn and Tautou and she does it effortlessly. The score is tuneful and how often do you find an interior rhyme in a lyric today. It builds up to a stroke-of-midnight kiss and it really is a twelve o'clock high."
"belowzero8","8","2","4","7 December 2007"," Disney does it again
","I am a huge sucker for Disney movies, and why not? Disney time and time again produces fantastic movies. Enchanted is no exception. <br/><br/>Amy Adams does a great job acting as the soon to be princess in a fantasy life lost in the real world. She is constantly cheery and surprisingly a decent singer. <br/><br/>The movie is full of humor and moments that sweet you off your feet in excitement. There is a great plot with a lot of things happening to keep the viewer watching. Definitely a must see, fun for the whole family movie. My only complaint is that it took a little bit for the humor to finely kick in about mid-beginning of the movie."
"msims1","9","2","4","5 December 2007"," ENCHANTED lives up to its name!
","Almost everything about the movie is enchanting from its two locations (""happy ever after"" Andalasia vs. ""happy never after"" New York City) to its multi-dimensional characters (campy cartoons vs. reality survivors). Pip, the endearing chipmunk, steals the show in both worlds. Amy Adams, as Giselle the intrepid, out of her element Princess, is a perfect foil for Patrick Dempsey's Robert, the staid and logical NYC lawyer who attempts to help her find her way home. Both have true loves, but their providential meeting alters their perceptions not only of love, but of friends, family, and life in general.<br/><br/>The stereotyping of characters, and some continuity errors, were a little disconcerting. Yet the metamorphosis of those characters into believable people, and the engaging storyline, eradicated all of these concerns.<br/><br/>If you love fairy tales with inevitable happy endings, see this movie. ENCHANTED is a movie in which almost everyone finds his or her true heart's desire, which could be exasperating for cynics, anyone who has no interest in romantic love, and those who abhor show stopping musical numbers."
"Boyo-2","8","2","4","1 December 2007"," Started out good...
","The animation was fun. Looked dated but it was probably supposed to. When she arrived in Times Square it was funny. For about 45 minutes it was very funny and very clever. It did not stay that way. It became the very thing it was making fun of so the beginning and the end were like two separate movies for me.<br/><br/>I do think that Amy Adams is extremely good and has enough talent and screen presence to keep the movie intact even when things go slightly corny. If she's not real good, the whole thing pretty much can fall apart.<br/><br/>James Marsden is also very good as Prince Edward. Having seen him in this and in ""Hairspray"" I am beginning to think I should be a fan. What was a little funny to me what that one day last summer I saw him in Central Park, and then he had that scene in Central Park when the guys on bikes run over him...<br/><br/>Went with several family members, all female, and they really loved this a lot. I cannot quite join them in that sentiment, but I did enjoy it more often than not. I could have done without Pip, completely. A little too cutesy for me, really. 8/10."

Disney is back to what it is good at and here is to hoping they bring back more and more hand drawn animation."
"TOMNEL","9","2","4","25 November 2007"," The commercials do this movie no justice.
","From the commercials, ""Enchanted"" looked like a typical, run of the mill family film. They show a princess coming into New York with hip hop music playing, and make it look like the movie is filled with jokes involving the princess mistaking people for Disney characters, and the princess singing and doing embarrassing things in public, in which she is told to stop. It's not like that at all. When (soon to be) Princess Giselle sings, New York starts singing with her. She's bringing her fantastical world to New York more than New York quieting her down.<br/><br/>After Giselle (Amy Adams) is saved by Prince Edward (James Marsden) from a troll, they are to be married. But Edward's wicked stepmother (Susan Sarandon) does not approve and throws Giselle into a seemingly bottomless well that leads straight to real life New York. Giselle meets Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a single working father, and learns about the real world, and gives the real world a reason to sing. Meanwhile, more cartoon characters go through the portal, and chaos ensues. One thing that really surprised me about ""Enchanted"" was that there was no contemporary music. From the advertisements, it looked like there would be hip hop and rap to portray New York, but all the music in the film was created for the film, including a few new songs, by the wonderful Alan Menken (Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc.) The whole movie was really cute and sweet, but managed to not go overboard and how corny it was, which is often hard with kid's movies. The acting was good, as was the singing, and it was nice to see some traditional Disney animation, which hasn't been seen theatrically since 2004's ""Home on the Range"".<br/><br/>Overall, this was a well put together, fun movie, with a fantastic musical score. I thinks kids and adults alike will enjoy this one.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins. PG for mild violence."
"mpm_27","10","2","4","24 November 2007"," Disney Making Fun of Itself
","This is by far, the most I've ever laughed at a Disney movie. I think most of the jokes went over the young kids' heads. However, the adults in the audience could not stop laughing. Amy Adams plays a perfect Disney princess. She is flawless as the doe-eyed, naive, love - will - conquer -all optimist. Snow White or Cinderella would not have done better themselves. The work song scene was hysterical as well as the Central Park chorus scene. The theater applauded several times during the movie. I don't think I've ever witnessed this phenomenon. Of course, the ending was predictable and a little cheesy but I think it suited the plot. It wouldn't be a Disney movie if it had a surprise ending. The only thing I found missing was a Susan Serandon song. We all know she can do it, remember Rocky Horror? That is a missed opportunity for more laughs if you ask me. It would have improved the movie and the soundtrack. Maybe in the sequel . . . This is a MUST see for children AND adults!!!"

","Disney blends live action and animation for a tale that subverts all their own big fairytale hits of old for heart warming results. Basically it's a fish out of water tale as a princess (the heart achingly yummy Amy Adams) is thrust into modern day New York and proceeds to change the life of everyone she comes into contact with. While of course nefarious baddies have followed her from ""animation fairytale land"" to attempt assassination for crown grabbing purpose. The ending is a joy, as is the big theatrical musical number in Central Park. 8/10"

","What a concept - the idea of Amy Adams doing a Disney self-parody where a traditional fairytale character ends up in grimy New York. Enchanted (2007) pulls this off mostly quite well with a compelling storyline of two worlds colliding. However, Giselle's naivety is too exaggerated considering that a lot of the classic Disney films have quite violent settings."

","2 December 2007. Unfortunately, this fun, entertaining, and delightful romantic, animated/live action movie has a problems that just can't be ignored and besmirches an otherwise solid film. The music, the plot, and fusion of live animated characters, the idealistic fantasy world values and the blending of the real world values are emotionally satisfying. Giselles first experience of the real world is a dizzying and brilliant sequence full of hurt, bewilderment, and the whole range of just what one would expect from fantasy meets New York. It is intriguing how the flat, old animated beginning sequence was necessary at this junction in such a film as this in order to heighten the contrast between the old fashioned animation film characters and live human characters. The animation technology has advanced sufficient to actually make this movie effectively successfully, something that wouldn't have been as rich and believable even a decade ago. The first problem occurs with the casting of Nancy, the protagonist's girlfriend, with actress Idina Menzel. Her physical appearance just doesn't lend itself to the overall movie's theme and character by the end of the movie. There wasn't sufficient character development if she was to be used, which wasn't really necessary, but she was cast almost too animated-like as a black and white idealistic character instead of the more complicated human character of New York City. A second problem with this movie was the over-exaggerated musical reality that occurred midway through the movie turning this movie for a brief time into a fantasy musical when in fact most of the movie is charming just for its more realistic bent meeting idealistic fantasy characters. This sequence while charming, didn't fit in this movie and took away some of the flow of the movie. Finally, reminiscent of THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) starring Eddie Murphy, he gets to battle an evil character who seems to transform into a large, horrific character played Charles Dance. The major conflict sequence seems somewhat confused, less effective, particularly as to what happens to the Queen. Overall, this is a fun, family movie that is rich with family themes, the importance of romance but also the importance of achieving one's balance with reality. It's not one or the other. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","6yrs before Frozen we are introduced to actress Idina Menzel in this Disney animated meets live action romance comedy.<br/><br/>Amy Adams starts out as the voice of animated maiden Giselle and then is thrust onscreen into the live action part dressed in a white wedding dress with a skirt so full it will make you think of Gone With The Wind. Sent into the dark mean streets of New York from fairy tale land Andalasia by the evil queen Narissa, portrayed by the amazing Susan Sarandon, Giselle is literally lost without her beloved Prince Edward, played by James Marsden.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey is a no nonsense divorce lawyer and divorced Dad Robert Philip. We meet him and his young daughter Morgan, played by the delightful Rachel Covey, on the same night Giselle is sent to New York. Robert has told his daughter he is going to propose to his girlfriend Nancy, Idina Menzel or aka Elsa from Frozen, and suddenly Morgan sees a princess on a billboard. She falls off and lands on Robert. They take her back to their messy apartment and he offers to help her out. Giselle falls asleep on their couch before Robert has a chance to ask her to leave.<br/><br/>The next day Nancy walks in on Robert and Giselle in a very compromising position. Mistakenly thinking Robert is cheating Nancy leaves and he becomes angry with Giselle. She suggests singing to Nancy to win her back which leads to a musical number with Amy Adams leading the supporting cast singing and dancing through Central Park.<br/><br/>All the while Queen Narissa's bumbling sidekick Nathaniel has been sent to New York to find Giselle and kill her so she will never return to Andalasia. Prince Edward also comes to New York to search for his bride to be along with Pip, Giselle's chipmunk friend. The back story is simple. Queen Narissa is Prince Edward's stepmother and when he marries his wife will be the new queen of Andalasia. Queen Narissa refuses to lose her role as queen and so she plots to get rid of Giselle so Edward cannot marry. Nathaniel is lovesick over Queen Narissa and will do anything for her and she very happily uses this to her advantage. So, while the prince is trying to find Giselle, Nathaniel is trying to kill her.<br/><br/>Throughout this Giselle, Morgan, and Robert are becoming friends. Morgan and Giselle bond quickly while it takes Robert longer to warm up to Giselle. One night Robert makes Giselle angry by telling her Edward is never coming for her. Giselle and Robert argue and almost kiss. The next morning Prince Edward shows up at Robert and Morgan's apartment to rescue his true love. Robert, shocked because he can't believe Edward arrived, and saddened that Giselle is leaving. Prince Edward is eager to return to Andalasia and make Giselle his bride, but Giselle tells him there is a ball that night and suggests they return after the ball.<br/><br/>In a hotel in Manhattan Robert and Nancy are dressed in period costumes as are all the other guests. Suddenly Giselle arrives on the arm of Prince Edward wearing a modern designer dress looking very beautiful. Robert sees her and Nancy is jealous. Its obvious by this point Robert is in love with Giselle. At the ball during the King and Queen's Waltz, Robert and Giselle switch partners and dance together. They dance to a song called ""So Close"" by Jon McLaughlin. Patrick Dempsey and Amy Adams glide across the floor flawlessly. Its an emotion filled dance as the audience sees how much Robert and Giselle love each other. Then suddenly Nancy cuts in and Giselle and Edward turn to leave. Giselle sees Nancy kiss Robert and the sadness is evident to Edward. She dismisses it and says she is fine. While Edward has gone to get Giselle's wrap Queen Narissa appears disguised as an old woman. Giselle recognizes her as the old woman who pushed her down the well sending her to New York. Narissa tells Giselle all her sadness can fade away with one bite of a wishing apple. Giselle bites into the apple and faints. Prince Edward discovers Giselle laying on the floor beside the now restored Queen Narissa. Nathaniel also appears and confesses the truth about his betrayal and Narissa's plan to destroy Giselle all along. True loves kiss is the remedy to bring Giselle back, but when Prince Edward kisses her she doesn't stir. Nancy tells Robert to kiss Giselle. He kneels down beside her and says ""Please don't leave me"" then kisses her gently. Giselle wakes up, looks into his eyes and says ""I knew it was you."" Narissa transforms into a dragon and climbs up the top of the building with Robert clutched in her claws. Giselle runs after them accidentally leaving her shoe behind. Narissa falls to her death and Robert and Giselle sit atop the skyscraper in each others arms sharing a romantic kiss.<br/><br/>Prince Edward takes Giselle's shoe and places it on Nancy's foot and tells her its a ""perfect fit."" They run down the streets of New York together to return to Andalasia. Nancy marries Prince Edward and becomes the new queen. Giselle opens her own store called Andalasia Fashions and she, Robert and Morgan live happily ever after of course.<br/><br/>This movie has a little of everything for everybody. It really is a family movie. And if you listen to the narrator you will recognize her voice. It's Julie Andrews!!"

","This film of animation and fantasy is based on the accidental journey of a princess to our world. Amy Adams is the actress who gives life to the princess Giselle, young and innocent, happy and hopelessly romantic. James Marsden made a good performance as Prince Edward, but who really makes some chemistry with Adams is her romantic pair, the skeptical and pragmatic Robert, played by Patrick Dempsey. Susan Sarandon is the villain, Narissa. In the supporting cast, Idina Menzel has been relatively well, Timothy Spall shone with his accent and theatrical manners, and a small squirrel, Pip, deserves congratulations.<br/><br/>The script is very original, blending our world with the fantasy world we are used to circumscribe to animated films and fairy tales. The pace is fast, things are happening rather quickly. The characters are forced to get accustomed to our world, much less charming and innocent than theirs, and we were delighted to see the countless hilarious moments that result from this adaptation. The animated scenes were very well done and easily brought to our memory the traditional animated films that we saw in childhood. But even some scenes in the rest of the film have made discrete reproductions of some famous scenes of these films, resulting in a very moving homage to this genre. The ending of the film is beautiful but very predictable, there is no surprise in the way it ends, and that is a little disappointing. The film also has several interesting songs, filmed in an original way an normally singed by Giselle.<br/><br/>This is a movie designed for families, which will easily please everyone. It's not a fully animated movie, it has minor flaws but it's nice."

","Disney Animation perfectly protects children's dream. For example, Disney Animation prohibits voice actors and actresses to speak as the character with showing their face.

It is surprising, interesting and a great idea. Actors and actresses of a live action and characters of an animation are very similar and nothing strange. Both of them are all attractive and nice.

","I'll give this bloated ball of sugar one high five, making me laugh and gag at the same time. The animated opening had me checking the film's running time as a cloyingly sweet princess to be sings of ""Happily Ever After"" while the grating handsome prince prepares for his wedding day while a wicked queen plots to send her where there are no happily ever afters. That of course leads her to coming out of a manhole right in the middle of Times Square, causing me to become distracted by Broadway theater marquees (circa 2007), one ironically displaying ""Wicked"" which originally starred Idina Menzel who appears here in a non-singing role as the neurotic fiancée of the hero who happens to rescue princess Amy Adams after bumping into her during her struggle to figure out where the heck she is and what she is going to do.<br/><br/>Call me cynical, jaded, or even bitter, but I far more enjoyed the reactions of the New Yorkers as they responded to the strange characters all of a sudden wandering the streets. Of course, as New Yorkers are used to strange characters are roaming the streets but one thing we do not do unless it is on a Broadway stage or in a film like this, break out into song in the middle of the street. There is a slight gay sensibility to this that strives for camp, not always a good idea to do purposely. Some moments seem straight out of the West Village Halloween parade. <br/><br/>The songs themselves are rather mediocre, each sounding like the previous one and none of them really memorable. I am certainly praying that this is not in the lineup of Broadway musicals, because I certainly would like to see something fresh on stage not rehashed fairy tale stuff that has been done on stage over and over again. This also perpetuates the stereotype that women are princesses and must find their handsome prince in order to be happy, while the realism of the world is much stronger and creates much disappointment to the young girls who get used to this and find out that real life is not always happily ever after. In looking for handsome prince to sweep then way too, the girls obsessed with fairy tale like this find out the realism of the situation of what man and women are like in real life.<br/><br/>But there are some wonderful surprises, and I give the creators credit for trying something unique. I would have liked to have seen more of Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, joining in the ranks of Glenn Close, Sigourney Weaver and Anjelica Huston who have gone from serious dramatic roles to the deliciously campy. Sarandon get a glorious entrance and that I wouldn't mind seeing on stage, just not in a stage musical version of this."

","Enchanted (2007): Dir: Kevin Lima / Cast: Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden, Susan Sarandon, Timothy Spall: Here is the answer to fantasy visiting reality. A Princess is banished to Earth and discovers New York. Her Prince follows but struggles with the same inability to communicate. Obviously she will have certain issues with the reality she now inhabits but director Kevin Lima spins a nice twist in the third act. This is a huge improvement over such crap as Tarzan and 102 Dalmatians. Amy Adams is delightful as a Princess who believes in love. She has fun with the translation from fantasy to New York but it is her switch in traditional storytelling roles that ultimately allows her to steal the film. Patrick Dempsey plays a divorce lawyer whom encounters her. The role is somewhat straight forward yet Dempsey is also thrust into that role reversal climax. James Marsden is hilarious as the Prince whom learns that New York doesn't heed his demands yet he too propels towards a conclusion that isn't as expected but it works the same magic. Susan Sarandon is dominant as the evil Queen in what might have been a standard issue role had it not been for her fierce delivery. Timothy Spall plays the Queen's evil servant who is manipulated to do her bidding. Tremendous animated, live action visual extravaganza about the enchantment of true love. Score: 9 / 10"

Also nice to see that the female love rival who in times past would have been inevitably cast as some evil gold-digger is actually treated as a real human being and in the end get's a heck of a consolation prize in husband terms. <br/><br/>On the bad points I'm still a little confused as to what happened to Patrick Dempsey's ex-wife, did she die or just walk out? Timothy Spall and especially Susan Sarandon are sadly wasted, I'd have liked the Wicked Queen to decide she can't go back to her old kingdom so instead stays in New York and becomes a chat show host, or Mayor or Senator or something (Hilary Clinton?) I kept expecting a scene where the police haul everybody off to a mental asylum where they try to convince the psychiatrist to release them by telling them their true life story. Would also have been a funny idea if Amy Adam's character wandering the streets had encountered a group of streetwalkers who attempt to sign her up to their pimp but maybe that would be pushing the two-level humour a little too far.<br/><br/>All in all though, great film"

","Yeah, the story is formulaic, predictable, but it's still a lot of fun. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Amy Adams in the lead role. It could have been a disaster, and the whole over-the-top princess obvious tone could have gotten annoying, but Adams always remains likable. In that respect, she's the main reason to see this. The story could have used a little more cleaning up, and a lot of times the script feels like it's rushing to get to the inevitable finale. But there are a lot of great jokes and individual scenes throughout that makes it more than worthwhile. Check this one out with the whole family, you'll enjoy it."

It is an old fashioned family film that you don't see very often in this day and age of fancy 3D.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is a fantastic actress and does this type of film so well as she has since shown in Night at the museum 2 and has all the charm, warmth and beauty to carry of the role of Giselle.<br/><br/>This is by far one of Disney's best films of the last decade and is well worth searching out if you are a fan of Disney films or just a fan of good storytelling."

","I found Enchanted to be a pleasant surprise. It appears to be a standard Disney offering, but the excellent cast, and clever, witty script, elevates this to a classy film which pastiches earlier classic Disneys without parodying them.<br/><br/>The story opens nicely as a classic animated tale of our innocent, lovely heroine (Giselle, nicely portrayed by Amy Adams), is united with her Prince Charming (Edward, ably played and sung by James Marsden) and to me married on the next day. The formula is completed when Edward's step-mother (Queen Narissa) thwarts the union by disguising herself as an old crone who proceeds to push poor Giselle down a magical wishing well, to a place where there are 'no happy endings'.<br/><br/>The realisation of the animation and live characters is very nicely down and plays on the conventions classic animated films - the two- dimensional true love and tidy, idyllic world of Andalasia and its bland, ballad-singing Prince Edward, compared with the cynical lawyer who reluctantly rescues Giselle shortly after her emergence from in New York sewer.<br/><br/>There are some great cameos from Susan Sarandon and particularly Timothy Spall as the guilt-racked servant of the Prince secretly working for his beloved queen to feed Giselle a poisoned apple.<br/><br/>""Sire, do you like yourself?"" asks Nathaniel, as the two of them discover the miracle of television.<br/><br/>""What's not to like?"" smiles Edward charmingly.<br/><br/>It's the interplay between the real-world cynicism of divorce lawyer Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and Giselle that really carries the day; the story is adult enough to amuse grown-ups but has enough silliness and fun to entertain older children.<br/><br/>I found it great fun, and have watched it more than once!<br/><br/>Roll on Enchanted 2.

","As a devoted, long time Disney fan, I really feel that this is probably the best live-action product the studio has made since major production from the original Burbank studio ended. It embodies so much of what Disney films should be like, only with a little couch therapy added for thought.<br/><br/>I've always loved Disney, but let's be realistic. Happiness is a very difficult path to take. Just look at what characters like Pinocchio, Dumbo, or Snow White went through to get there. As a avid Disney fan I have many times had to reconcile the Disney ""happy ending"" philosophy with the numerous soul crushing disappointments that life often deals some of us. Often the only true happiness I have found is mostly in the Disney films themselves. Real life can be impossible, heart-breaking, even dangerous, and decidedly full of lots of lies and untruths. This film is perfect tonic for anyone who was raised believing in a ""happy ending"" for themselves and finds life to be, well, rather hard. This film analyzes the ""happy"" concept, turns it every which way, and sincerely tries to help understand what ""happiness"" means in the real world.<br/><br/>The real world in the film is New York city, our time, our world, a world that the evil Queen in the film describes as ""a place where there are NO happy endings"". Ouch. In our world the vermin aren't cute, they're a little un-nerving and a little disgusting. People don't just burst into joyous song(or do they?). And happy endings take some awareness and self insight.<br/><br/>Any generation of Disney fans that doesn't embrace this film is asking for trouble. I promise you. It helps Disney fans understand themselves and come to better terms with Disney vs. the real world. It will put everything in proper perspective. I should know.<br/><br/>""Happy endings"" can be elusive for some. But you should try to believe, if not for yourself, for others. But be careful not to be blinded, and be careful that your happiness doesn't infringe on others too much. God Bless. Good luck."

"John_Truby","Null","0","0","7 January 2010"," Billy Kelly makes it work
","It's easy to underestimate the fantasy form, especially when it's a Disney family picture like Enchanted. But writer Bill Kelly knows his genre and its potential, especially when it's mixed with other forms.<br/><br/>Enchanted is really a combination of fantasy, fairy tale, romantic comedy, musical and the traveling angel story. That's a lot of forms, which is why this film is more complicated than it appears. Most writers trying to mix all those genres end up with a structural mess. Too many heroes, too many desire lines, too many story beats and so on. But Kelly makes it work.<br/><br/>One reason for the film's success is that Kelly has combined genres that work well together. Fantasy and musical have very similar thematic underpinnings. Both are about learning how to live well, which they define as forming a community. Love stories are about creating a community of two. The traveling angel story concerns a (usually) perfect person who enters a community in trouble and sets it right.<br/><br/>Now all of this thematic unity doesn't change the fact that mixing so many forms is tricky. Kelly starts by establishing the foundation of the story, which is the fantasy and fairy tale opening world. Though an apparent utopia, the world has a big flaw, which is the jealous queen. And the princess, though apparently perfect and about to be married, has a flaw as well. She has no emotional depth and therefore is about to marry the wrong person. One of the nice touches here is that the audience is no more aware of this at the beginning than is the princess. The viewer, having seen decades of Disney films, is as caught up in the promise of fairy tale life as the princess is. But this weakness is crucial because it creates the need in one of the lovers that is essential for a good love story.<br/><br/>With the foundation set, the heroine travels to the second, fantastical world. Ironically this film flips the beat and makes the second world all too real, modern day New York. But for the Princess it is a nightmare, a dystopia, and, true to the fantasy form, it is where the heroine will learn her great life lesson. It is also where the traveling angel plot kicks in. Using music and her own boundless, fairy tale optimism, she begins to help the characters who are in trouble and turns the cold New Yorkers in Central Park into a utopian community.<br/><br/>This is also where the love story line resumes. The man who helps her out has his own weakness and need. He's a single dad who doesn't believe in love. He needs to feel love again, for himself and his daughter. From this point on the film plays out the key beats of the fantasy, love story and traveling angel story. One of the fun aspects of modern fairy tales is seeing how the writer comes up with modern equivalents of fairly tale elements, like transformations, spells and kingdoms. For example, when the Princess finds herself in need of a fairy godmother, the daughter pulls out the greatest wish fulfiller of all time, dad's credit card.<br/><br/>Hollywood blockbuster films are all about mixing genres. Even pleasant little children's stories are more difficult than they appear, because they usually require a lot of forms. If you are interested in modernizing a fairy tale - which is a very successful story strategy - check out the Great Screen writing Class. For fantasy, of course, go to the Horror, Fantasy and Science Fiction Class or the Fantasy Software. You can learn Romantic Comedy in the Love Story Class or Software, or in the Comedy Class or Software.

","The 2007 film ENCHANTED is a deft and imaginative musical/comedy/fantasy that breaks several cinematic rules in its execution of a richly entertaining story that intrigues and delights the viewer. The film opens as an animated fairy tale where we meet Giselle, a princess who, shortly before her marriage to Prince Edward, is magically transported to modern day Manhattan, thanks to Edward's mother, the requisite Evil Queen, where she is befriended by an attractive attorney and single dad. Giselle's fish out of water experiences in Manhattan blend seamlessly with the arrival of Prince Edward, the queen's henchmen, and the Evil Queen herself, who also arrive in New York to return Giselle to the kingdom of Andulasia. The story takes most of the turns it's expected to, but the journey there is the fun here, as the the old cinematic chestnut of the fish out of water, is dusted off and refashioned into a contemporary fantasy filled with child-like imagination and adult sensibility. Amy Adams is perfection as Giselle, the princess transported to modern times who believes that love is everything, animals clean house, and pigeons deliver flowers. Adams' wide eyed sincerity and clear as a bell singing voice help to make this performance the flawless marriage of actress and character. Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden are attractive as the single dad who Giselle falls for and her fairy tale prince who want her back. Timothy Spall provides some funny moments as the Queen's henchman and there is a brief, but fabulous scenery-chewing turn by Susan Sarandon as the Evil Queen. Tony winner Idina Menzel (WICKED) also scores as Dempsey's girlfriend (BTW, note to continuity dept: during the course of the film, we see advertisements for WICKED and for RENT, two Broadway shows supposedly running at the same time, that both starred Menzel, but I digress). The film is energetically directed by Kevin Lima and the surprisingly clever song score is provided by Alan Mencken (THE LITTLE MERMAID) and Stephen Schwartz (PIPPIN; GODSPELL). Top it off with some top-notch visual effects and cinema's most durable sidekick, Pip the Chipmunk and you have all the ingredients for a first-rate adult fairy tale that provides some big laughs in addition to the expected warm-fuzzy feelings."

","First of all, I know this comment is really late, but I'd never seen this movie before last week. Now, i just regret that I didn't go see it on the big screen when it barely came out, because this movie is just AMAZING. It is definitely one of Disney's best movies in a LONG and I mean a LONG time (none of the crap you get in most of their new movies). This movie is fun loving, family-friendly, and original. Giselle is like an awesome combination of all the Disney princesses, and the movie is pretty much the story of Cinderella and Snow White with a twist (you know, since most of it takes place in modern-day New York City) I love how they did a combination of animation and live-action, and the animated characters look sooo much like the actual actors. Amy Adams is great in this movie, they couldn't possibly have picked a better person to play the character of Giselle. I love James Marsden as Prince Edward, his character had me laughing throughout the movie. Patrick Dempsey is great as well, I love his character. The plot of the movie is great, I absolutely love it. It's a bit cliché at times, but the movie is so great it doesn't even matter. I loved the ending of the movie - everyone got their happily ever after, and I think it's just perfect that Giselle and Robert ended up together, them and Morgan made the perfect family in my opinion. Edward ended up being with Nancy (Idina Menzel), so they were happy too.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a must-see. If you are like I was and have never see this movie, go out and rent it, you won't regret it in the least. I LOVE Enchanted!"

","When two brothers decided to write a collection of simple children's tales they never thought that they would become so well-known and certainly never considered them to inspire hundreds of terrific other books, stage shows and of course films. Some of these have reverently mocked them, such as the timelessly entertaining 'Shrek' series (2001- .)'Brothers Grimm' (2002) exposed the gruesome gore hidden in these stories. But largely the most successful and perhaps the most exceptional of the lot are the marvellous array of award-winning animated classics from the legendary Walt Disney Company that initiated with the ground-breaking masterpiece 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937.) And now in Christmas 2007  nearly seven years after their final cartoon release 'The Emperor's New Groove' (2001) they've decided to come back for more with a vastly more modern creation that isn't quite as pleasurable as the others but still a success.<br/><br/>This is the charming story of another sweet, beautiful princess. Once upon a time in the faraway kingdom of Andalasia there lived a lovely young woman named Giselle (a splendid Amy Adams.) She lived in a small cottage deep in the woods with her many animal friends and every day dreamed of meeting her one true love. One day a dashing young prince named Edward (James Marsden) rode past the cottage singing a love song, Giselle rushed up to meet him and as soon as they each set eyes on one another they new that they were destined to be wed and so the wedding was instantly arranged. The word of this union soon spread throughout the land and everyone was overjoyed to hear the wonderful news, all except for Prince Edward's cruel stepmother Queen Narissa (a most wonderfully intimidating Susan Sarandon.) She knew that if her son married she would lose the crown and so banished poor Giselle to a feared place where no one ever lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>So out she pops through a manhole into the busy streets of New York. Dazed and confused, she takes shelter in the home of a placid, sensible divorce lawyer named Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his adorable little daughter Megan (Rachel Corvey) who have been at a great loss since the death of their wife and mother. Back in Andalasia Giselle's faithful friend Peppi the chipmunk (voiced by Kevin Lima and Jeff Bennett) has lead the prince through the portal and into the real world to save his true love. Now more furious than ever, the Queen sends her lovesick slave Nathaniel (a masterful Timothy Spall) to make sure that he does not find her. After he fails, she makes an incredibly dramatic and terrifying entrance into New York as well to take matters into her own hands.<br/><br/>The film's main power source  apart from its vastly compelling cast  is the delightful entertainment in watching exaggerated, unrealistic fairytale concepts being put to the test in the world of reality. This film definitely shows that although their founder is long gone and they've changed immensely over the years they still have some of the unique quality that's made them what they are today left in them."
"silverscreen888","8","0","0","31 December 2008"," Amy Adams and a Charming Fantasy; Clever Mix of Animation and Realism
","Since the later 1970s, any film made for adults has had to be a personal project, so its creators can avoid de facto censorship by corporate tsars bent instead on supplying graphic emotional and special effects cinematic graphic drugs to their target mentally teenage addicts. ""Enchanted"" is such a vision, and less surprisingly so than it is satisfying. This I say is true because of what its makers tried to do even more than how well its creators performed that intended task. The use of animation plus filmed action in the film was not unprecedented; how seamlessly the combination works therein for many viewers may be so. This sprightly tale begins in a fantasy realm, Andalasia. We are introduced to a lovely commoner destined to marry a brave and handsome prince--despite the opposition of his mother, a true witch in several degrees, and her helper. After an animated series of songs and adventures during which we learn the young woman, Giselle, can charm animals into helping her--leading to a classic Disney historical-looking sequence--she and her prince, who has rescued her from an ogre, arrive at the royal palace to be wed; but, instead, she is sent as an exile to another realm--and emerges from a manhole in New York City. There she meets a wary, bemused but honest fellow named Robert, his daughter and his mismatched fiancée, But the brave prince soon follows her to save her, accompanied by a talkative chipmunk and followed by the Queen's besmitten aide, Nathaniel, whom we are told will try to stop the royal wedding. What succeeds this engrossing beginning I say is a gradual denouement to a satisfying ending, during which Giselle learns the limits of magic and the power of realism, and Robert learns the power of magic and the limits of doubt. This charming, fast-paced delight was directed by Kevin Lima, with script credited to Bill Kelly. Seven credited producers hired Alan Menken to<br/><br/>supply clever music, and Don Burgess to supply innovative cinematography and to incorporate the animated portions. Production Designer Stuart Wurtzel and Art Director John Kasarda dealt professionally with a variety of locales, ranging from an apartment to New York offices, stores and street features to a grand ballroom and Central Park. Set Decorator George DeTitta Jr. and Costume Designer Mona May deserved plaudits for their stellar work as well. The able cast includes likable Patrick Dempsey as Robert, James Marsden as the bravura Prince, Idina Menzel as the fiancée, Timothy Spall outstanding as Nathaniel, Susan Sarandon as the wonderfully witch evil Queen, Rachel Covey as Robert's cute daughter, Elizabeth Mathis as Robert's secretary, and talented Tonya Pinkins and Isiah Whitlock Jr. as battling divorce partners. But the core of the film I suggest is Amy Adams' award-level, lovely and memorable Giselle. Watch for a remarkable action-character development crisis, and a memorable ending during which all loose ends are neatly tied up so that all concerned can live on, mostly happily ever after."

I think the latter is due to the fine acting jobs by Amy Adams (princess) and Patrick Dempsey (the lawyer she meets in New York). She's all about fantasy ideals and he's all about the real world pragmatism - and their interactions are fun to watch.

","In this fish-out-of-water Disney comedy, a cartoon princess (Amy Adams) residing in a bucolic fantasy world is sent to modern-day New York by her evil future mother-in-law, played in delightfully wicked fashion by Susan Sarandon. The princess's fiancé, Prince Edward (James Marsden) leaps into our world to rescue her. Meanwile, the princess, now flesh and blood and thoroughly lost in Manhattan, is taken in by a starchy but compassionate divorce lawyer (Pat Dempsey) who is himself divorced with a small daughter. Pretty soon, the evil queen also hits the bricks in hot pursuit of the princess. You can guess the rest. The film begins with a gorgeously animated segment that perfectly imitates the angular style of Disney's 1956 SLEEPING BEAUTY. The live action segment, which takes up most of the rest of this expensive production, never quite achieves the excitement and humor of the cartoon, and viewers are likely to get restless long before the conclusion. There are some intentionally sappy songs and a big dance number in Central Park, and I have to say the special effects throughout were top notch. While Adams as the live-action princess is no raving beauty, she brings a huge amount of energy and a sense of fun to her slightly daffy character. Disney made a very smart move in hiring a competent actress rather than a simple looker for the lead role. Another nice touch: the legendary Julie Andrews narrates. I gave the movie a fairly high rating mainly for that opening animated sequence and Adams' wonderful, wide-eyed NF."

The performance is funny, adequately over-the-top at times, serious and emotional when needed and great overall.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey, who I've always liked since movies like Scream 3 or his guest role in Once & Again, is another great casting decision. The character he plays, Robert, is just a regular guy, but he has that humanness to him, that subtlety that turns an ordinary character into a memorable one.<br/><br/>James Marsden does a very good job as Prince Edward, Timothy Spall is hilarious, and ??? is also great as Robert's daughter.

Now they take a turn poking some satirical yet affectionate fun at their own formula. The movie remembers that the heart of fantasy is for the nice character to have their happy ending, and it takes you on a great ride to get there. Amy Adams is splendid as the typical fairy tale land princess with the frilly dresses with big shoulder things (and lots of forest creature friends) getting shot through a magical portal to modern day New York. Her sweet and naive character is immediately endearing, and as she spreads her optimism, sentimentality, and good will to strangers, inspiring them all; it's really a sweet thing to see. I love the way the song in Central Park is choreographed; funny and touching all at once.

On the way to the wedding the prince's stepmother sets Giselle up and sends her to the real world - New York City where she meets Robert and Morgan...<br/><br/>The use of animation for the fairy tale world is very clever and I didn't expect that. It's just so familiar and so Disney.<br/><br/>The development is in general simple and direct, which is quite good indeed for a fairy tale. But I'm not very satisfied with the abrupt ending (maybe you can say this is what you would expect from a fairy tale: you just need a happily ever after).<br/><br/>The music is very well-written and perfect for the film. Happy working song and That's how you know are particularly funny. The singing is also great. Amy Adams's voice is great and her way of singing is quite old-fashioned but I have to say it matches the stereotype of fairy tale songs. This is a plus. James Marsden and Jon McLaughlin have also done a good job.<br/><br/>Adams's performance as a super optimistic fairy tale character is very convincing. Some people may find it a bit over but this is what the character's really like. Dempsey as a realist is not bad but the character itself is the plainest in the film. Maybe that's why they have to look for his personal charm. Marsden's funny, Pip's very funny. The most unexpected is Nathaniel. It's really interesting to see from the beginning to the end how he sees senses. Others are worth their salt.<br/><br/>Just watch it or you'll regret it. After years of fairy tales with CG we've got a 'real' good deal here. At least their music is never as great."

","First of all, I would like to say I am a 19 year old Film analysis student at University, so I know what I'm talking about. Second my 24 year old boyfriend watched this film and actually LAUGHED. He normally hates this kind of thing... And finally, I would like to add, anyone who has given this film a bad rating is a sore looser, unable to cope with the newly-refined art of Disney as they struggle to make some money in their boring lives. Now for the real review:<br/><br/>This movie is a refreshing way of re-enhancing Disney's first ever feature length film. Taking their well-loved classic 'Snow White' and melding in a mix of odd, surreal and downright scary with real backgrounds and fresh jokes simply makes this a joy to watch. The screen writing is superb, easily mixing old and new to give a fresh innovative look at the archetypal Disney movie. The acting is new and invigorating, giving a new meaning to the term 'Disney Actors' and the songs blend in so well with the whole thing it's impossible not to love them. This movie refuses to allude to Beauty and the Beast or the Little Mermaid, but instead refers the original perfection of the first ever Disney movie. This is classics brought bang up-to-date with an all new twist. Snow White at it's deepest heart, Enchanted is simply enchanting."

","I cannot believe people writing glowing reviews about this Disney picture. I found only three comments that I agree with: This picture is ridiculous. Fairy tale or not, this is for little girls not adults. Even a teenager (male of female) can see that this picture has no redeeming value. The whole story is stupid. What really got me is the dragon fell off the building??? A dragon is supposed be able to fly (duh!), if you stick to common fairy tales. And... nobody in NYC wonders why these characters are coming out of a man hole? Oh I forgot it's a fairy tale. I was so bored I almost fell asleep. The singing didn't help either. Puhlease, give me something better than this to be enchanted."
"szokia","2","6","20","6 August 2008"," Too violent for young children, no continuum.
","Not impressed with this movie at all. The storyline is basically a mish-mash of some of the old, successful Disney stories: Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and even Mary Poppins (the central park dance routine is very reminiscent of Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke and the kids dancing in the park before they jump into one of the chalk pictures on the sidewalk), and anything else you are sharp enough to detect in there. That is not the problem. In fact, that is kind of fun. Revisiting bits and pieces of our old favorites...<br/><br/>Part of the problem lies more in the cutesy, gratuitous violence that runs rampant throughout the movie, especially the ""funny"" yet ""cute"" sadistic touches. I have never even liked it when filmmakers insert the highly overdone cat screaming or dog howling in pain in the background when someone inadvertently tosses something aside and it finds its mark. What is funny about hurting an animal? Well, in Enchanted, the torturing of animals is not accidental, it's deliberate and very disturbing, to say the least. Even though it's being done to a cartoon chipmunk, that somehow does not make it any less upsetting. If I were a parent, I would not want my child watching this kind of behavior, especially since it is being characterized as ""funny"" and ""cute"". It is neither, and children should not be taught that it is.<br/><br/>I very much recommend that parents take a look at this movie themselves first, before exposing their children to it. Do not judge this movie by the cover. It is definitely not suitable for small children. In fact, I wish I hadn't seen it myself.<br/><br/>Other than that, the other part of the problem is that the whole storyline is a big piece of disorganized fluff. There is no more basis for the romance that blooms between Robert and Giselle, than there is for the one between the Prince and Giselle. And Giselle runs around risking life and limb to go chasing after her Prince, only to be completely sidetracked, once they find one another, by her ""feelings"" for Robert, who has heretofore shown little else but irritation with her. And his irritation gets magically transformed into deep love for no tangible reason whatsoever.... Fairytale, indeed! Makes no sense at all. <br/><br/>I loved Amy Adams in 'The Wedding Date'. In fact, she's the reason I wanted to see this movie too. But, sadly, not impressed here. The acting is very mehhh... The storyline struggles - a lot. And the whole package is just not what I would expect from a movie of this caliber, with these actors. Too much trying too hard. Not enough real fun. No actual substance. Saccharin as can be. By the time it was all over Amy Adams' face must have really hurt from all that forced cheery smiling. I wonder how long it took to recover muscle control after the shoot?"
"thesar-2","3","3","8","16 February 2009"," Well, that's not gonna last.
","It's official: I may not have a heart. All the way through 'Enchanted,' a movie I really wanted to like, I just found myself, perhaps heartless, thinking it was just ""okay."" Actually the other thought occurred to me that the movie, itself, lacks heart at times.<br/><br/>A great concept of a film, though not entirely original (I did like 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' oodles more) the movie starts off summing up multiple fairy tales (namely, of course, Disney cartoons) and then, as the movie promotes, shifts into the real world. One by one, every ""named"" character goes into New York City and then the movie lets the LEARNING begin!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I liked the characters in cartoonland, or Andalasia, just the way they were originally. That's their life. They're happy, they thrive, let them be. I realize the movie follows the typical American attitude: ""you need to change to our lifestyle, you need to be just like us, or you simply won't be happy until you're just as miserable as we are."" And regrettably, that is one of this movie's messages.<br/><br/>I realize I'm the one being a cynic here, but I always have felt, if you're happy and as long as it harms no other, live and let live. What was wrong with Giselle (Amy Adams) singing, loving, dancing and generally being happy with life? Why did she have to meet the Anti-Giselle, Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and why does America, er, I mean, Robert have to drag her down to his level? Funny, he's so pessimistic throughout about true love, happily ever after, that when they (PREDICTABLY) get together ""for good,"" all I could say is, ""Well, that's not gonna last.""<br/><br/>I know we're not dealing with realism here, and I went as far as to give Giselle the benefit of the doubt and thought it was plausible for her to call upon the creatures to help her clean in the real world. But, what I couldn't get past was the song/dance Central Park number. Did she control them as well? Did she feed them their lines, telepathically? Yes, I understand the art of musicals, especially Disney's musicals, but they tried so hard to make sure we know this is the real world, I figured that's the direction the movie was going. If they just wanted to make her Mary Poppins, so be it. I wouldn't have blinked when she called upon the animals or the Prince that seems to have money coming out of his pockets to suddenly buy food at will or stay in a hotel. But, that's not the direction the movie seemed to be going. ""Wake up, Sleeping Beauty; this isn't a fairy tale anymore.""<br/><br/>Okay, I'm not totally without a heart. There were a lot of scenes I really enjoyed, including Disney actually and for once, mocking its own creations, stockpiling on the advertisements and duplicating a lot of the scenes of the Disney movies we've grown up to love. I also liked some of the songs, always adore the wonderful Susan Sarandon, I loved the heart Giselle had (until she became American) and I actually did like the little chipmunk, Pip, especially how his voice vanished once in NYC. In addition, I liked the whole concept of the film, bringing the clichéd Disney cutouts to the real world and how they would really react. And despite the sometimes mixed messages, it might be pure enough for the kids, aside from the somewhat violent ending (typical closing of a Disney cartoon, but this was real life.)<br/><br/>Speaking of the finale, the movie was already longer than it needed to be, but they seemed to wrap up everything fairly quickly. I wasn't too pleased with how everything went down, including all the humans suddenly accepting everything, including one character literally jumping into Andalasia without a slight thought, changing that person's character in a heartbeat. I guess they had to just wrap it up afraid kids might not stay with the story for two hours.<br/><br/>Uh, 'Harry Potter' is over two hours and kids are on the edges of their seats every minute. Hey Disney, if you have a good enough product, you won't lose your target audience. Just have a little faith. And a little heart."

I don't know what Disney films they were trying to parody but I did not recognize any of the princesses or princes. In none of the animated features are they so ignorant and stupid. It was like they were trying to poke fun at them but they only had their own jaded views of the films in their minds without even knowing the real films well. I hope this is the last of the Disney ""dark years"" films where it was uncool to sing and be idealistic. If you think the other animated features were all corny and bad then you will love this Shrek-esqe take on them. If you know the films avoid this lame duck.

","Outstanding film, and Amy Adams was perfect. The songs she sang were incredible. <br/><br/>The horrible song by Underwood that ended the film nearly ruined my experience, however. Why couldn't they have given Amy another fantastic, memorable song to sing, instead of some awful country-pop song?<br/><br/>One huge mistake: at the ball, the ""King's Waltz"" is not a waltz at all. How could these obviously talented composers have made such a boner? About halfway through, they play a bunch of eighth notes in groups of three, probably in 12/8 time, to sort of make it sound like a waltz, but we're not fooled! It sounded like a two step, and the dancers were all dancing two step dances, so it obviously wasn't enough of a waltz to dance a waltz to!! Plus, that song is almost as bad as the schmaltzy outro song."
"jillk60517","7","2","5","9 December 2007"," One reluctant thumb up
","I love Patrick Dempsey so I wanted this movie to be great. It just wasn't. The beginning was awkwardly silly (intentionally?) - the animated portion could have used better animation technology. The animation was totally yesterday. If it was supposed to feel like the old Cinderella , it did, but I want sophisticated animation not old flat animation. I felt no chemistry between Giselle & Dempsey and the writing lacked any decent dialogue. I read that some people laughed through the whole thing...at what? I read that there was adult humor...not really. Characters were dull, the story lines undeveloped (the relationship between the queen and her servant, what happened to Dempsey's ex? why did they introduce a gay guy at the apt. door?...) Underwhelming & disappointing."
"Doylenf","8","2","5","28 November 2007"," Probably the year's most enchanting romantic comedy...
","What the world really needs in 2007 are more films with the ageless charm and wit of ENCHANTED. It's priceless entertainment from the Disney studios, providing plenty of chuckles and downright laughter as PATRICK DEMPSEY, AMY ADAMS, JAMES MARSDEN and SUSAN SARANDON go through the paces of their fairy-tale roles. What helps immeasurably is that the witty script has been given a sumptuous look in both the animated and real-life scenes and the musical score is fresh and appropriate, if not a bit familiar in that it seems to be borrowing heavily from other Disney films--most of the time intentionally so.<br/><br/>The script has the animated Giselle, a princess, being banished from the palace when her beauty surpasses that of Queen Narissa (SUSAN SARANDON). She exiles her to an existence in hell--make that New York City. Once in the city, after climbing out of a manhole cover in full princess regalia, the lovely princess (AMY ADAMS in a cheerfully over the top performance), runs into all sorts of predicaments because she acts like someone who ""just escaped from a Hallmark card"", according to the lawyer (PATRICK DEMPSEY) who gives her shelter for the night but soon finds himself forming a romantic attachment to her.<br/><br/>It moves along at a brisk pace, is stunning to watch because the hand drawn animation is so beautifully rendered, and is fun all the way, with everyone giving their own brand of exuberance to the acting.<br/><br/>SUSAN SARANDON is extremely effective as The Wicked Queen and her make-up as the old hag deserves an Oscar. JAMES MARSDEN has all the physical requirements for his role as Prince Edward and tops that with a performance modeled after the vain Gaston from ""Beauty and the Beast"".<br/><br/>There's no shortage of romantic chemistry between PATRICK DEMPSEY and AMY ADAMS in the leads, evident from their first awkward encounter to the final fadeout.<br/><br/>Too bad Hollywood isn't capable of churning out more films like this one, as solid a romantic fantasy as anyone could wish for with lots of sly fun at the expense of other Disney classics and enough old-fashioned charm to satisfy adults and children."
"keayantz","4","6","26","4 December 2007"," Not a Good TIme Except for the Chipmunk.
","I guess, right from the outset I have to say that I'm not a Disney fan. Neither the man nor the production company has ever appealed to me. I suppose it is largely Walt Disney's involvement with the Nazi's and his production company's persistent racism and sexism that has always soured my viewing experiences.<br/><br/>I haven't seen a Disney film in awhile. Enchanted was the first in maybe 4 or 5 years. It makes me sad to say that even many years after Disney's death the company still releases films that perpetuate racist and sexist stereotypes. Sure, this film isn't as overt as other films but sometimes subtle racism is worse than overt racism.<br/><br/>To give an example of what I'm talking about: The film is divided in to essentially two parts. A ""fantasy"" world and the ""real"" world. In the fantasy world Prince Edward slays trolls for amusement. When he enters the real world he ""slays"" a bus that is being driven by an African-American woman who is treated not overtly but subtly by the prince and the film makers as a monster or troll that is in need of slaying.<br/><br/>Anyways, I don't want this to be overly long as I need to get some sleep but I'd like to say other than the racist undertones the film is just bad as far as film making goes. At the end of the film, for example, the evil witch is trying to prevent Giselle from marrying her step-son, the prince, by killing her and even when she decides she doesn't want to marry the prince anymore and instead loves Robert (from the real world)the evil with still tries to kill her. For what purpose? Giselle already isn't going to marry your step-son. It's just pointless. the film goes on for at least another 20 minutes after this for no reason. I mean, I suppose there needs to be action but at least it should make sense.<br/><br/>I would stay away from this movie if you are over the age of 14. I wouldn't take my kids to it if I had any. All in all not a good time except for the chipmunk."
"thoroughbredsrockmysox","3","5","21","31 December 2007"," Not all it's cracked up to be

Sadly, it is anything but enchanting. The shining moments stand with the little girl Morgan and the chimpmunk Pip. If they were to be taken out of the movie, there would be nothing. The majority of the humor is on a level that younger children will not understand, while the adults sitting through the movie will be ready to barf. I suppose that you could compare it to the Teletubby's but I'm not sure that is fare to them. All in all, this is a NO GO film."

","I really liked the look of this Disney film because it was essentially sending up the traditions they themselves have created over the years, mainly in making fairytale based films, so I watched, from director Kevin Lima (A Goofy Movie, Tarzan, 102 Dalmatians). Basically, once upon a time in the animated fairytale kingdom of Andalasia, Giselle (Doubt's Golden Globe and National Movie Award nominated Amy Adams) is the beautiful maiden living in the forest cottage waiting for her prince charming to come along. Prince Edward (James Marsden) is the one who hears her singing, and when they meet they instantly fall in love and are to be married the next day and have a happily ever after. However her evil stepmother Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) has been watching over in displeasure and doesn't her son Edward marrying her, so she disguises herself as an old hag and lures her to the magical well where she is pushed in. She tumbles into a new world where she changes from animated into a real life character, and in this world apparently no-one can truly fall in love, there is no fairytale magic and there are no happy endings, it is present day New York. She soon meets hardened but friendly divorce lawyer Robert Philip (National Movie Award nominated Patrick Dempsey) and his little daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey), who insists he lets her stay with them until she can get back to where she belongs and her ""true love"". While Giselle keeps acting like she is still a fairytale, including getting the animals of the city to do the cleaning and dress making, such as pigeons, rats and cockroaches, Prince Edward has found his way into the city as well. The Queen wants to make sure that the ""happy couple"" won't find each other, so she sends henchman Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) into the real world with a poison apple to put Giselle into the deadly sleeping death. Giselle's chipmunk friend Pip (Lima himself) is also there, unable speak coherently like he could in Andalasia (voiced by Jeff Bennett), so he can't be understood properly, especially by the daft prince. Robert may be engaged to Nancy Tremaine (Idina Menzel), who is misreading the situation between him and Giselle, but they spend more time together, she discovers real life has many more complications, especially in finding true love, he is finding her optimism and idealism affectionate. Edward eventually finds Giselle in the apartment she is living in with Robert, and while he is eager to get back to Andalsia with his bride, she is not so much, learning how to really fall in love she says they should have a date. Robert with Nancy, and Giselle with Edward, they all see the advertisement for the King's and Queen's Ball, and there is the part where they swap partners and Giselle realise her true love is actually with Robert. They do not know that because Nathaniel failed three times to kill the princess, she has come to the real world herself, disguised herself as the old hag once again, and tempts Giselle with the poison apple. Confessing the evil plot and going against the Queen, who he has realised is truly evil, Nathaniel says that true love's kiss is what can save her before the strike of midnight, but it fails for Edward. Robert kisses her just in time, and the spell is broken, and that is when Narissa makes her way out, turns into a giant dragon and takes Robert hostage to the top off the roof. In the end, with the help of Pip, the Queen falls to her death, Giselle saves Robert, and meeting each other and being attracted Edward and Nancy go back to animated Andalasia to marry, while Giselle, Robert and Morgan are a happy family. Narrated by Dame Julie Andrews. Adams is enchanting as the naive but adorable fish out of water princess, Dempsey is likable, Sarandon looks like she is having fun, the animation at the beginning, end and in between is really good, the computer effects do their part, and the story is really fun viewing, with many great jokes about fairytale traditions, a must see family part-animated romantic comedy fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Happy Working Song"", Best Song for ""So Close"" and Best Song for ""That's How You Know"" (it was also nominated the Golden Globe) (no wonder Take That's ""Rule The World"" in Stardust wasn't considered, three songs!), and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Musical. Very good!"
"peisenmann","5","1","2","3 December 2010"," Starts off with promise, but falls short with the ending
","My review is very full of spoilers for those that haven't seen it.<br/><br/>The movie starts out like a typical Disney princess tale, but quickly takes an interesting twist for a Disney movie - jumping to live action. And not just any live action, gritty New York. I'm hooked so far, fish-out-of-water, I'm buying it.<br/><br/>We meet the incredibly self-absorbed Patrick Dempsey, and Amy Adams learns what life is like in the real world. It's growth; it's interesting. Also, I loved the musical number ""That's How You Know"".<br/><br/>Skip to the end. Amy Adams is now in love with Patrick Dempsey, and the other two (Nancy and Edward, I believe) run off together. This ending seems to work for most people, I guess, considering the 7.5 rating and the many 10 star reviews I saw at a glance. It doesn't really work for me, however.<br/><br/>What's the moral of the story here? Make sure you know who you get to know the person before falling in love with them? I can work with that, but Amy's character and the Edward character believed they were in true love before coming to the real world, and then it turns out they weren't really in love at all. Does that mean I need to go back and reevaluate all Disney movies? How well do any of the princesses know their princes? What this movie says to me is that ""Happily Ever After"" is a sham for people who aren't especially self-aware. Prince Charmings are a load of fictional baloney not to be believed in. You should settle for the sad, angry, jaded, single father because true love is a myth. It's just short of retracting every Disney princess movie.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I just can't get into that. Little girls shouldn't aspire to be princesses? You can't live the dream because dreams aren't real? Yes, real life can be gritty and cold, and sometimes in life people are forced to settle. Now, not only does a Disney princess not get the Prince, but she shouldn't even want him anyway."

Unfortunately, I could only last about forty minutes before I had to turn it off.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is hilarious. The song sequences were so over-the-top, a great parody of the classic princesses. In addition, Giselle's reaction to New York City is pretty funny too.<br/><br/>However, as soon as the lawyer and his daughter were introduced into the movie, things went downhill quickly. The lawyer was just so unlikable, and his daughter was annoyingly unrealistic. In addition, Giselle's antics went from being cute to annoying. (I think the scene that really put me off was when she drank out of an aquarium and spit out a beta fish... Nasty stuff.) It's a shame, because the premise of the movie seemed so good.

","This is a perfect example of how CGI, a technique that today is often overused just to impress, can actually enhance a story. I really enjoyed the film, but what made it for me was the visual effects. I had to keep reminding myself that Pip was a CGI creation and not a real chipmunk--he looked so real. And it was only after the movie was over that I realized ditto for the dragon at the end. By that time I had completely suspended my disbelief and simply thought, hey, a dragon. It was also nostalgic to see the older Disney animation at the beginning, which at first was a shock, being used to the more sophisticated methods of today.

"Special-K88","Null","1","2","25 March 2008"," a delight
","Sweet, charming Disney fairy tale about a wide-eyed, warmhearted damsel (a radiant Adams) who's in line to marry the handsome prince. Unfortunately his wicked stepmother is fiercely reluctant to relinquish her crown, and banishes the poor girl to the 'real world' where there are no happy endings. Alone in modern-day Manhattan, she meets a cynical lawyer and single father, himself engaged, then brightens up his life and for the first time questions the very meaning and nature of love. It's not difficult to guess what happens next, but the film is a wonderful mix of creative animation and live-action, with great songs, in-jokes, an ideal cast, and an irresistibly joyful feel throughout. Adams shines—both literally and metaphorically—and Dempsey is a good fit for the leading man. ***"

","Some would call me a bit cheap. On a whim I rented this movie expecting to feel disappointed in the first minute. Boy was I surprised to find myself buying this movie the next day. With some great performances on the actors behalf and a great choice in music this movie was just great on every level. Women already in love with Patrick Dempsey aren't disappointed in his appearance either. Not only him but Amy Adams was fantastic, as well as the little girl that played Robert's daughter (pardon me for not recalling her name). The music was of course fantastic. I found myself spending countless ours downloading the beautiful songs featured in this film. At 15 years old I already know that I will be buying this film to share with my children as I grow older. Those who don't believe they are too ""mature"" to see it are sure to feel the same way. One of the best Disney films ever."
"ceallaig-1","10","1","2","21 March 2008"," Great antidote to the blues!
","I had just watched Atonement, and desperately needed a 'happy' fix, so I was glad this came in the mail for me. Absolutely delighted! The songs are good (and well sung), the story is cute (something of a reverse gender take on Miracle on 34th Street), and everyone, but EVERYONE, gets a happy ending! It's worth the price of admission just for James Marsden's Edward, gloriously over the top here as the handsome prince who finds his true love, though not in the way one might expect (this was very nice, as the man seems to have spent a chunk of his career being the guy that didn't get the girl). And that guy has a serious set of pipes! Patrick Dempsey works beautifully as Robert, the very practical man who has lost faith in love and magic discovering it all over again (or perhaps for the first time). Idina Menzel, for my money one of the most gorgeous women on the planet, shines as Nancy, who really really would like to be someone's princess. And Amy Adams (who is making me crazy because she reminds me very much of someone here, and can't think who -- a little Sandy Duncan, perhaps?) pulls out all the adorable stops as Giselle.<br/><br/>Special kudos to a regally witchy Susan Sarandon channeling Maleficent, and to Timothy Spall's lovelorn henchman. And yes, that is the wonderful Julie Andrews narrating.<br/><br/>It works as both a loving homage to and a hilarious parody of all the classic Disney fairy tales, with some nifty special effects thrown in. If you're in need of an emotional pick me up, you can't do much better than this one."
"countvonbarron","Null","1","2","20 March 2008"," Amy Adams- a star is born.
","2 words make ""Enchanted"" magical. Amy Adams. I'm 41 years old a Sergeant in the army. I saw this movie believe it or not in Iraq at Camp Anaconda one of the largest bases in the country. There is a movie theater on post there that shows first run films. What an absolute joy it was to see an audience of hardened combat veterans laughing with joy at the antics of the chipmunk. Amy Adams was a revelation. Following up her Oscar nominated performance in Junebug she proves herself to be a comedic actress of the highest tier. In my opinion the only reason she didn't get another Oscar nomination for her performance was because this was a kids movie. Remember her name. We'll be seeing a lot of her in the years to come. The hardest thing for any actor to do is to take a fantasy character and make them believable. Adams owned this role. In fact I can give her no higher praise than to say that there is not an actress out there who could have played this role better. She gave one of the years best performances-comedy or drama. She is radiant and she makes the movie. See it if for no other reason than her performance. She makes the movie live up to it's title."
"dgg32","9","1","2","20 March 2008"," Amy Adams shines totally!!
","Disney's Production is always a guaranty for quality. That fairy atmosphere, music with childish spirit. It is really a wonderful experience watching this film. I kept telling myself in the watching that I am enjoying a cheerful film.<br/><br/>Amy Adams sparkles. Her appearance is so sunny. All three of her dresses are masterpiece, elegant, pretty and unique. Without those fairy songs, Giselle would lose at least half of her charm. But it fortunately isn't the truth! The musical pieces are carefully written, they reminds me of another Disney's production: The parent trap, also having first-class music. Although Amy couldn't sing ""in situ""(obviously she acted soundless in scenes and her song voice was post-added.), but it doesn't burden that much. I can still lose myself deeply in her musical world.<br/><br/>By the way, the little Morgen Rachel also wins her own credit. Such a sweet girl (if I am allowed to say, twice so sweet as Giselle).<br/><br/>Finally, the whole film is an unforgettable sensation. I am always looking forward Disney's works. Keep on!"

","I saw this film tonight, and I have to admit, I totally loved it! Disney finally made a good movie, the first in several years. It is a loving tribute to the classic animated Disney movies, particularly the ones made from 1937-1959 and 1989-1999. If you are a big fan of those movies, you will love pointing out the little references they made to those films here (a pizzeria is called the ""Bella Notte Restaurant,"" Robert Phillip's ball outfit resembling the Beast's suit) The animation seen at the beginning and the end, though it was obviously outsourced, was very good. It looked like classic Disney at its best! The whole plot with Giselle and Edward not understanding the harsh reality of modern New York City actually made for an interesting plot. My favorite part was when Giselle sang out the apartment window and attracted the pigeons, cockroaches, rats and other NYC pest animals to help tidy up the house ala ""Snow White!"" The chipmunk was rather amusing when he was in the real world, with his unintelligible high-pitched ""real world"" voice and pantomime. Overall, I highly recommend this film if you absolutely love the great animated Walt Disney Classics!"

I loved everything about this film. This is not a musical but has some singing in it and I usually hate that, but it was just hilarious how it was done. The idea of the Giselle acting like a Disney princess in New York was just so funny. I really embarrassed myself laughing out loud, glad there was only 8 other people in the cinema. Im not really a romantic either but this film was so romantic i fell for it and prayed that they got together at the end. The animals were cute, the story was sweet and it all worked beautifully.

","I really have to say this is one of the best movies I ever seen with a mixed up fairytale and the truth of romance. I also could say it's one of the best movies I've seen this year but I was not very joyed that there was a bit too much of talking through out the film and yet the prince in tights should of anyway married the princess he wanted. I liked most of the humor of the film especially with the prince in tights, the chipmunk and the of course the bride. the ending however was a bit silly due to the evil queen dying to easily and the princess that prince Edward married in the end brought her phone to the animated world. there was always a strong message in the film that you have let the person you are falling in love with let them know you actually love that person. This is almost my second favorite movie of the year and hopefully there will be more of these fine romance movies coming out soon. 10/10"

","What can I say about this movie other than - see it! The lead actress, Amy Adams, is wonderful in every aspect of her performance, and is expertly supported by all other actors - no one fails to deliver in this movie. Even the chipmunk is some of the best and funniest work I have ever seen - and had the entire theatre in hysterics! The movie has genuine heart, and never once does it fall into the crassness often associated with a parody - in fact, Enchanted should not even be classified as a parody of old Disney movies. It is a breath of fresh air which has something for all ages, both male and female. The only minor issue for me was to do with the ending which gave the impression that the writers felt as if they needed to give symbolism for Giselle having changed her ways (by giving her a very plain, and disappointing, balldress and hairstyle to the ball) - I felt as if the audience was letdown by not seeing Giselle in an absolutely breathtaking ballgown. At any rate, the film deserves a full 10/10 and has countless moments you will want to see over and over again!"

","Well what can I say? It was so nice to see a fairytale again (a recent cinematic one I mean)! I went to see ""Enchanted"" at the Odeon Cinema in Hereford and it was just spectacular! It was such a gripping, outstanding concept for a cartoon Fairytale land and the real world to furiously collide (with the help of amazing trick photography). I saw it with my family to see it this afternoon after we had all made up from a row that was just SCOLDING and do you know what? It cheered up all of us not just through the cool comedy but just by looking at ""Enchanted"" - it is beautiful! I was so pleased that for once in this modern spunky era they used cartoons rather than CGI; they are filled with so much more dedication! ""Enchanted"" provides us with a fantastical insight on just how different those two worlds are! Giselle is banished from her home and doesn't know how to live life as a proper human being or how to behave in societies such as New York City. But that's not the only thing Giselle is faced with - she also must choose between two men who are both simply adorable; a price or a New York citizen (with a small 6-year-old child). Although the end was quite dramatic and it may not agree with young children, I, being 17, didn't find it at all scary but full of effective adventure so, for me at least, it was increasingly exciting! It was certified PG but I think the classification U would've suited this spellbinding movie better! I recommend it to families everywhere!"
"Jenica_Wood","10","1","2","28 December 2007"," Simply enchanting...
","Enchanted was, I could say, one of the best movies of 2007. It had all the right elements; a simple yet enthralling plot, lovable yet realistic characters, and a moving score. Knowing that the main character was a Disney Princess, I was expecting an over the top, cheesy performance, but instead I found a down-to-earth, touching performance given by Amy Adams, who was absolutely brilliant in all her princess glory. She hit all the right notes in her songs as well as in her comedic timing. Patrick Dempsey, who plays Robert was also great in his realistic portrayal of a divorce lawyer who incidentally falls head over heels for a Disney Princess (later in the movie). Enchanted isn't just about your run-of-the-mill Damsel in Distress and her Heroic Prince Charming (in fact there is a scene that ironically parodies this), it's about love, true love; in that it comes at a price and that not everything ends in ""Happily ever after"" just like they do in fairy tales."
"tearjerker08","8","1","2","23 December 2007"," Charming Marriage of Classic and Classless
","A perfect marriage of Walt Disney nostalgia, and the ""real"" modern world that we're more accustomed to. Gisele, a fair maiden living in a clichéd cartoon world where her best friends are a slew of woodland creatures who help her clean and get dressed, and sing in harmony while she sings of her dreams to kiss her Prince Charming she has yet to meet. By the end of the catchy but diddy she's met that man a stereotypical, handsome, self assured pretty boy, Prince Edward. After just meeting in cartoon fashion they are to be married the next day, but Edward's stepmother objects, because she will lose her throne if her son should marry. So she disguises her self as a familiar witch with an affinity for poisoned apples and pushes Gisele down a wishing well sending her in a whirlwind, in to the New York sewers. A realist single dad about to get engaged, divorce lawyer soon finds himself aiding her, and trying to make some sense of her outlandish outfit and attitudes about true love's kiss, rats, and dress making, but before he knows it she's shown him that maybe their worlds aren't as different as he thinks. Adams is incredibly sweet and enchanting as Gisele. From cartoon to New York City streets, she is an absolute embodiment of a fairy tale princess right in front of our eyes. James Marsden is also right out of a Walt Disney classic with his charming, ego-centric, swagger as the prince of every little girl's dreams. Patrick Dempsey might be slightly miscast in the role of the realist lawyer, but it doesn't hurt the film any. The singing is pitch perfect to match the great songs. It'll blow you away to find Amy Adams does her own singing."

"n-mo","8","1","2","22 December 2007"," Insipid meets cynical
","""Enchanted"" is a parody in the true sense of the word. Too many parodies these days ruin the fun with either mocking or filth (see ""Scary Movie""), but ""Enchanted"" works because it stays true to the Disney fairy tale genre while exposing said genre's more ridiculous edges to the harsh reality of life in that physically and psychologically roughest of world cities, New York. It tells us that, as any adult knows, real life is nothing like a Disney movie, but even at their most insipidly idyllic moments, they can provide just enough brightness to lift our spirits.<br/><br/>And in maintaining the integrity of the genre it satirizes, ""Enchanted"" turns out some amazingly strong characters (including, surprisingly, Pip the chipmunk). In a weaker take, a spoofed Disney Princess could easily be some stupid, slutty bimbo, but Amy Adams's Giselle is genuinely deep and good-hearted. Her idyllic nature is tested in a hostile environment, and she never loses her sweetness or musicality. She's an inspiration, and a beautiful thing to behold for single guys like me.<br/><br/>So naturally I sympathized with Patrick Dempsey's Robert. He's straight-laced, hard-working, caring of his daughter Morgan--and rather cynical. He does his best to steer Morgan away from the world of fantasy-princess literature that would give her unrealistic hopes--and just when they needs it the most, this family is jerked out of his bleak pessimism and finds a world of sweetness and light.<br/><br/>""Enchanted"" is more than a satire of or tribute to the fairy-tale genre. It is a statement about idealism versus realism, optimism versus pessimism, naïveté versus cynicism. The real world is neither ideal nor hell; the real world is harsh but there is hope for the future; and neither Pollyanna's curiosity nor the pride of knowing too much will move us forward. ""Enchanted"" is about Giselle and Robert moving from these laughable extremes, so characteristic of most Hollywood cinema, to a happy equilibrium, a much-welcomed respite.<br/><br/>I have scarcely touched on the visuals--computer animation is by now completely non-offensive and the film takes full advantage of this. So, too, do they capture the very best neo-Gothic and Classical architecture in New York City. The whole film is eye candy, an all-around inspiration."

This film is simply enchanted (as you may have worked out from the title).<br/><br/>Starting as a cartoon fairy story, a prince, the son of an evil queen who does not want anyone to take over her throne, rides into the forest to hunt for trolls and hears a beautiful voice in the forest. He finds a young girl and immediately decides to marry her the next day. Before they marry, an old crone takes the girl (who is Giselle) to a well and tells Giselle to wish for whatever she wants. The well is very large and deep and while she is on the very edge, the old crone pushes her and she falls down, down, until she finds herself in New York!<br/><br/>Good for fairy-tale lovers of any age and for people who also like to have laughs in Disney princess films, this is the film for you.<br/><br/>Enjoy ""Enchanted""! :-)"

","As someone who was a young girl during the heyday of ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Aladdin"", I have a soft spot for the type of movie that the beginning of ""Enchanted"" looks like. As someone who grew from a young girl to an adult watching the likes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (the TV show, not the movie) and reading ""Wicked"", I also have a soft spot for movies, books, whatever that are willing to change the formula. So it's only natural that I really enjoyed ""Enchanted"".<br/><br/>The story is a smart one that plays on fairy tale archetypes, showing how dusty some of them are, like the whole meeting and marrying in what seems like a day to live happily ever. It also shows how life might be a little better if we took some lessons from the fairy tales when it comes to love, at least in our declarations of it.<br/><br/>Some have been unhappy with the story that Narissa (Susan Sarandon) has, but there's only so much film that can be made and since this is a movie for children, there has to be something that's black and white.<br/><br/>The performance that sticks out the most is Amy Adams. Every note is pitch perfect. She never plays Giselle with a knowing wink to the audience. She IS a princess come to life, until she's been in the world enough to move into that 3rd dimension character-wise.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable movie for everyone, well except for young boys who don't like princess-y stuff."
"lmitrani","9","1","2","16 December 2007"," Hugely Entertaining Fantasy with Love Lessons for All of Us
","I have another movie to recommend; it's title, Enchanted, describes how I felt about it. <br/><br/>When I entered the theater, I thought I made a mistake. This was a Disney movie, and many in the audience were kids. The opening scenes further reinforced my mistake, since all I saw were animated, cartoon characters.<br/><br/>But 10 minutes later, a dramatic turn takes place. The cartoon princess-to-be has her storybook romance with Prince Charming (the animated kind) derailed as she's catapulted into New York's Times Square, where she emerges from a manhole and is surrounded by real people. Much later, Prince Charming leaves Fantasyland and comes to New York to claim his bride. Are you still with me? This being a romantic comedy, here's where the complications come in. <br/><br/>Before the Prince arrives in New York, Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) has met a handsome, engaged lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) with an adorable six-year old daughter. Add the lawyer's girlfriend to the mix, and you have your basic story. Let it develop at its own pace, and don't prejudge its uniqueness. I urge you to accept the fantasy premise of animated characters and humans interacting, and just follow the enchanting and refreshing story. (The last films I saw involving human-cartoon interaction were the 1988 Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and last year's Pan's Labyrinth, award winners in several categories.) This is a great ""date movie,"" since all aspects of relationships are discussed: commitment, dating, fidelity, jealousy, infatuation, serendipity, accepting imperfections, and even questioning if Prince Charming is indeed the best candidate for ""happily ever after."" What stands out most is dialog about relationships and what's meaningful. <br/><br/>One would need to be hard-hearted not to appreciate fantasy Princess Giselle, who is described as a ""Hallmark Card brought to life,"" and her gallant Prince Charming (James Marsden), who is no shoo-in to win her heart. Guys can be reassured that if even Prince Charming has romantic barriers to surmount, it's even harder for us. Women might recognize that someone other than that Prince may be a better choice. <br/><br/>As the story unfolds, the characters switch roles; animated ones develop human qualities, and vice-versa. All four protagonists, or five counting the six-year old, are likable. Trust me on this one. Don't be afraid to shed a tear. This movie has been #1 at the box-office, and received great reviews. <br/><br/>Enchanted features many other audience-pleasing elements like special effects, a Cinderella scene, villains, two songs, waltz dancing at a Ball, elaborate costumes, a King-Kong like rescue from a skyscraper and wonderful scenes from New York City's Central Park, the new Time-Warner Complex and Times Square. There's also a surprise ending.<br/><br/>The best-known cast member is Susan Sarandon, playing the mother witch of the Prince. However, the cast is well suited for their parts. See the film, and give me your feedback. <br/><br/>I did not make a mistake in seeing this after all. It's more than a kid's film, despite the Disney animation. And shouldn't all romances include some stardust?"

","OK, how do I start. This movie is corny, in fact it takes the word corny to a whole new level, It is also kinda predictable, from the very beginning you kinda know with whom she's gonna end. But I don't know if its the holiday season or what but I really enjoy this movie. It is a very fine parody of all Disney movies with a princess as a main character. The story is good and entertaining. Giselle a young girl who is waiting for his prince for the first love kiss and live happily ever after when the evil queen/witch send her to an unknown place to her, New York city. It has its funny moments and some musical ones like in all Disney movies. The fx are very good, specially when Susan Sarandon's character turns into a dragon. The cast is very good, Amy Adams in a cute and tender role that you will finish loving her or hating her, James Marsden as the typical and innocent fairy tale prince, Susan Sarandon is excellent as the evil queen/witch and women will love Patrick Dempsey with this performance that fits him really well. In conclusion, If you don't like this type of movies you will get annoyed very soon, if you are the corny type of people, you definitely will love it. For me, yes it was corny and kinda foolish but also I think its worthy to give it a chance to watch it with the family and spend an enjoyable and entertaining moment."

","The first thing I saw about Enchanted was at Euro Disney, Paris. I thought I'd check it out when I come back home. And I did. I visited Disney's site about the movie and here you can see some highlights of the movie including the ""that's how you know""-song in Central Park. I saw the trailer and this song and I was able to tell I'd like this movie. Having to wait several weeks to see, it was only yesterday I could make it to the theater to see movie. Still I wasn't to know what was coming.<br/><br/>The movie turned out to be funnier and more romantic than I expected it be.I won't tell you the whole story because it has been done several times already. The animated part was better than I expected. When Giselle arrives in New York, the immense wedding dress she wearing gives her a lot of trouble, laughs all around here. The dresses she made were quite beautiful, my favorite was the flower dress. During the movie I felt a switch from pure comedy to more romantic comedy. The most romantic part was the dance and all comes to a happy ending, when the evil queen Narissa felt from the tower. She is one of the most weird looking dragons I saw on movie screens. <br/><br/>The movie was over before I realized it and this means a big deal, I guess. Amy Adams makes the movie as Giselle, before I saw the movie I doubted if I would like her, but I totally fell for her portrayal of Giselle. She totally was a fairy tale princess. Patrick Dempsey was likable as divorce lawyer Robert, Timothy Spall did a fine job as Nathaniel. James Marsden did an excellent job in portraying the cocky prince Edward.(one of the finest moments of the movie are coming on his account) The chipmunk was lovable and steals the show a couple of laughable moments. Susan Sarandon makes a fine evil queen but has too little screen time. The songs and music deserve some special attention. The songs are typical Disney songs and especially the ""That's how you know""-song i'll never forget. Remembering the scene, it makes me laugh. ""So close"" is another beautiful song. The other Disney songs are quite lovable and the happy working song is quite funny, seeing the scene before you. <br/><br/>So Disney poking a little fun out their own movies is quite endearing to see and it makes the best Disney movie in years. It is more of an homage. This movie is definitely worth a visit or two. Go and see it!"
"fantasyescapist","Null","1","2","14 December 2007"," Enchanting Disney fantasy rom com that's good but not great
","Just seen this today at 3pm, and I left with smile on my face and a light, bouncy feeling after seeing it.<br/><br/>It starts with traditional 2D animation with our heroine - a new Disney princess Giselle who falls in love(as they do) with Prince Edward. Things are going well, until, on her wedding day, she's pushed down a wishing well by Edward's evil mother, Queen Narissa.<br/><br/>So she appears, in our world, as a real-life version, completely clueless to reality when she comes from a place where everything's happy and in song. Luckily for her, she is offered a place to stay reluctantly by divorce lawyer Robert. <br/><br/>The few songs sang by Giselle in this: a main, big Bollywood-looking scene, with a memorable stuck-in-your-head classic Disney songs, like That's How You Know, that could've easily have come from The Little Mermaid soundtrack, and Happy Working Song is obviously inspired by Whistle While You Work from Snow White.<br/><br/>I have to say, Amy Adams(Giselle) does the princess personality so well, it's excellent and very believable. I didn't even know she could sing! James Mardsen, as her Prince Edward is also quite good and funny as the empty-headed and handsome man searching New York for her, and Patrick Dempsey plays the cynical lawyer alright too. I especially liked how Susan Sarandon relishes the role of the villain Queen Narissa, but she was badly underused and most her plans were non-threatening and uninspiring.<br/><br/>Special effects wise, it very good. I really liked the scene where she's changing to 3D form in-between Andalasia and our world - it's impressive, with all the stars and stuff. During the Happy Little Working song number, the animals look quite realistic, and a CGI Pip the chipmunk looks good as well. The effects in the climax could've been better though, as it did look cartoonish(maybe that's the point?), and no where near as scary as it could've been I though. The makeup too(particularly for Queen Narissa nearer the ending when she tempts Giselle) was jaw dropping - seriously, this should win awards just for that alone. I loved the various costumes Giselle wore in New York.<br/><br/>There are references to other Disney princess films(Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella etc) and a climax that fans of those Disney films will be familiar with. Sure, I thought they could've been a lot more peril during the showdown between good and evil, though as that was a bit disappointing. <br/><br/>It's all together a good family film with some few funny moments and a homage and part spoof to Disney if somewhat cheesy in places and lacks the wit that would've made it better. Mum was afraid I'd taken her to see 'rubbish', when I assured her I hadn't, then she leans over after the first 20 mins in to say ""I was wrong - this is good ... very good, actually"" so she loved it more than I did. Good, but not great to me."

","Last night me and my Dad went to the opening night of this movie. The cinema wasn't loaded so my expectations weren't quite high. But from the minute the movie started, I laughed and felt great! Disney has made an effort in this movie, to show the world they know their movies are supersweet and always have a happy ending. The movie contains a lot of resemblance with lots of Disney movies, ranging from Snow White to Cinderella and all in between. Not to mention that the star in the movie looks like an actual Disney cartoon.<br/><br/>The music is addictive, the jokes are to be liked by both kids and adults and the atmosphere is just great. I can't imagine anyone not liking this film and not being happy when the end title appears. I felt like a little girl when I got out of the cinema, and I know a lot of girls there felt the same way.<br/><br/>Plus, Patrick Dempsey plays a great character rather then being total eye-candy (which he is, but that's not his role) like in G.A.<br/><br/>So please, go and watch this movie. It'll make you laugh, tingle and feel utterly romantic. A must-see, without any doubt."
"Vivichan","10","1","2","9 December 2007"," So Wonderful
","I didn't have a clue what a treat I was in for. I thought it'd be a corny movie,gimmicky. Fairytale meets real life. I was so wrong. It's like the same old fairy tale but it has some twists to it. It's a really uplifting family film. It's a feel-good movie. It started out coming off as corny to me, but as it went along I really got into it. I suppose that's the way it was for the main character, a New Yorker, meeting the princess too. You start out as skeptical, but it just draws you in as you go, like the princess drew him in. It really is a wonderful movie. The end, I couldn't help but cry. I mean, it reminded me that even in reality, there can be a happy ending for everyone. Oh, keep an ear out for some songs from the Disney classics popping up throughout the movie. I recall a melody from the Little Mermaid during the fish tank scene. <br/><br/>Wow, just when you thought all that good old Disney magic might have been used up with all the old classic fairy tales. Not quite just yet. Good Job Disney."
"SiriusPotterFan1","7","1","2","9 December 2007"," Funny in a Bizarre Way
","This was a funny movie because it was so lame, which I think was what they were going for. It was cliché and predictable, but had some very funny moments. Good acting for the most part, but of course there were some things I would change. Some of the songs were admittedly catchy and it had good singing. Perfect if you are under 10.<br/><br/>The kids will go crazy for it and the adults will have a good few laughs too, as there are some jokes directed towards adults. Morgan Philip: Remember not to put too much makeup or the boys may get the wrong idea. They are only after one thing. Giselle: What's that? Morgan Philip: I don't know. They won't tell me. That would be one of them. Of course, there are some points where you'd remember, ""Oh, yeah, I remember when I thought like that"" and it will put you in a childish mood. I don't think you'd be wasting your money if you saw this, it was decent. Not the best, like the classics, but admittedly funny and good."

Loved the line and scene when she tells Giselle that if you can't find a fairy godmother, then the credit card is the next best thing.<br/><br/>Also the little parts with the chipmunk are SO cute. Can't remember his name (Pip?), but he is great. And it makes you think about trying to communicate using eye expressions and sign language, or animal sign language.<br/><br/>Go see it!

"virginiarules","9","1","2","5 December 2007"," I loved this movie
","I thought this movie was great! I loved the entire thing, but then again, I love musicals. I like the fact that it explains why Giselle just bursts out singing in the middle of Central Park (because she's from a place where people do that), instead of most musicals where people just sing with no reason. On top of that, I love the actors in this movie (although I will never see Timothy Spall as anyone but Peter Pettigrew from Harry Potter). I think it was casted perfectly. James Marsden is perfect playing a goofy character, and there's not a line Price Edward says that you don't want to laugh at. All in all, I enjoyed this movie and plan on buying it when it comes out to video. My advice, go see something before you put it off. This is no ordinary Disney movie!!"
"bob-3457","7","1","2","5 December 2007"," A slightly dissenting view
","The film opens with a straight-forward, not-very-ironic, animated prelude; the beautiful princess Giselle (the uber-talented Amy Adams) lives in the forest with her animated friends, waiting to meet her ""one true love"". He arrives in the form of the handsome, charming, none-too-bright Prince Edward (the very game James Marsden), who comes with the requisite evil step-mother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon). Narissa's reign is threatened by her step-son's impending nuptials. What to do? Transformed into the prototypical poison apple-wielding crone, Narissa lures Giselle to a wishing well and pushes her in. Down she falls, until she arrives, fully 3-D flesh-and-blood, at a manhole cover in N.Y.C.<br/><br/>The live-action Giselle is lost, confused, disoriented... but her sunny disposition and indefatigable optimism will not be deterred. It is here the film-makers have made their most inspired choice- the casting of Amy Adams as Giselle. In a role that that has many opportunities for failure, her every note is pitch-perfect. The naivety and optimism that could have been cloying or superficial are infused by Adams with nobility and warmth. Her performance is the center of the picture, and it's chief attraction.<br/><br/>From here, a great deal of promise is somehow not... quite... realized. Giselle is taken in, at the behest of his young single-parented daughter, by a kind but cynical divorce lawyer, Robert, ably but somewhat blandly portrayed by Patrick Dempsey. The juxtaposition of his modern day attitudes toward love with Giselle's story-book ""happily-ever-after"" optimism is none too original, which would be OK if there were some wit involved, but it's all rather rote. Robert's girl-friend of five years Nancy (Broadway star Idina Menzel) is understandably put-off by his new room-mate, but Giselle's child-like charm eventually wins even her over.<br/><br/>Edward arrives seeking his love, and is followed by the Queen's henchman Nathanial (Timothy Spall), who has been instructed to stop him and, eventually, by means of poison apple, kill her. Nathanial is not truly evil, but is influenced by his unrequited love for the Queen.<br/><br/>With the whole world of Princess/Fairy Tale convention to play off of the moments of actual inspiration are few and far between. Perhaps had the budget been smaller and the score a bit less bombastic this could have played more low-key and charming. But the style is more ""Roger Rabbit"" than ""Princess Bride"", and the script simply can't support the scope of the canvas.<br/><br/>One choice nicely made by the screen-writers is played out in the relationship between Giselle and the attitudes of the modern day world. Giselle's sunny optimism, predictably, begins to rub off on the people around her, infusing them with a better outlook. Less predictably, the opposite begins to occur with Giselle. Things she found straight-forward become suddenly more complex. It's easy to suggest that we have much to learn from Giselle; that a seemingly well-adjusted, happy person has something to learn from us is fresher territory, and goes to the heart of what is right with this film. It suggests that there is a yin and yang relationship between optimism and cynicism. Giselle's unwavering optimism finds it's balance in Robert's more complex world-view, and visa-versa. That we can all see the world in a new way through the eyes of others is both happy ending and the real world. Nice.<br/><br/>I expected a bit more from this film. It's premise is rife with ideas, very few of which are discovered or explored. The Disney princess ethos is permanently ingrained in our culture; we all know the conventions, we all understand the appeal. That this ingenious premise is so under-imagined from an intellectual point of view, simplistically presented from a story-telling point of view, and over-boisterously presented from a charm point of view is disappointing. There is fun to be had here, but this is neither as clever as the aforementioned ""Roger Rabbit"" or endearing as ""The Princess Bride"". It actually could have been both.<br/><br/>The real heart of the film is, always, Amy Adams. That she is not drop-dead Hollywood gorgeous is further testament to her talent. Fresh off her Academy Award nominated role in the touching ""June Bug"", her performance is funny, touching, wise, brave, and beautiful to behold. Just like a real princess."
"chicachinita24","10","1","2","4 December 2007"," Echantingly different kind of romantic comedy!
","***I'm not sure if there's a spoiler in this...but I'll put up a warning JUST IN CASE!***<br/><br/>As I was a little girl, I was content with watching my Disney favorite princesses meet the man of their dreams. Now that I am a teenager, I often found myself watching ""real"" movies. It seems as though animated features weren't for me anymore. But what do you know? Disney came up with something ""real"" and animated, satisfying my thirst for seeing a princess reach her dreams once again...in a very different way. <br/><br/>Enter 'Enchanted'. It has Disney trademarks - the characters suddenly breaking into song and dance number in many scenes, the songs every viewer will learn to cherish and the sappy love scenes and happy endings that leave us feeling good. <br/><br/>So, what's different about it? For one, two different worlds collide (literally!) Then, there's less of the drama and more of the comedy, spoofing a lot of our beloved fairy tales, without making us hate them for it! <br/><br/>Amy Adams was awesome as Giselle, the ""lost"" princess. as pointed out by a user on this site, not many actresses can pull off playing a princess, acting ""stupid"" in the middle of New York City. She has a lovely voice too! <br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey played Robert Philipp's part well too. Robert is a lawyer with a little daughter, Morgan (played by adorable Rachel Covey). I do not watch 'Grey's Anatomy' but Patrick Dempsey's name was the first familiar name I heard when I looked up the film. That is, until I learned James Marsden was going to be in it. <br/><br/>This man is hilarious! James Marsden played Prince Edward's role to perfection. Most of the one-liners I remember from the movie are his! He makes me crack up in every scene he's in. Despite his antics and silly comebacks, everyone finds themselves loving this egotistic prince charming. James Marsden charmed his way through this movie (and possibly into the hearts of every fan!) <br/><br/>If you're looking for a different kind of romantic comedy that the young and the young at heart would love, then 'Enchanted' is the right film for you. Go see it with your siblings, your kids, even your parents and grandparents. I saw it with my friends and we still laughed about the film even after we've seen it. And if you've already watched it then, you probably get what I mean. No wonder it's such a hit in the box office!<br/><br/>Thanks for making such a great film, peasants (Disney)! *wink*"
"dsklodginski","8","1","2","4 December 2007"," somewhat confused by some ratings
","Ye gads! Some people must have seen a different movie than I did. I found Enchanted to be a great deal of fun, the music captivating, the actors sublime....yet a number of voters chose to rate it a 1. It's understandable that someone may not have loved it as much as I did but to rate it that poorly? All I can say is that if you are trying to decide if you want to see this movie, you are in for a treat. The movie pokes gentle fun at the princess looking for her prince while a man who has been wounded in love is willing to settle for steady and stable. Of course they find that things are not always as they seem on the surface. The blending of animation and live action with a wink to setting the animated characters in reality was perfect due in part to the excellent casting. Kudos to all who made this work so well."
"mollymormonbrat","7","1","2","25 November 2007"," Release your inner Disney Princess!
","Oh, golly, it's almost embarrassing how much I liked this movie. I remember being tempted to see the movie upon seeing early trailers and posters, but I also realized it would probably bomb. But hey, I was going to see it anyway. Clearly I never entirely grew up. It's classic Disney cotton candy fluff, I still can't figure out why anyone would be attracted to a cynical jerk, there were obnoxious talking animals... and I think I just answered my own question. Isn't this the stuff that makes Disney so abhorrently great? I've already seen it twice, and the second time around was just as delightfully scrumptious as the first. And why not? ""Shrek"" originally captured our hearts with contemporary cynicism in a fairy tale world--and look how that angle turned out in the end with that disastrous #3. Maybe society is ready for happiness and joy and joyness and little singing woodland creatures once more.<br/><br/>And boy, do we get it. In the happy-magical kingdom of Andalasia (which is most reminiscent of the worlds of fellow princesses Snow White and Sleeping Beauty) we have the fair forest maiden Giselle, an angelic creature with a heart of gold dreaming of the day when she would receive True Love's Kiss. Fortunately, convenient Disney Destiny thrusts her into the arms of the handsome and dashing Prince Edward... and the happy couple are engaged about ten seconds later. All seems well in Andalasia, until Giselle is thrust down a waterfall into a horrible, dark place where no one lives happily ever after. That's right. New York City.<br/><br/>However, Giselle, now reality-incarnated as the sparkling Amy Adams, is not about to let a bad situation get the best of her. She sings and dances out her views on the world via a less-than-subtle reminder that life would indeed be better as a musical. Throw in a simple-but-tried-and-true plot and some enchanting stereotypes of characters and she has a dazzling film of which any Disney Princess would be proud.<br/><br/>Frankly, a lot of the wonder has to do with the casting and characters. Amy Adams is to Giselle as Johnny Depp is to Captain Jack in absorbing a character. Timothy Spall does an excellent job as a bumbling lackey, and his character of Nathaniel really wormed his way into my heart. James Marsden happily becomes Prince Edward and has a blast playing a properly two-dimensional prince who, as you know, must survive on looks, bravery, and charm rather than brains--fortunately his heart is just as big as Giselle's. Even Idina Menzel makes the most of her character's lack of screen time. I felt Susan Serandon could have had a bit more fun with her evil queen role, but still, it's hard to completely ruin any evil queen role. Patrick Dempsey also kept his role as straight man a little too straight (I still can't figure out why the character of Robert was supposed to be so great) but it was still entertaining to see him trapped in a fairy tale freak show while his own daughter is happily joining the party.<br/><br/>This lovable cast leads us through a sprightly and sweet story that took a deeper look at the typical fairy tale ending--without getting mind-numblingly philosophical on this, because hey, it's Disney. I for one appreciated the idea that blissful unapologetic romance and thought-out personality/values matching are both necessary a relationship to really work.<br/><br/>The story was cute, fresh, and funny. I had fun counting the various Disney references (and I still think I missed some). I still laugh over the idea that the obligatory talking critter lost his power of speech upon coming to the real world and it was wonderful to see Jodi Benson as Robert's recetionist sassing around whilst score from ""The Little Mermaid"" played in the background.<br/><br/>The last act wasn't quite at part with the rest of the movie: the twist of the princess as the hero has actually become its own cliché and I think they could have come up with something a little more creative. I also still can't figure out why Patick Dempsey's character was all that wonderful, but Beauty and the Beast fell in love and I'm the one that would happily ridden off into the sunset Prince Edward. But all in all, it was indeed a very enchanting movie and I hope the Academy looks Amy Adam's way when it comes for nominations.<br/><br/>It's the best kind of fluffy goodness, complete with a romp of hilariously stereotypical characters and fairy tale clichés--all done right! I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will condemn this movie for not embracing reality and pain, and I bet those are the type of people that don't let their kids read fairy tales.<br/><br/>The seven-year-old girl in me was extremely pleased."
"btm1","3","2","7","20 February 2009"," Reality: ""Enchanted"" failed to stay with its fantasy plot
","""Enchanted"" starts out in saccharine sweet animation. Not having read anything about the film in advance, I feared that the whole film would be a rehash of Disney classic animated films. The best part of the film was the transition from cartoon characters to live actors, which I wasn't expecting and was done very well. The next scenes with the fantasy world princess- to-be trying to cope with real world New York City was also well done, although I would have hoped that even in NYC the police would have eventually noticed her and taken her to Bellevue Hospital's psychiatric ward. Why Robert didn't do that after observing her actions and talking to her in his apartment also was more fantasy than reality, although it was in the reality part of the story.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Giselle getting the help of the real world animal kingdom in cleaning Robert's apartment, including rats and roaches. Hopefully the rats disease spreading fleas were well behaved. <br/><br/>Denying the animals of the real world the ability the animated animals had to speak in human voice was a nice touch. I also liked the next day scenes when Giselle got the denizens of Central Park singing and dancing. <br/><br/>But I hate it when a good story is ruined by producers who think all movies must have more destruction and special effects. <br/><br/>The story line of Enchanted is that the Queen doesn't want her stepson to marry his ""true love"" because she fears that when the bride became a princess she would want to usurp the Queen's crown. That seems a rather weak reason for a Queen to plot to keep them from meeting and, when that failed, to have the girl killed. But I can accept that as I can assume the Queen, whose magical powers seem limitless, is not only power mad but also paranoid. Of course it would have been simpler for her to just eliminate her step-son. <br/><br/>What I object to is that after Giselle chooses Robert Philip over Prince Edward, the Queen still sees a need to kill Giselle. I would have expected the Queen to be happy to see Giselle and Robert become a couple. Instead of the violent ending that is in vogue, the film could have ended with everyone, including the Queen, living happily ever after. Or at least transfer the Queen's wrath to Nancy, who seems in danger of becoming the Prince's new love. <br/><br/>The actual ending has Edward and Nancy reversing the plunge off an endless cliff in the kingdom of Andalasia, although Edward previously did not have the ability to soar up a cliff. It is also regrettable that Nancy had no time to let her work know that she wouldn't be to work the next day because she was leaving the real world. Do you think any of her friends and family made it to her wedding?"

","It's too bad; I was really looking forward to this movie based on the trailer. Sadly, all of the best laughs in the movie were *in* the trailer, so that was more than a little bit disappointing. I won't rehash the plot, as many others have, but I'd like to comment on a couple of things in the movie that had me scratching my head... first, if Giselle has magical powers and the ability to communicate with animals in the ""cartoon"" world as well as the ""real' world, why limit her powers to cleaning rooms... why couldn't she summon a swarm of pigeons, bees and the like to defeat the dragon? Maybe I'm over analyzing, but the action on the top of the skyscraper was really lame -- quite an anti-climax. <br/><br/>The second point has been alluded to before, but it bears repeating... the assumption that money solves all problems (even worse... a *credit card* solves them). The shopping montage was really offensive, and a terrible message to send to children.<br/><br/>Amy Adams did a wonderful job, and James Marsden was very good as well, but there wasn't enough there to merit a recommendation. The negatives stood out too much."
"yosefarochelh","3","3","14","8 April 2008"," disappointing
","I'm 24 and I usually enjoy kids movies, cheesy romance, animated...But this was pretty lame. The characters were shallow and the romance was underdeveloped. In addition, the animated portion paled in contrast to the classics (Sleeping Beauty) or some beautiful more modern classics (Mulan). The music lyrics were cute, but the compositions were uninspired compare to Beauty and the Beast or Little Mermaid. It's watchable if you're desperate for a recent movie to watch with your kids, but you could probably find something better to do with your time. If you like the ""true love"" theme, may I suggest Princess Bride? Or not encourage youngsters to think about romance. How about Free Willy or another nice animal flick?"

"TheXeroXone","7","1","3","16 March 2008"," Ultimately a victim of bad editing.
","I find this movie is hard to critique because there was a lot that was really good about this film with just a few moments of clumsy story editing involved. <br/><br/>As a romantic comedy this film delightfully shines above most, but only because Amy Adams overplays every scene with a stunning display of storybook innocence. The film's use of the typical princess superpower of command over animals in the real world is extremely funny - watching anthropomorphic cockroaches cleaning an apartment is always good for a sight gag (as proved in Joe's Apartment). The instant song/dance routine generation is just a little too over the top, but is still enjoyable. <br/><br/>There is also some things that are very bland about this movie. When the central idea of the film is to challenge romantic stereotypes and the filmmakers limit those stereotypes to just those within animated romances, the stereotypes and clichés that are used in live action romances stick out like a sore thumb. For example, the character of Robert Philip is shown to be faithfully attached to a woman for five years and even though there is no sign of emotional problems within the relationship, that connection is shown that it can be torn asunder by the introduction of a single female. <br/><br/>Also, this movie fails to give the character of Prince Edward any time to really develop interest or explanations for why he does half the things he does. For example, why does he jump head first into a well when he has absolutely no idea what's down there or why does he jump on a bus and believe it to be a wild beast when they obviously have carriages in the animated world?<br/><br/>Susan Surandon's character of the evil stepmother offers the movie little beyond her animated portrayal. When she shows up in the end, all she comes across as is a drug dealer and someone whose purpose is to spell out the role-reversals to anyone in the audience who just happened to be stricken with blindness within the previous 10 minutes. The unfortunate fact that her character does not come to terms with the limitations of her clichéd persona as the other characters do leaves a bit of a void within the story. <br/><br/>Of course I couldn't possibly write a review about this movie without mentioning Nathaniel and the animated chipmunk, Pip. <br/><br/>There, I mentioned them. <br/><br/>Final Grade: C+ (nothing to cry about)"
"dbborroughs","8","1","3","5 January 2008"," Lots of fun-more so if you know all the Disney fairy tale cartoons
","Disney pokes fun at itself and makes a glossy fairytale in the process. Animated princess is banished to the real world by a wicked queen, where its hoped she will stay forever. However the not too bright price follows suit as does a wicked henchmen. As the characters try to find each other and their way back romance blooms and the wicked queen fumes. I liked this movie. It helps that I've seen most if not all of the Disney fairy tales that are being sent up so the jokes played a little funnier. For example I loved the princess calling for help from her furry friends to clean the apartment and having rats, cockroaches and pigeons show up. The cast is mostly good, with only Idina Menzel, Tony winner for Wicked, being not really up to the material. She plays Patrick Dempsey's fiancé and seems off (as she often does on film and TV). Definitely worth a look, especially if you've seen all the Disney fairy tales, mores o if you've seen them more than once."
"tavm","8","1","3","27 December 2007"," Enchanted is a nice parody/tribute to fairy tales from Walt Disney Pictures
","Walt Disney Pictures' original animated/live-action musical comedy Enchanted is a mostly wonderful tribute/parody of various fairy tale films that made the company the most enchanting for family entertainment. Amy Adams is simply luminous as Giselle, the maiden who finds herself caught between James Marsden's Prince Edward from her animated life and Patrick Dempsey's Robert Phillip in the real New York one. Also featuring Susan Sarandon as the evil Queen Narissa and Timothy Spall as Nathaniel, her henchman. Then there's the chipmunk Pip, voiced by Jeff Bennett in Andalasia and the director Kevin Lima in New York when Pip can only communicate in chipmunk sounds. Finally, there's Idina Menzel as Robert's fiancée, Nancy, and six-year-old Rachel Covey as his daughter, Morgan. All players I've mentioned contribute wonderfully to this movie that lives up to its title. My favorite sequences, however, both involve Giselle when she sings her heart out in New York. The first involves when she calls to some animals to help clean Robert's apartment when he's gone and many of them are rats and roaches! Then at Central Park when she starts singing to Robert about finding true love, he at first tells her to just keep walking then she encounters some Calypso musicians and they start joining in and then just everyone within walking distance do the same. Well, except Robert who insists he can't sing or dance! The songs by Disney veterans Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz move along at a breezy pace. Also nice to see previous animated Disney princesses Jodi Benson (Ariel), Paige O'Hara (Belle), and Judy Kuhn (Pocohantas) make cameo appearances and to hear Julie Andrews herself narrate. All in all, Enchanted is another Disney movie that should be entertaining enough for all ages who want that feel-good happy ending with some clever satire that makes, in the words of Andrews' Mary Poppins character from that Disney picture, ""the medicine go down""."
"evanston_dad","7","1","3","14 December 2007"," It's Nice to See That Disney Can Make Fun of Itself
","A cute and diverting Disney film that pokes fun at other Disney films.<br/><br/>Amy Adams does fine work as a cartoon princess named Giselle who is banished to that frightening, sinister world otherwise known as New York City by an evil queen (Susan Sarandon) who doesn't want her marrying her dashing stepson, Prince Edward (James Marsden), and stealing her crown away from her. Giselle winds up in the care of Patrick Dempsey (who's come a long way since his days as a gigolo pizza delivery guy in ""Loverboy""), an uptight divorce attorney who doesn't believe in true love. Giselle of course, in true Disney princess fashion, believes in nothing else, and the two fall predictably in love, much to the dismay of Edward, who has followed Giselle to New York.<br/><br/>Much of the humor in ""Enchanted"" revolves around contrasting fairytale mannerisms and beliefs to the, shall we say slightly more jaded, attitudes of modern-day New York. Giselle and Edward are both completely lacking in irony or sarcasm, and don't understand feelings like anger or scorn. They both also have a habit of breaking out into big production numbers at the most inopportune times, which provides the film with its highlights. When Giselle wants to clean up a messy apartment, she enlists the help of God's creatures, just like Snow White did so many years ago, but the ones that show up here are pigeons, rats, roaches and an army of flies. It would be easy to dismiss Adams' performance as unchallenging, but I think it would take a lot of skill to carry a movie like this, and she does it well. Marsden is also quite funny as the pompous prince with gleaming white teeth. Demspey is kind of droopy, while Susan Sarandon hams things up as the wicked stepmother. The film grows rather tiresome by its conclusion; the filmmakers can't resist a CGI showdown between the queen (in the guise of a giant purple dragon) and our lovers. But overall it left me entertained.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"hderksen","7","1","3","26 November 2007"," fairy tale meets real life
","This movie has - what else would you expect - a happy ending. The movie rides on the comical clash of cultures when fairy tale characters end up in New York city. The New Yorkers and the fairy tale characters clearly have very different notions on romance. In the end, they learn from each other. The movie was actually better than I had expected. Amy Adams is wonderful as Giselle. The ""prince charming"" was a bit cheesy and never evolved beyond the clichés. Susan Sarandon is pleasantly evil. Of course anything can happen in a fairy tale, so with the help of a kiss from the right prince and a glass shoe, the day is saved before the clock strikes midnight. And they lived happily ever after."

","It's a nice movie thats entertaining, very clever, and even somewhat funny. That says something because I normally don't go for movies like this. It's definitely good for kids, particularly little girls. There's just a lot to like about this movie. It's different for a lot of stuff that's been done nowadays and very clever. Amy Adam's does a great job as lead female, Giselle.<br/><br/>The movie starts off animated. Giselle meets a prince named Edward(played by James Marsden), and they fall in love instantly. However, Edward's bitterly evil step-mother(played by Susan Sarandon) does not want this and decides to push Giselle down a well. She ends up in real life, New York, where she is extremely confused and out of place. She meets a lawyer named Robert. Oh, and Edward follows her to New York as well, just as out of place and lost as she is.<br/><br/>It's a very fun film. In my opinion, the kids will enjoy the comedy and the cartoon chipmunk, and the adults can enjoy the actors performances and have a good time. I recommend this movie to anyone. It's very charming and could end up being a classic."
"Drake_Clawfang","10","1","3","24 November 2007"," Family fun
","I honestly was surprised. Enchanted does exactly what the plot says it does - it takes the classic fairytale characters we grew up with, and dumps them in the real world. Queen Narissa wants her son to never marry so she never loses the throne, so when he meets Giselle, she spirits her away to modern New York, and she gets taken in by Robert, a divorced lawyer.<br/><br/>From there on out, it gets kinda predictable. Prince Edward rushes to the rescue, unaware his squire is working to make sure he doesn't find Giselle. And while Edward is busy running around the city, Robert teaches Giselle the ""real world"" version of love, complete with dates and divorce. And by the time Edward finds her, Giselle is falling for Robert.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's predictable, but its fun. If nothing else, seeing all the movie clichés happen in real life is worth a laugh. Seeing mice and birds clean a house is fun in animation - in real life with rats and pigeons cleaning an apartment, it's a little different. And there's a slew of allusions to all the classics, Beauty and the Beasts, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty. There's a few times (like the first ten minutes) when you groan and just bear it because it's sugary enough to rot your teeth. But its fun. And the songs are kept to a minimum, and are fun when they do happen.<br/><br/>Overall, predictable, but fun. Like Shrek and Hoodwinked before it, it does a delightful spin of every storybook cliché. Enjoyable for all ages."

","When I first saw the trailer for this film I had my doubts that it would ever fly. The idea of turning Disney fantasy characters into real people running around New York City seemed clumsy and silly.<br/><br/>The film soared way past my expectations. It is a wild ride from start to finish and offers nonstop laughter for child and adult alike. Between all the unrelenting humor it offers a simple and tender message of love and acceptance that is understandable by people of all ages.<br/><br/>Kudos go to actress Amy Adams who very plausibly fulfills how one might expect a Disney fantasy heroine to behave once turned into flesh and blood. Her talents really make the whole outlandish story work.<br/><br/>The cute self parodies on all the elements from classing Disney-adapted fairy tales are too numerous to go into here, but they give the film a buoyancy and bubbly never-ending pace.<br/><br/>My only small criticism is that the talented Susan Sarandon was underutilized in her role as the wicked queen. Her henchman, played by Timothy Spall, wasn't nearly as funny or engaging in the screen time allotted. One can imagine an energetic cat-and-mouse chase around Manhattan between the queen and the princess.<br/><br/>It's been a very long time since I'm seen a children's film so complete enjoyable, funny and touching. I was beginning to lose hope after sitting through the very un-funny ""Bee Movie."" No wonder it was released a couple weeks earlier. In terms of pure entertainment, this film is light-years ahead of that insipid clunker."
"jemps918","6","2","12","26 November 2007"," Kind of disenchanting...
","Kind of disenchanting...I heard great reviews about ""the great Disney comeback"" but only the chipmunk sidekick Pip really delivered the laughs.<br/><br/>Enchanted starts as an animated flick, and the audience is on board for how it would transition to reality. However, the cheesy cartoon, which is obviously meant to be a spoof, just dragged on too long for comfort.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is a terrific actress and immersed in the character Giselle, but she looked way too old (at 33!) for the role. The grand transformation scene was anticlimactic; she looked dull and her lackluster, understated purple dress made her look washed out. Her plain but mercifully expressive face simply isn't beautiful enough, but her acting carried her all the way through.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey is perfect as the tired, cynical lawyer Robert Philip, and so is Rachel Covey, who plays his shy child Morgan., who is forced to mature too soon. Covey is thankfully not annoying for a child actor and actually brought dimension to her character. James Marsden was great as the conceited, swashbuckling Prince Edward, while Susan Sarandon indeed looked evil as the villainous Queen Narissa.<br/><br/>It's targeted more for children and is not as funny as Shrek or even Over the Hedge. If you hate singing in movies, not even when spoofed, you also might not take to Enchanted very kindly."

I registered an IMDb account just to write a review for a movie, something I've never done before and I've also never thought I would do for anything other than video games !!!(I'm kind of a hardcore gamer). But ""Enchanted"" really stands out from all movie I have enjoyed. It has been really a long time that there is such an intriguing film come out to market.<br/><br/>Enchanted is a masterpiece in every aspects, especially presentation. The visual and the music are both terrific, they blend so perfectly, so naturally, so fantastic that can suck everyone into the world of fairy tale unconsciously. Enchanted reminds everyone that when talking about fairy-tale, Walt Disney is king !! As a fairy-tale based movie, it is understandable that Enchanted plot is predictable, but surprisingly the plot is very entertaining and doesn't make you bored for even one minute.<br/><br/>What about the cast? One word: flawless !!! I'm not exaggerating it.<br/><br/>If you think that you're too old for fairytale, think again.

"zetes","7","1","4","23 March 2008"," Slight but quite amusing
","Not a great movie, but a delightful one. It's nice to see Disney playing with their own formula, even if it is with kids' gloves. So many other films and TV series have ripped it apart quite meanly, but few have done it as well and as poignantly. Enchanted still wants to rely in the happily-ever-after thing in the end, but at least they acknowledge the real world here. The lead actor plays a divorce attorney, for instance. He's a single father, and for the longest time I was expecting the story of how he became a widower, but then it's revealed that his wife left him. And it's nice to see the traditional princess and damsel in distress, played by Amy Adams, become the hero during the climax. Adams is the main reason to watch. She's such a charmer. James Marsden is also quite funny as the prince who has come to rescue her, and Timothy Spall has a nice, hammy role similar to the one he also played in Sweeney Todd last year. And it's nice to see Susan Sarandon turn into a dragon. It's about time she revealed her true form to the world."

Enchanted does not attempt to weave a Fairy Tale, it IS a Fairy Tale, and a darned sweet and entertaining one, at that.<br/><br/>All in all? This is definitely a Friday/Saturday night movie for the family, children worried about a ""wicked"" stepmother, or dating couples, though probably not one for ""the guys."" I cannot say there is something here for everyone, because frankly, if you have a cynical eye for romance, this work will probably cause you to long for some Visine.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

First off, the beginning had a odd felling and was very awkward. When she finally went to NYC, it was still awkward. In fact, most of the entire movie had a musical feeling and was again, awkward. The evil queen that you see in the trailers only shows up at the very end of the movie. She makes her eat a poison apple, a BIG clichÃ©, and, what do you know, she falls to sleep.

"dfle3","5","1","7","3 July 2008"," Lacks the adult appeal of classics like ""The Princess Bride""
","Starting off a standard Walt Disney cartoon and then transforming into a live action movie, this is the story of 'true love' and those that would seek to deny it for their own reasons.<br/><br/>The one seeking to deny others the chance of true love is the handsome Prince Edward's step-mother, Queen Narissa (voiced and then played by Susan Sarandon). She's a nasty piece of work because she fears losing her title as ""Queen"" if her step-son marries the likely lass that has taken his fancy-Giselle. Hence, by magic the evil step-mother banishes Giselle to non-cartoon New York, in order to separate the would be lovers.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie and the reason I am giving it a low score is that this movie is very much pitched towards children and lacks the cross-over appeal of such great ""G"" rated movies like ""The princess bride"" and ""The Incredibles"" (the former a classic and delightful comedy/fairy-tale, whilst the latter was a cartoon that I saw without great expectations and which impressed me). The latter films provide a reason to have kids!<br/><br/>The actress playing/voicing Giselle, along with the other fairytale originating characters, play the live action scenes as if they were in a pantomime. It's a performance pitched at the very youngest of audiences.<br/><br/>On the other hand, oddly, you get a very dour and ""realist"" performance by Patrick Dempsey (of the medicated soap ""Grey's Anatomy"", I think)-playing a character who complicates the situation with the would be lovers.<br/><br/>At times I felt this movie tending to drag and I found myself cringing at some of the musical numbers (I'm not that into musicals though). However, in the movie's favour, there were a around a handful of laughs to be had. The film does poke fun at the whole ""fairytale"" genre at times.<br/><br/>There were a lot children at this screening and whilst they weren't riotously entertained they did enjoy some musical numbers and jokes.<br/><br/>For the kiddies."
"lee_eisenberg","7","1","9","10 April 2008"," Let me explain...
","It was bound to come one day: a movie about a princess from fairy tale land who comes to the real world. And where can one get a better taste of reality than New York? As I understand it, some people found it a little inappropriate to show Giselle (Amy Adams) wearing only a towel in that one scene. Obviously these people didn't realize that ""Enchanted"" is partly a parody of these sorts of movies (and confidentially, if I'd seen her like that, I might have asked her if I could get slinky with her). Of course, a gorgeous babe like Giselle probably wouldn't have wanted to get sexually involved with a dork like Robert (Patrick Dempsey).<br/><br/>I should also say that Susan Sarandon, as evil Queen Narissa, also exudes eroticism. It takes one svelte gal to look that sexy while being totally wicked. In my opinion, Prince Edward (James Marsden) was best while watching TV, while Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) probably could be the star of his own movie.<br/><br/>And the songs? They probably won't stick in my mind (sorry, I'm just not a fan of that stuff). Whereas the official description of Giselle is no doubt supposed to be ""beautiful"", I prefer to say ""hot""; seriously, what guy isn't gonna feel just a little aroused at the sight of her? The overall gist of the movie seems to be that if we were nicer to each other, then the world would be a better place (well, after everything that's happened in the world during the past few years, that's going to be a tough task).<br/><br/>Anyway, it's not a bad movie. Not my favorite, but worth seeing as long as we understand what it portrays."

This kind garbage is the very reason why millennials are such a dysfunctional bunch. If you want your daughters to not grow up being a attention seeking slut, you would do well in teaching her about taking responsibility and working hard for her own happiness.<br/><br/>So, if you are living in the real world; Enchanted is a charming film that at the least, attempt to make the princess take some responsibility for her happiness and to at least try to work for it. Of course it's suppose to be silly and fun and for the most part it is. The songs are very catchy and infectious; reminiscent of 1960s Disney.<br/><br/>Amy Adams plays the part of Giselle mostly well. She sings great but she overplays the doe-eyed maiden. It wouldn't be so bad if she was younger but unfortunately she's not that young to be believably naive. This also affect the way she tries to be cutesy and adorable; being cute and adorable only works if you are young enough to pull it off and Amy Adam barely managed to do it.<br/><br/>This goes the same with James Marsden's Prince Edward. I think he is cast well as the dumb prince and Marsden certainly acts and sings the part, but the character is just too dumb to be believable. You are dumb and full of bravado because you are young and James Marden isn't that young to be believably dumb.<br/><br/>Patrick Dempsey, Susan Sarandon and Timothy Spall played their part without any discernible flaws.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is okay but not outstanding."

","The concept of taking Disney love into reality is always going to be an interesting approach. In hindsight, the romance of the Disney movies before the 1960s is simplified and flawed. Heck, even afterwards they have their problems. It hasn't been until this decade when the romance feels more up to date. It's not there yet but it's progress. There's a compelling exploration to be made there, that is, if Enchanted was willing to go a little darker, but even though I didn't expect it to, it doesn't hit all the notes. It's enjoyable though, deliberately sickly sweet, but it crumbles by its third act when Susan Sarandon turns up. Still, plenty of charm along the way, especially with the spirited cast with Amy Adams, James Marsden and Timothy Spall proving how perfectly cast they are. Very nice animation sequences as well, really ties it together. Doesn't live up to its potential but at least it's not annoying.<br/><br/>6/10"

And I especially don't like that they relegated getting married to being something so farcical that its only something fairy-tale characters do (in case you missed it Giselle never marries Robert since according to the movie you can just date so long as you have activities to do together).

I remember several songs from it being nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars in 2008, but I was glad when they all lost to ""Falling Slowly"" from ""Once"". I never actually saw ""Enchanted"" until just a few months ago. This was after I watched ""Juno"" and ""Superbad"", two other very popular films from 2007, and found them both to be very overrated indeed! Even though this movie is nothing like either of those two, I ended up thinking this was another vastly overrated blockbuster from the same year. Trying it a second time several months after my first viewing unfortunately didn't seem to change anything.<br/><br/>Giselle lives in a cartoon fairy tale world called Andalasia, where there is always a ""happily ever after."" This is also a world where animals talk and inhabitants often break into song. Her true love turns out to be Prince Edward, who saves her from a troll, so the two of them will soon be married, and Giselle will become a princess.

This world is the real world, where Giselle finds herself in modern-day New York City! Obviously confused by her surroundings, the young fairy tale woman is soon found by a divorce lawyer named Robert Philip, who comes to her aid. He takes her back to his apartment, but even though she means no harm, she is bound to cause some trouble in Robert's life. Meanwhile, Prince Edward goes to the real world to search for Giselle, and Pip the chipmunk comes along. Queen Narissa sends her servant, Nathaniel, to try and trick Giselle into taking a bite out of a poisonous apple! Pip learns the real reason why Nathaniel has come to the real world and tries to warn the prince, but unfortunately, in this world, chipmunks can't talk! <br/><br/>The lead character here is played by Amy Adams, and both times I saw this film, I realized that this character's cutesy fairy tale demeanor is supposed to be part of the humour here, but I was put off by it. In fact, I didn't really care much for any of the characters. The film is a comedy, but I hardly found anything funny at all, and I think the characters had a lot to do with this, Giselle case in point. The many gags which I found unfunny include Pip defecating in fright at one point, which I wasn't expecting the first time and thought was pretty gross! The idea of fairy tale characters in the real, modern world is an interesting one, but what this causes in this comedy fantasy wasn't usually that amusing to me. I did hear several songs from the film performed at the Academy Awards, but couldn't remember exactly what I thought of them at the time. However, after actually watching the movie and hearing those Oscar-nominated songs again, I would say the songs here are another weak aspect of this 2007 Disney blockbuster, and they have made me appreciate ""Falling Slowly"" more, even though that is a totally different kind of song from a totally different kind of film.<br/><br/>Of the three movies of 2007 which I later saw and didn't even come close to getting the hype for, this one is by far the most different of the three (unlike the other two, this one is a family fantasy film and has nothing to do with teenhood), and the only one without Michael Cera, but regardless of significant genre differences, my opinion still stands. I didn't review ""Enchanted"" after my first viewing, since I had just watched ""Superbad"" and written my bad review of it, and I guess something about doing the same with this film immediately after that one didn't feel right. Even though it didn't seem like this parody/homage to the Disney fairy tale movies would likely improve for me, I gave it another chance several months later, and this time, I intended to review the movie regardless of what I thought of it. Unsurprisingly, I still don't have many positive things to say about it, other than the stunning visual effects towards the end, and I most certainly don't intend to watch it a third time for ANY reason. No matter how well received a film is, it can't impress EVERYBODY who sees it, and I respect other people's opinions, but cannot imagine myself ever agreeing with this movie's reputation."

","What do you get if you put Snow White,Cinderella,The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty & the Beast into a blended machine and have it like Who Framed Roger Rabbit except have them coming to life. You get this silly,romantic,adorable fantasy tale.For the first ten minutes the movie starts off as an old-fashioned cartoon and Amy Adams (who I never heard of until I saw her in this film)plays,voices and sings as a soon to be princess named Giselle who is banished from her animated world into the real world of NYC by a magic fountain that leads to a manhole in Times Square New York City in 2007(yeah the film reminds me of that other film back in 2001 Kate & Leopold only that had a Pride & Prejuice feel to it). Lost and scared she meets a handsome attorney named Robert Philip(Patrick Dempsey from Grey's Anatomy who played Dr Derek Sheppard)who is a single divorce father of one who's ex wife left him and he tries to avoid love altogether. At first Robert finds Giselle insane and mad as she is so cheerful and annoying (""what is wrong with you"" says Robert as he is embarrassed at work with Giselle) but they soon find themselves falling for one another despite the fact his suppose to pop the question to his girlfriend of 5 years Nancy Tremaine(Idina Menzel from Wicked) and Giselle is suppose to marry Prince Edward(27 Dresses star James Marsden who plays his part well here as a stupid idiot prancing around NYC looking for his long lost love who is apparently falling for someone else).<br/><br/>Although Giselle has the best of both worlds she has to choose which man she loves and can a storybook ending survive in the real world??. The music in this is brilliant from That's How You Know performed by Ms Adams which was such a feel good song I was literally singing the song every time I watch this film to the love ballad So Close performed by Jon McLaughlin which was played in the Kings & Queens ball. The cast was excellent Amy Adams was brilliant as the irritating princess who will do your head in from time to time yet you will fall in love with her character ,Patrick Dempsey (who I didn't give a damn about at first)was really good for his first musical debut(just watch it for him you will be surprised what secret talent he has) and as for the rest they were good except Susan Sarandon I didn't like her in this movie at all she was wasted as she only arrives near the end of the film trying to finish off Giselle because she doesn't want her to marry her stepson Prince Edward. The only issue I had with this film is the amount of mistakes I spotted as I was watching it.It was packed with plot holes from the moment the wide-eyed princess was sent to our world in human form and I think it ruined it for me. As for the whole film it is so cheesy I could cringe for days but having said that it was the best 1hr and 40 mins of my life it makes me happy and it tells us that you have to accept life for what it is. Like most Disney classics this one is the best film of the 21st century. Julie Andrews (who I forgot to mention is the narrator of this film) did a brilliant job. I love the pop up book design as well especially when you see the glass slipper in the end and Giselle and Robert running around the house having fun. I highly recommend that you should check this one out its funny in some places and its not aimed for kids only its for adults too as there is quite a lot of adult humor that the kids won't get(e.g gay biker,Giselle feeling Robert's chest). This is coming from a girl who is reaching adulthood and I was so proud to see this film as it is so cleverly well done and for the credits (8 mins long) this should be for the young and old.<br/><br/>""Let yourself be Enchanted if you just might break through""<br/><br/>Best scene<br/><br/>The that's how you know song(I was smiling for days when I watched this scene) The ballroom scene(Patrick Dempsey says it all in this movie as he can sing) The animation was beautiful(hand-drawn animation was colorful).<br/><br/>Best Quote<br/><br/>""But dreams do come true and maybe someday something wonderful will happen""<br/><br/>"" Because that lovey-dovey version you talk about is fantasy and one day you wake up and your in the real world""<br/><br/>Worst bit :The dragon scene was a bit lame and too short and there is a lot of errors in this film and the characters can be a bit annoying from time to time.<br/><br/>If you liked the movies it mocks then you will love this.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A fairytale princess meets her real prince in Manhattan.<br/><br/>9/10 4/5<br/><br/>A-<br/><br/>Enchanted you will be.<br/><br/>Excellent stuff from Disney."
"DiamondGirl427","6","0","1","1 July 2010"," Wrong Choices For The Cast
","I know this film has been out for a while..and my family has probably seen it a couple of times..and while I think the story idea was a good one..I could not help but wonder why these particular actors were chosen to play the parts they did. Amy Adams is a great actress..but she tends to play the same slightly scatter brained person in every film..here she did just that too. Her annoying behavior would not be something most modern guys would tolerate for very long either. Patrick Dempsey is the ""it"" guy of the moment in a lot of movies...and this was apparently why he got casted here. He seemed too stiff and distant to be believable..maybe that was his lawyer persona coming through..but he failed to warm up much...even when he was in ""dad"" mode with the delightful little girl cast as his daughter. The actress who was chosen to play his fiancÃ© was totally wrong too..she was not really very girly at all. I do not see someone like Dempseys' character being remotely interested in her did not fit at all. I liked Susan Sarandon in her role as the Wicked Stepmother...it worked good. I could have done without the mice and the guy who was hopefully in love with the wicked stepmother...come on...the guy had no chance there..unless he wanted to be a doormat. But...considering it was a fairy tale with a twist...I can see the entertainment aspect too. There were jokes and cute stuff..and it was a good family type film. I just wish the casting had of been better though...even with the happy ending I wanted a little more."

","I just want to say that this really isn't my sort of film. In my opinion Disney should be doing something more worthwhile with their time than making strange, sickly live-action films such as this. On the other hand, it is an original story done in such a way as to make it interesting. Amy Adams give a strong performance, and while the songs aren't Disney's best, they're still well performed. I did find it funny at times, and Timothy Spall has to be one of the best things in it. Conversely, I can't stand Patrick Dempsey. It's the sort of film that girls would love, and I can see why, though most other people would probably find that the minutes drag on."
"hosolo","7","0","1","20 September 2008"," A Strange Fantasy
","I watch movies to escape the real world. This movie is silly, but lets you forget the real world for a little while. It starts off as a saccharine sweet cartoon, then morphs into a live action animation musical comedy-drama. A genre only Disney/Pixar can manage to create.<br/><br/>Because of an evil scheme by a Disney stepmother (who else?), Amy Adams as Princess Giselle gets stuck in the company of mean New Yorkers, save a kind-hearted divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey - the former teen star that got better looking as he got older). Giselle speaks likes the cartoon character even in modern day New York, and New Yorkers believe she's just another crazy woman from the street. Both Disney Prince and Princess end up in New York, looking for each other while maintaining their cartoonish attributes. I know it's Disney and aimed at kids and family, but that was a little too unbelievable.<br/><br/>The minute Adams' Giselle, became an angry New Yorker, because of Robert's (Dempsey) pessimistic view of love and life as a divorce lawyer, the story became more interesting and more watchable. I guess I can't relate to cartoon characters as much. Still the fun part was not watching the special effects, it was great seeing Susan Sarandon as the evil stepmother, Narissa. That's acting and she should have had a larger role in the movie. Not the best Disney movie, that belongs to Beauty & the Beast (IMO), but a fairly good escapism film, that got better as it neared the end."

But Edward's step mom, Queen Narrisa, sends Gizelle to real world New York City. Amy Adams was perfect for this character. She sings well and has this sweet, high pitched voice perfect for being a Princess. Gizelle falls into the lap of Robert, whom has a little girl and a girlfriend of 5 years. It's not long before Gizelle realizes there's more to finding a guy than one can do in a day and wants more than the dazzling smile from Prince Edward. Edward finds her, but she wants to go on a date at the Queen's Ball. Narrisa comes to New York to stop the 2 and she becomes the big ending. Does Gizelle want more than a fairy tale typical romance? Does Edward get a wife? Watch to find out.<br/><br/>This movie was funny also. From Gizelle making her own clothes to Edward's fascination with the TV.

","""Enchanted"" is a fish-out-of-water tale that is also an homage to ""Snow White,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Mary Poppins,"" and countless other Disney classics that have come before it. Here, a fairy tale princess (Amy Adams) crosses over from the world of animation to the world of live-action, without losing her cheery disposition and otherworldly charm in the process.<br/><br/>On the day she is to be wed to her long-awaited Prince Charming, the beautiful Giselle is tossed out of the storybook kingdom of Analasia by a jealous evil queen (Susan Sarandon) who has no intention of letting some pretty little upstart usurp her throne. When Giselle finally finishes falling, she lands smack dab in the middle of a live-action Manhattan that is only a tad less immaculate and a shade less colorful than the cel-animated world she calls home. The plucky heroine is both dazzled and a bit confused by this strange looking world where the people don't seem quite as friendly or optimistic about life as the inhabitants of Analasia. Giselle is befriended by an unromantic, decidedly commitment-phobic divorce attorney (Patrick Dempsey) who doesn't know quite what to make of this odd, undoubtedly deranged creature who, when she isn't inspiring critters to help her tidy up the apartment or breaking out into full-throated, spontaneous song, is extolling the virtues of true love and declaring her undying faith in happily-ever-after endings.<br/><br/>Most of the fun of ""Enchanted"" lies in watching this almost impossibly cheerful, utterly imperturbable former cartoon character going up against the harsh realities of the real world (as harsh as the ""real world"" in any Disney film can be, that is), yet maintaining her sunny disposition throughout. The filmmakers have devised some spot-on parodies of the typical Disney musical number, replete with high-pitched warbling, a chorus of singing animals, and lyrics that reflect an unquenchable conviction that all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. At times, the idea of the film is better than its execution, opting, as it often does, for silliness and strained slapstick over sophistication and wit. And sometimes, even the concept itself falls flat, as when we are left to ponder whether these creatures, with their weird behavior and exotic garb, would really be all that out of place in Times Square. And, regrettably, the filmmakers couldn't resist throwing an utterly superfluous, CGI-generated dragon into the mix at the end.<br/><br/>Yet, for the most part, the movie is clever, bright and beguiling, and boasts a wonderfully ditzy performance by the lovely Miss Adams that brings the whole sugarcoated confection to life. The material many be stretched a bit beyond its breaking point, but ""Enchanted"" casts a spell over its audience anyway."

","This was a brilliant movie. And it was mainly because Amy Adams was absolutely perfect as Giselle. She brought so much life to the screen and was just such a lovable character. Prince Edward was really funny, and so was Pip. I enjoyed this movie throughout. I loved the songs that were played, you could they were originals. Robert's little girl was very cute as the girl who just wants to believe in fairy tales. And Amy Adams is marvelous as Giselle, who shows Morgan that you can still believe in them. I thought the combining of the animated world and the real world was a very clever idea. It just goes to show how different fairy tales are to our lives. But this movie also shows that the two can combine. Dreams can come true. And true love can be found. Amazing movie.

Dempsey is given little to do but look handsome and he does it well enough. Sarandon has a small role as the wicked stepmother but she vamps it up. The squirrel is cute as are all the other animals. It's all very predictable, but that's what endears it to the kids to whom it is targeted."

","Disney's Enchanted is a wonderful film: not only does it have a brilliantly simple, yet completely ingenious concept, that is packed full of great jokes, romance, adventure, and hugely enjoyable musical numbers, but it also makes a star of the beautiful and talented Amy Adams, who, if there is any justice in this world, will have a long and successful career ahead of her.<br/><br/>As Giselle, the fairytale princess-to-be who is sent to New York by the evil Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), Adams is absolutely perfect: heart-achingly attractive with an angel's voice. Who can really blame single father Robert Philip (played by Patrick Dempsey) for falling for her charms, even though he is about to propose to his long term girlfriend? Not I.<br/><br/>Robert, an attorney, meets Giselle as she wanders the streets of the 'Big Apple', struggling to cope with the harsh reality of the city. After taking the confused young woman back to his apartment (which he shares with his six-year-old daughter), his life becomes completely turned upside-down: his girlfriend leaves him (fair enoughÂ—she sees Giselle laying on top of him in nothing but a towel!), and his career looks decidedly shaky (once again, Giselle does not seem to help the situation).<br/><br/>Also throwing a spanner in the works are several others characters from the fairy tale realm, who have followed Giselle to New York: Prince Edward, who wishes to marry the pretty maiden, having spent a whole day in her company; Giselle's best friend Pip (who happens to be a chipmunk!); and the loathsome Nathaniel (Timothey Spall), Queen Narissa's right hand man, who is determined that Edward will not find his true love.<br/><br/>With Enchanted, director Kevin Lima proves himself to be a name to watch, providing his audience with brilliant wall-to-wall family fun, and delivering a couple of scenes that are instant Disney classics: Giselle summoning the vermin of New York to help her tidy Robert's apartment; and the song and dance routine in which everyone joins in, having obviously been affected by a little of Giselle's fairytale magic.<br/><br/>Of course, despite the villains' best attempts, everything ends happily ever after (as do all great fairy tales), but not before Giselle learns that falling in love means getting to know someone properly first, Robert learns to trust his feelings, Nathaniel realises the error of his ways, the nasty Narissa is defeated by a brave rodent, and Edward finds someone who is truly grateful to be whisked off their feet by a handsome prince."
"jlpitzen","8","0","1","28 March 2008"," When Two Worlds Collide
","I wasn't quite sure what to expect from ""Enchanted"": corny retread of Disney themes or inspired genre-bending? The movie begins in the animated world of Andalasia, which borrows copiously from ""Snow White"". We have the young damsel (named Giselle) loved by woodland creatures, her knight-in-shining-armor (Prince Edward), and the evil stepmother (Queen Narissa). So far, signs point to corny retread. Novelty is introduced as Giselle is sent packing down a wormhole by the evil queen because Giselle's impeding marriage to Prince Edward will dethrone Narissa. At the end of the wormhole, Giselle pops up through a manhole onto the streets of New York City, sans animation.<br/><br/>Giselle is clueless in this new world, and the naive woman is befriended by conservative divorce lawyer Robert Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter, Morgan. I still wasn't sure about the movie until one scene in particular laid its hook in me, and the film kept me hooked the rest of the way. In Andalasia, Giselle had sung out her window to beckon woodland creatures to help her in her work. When faced with Robert's messy apartment, she does the same thing, but, ya know, this is New York City. So what should respond to her call but pigeons, rats, flies, and cockroaches. Not batting an eye at the obvious decline in quality of her beckonees, Giselle happily orchestrates the creatures while singing ""The Happy Working Song"". Brilliant!<br/><br/>Since the collision of animated fairytale-land with the contemporary real world is mostly virgin territory, there were many possible ways this venture could play out. For the most part, the makers of this film hit the nail on the head. By juxtaposing these two different worlds, the filmmakers manage to astutely compare and contrast these worlds, identifying what is good and bad in each of them. The fairytale-land of classic romance-based Disney movies such as ""Snow White"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" create an enchanted world of childlike enthusiasm and trust, because, after all, they're aimed at children. But these movies also contain old social mores in which people, especially young women, are more wrapped up in the ideal image of love and marriage rather than the specific personality of their lovers. Contemporary New Yorkers, on the other hand, have become so involved with their careers in a callous, fast- paced world that they've become too calculated and cynical when it comes to love. ""Enchanted""brings about a rich cross-fertilization between these worlds as Philip is genuinely affected by Giselle's childlike enthusiasm and belief in love, and Giselle comes to realize that it may be a good idea to actually get to know your lover before you marry him.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is simply remarkable in manifesting the naivety, childlike enthusiasm, and pure sincerity of a classic Disney princess into the real world of contemporary New York. Prince Edward follows Giselle to New York City, and James Marsden does a fine job of portraying Edward as a classic full-of-himself jock. Susan Sarandon and Timothy Spall are well-cast as the classic Disney villains. Giselle's lovable sidekick Pip, a chipmunk, even gets a real world makeover via CGI, and he enriches the story by engaging in many hilarious antics. All in all, the cast from Andalusia does create a sense of enchantment that would make Walt Disney proud, and the New York cast help the Andalasians break out of their outdated social mindset to get a better grip on reality. While being a fun ride, some good moral lessons are provided for the young and old alike."
"EUyeshima","7","0","1","27 March 2008"," Clever Throwback to Disney's Better Days Provides an Ebullient Breakthrough for Adams
","For those fortunate enough to have seen Amy Adams in Phil Morrison's ""Junebug"" (2005), you saw a genuinely guileless actress who is capable of conveying sincerity without a hint of irony. As the perennially sunny and interminably pregnant Ashley, she stole that picture easily, and the same holds true for this far more extravagant 2007 Disney production directed by Disney stalwart Kevin Lima (""102 Dalmations"", ""Tarzan""). This time, she provides the voice for Giselle, a fair maiden in bucolic woodland where the animals sing and dance as she dreams of kissing her prince. Fortunately, the handsome, self-absorbed Prince Edward shows up with his Marty Feldman-like sidekick Nathaniel in the nick of time as a gigantic troll is about to pounce on Giselle. They fall in love and decide to marry the next day.<br/><br/>However, Edward's stepmother, the evil Queen Narissa, does not want Giselle in line for the throne, so she plots to be rid of Giselle by pushing her into a portal that ends up in the middle of Manhattan's Times Square. It's at this point that the film turns to live action, and Giselle is fully embodied by Adams as a wedding ball-gowned fish-out-of-water. Bill Kelly's amusing though somewhat erratic screenplay has her going through the predictable shenanigans, including a chance encounter with Robert, a pragmatic divorce lawyer and a single father to Morgan, an Abigail Breslin-look-alike moppet who wonders if Giselle could be really a fairy princess. Of course, complications ensue with not only Robert's suspicious fiancée Nancy but also Nathaniel, who has come after Giselle upon Narissa's orders. Edward also shows up, and consequently a romantic quadrangle develops with Giselle in an unfettered search for true love.<br/><br/>Most of the musical numbers by Disney veteran Alan Menken and Broadway composer Steven Schwartz are catchy and true to the spirit of the story. ""Happy Working Song"", a vermin-infested paean to Snow White's ""Whistle While You Work"", and ""That's How You Know"", which mimics the calypso beat of The Little Mermaid's ""Under the Sea"", benefit from witty staging and Adams' surprisingly clear soprano. The only exception is the turgid love ballad near the end, ""So Close"", sung by Michael Bolton-wannabe Jon McLaughlin. Beyond Adams, James Marsden plays the hilariously misguided prince with gleeful panache, and Timothy Spall dances easily between malevolent and befuddled as the conflicted Nathaniel. Susan Sarandon is slumming as the Queen, but once she finally shows up in human form, she puts her authoritative spin and killer rack into the character. Perhaps because his character is scripted as such a downer, Patrick Dempsey makes for a lifeless romantic lead for the ebullient Adams. A couple of familiar Broadway performers show up  Idina Menzel (""Wicked"", ""Rent"") as Nancy, and Tonya Pinkins (""Caroline or Change"") as an embittered wife facing a nasty divorce.<br/><br/>The one problem I had with the movie is the drastic shift in tone during the overdone, CGI-saturated finale. While I can appreciate the female empowerment orientation being conveyed, the story could have easily ended about ten minutes earlier. Fortunately, the hand-drawn animation in the opening sequence is a fine tribute to Disney's pre-Pixar glory. Given it is from Disney, the 2008 DVD has plenty of extras beginning with a behind-the-scenes featurette, ""Fantasy Comes to Life"". Divided into three parts, it shows how the production numbers for ""Happy Working Song"" and ""That's How You Know"" came together, as well as the finale. There are six deleted scenes, all introduced by Lima, which includes a storyboard-only alternative to the opening sequence. A two-minute blooper reel is included, as well as a five-minute short for the kiddies called ""Pip's Predicament: A Pop-up Adventure"" about the daredevil chipmunk and a music video of Carrie Underwood's ""Ever Ever After"". Definitely better than I expected."

","I warned against spoilers because honestly I'm not sure what some people consider one.<br/><br/>The good news is, this is a lot like a trip to Disneyland without the lines. The bad news is, it's also like a trip there without any rides. In short, it has all the cloying sickly sweetness of the theme park in spite of trying to laugh at itself. It could be quite a good movie, in fact, I suppose it is quite a good movie. However, in spoofing some of the most common elements of fairy tales, or their Disney versions more so, they have still put in huge amounts of the sparkly candy floss cuteness that their other princessy movies ram down our throats in abundance.<br/><br/>Having been to Disneyland sometimes frequently with my children here in Orange County, I can tell you that it just brings back the feeling of sitting in front of the speakers while the parade roars by, munching churros when you'd rather have pizza, regretting the souvenirs and wondering how hard it's going to be to get to the tram and hike through the parking structure. If you have issues with corny movie music, you'll have trouble here too. I understand that a lot of it is supposed to be a joke, but danged if it doesn't feel sincere.<br/><br/>And with all that said first to help clear my head of the shock of all that sugar, I have to say that otherwise it was delightful. Not too deep, mind you, but a lot of fun. Susan Sarandon was brilliantly cast, just flawless in her performance. Evil with just the right touch of humor. Giselle was totally believable as the Disney princess, from her looks to her portrayal. James Marsden was a joy, even when he sang. He was just about the funniest thing in the film. The sight of him in full puff-sleeved period dress wearing a Statue of Liberty foam souvenir headband just got funnier the longer I looked at him. Also a highlight, the evil henchman calling Dr. Laura about his relationship with the witch. He is told to find out how she really feels about him. Cue the witch walking up and saying, ""Hello, worthless."" <br/><br/>If you like eating straight sugar or watching the motion picture equivalent and know enough about fairy tales to get common jokes about them, there's a good chance you can enjoy this movie without having to fast-forward the songs."

(I can't think of a more affectionate parody; little girls will love it, for sure, but then so will their parents).<br/><br/>It begins in a cartoon wonderland straight out of ""Snow White"" and ""The Sleeping Beauty"" but this one has an ogre, (Shrek has a lot to answer for), and a heroine who's whiter than snow. There is also a handsome prince who is clearly in love with himself, (when asked if he likes himself he replies, 'What's there not to like?'), and a wicked queen voiced, and finally brought to life, superbly, by Susan Sarandon. The film takes off when Sarandon banishes our heroine, Giselle, to present day New York, ('where there are no happy endings'), and she materializes in the form of Amy Adams who is the kookiest and most lovable klutz the movies have given us in quite a while. The only mystery is why no Oscar nomination? Of course, in New York she meets her own Prince Charming in the shape of handsome divorce lawyer Patrick Dempsey but before the inevitable happy ending they have to contend with poison apples, an old hag, (Sarandon, naturally), and a dragon, (Sarandon again). I suppose you could call it post-modern but that might put you off. (We aren't talking Bruno Bettleheim here; this isn't ""Into the Woods""). Best you just go with an open mind or better still, with an open heart. This is one movie that really is magical."
"jaybob","8","0","1","18 March 2008"," a typically, delightful fantasy from Disney
","Enchanted is a good, delightful fantasy from the studio that has made many such films.<br/><br/>The story, is what you would expect It is half real life & half animated, very silly at times,It is also romantic in the old fashioned manner. ( Very chaste & Vanilla).<br/><br/>There are a few good songs, 3 of them were nominated for an Oscar. To its credit they were done LIVE, I wish all songs were done live in films, like they used to be, Years back they always had a scene in a night club or bar, where the star or featured performer sang. (that is when it was not an actual musical comedy).<br/><br/>The acting in ENCHANTED is good, Amy Adams is our heroine, Patrick Dempsey is our real life hero, James Marsdden is our fairy tale hero, brought to life. Susan Sarandin is th evil witch, Timothy Spall is our comic relief. <br/><br/>two other performers I must mention,Patrick Dempse has a cute daughter, & little Rachel Covey is this typically delightful Disney moppet,<br/><br/>Idina Menzel is Dempsey's fiancé, I know I want to see more of this actress.<br/><br/>The film has a proper PG rating,<br/><br/>Many Disney movies should have been rated PG,some of the older ones had at least one scary scene. The running time of 103 minutes is about 15 minutes too long, It has a tendency to drag in spots, Overall, it is a good BUT not great family fun<br/><br/>Ratings *** out of 4: 86 out of 100 points: IMDb 8 out of 10"

The sexy, new to me, Amy Smart, Susan Surandend as the evil witch. Peter Pettigrew from Harry Potter and the guy from X-Men. Really cool animation that looks like old school Disney style circa Beauty and The Beast, Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, Sword In The Stone. This film then goes into the real world modern day New York city. Super cool story. Very humorous and Amy Smart is just adorable and cute. This is a kids movie but a story also about love.

I love almost everything Disney releases and this was one of the better Disney films I've seen new to DVD in a while."

This film is captivating throughout and is possibly the best film i have seen in ages. the acting is amazing, the characters are adorable, and the comical set pieces will keep me giggling for weeks to come. granted the ending was a bit rubbish but what Disney film has a good ending apart from the lion king? Anyway i would recommend this film to anyone, the only thing you will have to worry about will be how to retrieve your masculinity after enjoying such a film, n if you can watch this film n not feel good afterwards then i suggest you take a long look at your self n realise your an idiot. go see this film!!!!!"
"pc95","7","0","1","10 January 2008"," Good Comedy w/ some Original Elements and Good Performances
","I went into Enchanted with no knowledge of what the movie was about and was pleasantly surprised. Thanks in large part to James Marsden, Timothy Spall, and Amy Adams - this movie takes off. Especially for about the first 2/3 of the movie, the movie makes for a clever mix of fairy tale vs. real world logic. And a hilarious clash of naivety and chivalrous antics. (spoiler) Favorite scene was the apartment cleaning (in New York) as well. There's plenty of physical humor and the dialog and script are very well written. There are plenty of chuckles, and for me the movie was at its best when concentrating on the comedy. Some minor things that didn't work or wore out as the movie went on: the chipmunk (Pip) and the final 15 min with Susan Surandon as the evil queen who wasn't given much to work with in her defense. Anyhow this movie manages a high level of entertainment, and gets extra merits for it's energy and original elements."
"rmilljunk","7","0","1","8 January 2008"," Disney's back, and they hit the mark!
","I remember the days of Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Mermaid. Some of you out there might actually be able to remember the days of Peter Pan, but I'm afraid I can only go back as far as the early '90s...<br/><br/>Enchanted is a very goofy, playful movie full of Disney jokes that poke fun at themselves. The reason I didn't give this movie more than 7 (a ""good"" rating in my opinion) is because it definitely didn't have the same feel as their older classics, but I really appreciated how Disney took a risk at making fun of itself for the sake of producing a truly entertaining and enjoyable film.<br/><br/>The acting was overall very well done with the whole cast. Amy Adams pulled off a blank, dreamy-eyed princess near perfectly; James Marsden played a similar prince very well and I was particularly impressed after having seen him as Cyclops for so long. Timothy Spall has definitely stood out to me lately in movies and I was very pleased to watch him on screen.<br/><br/>The plot, although generally typical for a Disney movie, took me by surprise. I knew it wouldn't be terribly ""deep"" per se, but I was shocked by how intricate they were with the story. Also, the theme was quite refreshing. The whole movie gave kids (and adults alike) a good idea of how to live properly IN the reality that we all occupy, but live FOR the dreams that are in our hearts.<br/><br/>There were a couple of complaints I had; although the music was quite enjoyable I was expecting some more musical numbers and a little more variety, and I kind of hoped for a movie with a little bit less ""modern movie appeal"" attached to it.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was charming. It paid homage to classic Disney movies and it sort of revived something that we've begun to lose...a fun time at the movies."
"ayoreinf","8","0","1","8 December 2007"," I expected charming and witty I got clever as a bonus
","I got more than I expected. I went to see a charming fantasy with some promising cast members and one or two nice trailers. It started slow, witty from the start but very little emotional involvement, I was impressed with how nicely Amy Adams was portraying a cartoon but how emotionally involved can you get with a cartoon character. I was even more impress with her transition into flesh and blood and the growth of character she was showing during a rather short movie. All the cast was doing well not everybody had such a demanding role and Susan Sarandon can complain about lack of screen time even though she gets a blast from her part and it showed. But I most enjoyed the way this movie was commenting about the relations between cinema, fairy tales and real life. I can't demonstrate how well it was done without adding spoilers so you'll simply have to take my word on the subject. You may take a look at the trivia section of this internet page but all those may seem like plain movie buff jokes unless you really go and see how it all makes sense as a statement about cinema as the modern Brothers Grimm. And the movie does it without being openly philosophical, it's all done in a subtle manner in the subtext. It was more than I expected but I'm always ready to get such ""disappointments""."
"madonnawb","6","0","2","3 December 2007"," great for kids- which is all that matters I suppose
","Enchanted is a movie that combines half animation and half real life- which was quite a neat concept striking many funny scenes: like when live rats and pigeons are helping Giselle make her dress and fix around the house (although I did not like numerous shots of cockroaches in the bathtub nor do I remember cockroaches ever helping Cindarella or Giselle in any animated Disney movie). At any rate the movie starts in animation with Giselle falling in love with her prince charming (Prince Edward) and after 5 minutes of knowing each other they are to be wed. However, Edward's evil stepmother Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) wants to remain on the throne and has other plans for Giselle  mainly dispatching of her in some way- in this case pushing her into a deep well that leads to present day New York. The scenes of Giselle in New York were quite funny  she barely survives the traffic, can't find anyone to help her and gets her tiara stolen by a homeless man. Eventually she is helped by Robert (Patrick Dempsey) and his little daughter Morgan, and even though Robert is little freaked out by her appearance and mannerism, (and rightly so) he helps her around New York as well as to find her the prince charming (Edward) who also arrives to New York looking for Giselle. Now to add to the complication- Robert has a long time girlfriend who suspects Robert is cheating on her with wacky Giselle, Prince Edward thinks Robert is stealing Giselle from him, Evil Witch's helper is in town trying to poison Giselle, and as she is getting to know Robert Giselle realizes that there is more to a price charming than being valiant and heroic  chemistry is a big part of it.<br/><br/>I found Patrick Dempsey a bit dry (I could not shake off the McDreamy role), and Susan Surandon was practically useless (she has literally 5 minutes worth of dialogue). On the other hand Amy Adams was awesome as Giselle and she had most of the movie's memorable funny lines."
"stevepat99","10","0","2","2 December 2007"," My one HUMBUG with this Enchanting film - (don't think it's possible to write a real spoiler???)
","Okay, okay, the world LOVES Enchanted for 95% perfectly good reasons. So did I hence my '10' rating. However, even excellent films can be bugged. Given that one must tread very lightly when applying 'real' values to a Disney Fairy Tale my Hum Bug is, I think, never the less valid.<br/><br/>Many laud the 'lesson' the movie teaches young girls to wit: Even a man who seems to be a Prince Charming may not be the right man for you.<br/><br/>Now, if that is a LESSON then here goes lesson #2 that no one mentions:<br/><br/>Expect your true love to DUMP YOU for a woman he's met and known for a day or two and despite: 1) You've been a devoted girl friend/fiancé for FIVE YEARS <br/><br/>2)You've been faithful for five years <br/><br/>3)You are very smart,sophisticated, educated and savvy.<br/><br/>4) You are understanding, not pushing him into marriage given his history of a wife who walked out on her husband and child. <br/><br/>5) You dismiss your jealousy when you find a beautiful girl in his apartment because you TRUST him. <br/><br/>6) Even at the end, at the ball, you hope against hope that he will not betray your five year relationship. <br/><br/>7) You are simply stated a very NICE GIRL in all the right ways.<br/><br/>8) Finally, you are so depressed, all your hopes and dreams having been dashed, that you resign from the human race and take the first opportunity to jump off a roof....NO I mean jump down a man hole.<br/><br/>Why can't the writers simply have Dempsey dating his girl friend for several months instead of FIVE YEARS which is so absurd. OR use the tried and true film technique of the UNSYMPATHETIC girl friend???<br/><br/>Have any of the writers seen like Sound of Music or the all time favorite, The Parent Trap? In the latter Dennis Quaid's 10+ hottie girl friend is not only 100% deliciously evil but is also shallow, a gold digger, secretly hated his kid, was 1000% materialistic and was forever scheming for her self interest. She was a girlfriend all loved to hate, So that her day of reckoning was hilarious and welcomed by all. Such comedic writing was a high point of those and other similar comedies. WHY NOT HERE?"
"fwomp","9","0","1","2 December 2007"," Disney Making Fun Of Itself? Wow! Imagine That!
","Let me make it immediately clear that I'm not a big fan of Disney films. Most (if not all) of them are overly-schmaltzy, teach kids nothing about the real world, and are so simple a chimp could follow them. But my twin 19-year-olds (boy and a girl) wanted to check out this latest mouseketeer event. It isn't hard to imagine someone of my nature grudgingly slapping down hard-earned cash then grumpily sitting with an overpriced and over-sized box of popcorn, ready to be bored out of my mind and intellectually insulted.<br/><br/>What I got instead was a big shock. I'd obviously seen the ads for the film on television and thought, ""Ugh. Another no-brainer."" My initial concerns seemed justified as the film started and was quickly assaulted with the 2-dimensional animation we've all seen during early Disney tellings. I sank further into my chair, grumbling, ""This is super-lame."" But as the film progressed, and the animation gave way to live action characters, I began to realize that Disney was ...poking fun at itself? No. It couldn't be, could it? But yes, they did, and they did it right! This is a melting pot of animation, live-action, and animation within live-action that is seldom seen. That's a nice score for Disney. Added to this is the retelling of old fables that've become part of our movie history. A combination of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and several other commonly seen films are incorporated into ENCHANTED to give it a familiar yet equally unique story.<br/><br/>Amy Adams (TALLADEGA NIGHTS) stars as Giselle, a soon-to-be princess recently swept off her feet (literally) by Prince Edward (James Marsden, X-MEN); it's noteworthy to mention this all takes place in the early animation portions of the film. But Prince Edward's mother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon, ELIZABETHTOWN) doesn't want to give up her queenly title and throws Giselle down a ""wishing well"" on her wedding day. Giselle anti-magically reemerges near Time's Square in New York (we've now entered the live action portion of the film). Searching high and low for her castle and her future groom, Giselle quickly learns that New York is no fantasy world. Jewelry is stolen off her person by the homeless, her dress quickly becomes soiled, rain drenches her, and no one is saying friendly things or breaking into happy song.<br/><br/>Divorce attorney Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey, FREEDOM WRITERS) and his eight-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) are on their way home via cab when they discover poor Giselle. She (again) literally falls into Robert's lap and he and his daughter feel pity for this seemingly deranged woman and take her home with them to help her find a way home (via cab, subway, etc.). Robert is less than thrilled about having an attractive woman in the house as he is prepared to pop the question to his longtime girlfriend Angie (Samantha Ivers, INSIDE MAN). But Giselle falls asleep on Robert's sofa and he's forced to let her stay the night. Come morning new discoveries await Robert and his daughter. Giselle, who can normally call up all the cute and fuzzy animals of the forest to help her with household chores, decides to do the same here. But her sing-song doesn't bring cuddly rabbits and dainty deer. She's in New York City, and when her enchanting voice reaches the creatures of this land, they come in the form of cockroaches, sewer rats, and pigeons. They still help her clean up Robert's apartment, but when Robert awakens, he finds the invasion of his home by insects and rodents too much and shushes them out of his plush home. He also finds that Giselle has made a new outfit for herself out of his expensive curtains. At wits end, Robert takes Giselle to work and thrusts her needs onto the company secretary who can't find out where her home is let alone who she is.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the now unanimated Prince Edward comes to the real New York City, too, and finds it terribly difficult to locate his lost love. With him comes an assistant of the queen, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall, HARRY POTTER), who's job it is to make sure he and Giselle never meet up. Failing that, he's supposed to give Giselle a poisoned apple (in the tradition of Snow White).<br/><br/>When all fails the queen, she's forced to come to the real world, too, and does so with frightening ferocity. But can even her powers stand against true love's first kiss (a theme that runs throughout the movie)? It isn't necessarily the fairy tale items that grab movie-goers but the failing of those items by those that come from such a land where things exist and are forced into a land where reality is more brutal. The reverse obviously becomes true, too, as those who live a hardened life in the real world come to accept that having a bit of fantasy fun and believing in the unbelievable can have overwhelmingly positive results on your life, love, and your happily ever after.<br/><br/>The movie is funny beyond mention, too, with some perfectly executed scenes (including a dance sequence in Central Park, watching Prince Edward break into song only to be stopped by bicyclists plowing into him, Giselle's continued clothing designs by utilizing various items in Robert's home, Prince Edward believing a television to be a kind of magical looking glass, just to name a few).<br/><br/>The film is touching and, in the end, pretty predictable. But that didn't stop young and old from applauding when the film ended. I even found myself clapping a few times. Wow. Imagine that."

","Greetings again from the darkness. A Disney fairy tale like the old classics ... only this time brought to life! Beautiful princess to be, charming, handsome (though somewhat daft) Prince, evil witch/step-mother, bumbling henchman, lovable little creatures, all wrapped up in a fantastical love story.<br/><br/>Amy Adams (so wonderful in ""Junebug"") is magic on screen as the pure-hearted fairy tale princess-to-be who comes to life ... oddly enough in Times Square! Ms. Adams has the bright-eyed, innocence to capture the wonderment and excitement of the damsel in distress who just wants someone to be nice to her. I would love to see the Academy recognize her performance because it is worthy. Her movements and hand gestures and sparkling eyes and upbeat voice are just perfect for the role. Of course, a nomination couldn't possibly happen because this is a sweet film aimed at kids.<br/><br/>FINALLY ... Susan Sarandon is perfectly cast! She is not believable as a loyal wife or loving mother or love interest or fact finding reporter. As an evil witch/step-mother she has found her niche. I absolutely love her scenes as she first arrives in real life. James Marsden (""Hairspray"") is also very good as the slightly goofy, but well-meaning Prince come to save the poor damsel. Patrick Dempsey is along for the ride as the single dad who befriends (and maybe more!) the lost princess. Watching his face during the Central Park musical scene is pretty funny.<br/><br/>This is one that kids and parents and grandparents of all ages can enjoy. Certainly it is corny, but it is also good natured and warm-hearted ... two things we could all use a little more of."

I'm a movie-making technology buff and am amazed at how well ""Enchanted""'s film-makers held together a movie with at least ten different styles of movie-making like classic animation, live action, etc., etc. It's as if someone at the House of Mouse walked down a very long hall pulling people out of offices labelled ""Classic Animation"", ""CGI"", ""Live Casting"", ""Disney on Broadway"", etc. saying to them on the way ""We're going to make a movie called ""Enchanted"" and I want you all to work on it and I want you all to do your best work"".

Disney does a really admirable job poking fun at itself; the first few minutes of animation are exactly like a Disney movie, but more so. The songs are the catchiest Disney pieces in years. It's just so over the top without going too far, and it's both a great movie for kids and a delightful romantic comedy as well. I'd find myself laughing and crying at the same time (like the little girl asking, ""Is this what shopping with your mom is like?"")

","I must say that this is one of the best Family movies I've seen in a while. Funny, charming, likable. I don't usually write reviews, but I liked this movie so much. Amy Adams was great as Giselle, and the rest of the cast was good as well. A bit predictable in some parts, but not boring. It sucked me in, and not once during the movie was I wondering when it would be over. It's a classical Disney tale twisted, where the Prince and the Princess don't fall in love, and has a new take on a more modern romantic view. Most of the characters are likable, the slightly arrogant but ultimately kind hearted Prince. The bumbling sidekick of the Queen. The naive Princess, and the cynical, single dad divorce lawyer who falls in love with her. Also, the first movie I've ever been to where at the end the whole theater clapped."
