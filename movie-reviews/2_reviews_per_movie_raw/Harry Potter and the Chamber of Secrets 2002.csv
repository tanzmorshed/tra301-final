"BiiivAL","9","73","79","5 June 2018"," The first milestone. Sinister mystery of Hogwarts.
","""... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath.""
Book Review, December 18, 2000<br/><br/>The second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" appears before the reader's eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.<br/><br/>The magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.<br/><br/>In ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death.
Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.<br/><br/>Characters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic.
The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I'm torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.<br/><br/>""I'm sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us."" - ""Certainly.""
Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Ron Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.<br/><br/>Hermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.<br/><br/>""We are badly influenced by it.""
Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That's what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus. For the second time we stepped into this unique world full of mysteries and terrible discoveries. Music, Gothic entourage, Hogwarts and unchanging heroes in the fight against evil: welcome to the magical world of Harry Potter, created by the hand of a fabulous storyteller Joan Rowling."
"Doylenf","Null","41","49","20 June 2003"," Darker fantasy than the first Potter film...brisk despite its length...
","Prepare yourself for a darker fantasy this time with some harrowing and scary special effects. Apparently J.K. Rowling has hit upon the fact that kids love to be scared stiff along with being entertained by touches of humor and excitement--although I think her imagination works overtime on scenes like the vomiting fit for Ron, one of the more tasteless sequences.<br/><br/>And apparently the makers of this Potter film have met the challenge of providing spiders and snakes that are hideous enough to have Ron and the audience in a fit of hysterics. It's all here--the main events anyway of the Rowling book--and for extra measure they've given a much needed humorous role to Kenneth Branagh who has great fun with his role as the self-loving Gilderoy Lockhart. The only real drawback is that Maggie Smith has very little to do--but the main chores belong to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint who continue to charm as the three leads. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy has a commanding presence and an amusingly wicked final scene involving the computer created Dobby who steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Should keep Potter fans happy--and for a movie two-and-a-half hours long it moves along at a brisk pace from one adventure to another with what by now appears to be mechanical skill, thanks to artful direction by Chris Columbus who knows how to keep this sort of thing moving. John Williams' perky score is a distinct help."
"Cheese-18","8","100","130","9 November 2002"," I want more!!!
","Chris Columbus said he wanted to make a 2,5 hour movie that feels like 30 Minutes. Well, in my case he surely succeeded! I saw the movie as a member of the press and couldn't get enough of it. I would have gladly sat in the cinema for another two or three hours with a biiiig smile on my face.<br/><br/>Like part one, ""chamber of secrets"" stays true to the book. I don't know about you - but I HATE it when movie makers change the storylines, add or remove characters and do it for the ""sake of the art"". I think they do it because they are too lazy to create their own storys, so they rip off other peoples ideas and crush them to make it more comfortable... If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. Chris Columbus has captured the essence of the book on screen. So, after ""philosophers stone"" he delivered again!<br/><br/>When reading the book I always envisioned Michael Crawford playing Gilderoy Lockhart. His broad smile and clumsiness Ã  la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. But instead we get to see Kenneth Branagh, so of course you won't see ME complain. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. In his short scenes onscreen he makes your blood freeze. And again: all the casting is brilliant. Every character just feels right - even if you imagined something different when you read the book. There also has been talk about the young actors getting older. Well, let me remind you that this also happens in the books. In every book Harry Potter and his friends are one year older. So there's no excuse to take the roles away from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. I couldn't imagine someone else playing their parts.<br/><br/>Go see ""the chamber of secrets"". It's pure fun and excitement! And it will wet your appetite for more to come. Richard Harris couldn't have asked for a better movie and legacy to be remembered by."
"siit","7","7","7","21 January 2006"," That bit of magic returns
","The second installment seems to carry on where the first left off. All previous characters return and then some!! The grandiose majesty of Harry Potter continues with new tricks, new delights and little treats that can be taken for granted. At times I find the Harry Potter world has so many wonderful things happening at the same time that you tend to overlook the smaller things (ergos the Weasley's residence and the great Hall) The Chamber of Secrets is a darker tail but is well within the tolerances of most children's ability to handle. The creatures are excellent, the overall story is easy enough to follow, though some aspects have to be explained to younger children.<br/><br/>What does get annoying is that constant overused Daniel Radcliffe cheesy smile. It wears on the sensibilities after a while like sharp finger nails scraping down a blackboard. Overall though, Chamber of Secrets is a solid good natured magical movie only slighter less pleasing than the first."
"ivony","9","14","16","17 May 2003"," A wonderful journey into a world where magic is, indeed, real.
","Having three daughters I have a choice when a great book comes out:  buy three of them (EXPENSIVE!!), force someone to wait until the other is done before they can read the book (sure, I enjoy breaking up fights!), or read it to them.  I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did!  Naturally, the kids were excited when the movie came out.  However, when I saw the first Harry Potter, I was terrified it was going to be ""butchered"" like most ""books to movies"" are; but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively ""stick to the book"" script it displayed.  Sure, some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints, but overall, it conveyed the story well.<br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets did this even better.<br/><br/>As an avid reader, I am quite hesitant to see my beloved books displayed on screen only to have the directors do them no justice.  However, with both Harry Potter movies, the visuals were spectacular, the acting well done, and the characters almost perfectly matched.  The set design for Diagon Alley and the Weasley house was fabulous!  How wonderful to see these places come to life outside of our imaginations!  This stays true for nearly every aspect of Hogwarts...from the greenhouse, to the moving staircases, the dorms and Dumbledore's office.  <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson do superb jobs of playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  The movie undoubtedly draws you in and makes you forget that this isn't real...quite an acheivement!<br/><br/>Of course, not all moviegoers will enjoy this one.  It is not for the die-hard action fan, the horror-only fans, or those that dislike a bit of magic, imagination, and fantasy.  But for the rest of us, Chamber of Secrets accurately depicts what until now, only our imaginations could see. Children will love this for the wizardry and magic, the struggle between Harry and his foes, the friendships that abound, and the simple fun of it all; while adults will love it for bringing them back to a time when magic was, indeed, real.<br/><br/>All in all, I give this a 5 out of 5...fantastically done.  Of course, I would have liked to see a bit more scenes from the book added, but I understand time restrictions.  Great film and a definite must see!"
"cp74","Null","79","111","10 November 2002"," A great sequel!
","If you liked the first one then you're going to love this!  There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including Gilderoy Lockhart (hilariously played by Kenneth Branagh), Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius (a great performance by Jason Isaacs, exactly how I imagined the character from the books!), Ron's father, Arthur, and the mysterious Dobby the house elf (fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies, but I won't name any names... *cough*JarJarBinks*cough*)<br/><br/>The movie sticks closely to the novel, but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters, especially the hate-hate relationship between Harry and Professor Snape (who was seriously underused in this movie!)<br/><br/>All in all it's definitely worth checking out, the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it.  By the way, whatever you do DO NOT leave until the credits have ended, otherwise you'll miss a little extra treat..."
"swright-3","10","58","81","10 November 2002"," The story starts here!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a huge step on from the first film.  In the Philosophers stone we were introduced to the the world of Harry Potter and given a taster of what lies ahead.  <br/><br/>In the Chamber of Secrets the main story line for the series of books really starts to be told.  It is much darker and sinister than the first film and Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give good performances and give us a glimpse of the fine actors they are becoming.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs are perfectly cast as Gilderoy Lockhart and Lucius Malfoy and truly bring the characters from the book to life.  Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley while under used in this film is going to be great in the next few as his character has more to do.  The Cinematography is again superb and somehow the Quiddich game is better than in the first film.  <br/><br/>A fine sequal to the first film and should dispel any notion that the first one was just a one hit wonder.  <br/><br/>A firm 10 in my book."

","This beast of a film felt like it's writers and directors were drunk children and I love that!!!! The film's childish makers made this film truly magical and a spectacular sight to behold with unlimited creativity, this film has no limits, the characters feel invincible and gives the viewer a great special feeling of being invincible if they were on the sexy island known as Great Britain."
"EVANOC","7","41","57","1 December 2002"," Character palette and story drives me to read the books
","A lot has been made about the pubescence of the three leads in this new Harry Potter installment and it is a bit disconcerting when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) speak their first lines in those awkward cracks of pre-adolescence.  However, their growing up, along with the physical blossoming of their friend Hermione (the perky and smart actress Emma Watson) seem mark a general growing up of the whole Harry Potter series.  This one is more for grown-ups:  the first one hooked the kid demographic and no doubt they will still be enraptured by ""Chamber of Secrets.""  This is the film, however, that hopes to attract a whole new audience in the parents of those kids.  It is darker and has more layers. The explanations about wizardry are less cursory and the acting seems stronger.<br/><br/>I have never read the books so I bring an outlook to the films that is free of personal bias toward the quality of the adaptation or the faithfulness to Rowling's words.  One thing this film does do, that the first one did not, is it made me want to read the books.  I was more drawn in, in a literary sense, to the world, to the stories, and particularly to the characters. Whereas the first film was a passable introduction to everything Harry Potter is about, this seems like a deeper riff on some of the same themes that the first one only glossed over.<br/><br/>However, I might not have enjoyed Chamber of Secrets as thoroughly if I had not first seen Sorcerer's Stone.  It gave me (and Chris Columbus' production team) a framework that invited expansion.  Without the background of the first film, I might not have been as emotionally invested in Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), or have understood the mechanics of ""Quidditch,"" or even have cared about the tenuous future of Hogwarts School for Wizards.<br/><br/>In a word, the performances are ""marvelous.""  I read somewhere that Rowling wrote with a Dickensian sense of character and that seems to carry over to the film.  Robbie Coltrane as the affable Hagrid is still my favorite. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are woefully underused in this film but I can only hope they will resurface in the others; they can still steal their scenes with the tiniest pursing of the lips or eye flickers.  (As a side note:  Outside of Coltrane's Hagrid, I find Rickman's Professor Snape the most interesting and multi-layered character across both films).  Richard Harris is suitably noble and wily in one of his last roles.  And Kenneth Branagh, as the egomaniacal new Hogwarts professor and author of wizardry books, is perfectly cast and very funny.  One thing this film does is allow room to explore these characters in a full sense and give the audience time to get under their skin.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus has been called a tactless director and I can see where some of his scenes, particularly the action ones, are played so broadly that they lose all semblance of meaning.  He is not particularly adept at handling the young actors, who come across as pretty bland and uninteresting (Rupert Grint as Ron is sort of annoying, overplaying the stuff that was likeable at first).  Likewise, he is unable to invigorate some of the scenes (the car scenes, the spider scene, and even the final encounter between Harry and the Chamber of Secrets' monster) come off as overlong and particularly flat. The running time of 2 hours and 41 minutes is a bit exorbitant:  To me it just suggests that Columbus doesn't have the necessary audacity to deviate too much from Rowling's source material.  I know that he has to maintain a certain level of faithfulness to the books but, to be honest, what is exciting on the page does not always translate well onscreen.  Perhaps Alfonso Cuaron, slated to direct the new film, will have a better, snappier sense of how to energize the action scenes without losing the obvious positives of sticking to the novels.<br/><br/>However, the movie did energize me enough to want to go and read the books. The scope, the palette of, yes, Dickensian characters, and the intertwining of stories makes me want to see how Rowling fits it all together.  Then maybe I'll be able to talk more intelligently about faithfulness when Cuaron releases `Prisoner of Azkaban.'  Maybe I'll undergo a massive reading program this holiday season."
"Aberlass","8","66","97","8 November 2002"," The Chamber of Secrets has been opened at long last!!!!
","Lessons learned since the 1st film! Clearly this film was edited at script stage rather than the cutting room floor stage!! This story reads as film narrative, rather than a book illustration, which was the big mistake of the 1st film. Anyone can watch this film and follow it without knowing the book. The 1st hour is pure laugh out loud fun (the adults in my Cinema audience were shouting with laughter!). The last hour is scary, wand dropping tension.<br/><br/>The problem is: how do we convince muggles put-off by the 1st film to go see this one? Why should they give this one a chance? Answer: If you know someone who likes Fun, make them see this film! This film is not about 'Oscars' & Acting, despite the fabulous performances by all the adults, it is about enjoying the overall effect of the film, this being to give the viewer a long lasting buzz. Brilliant! The staging is very theatrical in it's minimalism, yet extravagantly arty in visual specifics. In the not to distant future I see fans going to a regular weekend slot at their local cinema for Audience Participation fun. Wands, swords, sorting hat, spiders, mandrakes & crucial ear muffs as standard props! Lots of gaps for us to shout out funny quips. A Rocky Horror Show Audience Participation Show for kids! Long overdue.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10. Not a masterpiece of cinematic potential, but such jolly good fun that no one should be denied the joy of a ""Bloody Marvelous"" frolic. A film for the child within us adults. Go see it with a predominantly adult audience if you want to experience the real buzz of unfettered emotion. Only three children were present at the Preview I witnessed and they were silently spellbound whereas the adults evoked emotion noisily throughout and then stood up, cheered and applauded at the end! I shall never forget this truly magical experience.<br/><br/>
Richard Harris you can not be replaced, you will always be Dumbledore, and hence Omnipresent. Thank you for the fantastic finale to a wonderful life that you gave us. Thank you. And Thank you JK & Chris. You did it, the Chamber is well & truly open now!"
"aussie-21","8","58","86","8 November 2002"," Not the target of this movie...but still enjoyable.
","Not being a fan of the Harry Potter Movies, I toddled along to the first showing of this movie at my local UGC Cinema and sat down and thirly enjoyed this movie, but not in the way that I would enjoy something like the Lord of The Rings or Spider-Man. Of course Harry Potter's target audience is of a younger age so I can see how I might not have enjoyed it as much as a slightly younger audience, but to say the least it is a lot better than some of the crap that is fizzled out these days. <br/><br/>Crap this is not and a year on the main characters are a lot older, taller and voices broken. Many of the original cast return and a few new characters appear in this such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs. Kenneth Branagh plays a wonderful part of Gilderoy Lockhart who seems to think he's adored by all and quite frankly he is adored by women for his charm and bravery. He was one of the better bits in the movie as was Jason Isaacs who played Lucius Malfoy father of Draco.  Jason sports a nice long wig and plays the evil father/villian down to a T.  He plays it much like his villian in The Patriot. I was sometimes phased by Rupert Grint's ""Ron"". He isn't that great an actor, but he could play his part satisfactory. He could have done better, but then again I have not read the book so I would not know how Ron would have behaved. I guess the scenes he played a scary person (which was quite a lot) in weren't convincing enough for me, but kids should get a good laugh out of him more than I did. I suppose you can't hold it against the kids who aren't up to par because they're just young and learning the actors trade, but for those who play their part well they should get a pat in the back. <br/><br/>The SFX were impressive, especally the character of Dobby. He was well great. I couldnt tell he was CG by his bad creation, but through the fact there was no way they could have done it otherwise. In fact the CG character of Dobby is very similar looking to Gollum in Lord of The Rings and the CG Asgard in television series Stargate SG-1 (speaking of textures) which which speaks well for Stargate SG-1 if it can do just as good as a top movie like this...and top it is. The CG Spiders were incredibly creepy and realistic looking. Not being too scared of Spiders, they kind of made me jump. I felt by body tense up as the gave case to Harry and Ron, which is a good thing because not often do I find myself doing this in movies. The person I had sat beside seemed pretty scared of the spiders as well.<br/><br/>
John Williams score was very much like his original score with old themes returning and some of the music sounding like music from his Indiana Jones scores. I found myself whistling the main theme of Harry Potter for most of the night and on occasion not realizing I was doing it until someone else pointed it out to me.  <br/><br/>This movie certainly had better action sequences and a lot more action geared than The 1st Potter movie. I found myself clenching up at points as they were really tense. The story wasn't too difficult to understand from a non-potter-fan point of view and the film was a lot shorter than I expected. I had thought it ran for three hours when it was more like 2 1/2. In some cases I found that you had to have seen the 1st movie to understand some of what was going on, but that was mainly due to the back story of he who shall not be uttered and some of the gags. The only thing that annoyed me was that the cues in the Foyer were too long and I couldnt get an ice cream and there was some little toddler crying down the front row for a few minutes mid-way. Why bring a toddler who's going forget about the film by next week? You may ask this yourself.  <br/><br/>If you're not a mad-potter-fan then I would suggest you wait a few weeks so that you're not over run with humans who stand 4 feet tall...ie. CHILDREN! (I'm not talking about Dwarves)<br/><br/>I'd give it 8.5/10. But I am not a huge fan of these movies and I am not the target audience.  That's a good thing in case you were wondering."

"chicamanticore","Null","5","5","17 November 2002"," I absolutely LOVED this movie
","This movie is way better than the first one, which everyone is saying because--let's face it--it's true. The three leads have grown into their characters, and their acting is loads better. I kept thinking during the first one, ""Aw, look at these cute little kids playing Harry, Ron and Hermione."" Now they ARE Harry, Ron and Hermione, though they still won't get any Oscar nods. All the new characters were absolutely wonderful. I was not disappointed at all with a single one, even Dobby. Now, I know a lot of people compare him to another CGI character, but he's not like that at all. I loved Dobby, even though when I saw him the trailers I thought I was going to hate him. Jason Isaacs as Malfoy was an absolute slime ball, and just so deliciously evil. Not bad looking, either, especially with his luscious long blonde hair. Bonnie Wright returned as Ginny Weasley, who had a much more important part and did an excellent job, I was very impressed. I'm tempted to go on about the lovely Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle, and Kenneth Branaugh, who embodies Gilderoy Lockhart on the screen, but this review has a word limit. Even if you are not a massive Harry Potter fan, you will find this movie very enjoyable. It's scary (spiders, snakes, and willows, oh my!) and incredibly funny, thanks to Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and of course Kenneth Branaugh, the incredibly pompous new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Back to the subject of the three leads, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione). They have grown quite a bit since the last film, though it's not a bad thing-Harry and his friends are supposed to grow too. Girls are starting to notice how good-looking Harry has become, and Ron, who is still adorable, and Hermione is becoming very pretty. I was pleased to see that her appearance was more like it was described in the books-she even had big teeth. Ron is finally taller than the other two like he's supposed to be, but that's most likely due to Rupert being older. I only had one disappointment as a major Potter fan-Sean Biggerstaff. While I believe he is absolutely dreamy and am in love with him, he just didn't come across as the mad, maniacal Wood we've grown to love. A consolation for some of the die-hard fans who might find the movie a little fast when they first see it-see it twice. The second time is so much more enjoyable, I can't tell you why, but you'll love it. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, from the scary gothic kid who sits next to me in fourth period to my work-a-holic father, it's great. I can't wait to see it again with my mother, who was away this weekend. I've already seen it twice, and it's only been out for three days. I can guarantee that you'll enjoy it, even if you didn't like the first one-which I personally find odd, but slightly understandable. Slightly. Go see Chamber of Secrets!"
"MaxBorg89","8","36","53","20 November 2005"," Back to school, Mr. Potter: a superior second installment
","Having done a good job with the first Harry Potter flick, one shouldn't be surprised Chris Columbus was asked to direct the sequel as well. And the second film actually improves on its predecessor, getting a little edgier and less children-friendly (two factors that raise exponentially with each new installment), even though it does repeat an old mistake in certain places.<br/><br/>So, what about the plot? Well, it's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts, and everything should be fine, given he defeated Voldemort in the previous film and there are no other threats lurking in the magical world. Or are there? A mysterious house elf named Dobby seems to think so, as he repeatedly tries to prevent Harry from returning to school and keeps asking him to leave when students start being attacked by a supernatural, unknown foe. All this seems to be connected to the Chamber of Secrets, but that isn't of much help, especially considering the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, famous writer Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), is a complete idiot.<br/><br/>Darker and faster, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets repeats the Philosopher's Stone's mistake of being slightly too faithful to the literary source, but Columbus manages to compensate this flaw with better visuals, some really creepy set-ups and improved acting from the younger cast members (Emma Watson in particular). He has also made interesting choices when it comes to the new faces in the adult group: Branagh is very, very funny as the ego-fueled Lockhart (a role originally intended for Hugh Grant), but the most interesting addition is Jason Isaacs (whom I can't wait to see again in the fourth film) as Lucius Malfoy, an intriguingly sinister wizard who is as racist and arrogant as his son, Harry's arch-nemesis Draco. As for Dobby, a CG creature voiced by Toby Jones, he is interesting at first but rapidly becomes annoying, his masochistic antics being repetitive and a little dull.<br/><br/>Finally, a special mention for Chamber's best element: Richard Harris, who sadly passed away a few weeks before the movie's premiere. He was, and is, incredibly good as headmaster Dumbledore and despite a worthy replacement (Michael Gambon), in the purists' hearts he will always be the one and only greatest wizard of all time.<br/><br/>Verdict: good, but they could have done better.

","I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn't overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It's not ""Lord Of The Rings,"" of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I've seen now.<br/><br/>I don't buy into all the occult baloney and black magic stuff, just enjoying the special-effects that go with it with these stories. It also was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff (""Harry""), Emma Watson (""Hermione"") and Rupert Grint (""Ron"") have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. ""Ron"" squeaks half the time he talks!<br/><br/>As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. Definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language."
"thinkinfairytales","10","48","79","19 November 2002"," Stop knocking this masterpiece
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superb, and don't listen to those narrow-minded critics who claim otherwise. Those who said it is superior to the first film are right: Philosopher's Stone was wonderful but the sequel does for Harry Potter what the Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars - elevate it to a higher level where it will be regarded as a masterpiece in it's own right.<br/><br/>The plot is tighter and 'cleaner' then the first film, and runs along at a pace brisk enough to sweep the two-hours away with the wave of a wand. The acting from Daniel Radcliffe was criticised by some in the first film and still others are bleating on about him now. Give it a rest, say I. He was excellent.<br/><br/>Hogwarts itself really comes to life, largely due to the camera shots sweeping in through a window or over the castle - it feels a lot more 'rounded' and the Quidditch match benefits from a makeover and improved SFX.<br/><br/>Unlike some other fantasy films the CGI is not over used and doesn't smother the screen.<br/><br/>If you've read other reviews you'll know Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as Lockhart (and you have to stay to the end credits to see what happens to him)Jason Isaacs is great as Lucius Malfoy, and overall the film is scarier and darker then the first film, and there is a very touching moment involving Hermione and Ron which was performed with wonderful understatement by Rupert and Emma.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole 2 hours I don't think I stopped smiling. The Whomping Willow, the flying car, the duel between Draco and Harry - every scene was a joy to behold.<br/><br/>To those critics who keep on comparing Potter to Lord of the Rings and finding the former wanting (one person even laughingly suggested Christopher Columbus was ripping it off)bear in mind that Philospher's Stone is the second biggest film of all time behind Titanic - beating Rings. I use this only to illustrate the popularity and success of Harry Potter, as so many people seem to find it inferior. I for one was left cold by Rings and was thoroughly bored by it - it was the least magical fantasy film I had ever seen. Give me Harry Potter any day.<br/><br/>Anyone who rates this film poorly (comparing it to Rings no doubt as they always do) has no sense of adventure, no sense of humour, and -most importantly - no sense of wonder.<br/><br/>So put that in your cauldron and boil it!"
"funkyfry","6","7","9","13 August 2007"," OK, but I think for fans only
","""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is, unfortunately, not one of the best Harry Potter movies despite (or perhaps because of) sticking relatively closely to J.K. Rowling's original novel (IMHO one of the better in the series). Some parts feel overlong and others too short, and there are signs that director Chris Columbus was growing fatigued in his second (and final) entry in the series.<br/><br/>Overall I think we have a good fantasy film here. Other than Rupert Grint's Ron (Grint's whole range of facial expressions seem to consist of scrunching up his face in a Spielbergian ""ewwwww"" pose) the young actors were growing well into their roles, and the new adult performers are excellent. Kenneth Branagh is well-cast as the pompous celebrity wizard Guilderoy Lockhart, hired as the kids' second ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" professor. The particular standout here is new cast member Jason Isaacs, who is the very image of petty evil as Lucius, the father of Potter's nemesis Draco Malfoy. Some parents might feel Lucius' treatment of servant, the house-elf Dobby, is overly harsh but it introduces an important theme for the series. Contrary to what I'm tempted to think the film producers would like, ""Harry Potter"" isn't just an action-fantasy story. This story introduces the important concept of ""mud-bloods"" (wizards with one or more non-wizard parent) and the theme of prejudice and bigotry shown by ""pure-blood"" wizards towards them.<br/><br/>Other than that there's not that much to talk about. There's more Quiddich, more mystery and intrigue. This story has quite a few more horrific elements than the first, ranging from giant spiders to a spell that makes Ron vomit slugs. Hermione (Emma Watson) disappears for much of the film's running time under an evil spell, requiring Ron and Harry to think for themselves for once. The ending feels like a generic action scene in any Hollywood film, failing to capture the magic that the book did. Of course some of this is just the fault of actually being too close to the book. Dumbledore's phoenix clawing out the basilisk's eyes is an exciting concept but as a CGI on screen (particularly since they chose to make the phoenix awfully small) it just looks silly.<br/><br/>One last word on the Gambon vs. Harris as Dumbledore controversy. Honestly as much as I respect Harris I just think he looked tired in this film and failed to capture the kind of energy that Dumbledore needs to have. Harris probably would have been an excellent Dumbledore if he had been healthyÂ he's got all the screen presence that you need but none of the humor at this point in his career. I saw the first 4 movies before reading the books, and at first I felt Gambon was getting too goofy, losing the gravitas of the character. But after reading through the books I see that Gambon's performance is actually closer to what Rowling wrote. Harris' wizard is a bit more of a generic wise authority figure, where Gambon catches more of the particular side of Dumbledore that is sometimes wreckless and can be disarmingly whimsical Â traits that make him seem less ""authoritative"" but certainly more human, and are of increasing importance in the 6th and 7th books.<br/><br/>All in all, I would argue that this film (like most of the others in the series) functions very well as a companion to the book but not so well as a stand-alone film for those who haven't read the series. Speaking as one who has seen the film both before and after reading the books I guess I should know. It's not a bad film, especially for those familiar with the details of the story that are left out which add depth (but which are not contradicted by the film for the most part), but it was a wise choice of the producers to hire a new director for the 3rd (and IMHO best so far)."
"cammyd99","9","3","3","12 August 2017"," Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets Review
","This movie is similar to the original adaptation but it's better in every single way and I was surprised on how well it's aged. This film is a lot more mature than the first one while still having a lighthearted tone and balancing that with very dark messaging throughout the whole film. A lot of people criticized it for not following the book properly but that's where I think it really works in this films favor. I don't understand why you would want to have it viewed for what the book did. If it's a movie. It should be it's own thing rather than cram everything together in to a mess of a production like ""Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire"" where too much of the book gets thrown in to the film and a lot of things ended up not making sense.<br/><br/>Chamber Of Secrets has a half an hour setup starting in the Dursleys house again but a peasant elf named Dobby warns that Harry Potter should not go back to Hogwarts this year as something as he would be put in danger. The Dursleys house scene is a lot more entertaining this time as there's something that looks so visually improved from the first one in fact no scratch that. I confuses me to how everyone looks past this film and dismisses it as 'too similar to the first' where it actually does look from a technical standpoint a lot better than the first. <br/><br/>around 30 minutes of a very entertaining setup with a flying car scene and crashing in to the 'Womping WIllow' they finally arrive at Hogwarts. This movie has a lot of wondering around. There is not a great hall scene this time as you already seen that in the first film. Another reason as to why this is in no way too similar to philosophers stone. Instead of setting things up for the next movie. This film is not a drag. It doesn't take it's time and gets right in to what's important. The reason why I love this film so much is because it's completely focused on what the chamber Of Secrets is and is the only one to live up to it's name besides Prisoner of Askaban. The pacing is just perfect here. Chris Columbus really knew how to make a flawed formula great. <br/><br/>Gilderoy Lockhart is the new defense against the dark arts teacher and I know people have problems with him but honestly? he gives the film so much charm and personality. He's entertaining to say the least. There are creepy sequences with voices saying 'kill' 'kill' It's really effective and chilling which leads me to another thing this movie did right. Atmosphere. There is even a scene where Professor McGonagall explains the origins of the Chamber Of Secrets and it's probably the most effective scene in the film. <br/><br/>There is a really cool scene not long after which involves Harry communicating with a book getting took back 50 years before and learns more about the chamber.<br/><br/>There is a short section of the film where they go and fight a bunch of spiders (which got me a little freaked as I have arachnophobia myself) and then when Harry Manages to get in to the Chamber Of Secrets. He finds out that the person who opened the chamber was Ginny...but because Tom Riddle. The man from the past in the book Harry opened who revealed himself as Lord Voldemort. through a smart scene where he directly spells out his name then there is one of the most epic scenes in film history the basilisk fight. Harry manages to save Ginny and get out while Tom gets defeated by Harry stabbing his Quill in to the book. And your telling me this is the worst Harry Potter film?<br/><br/>The ending rehashes the 1st ones ending but it goes out with a band this time. Instead it ends with a camera shot zooming out of the great hall of Hogwarts and then it ends. It's just as epic as you think it sounds. This film is so overlooked and does not get the respect it deserves. <br/><br/>This film isn't flawless as it's own film though as there are problems. Molly says Ginny's jumper is on the cat? Seriously?<br/><br/>Overall I would say this is definitely my favorite Harry Potter film. Always will be. I didn't even mention half of the things that went on in this movie that make it so original and unique. I loved every single second of this film. It's one of my favorite films of all time and it's not just Columbus nostalgia keeping this one alive. Daniel Radcliffe who never really 'acted' much in the first one but in this. He's excellent. This is where his acting started to shine. This is where Columbus formula would perfect and would go in a different direction with a change of directors for the other masterpiece and next entry known as Prisoner Of Askaban. Harry Potter and The Chamber Of Secrets is the perfect balance between dumb, absurd and epic and that's why it makes it the best Harry Potter movie in the series for me but Prisoner a close second."
"cruiseee","Null","3","3","10 November 2002"," Better than the first Harry Potter.
","I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan, but I really did enjoy 'the chamber of secrets'.  After seeing the first installment of the Harry Potter saga I wasn't quite sure what to make of it all.  I never hated it, nor loved it, but I can honestly say that it hadn't left any impression on me.<br/><br/>However, this second installment was a vast improvement on the first.  The movie moves a lot quicker & goes straight into the story without any faffing about.  I guess there's little need for introductions as we already know of most of the main characters.<br/><br/>The kids' acting appears to have improved a hell of a lot.  Looks like they've gained more confidence, and it really shows, which is great for us as they're much more entertaining to watch now.<br/><br/>The ending to this movie was also a great improvement from the last film, with a more believable baddie and more terrifying monsters.<br/><br/>All in all, I was impressed with this film, more so when I compare to the first one.  Others may disagree.  I don't care!  This is a kids film, after all."

","""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is more of the same from Chris Columbus, the man who brought the first Harry Potter book to film: dutifully committed to pleasing fans of the book resulting in completely uninspired filmmaking.<br/><br/>Though if Columbus had to direct any of the Potter films, I'm glad he was assigned the first two, before the series turned dark. Columbus's style fits the bubble-gum kiddie movie tone of the first two books, but would have been completely mismatched with the later installments.<br/><br/>The fun of all the Harry Potter movies lies in seeing what big-time British talent will pop up as the various adult characters, and in this one it's Kenneth Branagh as the preening Gilderoy Lockhart who gets most of the fun.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"Niv-1","9","6","8","24 June 2003"," Zooms Along
","Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever. So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon. <br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets is about Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year in Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry and something is attacking the students. The fact that these students are of mixed parentage, one being a muggle(non-magical and the other being a witch or wizard) leads to a very unstable environment at Hogwarts. <br/><br/>Directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves this movie packed with the details that Rowling weaves throughout her book. The score by John Williams is excellent and well suited to the movie. Roger Pratt's cinematography is amazing. There is flashback to an earlier time at Hogwarts by way of a magical Diary that is brilliantly lit and shot in a sepia tone that looks just like the color of old paper. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh gives a great performance that should have gotten more attention at award time. Jason Isaacs owns the role of the villainous Lucius Malfoy. His costuming and look are very well matched with that of Draco Malfoy, a nemesis of Harry's. Shirley Henderson as a ghost is also very good and steals her scenes. Returnees Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, and in particular the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore are very good. Christian Coulson does a good job as the  mysterious Tom Riddle.<br/><br/>
Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) are very good in this movie and have their characters down. Watson in particular is excellent. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in an underrated movie that is a must see."
"cosmic_quest","5","23","44","2 April 2006"," You're bland, Harry...
","The second in the Harry Potter franchise, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was clearly intended for small children. While this approach did work with 'The Philosopher's Stone' as the happy, Disney -esque atmosphere reflected Harry's idealism of a wizarding world that was perfect, a slightly moody and mature tone would have been far more suitable for CoS since this is when our Boy Who Lived starts to realise the darker side of being a wizard and being a hero. In this film, twelve-year-old Harry is now in his Second Year at Hogwarts when the school is subjected to mysterious attacks that leave Muggleborn students incapacitated. Harry, Ron and Hermione quickly learn a creature is stalking the school, a monster that lives in a secret chamber and was once responsible for the death of a child.<br/><br/>The quality of the child acting still leaves much to desired, with Rupert Grint and Tom Felton shining out above their weaker contemporaries. It is left to the adult cast to provide the solid performances, which they do to a marvellous degree. Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Snape seem born to play their roles, bringing their characters to life in a way the child actors just can't do. Kenneth Branagh is a treat as the conceited, campy Lockhart and the scenes where he and Rickman's Snape play each other off are the best in the film. Jason Issacs also deserves a mention since he was deliciously evil as Lucius Malfoy. He and Tom Felton not only look like father and son but in a minute-long scene they were able to portray Draco's hero-worship of his father and Lucius' impatience with his son.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull, bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him at the barest of evidence, scriptwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus seem intent on making the film a magical version of an Enid Blyton boarding school where kids merrily skip around solving problems. The vain attempts to make the film threatening, such as the overly-long flying car scene (as if anyone thought Harry was going to fall out) and the trudge through the Forbidden Forest, are flat and weak. The final battle between Harry and his unmasked enemy are also lacklustre with no spontaneity and drag on for too long. Character development hasn't improved much either with Ron continuing to be dumbed down for comic relief while we have Hermione getting Ron and Dumbledore's lines (and in the case of the latter, it just sounds odd hearing words of wisdom said by an powerful, elderly wizard in the book being uttered by a child of twelve in the film).<br/><br/>CoS also drops a number of points, in my mind, for the crass, cheesy overly-sentimentality of the ending. Steve Kloves must have been in Hollywood saccharine mode when he thought that pupils in British high schools would honestly clap for teachers (especially ones who have done nothing to warrant such praise) and kids hugging teachers in front of everyone. Harry would have been beaten up and bullied for being a boy of twelve who cuddles into his teacher like a wimpy little girl. And the preceding scene where Lucius confronts Harry was also cavity-inducing with the modest hero of the novels coming across as an arrogant, smug little brat. Kloves not only needs to re-read the book but he should spend more time with real kids at high school if this is how he thinks they conduct themselves.<br/><br/>While CoS was enjoyable enough, it was still a mediocre take of the novel. It was evident that it was produced to keep little kids happy rather than a love for the series or to please the actual fans. I did like it but I still feel so envious of the LotR fans who get an epic film trilogy that matches up to the excellence of books and I wonder if HP will ever be that great."
"hnt_dnl","10","4","5","10 October 2009"," The best Harry Potter film?
","Not originally a fan of this series (really, not interested), I've got to say that I now see the widespread appeal of these Harry Potter movies! I actually first saw GOBLET OF FIRE (2005) when it premiered on cable the year after it's release and liked it enough to want to start watching this series. Then when ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) came out 2 years later, I liked it, but it seemed to get really dark and serious more so than GoF and I really needed perspective in understanding the trajectory of these HP films. I went out and bought the 5-disc collection of SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZBAKAN, GOBLET OF FIRE, and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. It's apparent these films are purposefully getting darker as they move along, some staying very true to the source material, some taking liberties.<br/><br/>Of the 5-disc set, I actually think this film, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, may be the best! I still like the other 4 for different reasons, but here's some reasons why I rate this one so high: <br/><br/>*Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry Potter, improved immensely from the first film to this one! In SS, you could really tell the 12-year old youngster was a bit nervous and awestruck at having to carry the load of this franchise on his shoulders! Radcliffe, while adorably cute along with his co-stars Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) in SS, really needed to step it up in CoS and he did in spades! In CoS, 13-year old Radcliffe obviously established that he IS Harry Potter! <br/><br/>*The film's length is not a bother! When a film this long (over 2 1/2 hours?) can sustain itself and hold your attention without ever devolving into boredom or tedium, that is saying something! Especially when it's led by 3 kids! Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson deserve all praise! <br/><br/>*Kenneth Branagh's delightfully fun performance as new Defense Against the Dark Arts Prof. Gilderoy Lockhart! This is the role that gets changed from film to film and Branagh's Lockhart is probably the best! <br/><br/>*Christian Coulson as 16-year old Tom Riddle! This young actor was my favorite villain in all the films, even over Voldemort!...Uh, don't worry, I know what the big surprise was at the climax! Still, young Riddle was such an elegant, charming, devious, cold sort that I couldn't help but be enthralled by his commanding presence.<br/><br/>*The climactic showdown between Harry and Tom was suspenseful and epic! Who'd have thought a scene between two teenagers would be as involving, deep, and exciting as any showdown between two adults? And they used words as weapons just as much as action and never sounded preachy or boring! An accomplishment indeed! <br/><br/>*Of course, the adult cast the late great Richard Harris (Prof. Dumbledore, played by Michael Gambon in the later films), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) carry their loads in professional, brilliant fashion and allow the young actors to have their shining moments. Jason Isaacs was a great addition as Lucius Malfoy, a new foil for Harry Potter and the father of little Draco Malfoy (reliably malevolent Tom Felton, who has played the role since the beginning with his contemporaries Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson).<br/><br/>*Moaning Myrtle! Special mention also goes to Shirley Henderson as the newly introduced character in this film. A great comic relief (but still essential to the plot) character! <br/><br/>CoS is the one Harry Potter film where one can say that it follows the source material AND does not bore the viewer!"
"Sofalofa","Null","25","50","9 November 2002"," Good fun but not quite so fresh
","I was one of those people that read Philosopher's Stone after I'd seen the film. Enjoyed it so much I read the other three books, all excellent. Problem is though, because I'd seen the film first, the pictures you conjure up in your mind while reading the other books all tend to follow the faces and locations that you have seen in the film, you simply adapt it to the new plots and locations. Chamber of Secrets is pretty much exactly as I pictured it when reading the book. In fact as the closing credits rolled I felt like I had seen it before...<br/><br/>This isn't a criticism at all, the film-makers have done a great job of translating this book to the big screen, far more thoroughly than Philosopher's Stone. With this film there isn't too much that's left out. <br/><br/>
Whilst I know Chamber Of Secrets is gonna get (and is already getting) loads of fantastic reviews, I have to say I found it a bit flat. I thought the first film was great fun and quite magical, although I'm afraid I disagree that the acting was great. Personally I thought the 3 children leads were pretty poor, especilly Emma Watson as Hermione (the way she delivers some lines made me cringe!) People often pass-off child performances as ""well they're only children"", but watch Natalie Portman in Leon or Haley Joel Osment to see quality child acting! Not much has changed here, although it is amusing to hear Harry and Ron with newly acquired broken voices... they'll be shaving next!<br/><br/>Apart from a larger part for Richard Harris (excellent as Dumbledore - will be sadly missed), it seemed that Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and the wonderful Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall hardly had any screen time in this one. Perhaps it was that way in the book, can't remember. Shame though...<br/><br/>Was disappointed in the Quidditch match here. Being one of the best scenes in the first film, I expected a full-on assault for Chamber Of Secrets. We join the game towards the end, it consists mainly of Harry and Malfoy flying round and round underneath the seating stalls and is over way too quickly.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh seemed a very strange choice for the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. I always imagined a character like Terry Thomas when reading the books. I never thought I'd say this about Kenneth Branagh, but he actually seems to under-play the part (rather than wallop it with a sledgehammer like he usually does). <br/><br/>One thing that did bug me... the sound-track. The Philosophers Stone was great. Another classic John Williams score. Problem is, rather than write a new score that kept the main spirit of the original (which John Williams did brilliantly in the Star Wars trilogy), they seemed to have lifted entire bits of music used in the first film, particularly the dramatic parts that you associate with a certain scene from Philosophers Stone, and transplanted it into Chamber Of Secrets! Couldn't help thinking... cheap... cheap... cheap<br/><br/>Three of us went to see this film at a preview screening last night, and chatting afterwards we all felt basically the same way. Good film, good fun, but lacking the ""spark"" that made the first film so magical. Maybe because part of the fun of Philosopher's Stone was being introduced to this strange, quirky new world and its characters. In Chamber Of Secrets, we are now familiar with this so the story takes centre stage, and at the end of the day... it aint that strong.<br/><br/>7/10"
"keenan-1","Null","10","17","2 December 2002"," Worth the price of admission.
","Warning to those who are avid fans of J.K. Rowling--I LOATHE the Harry Potter books.  Yes, I have read them.  I find her writing to be more than a little plagiaristic of the style of C.S. Lewis, but without the skill that he employed.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed both this and the first movie.  Frankly, I don't care if the scriptwriters left this bit or that bit out; it is simply impossible for all parts of any novel to be completely included in a film without turning it into an epic of a minimum of seven hours, which is ridiculous.  That is the nature of a film; much over two-and-a-half hours and the theatres are only going to be able to show a limited number of screenings, which will, of necessity, limit the profit to be made on the film--and the bottom line of any film project is ""How much of a profit will it make?"".  (And, of course, how many people are going to be able to sit through it without multiple bathroom breaks?  I had to run out myself once, cursing, just when they were about to ""follow the spiders""...)<br/><br/>I found the casting to be clever and appropriate; of special note is, of course, the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore (and I wonder if they will make the obvious choice to replace him in the next movie with Max von Sydow, who could be made to look and sound exactly the same?) as well as the return of Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman.  Both of these actors can actually act, as opposed to simply being screen personalities.  The visual effects are stunning, although just a little too obviously digital in more than a few cases.  The story is easily followed, which is more than I could say for the original books.  The pacing was almost perfect; I only looked at my watch twice--my measure for a movie in which I am immersed.  Both times occurred, I might add, when I was distracted by Rupert Grint's voice obviously cracking--they're going to have to do something about the fact that their stars are definitely more than a few miles down the road of adolescence.<br/><br/>This movie, of course, is raking in the cash.  Deservedly so; it's not by any stretch of the imagination a movie of any deep and lasting meaning, but it gives good value for one's entertainment dollar, and at the scandalous prices that movie admissions are reaching now, that is certainly a ringing endorsement.  It was able to take me away from the insanity of a stressful holiday season, and for that reason alone I was completely satisfied.  See if it can do the same for you."

","Yes, we all love the first one, but we gotta admit, it's whatever. This is when it starts to get juicy. There are frozen people and all the giant spiders are a BIG plus. There are many small fires throughout the movie in favor of lights, which leads me to believe that many attendees of Hogwarts will have lasting vision issues from strain on their eyes due to the dimness of the school."

I'm sorry to report that he definitely has not.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this film and almost nothing to recommend it. More than two-and-a-half hours are spent rolling around in pure tedium - only the REALLY easily pleased will be entertained. The story has a slightly harder tone than the first, but there is nothing on display that will discomfort anyone of any age.<br/><br/>Harry is being mentally tortured and starved by his muggle family during the summer holidays. He longs to go back to Hogwarts, but a Jar-Jar Binks lookalike elf, called Dobby, turns up in his bedroom and warns him that terrible things await him there. It's six of one and half a dozen of the other for Harry, as the Dursleys can be just as evil as anything the chamber of secrets has to offer.<br/><br/>Once Harry gets to school - by means of a flying Ford Anglia - his fellow pupils are frozen with fear at the slightest glimpse of something evil. Harry hears voices in the walls that no one else can. And he suffers from the incompetence of the new Defence Against The Black Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh, totally miscast), who is not as funny as in the book.<br/><br/>Five minutes after we are re-introduced to the students and teachers, the film slips into a clumsy mishmash of poorly staged scenes and bad acting. First time around it was easy to turn a blind eye to the amateurism of these kids. But there's no excusing it now. They've had a year to study their performances and see what was right and wrong - I know, I know, they're only kids. Trust me, none of them will be thanking the Academy anytime soon, which makes most of their scenes difficult to watch. Even with the support of such talent as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith - Robbie Coltrane is seriously underused - they cannot handle the weight of the material. Their acting seems a few seconds behind the adults and any scene with them together has big contrasts between veteran and novice.<br/><br/>Steven Kloves' screenplay tears out many pages and cuts so many corners from J.K. Rowling's book - once again, Rik Mayall is completely left out - in order to keep a tight pace. Yet the film still manages to be dull and boring. Nothing REALLY happens. And there are far too many pauses and silences in dialogue scenes - an absolute crime in a film of this length. With the exception of the chamber of secrets - which holds precious few secrets, I might add - no part of Hogwarts is explored. Almost the entire movie is shot in a generic corridor and you can bet your bottom dollar that for the other locations Columbus just shot the same set from a different angle. The lighting is conveniently yellow-candlelit, when he wants it to be mysterious, or comfortable, and green, or blue, when it should be menacing.<br/><br/>Some credit should be given to the director for trying to make it a little bit darker than before. There's nothing visually disturbing, but the sight of a petrified Hermione and the angles he uses for the film's many and lengthy dialogue scenes echo film noir rather than tame, family friendly blockbuster.<br/><br/>Aside from one quidditch match and the final showdown, there is nothing of interest. The mystery is very weak and straight-forward. There is too much talk and not enough action. It doesn't bode well for the rest of the series, which has so far been equally as dull.<br/><br/>All the best elements that made the original entertaining are not here. Hagrid has less than five minutes screen time and Columbus exploits our disappointment by giving him a big applause at the end. This did not happen in the book and he only does it because that's his style, to force the audience to cry (Home Alone, Bicentennial Man)."

","The worst of all the Harry Potter movies. This is my opinion about ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''. This is the movie of the second book, which is also the weaker of all books written by J.K. Rowlling. I hated some things in the movie that became awful but in the book are exciting:Dolby and the Basilisk for example, are too digital. I like special effects a lot, but they need to be convincing. I mean, in a movie like Shrek,no problem about the reality thing, but in a movie with real people, the Basilisk and Dolby should have other consistence.A sad thing to comment is that Richard Harris, a great actor and also the best Dumbledore, died."

The fact that so many people cannot see how bad the story line is, is testament to how low standards of story-telling have fallen.<br/><br/>How pathetic it was for HP to suddenly and conveniently win the battle at the end of the first movie by touching someone's face - and the lame-o explanation given is ""it was a mother's love"" - WHAT?<br/><br/>As if the weak ""Independence Day"" type ending of the first movie was not bad enough, the second one ends even worse - a stupid bird flies in at the last minute to destroy the big bad snake!

For crying out loud, I think it was too much of a coincidence that a giant spider is in the second book of The Lord of the Rings - and surprise surprise, a giant spider in the second book of HP.

It has a wonderful story, wonderful characters, great action sequences, and good humour to balance it all out.  I've heard a lot of arguments for the actors playing the trio being too old for the parts, but I think people fail to realise that the characters age as well, not to mention the fact that in most movies/tv shows there are much older people playng ""teens"", so for Emma, Daniel, Tom, and Rupert I don't think that there age difference is really that big, but I digress.  This movie is fun and exciting, it crosses age groups (seeing as how when I first saw it I was 22, my mum was 60, and my neice was 8...and we all loved it)I can't wait till June '04 to see the next exciting installment :)"

","I hated this movie. I'm sorry if that bothers anyone, but that is my opinion. No, I have not read any of the books, nor will I ever, but that should have no bearing on the quality of the movie; in other words, if I have to like the book to like the movie, then this is simply a movie for fans, nothing more.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely slow, the plot incredibly predictable, and, overall, the main problem with the movie was its emphasis on visuals... well, that and the fact that all of the peripheral material that was pretty much left in for showmanship could have been cut out completely and wouldn't have been missed (I will not mention such scenes here since I don't want to spoil anything)... but I am a firm believer that before you can have a good movie, you MUST have a good script.<br/><br/>This movie did not. And I think Chris Columbus realized this as he was directing it... the characters talk the whole time about the plot, explaining what's happened as if we missed it, and seem to have little thoughts of their own... so, rather than leave his camera still, which would have been even more unbearable, he places as much emphasis on showing things as he possibly can, to the point that the script is pretty much useless. What's the point to all of the out-of-place tilts or all of the effects shots? Nothing really, other than to keep interest. Yes, I realize film is a visual medium, but there's a difference between using visuals to add to the story and using visuals for the sake of using them because they're the only thing worth while... this film falls into the latter of the two (admitted, the effects are good for the most part, but when the effects are the best part of a movie, it's not a very good movie).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm sure my criticisms will only be criticized and cut down, or possibly thrown away as being worthless, but this is my opinion nonetheless - just because some of you may agree or disagree does not necessarily make any of us right."
"Spleen","Null","14","31","28 November 2002"," Obviously not a great fantasy film, but surprisingly, a good one
","This is undeniably a better film than the last one, which is odd, since it's also undeniable that the second book is the weakest in the series. But perhaps it's not so odd. The first book, after all, is at its best in the opening chapters, in which we, more or less along with Harry, discover that there's a whole world of wizards and witches, that Harry is both talented in magic and an inadvertant celebrity, etc. It was these opening chapters that Coloumbus most thoroughly muffed when he made the screen version. In the first book, nothing that happens at Hogwarts can live up to the promise of the opening; in the first film, the arrival at Hogwarts is a relief after all the dutiful but tedious exposition.<br/><br/>Here, Columbus doesn't even bother trying to do that which he cannot do well in any case, brings Harry to Hogwarts by the shortest route possible, and plunges into the Hogwarts story - which is, it must be admitted, a far better story than the last one. Both films conclude with Harry and companions sneaking into a kind of underground ""chamber of secrets"", but this quest has far less the nature of an arbitrary obstacle course; indeed, the last film had so much the nature of an arbitrary obstacle course that it might as well have been a game show.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything is better the second time round. The creature effects are on average better (the basilisk actually WORKS), the art direction is better, the CGI is still a bit uneven but at its worst (i.e. on the Quidditch pitch) isn't quite so purely dreadful as it was last time, and John Williams's musical score is apter and more enchanting. (His music was the best thing in the film last time, and it is again, but this time it's richer and has been applied with a good deal more taste.) Kenneth Branagh makes a marvellous Gilderoy Lockhart. A pity he's under-utilised (as is everyone, to some degree); there's nobody else with comparable energy or charm in either film. Once again John Cleese has been dragged onto the set in order to appear on screen for a minute or so and to utter perhaps ten words in total.<br/><br/>Columbus is still a pretty uninspired director, of course, and his dumbing down, his telling us everything twice and with words if possible so that even the slowest audience members get it, still earths the electricity we might otherwise have felt. (No doubt he dumbs down because he is making the film for children, but dumbing down for children has even less to be said for it than dumbing down for adults. If children fail to understand something, we can assume that they will grow smarter with age, and get it one day; whereas the adults too thick to get something are precisely those people who don't grow smarter with age and will never get it unless it IS dumbed down.) But all the same the direction is sharper and more assured than last time round. Columbus adheres less slavishly to the letter of Rowling's novel and the film is all the fresher for it. It's still true that more changes still should have been made. I wish Dobby had been written out of the script altogether, but given that he's there, I couldn't help longing for Columbus to summon up the courage to have him guillotined in the course of the film. I longed in vain."

"tedg","Null","6","11","17 November 2002"," Shakespearian Architecture
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I did not like the first Potter film. Indeed, I've been generally unimpressed by all the manufactured Hollywood spectacles that have been moving through the promotional pipeline. So this one caught me unawares. One element of its craft was done so very well, that it alone had me captured for the three hours or so: Architecture.<br/><br/>Film is about more than just recording a play. It is all about using tricks unique to film to place us within the story. The most powerful and unique of these is the placement of the camera within the space of action: psychologically or architecturally. Shakespeare was all about this psychological placement, which is why reading one of his plays is in many ways better than seeing it. Directors have certain tricks to place the camera within the shared mind of the actors when the matter of the film is deep enough. But that's possible in only a handful of films. In most cases, the opportunities are architectural: namely placing the camera within the physical space of action in extraordinary ways.<br/><br/>But alas, doing so requires skills and funds that are generally lacking. On blockbuster films, they are spending a gazzillion dollars anyway so why do it right? That's why I hit `Spider-Man' so hard on IMDB: it had every excuse to use architecture well with all the vertical cityscapes and swooping within them. Well, our wait is over. Someone in Potter, Inc has made the decision to instill this film with an architectural eye. I presume that is because they are looking at the long run of the franchise, which after all is up against some well-financed competition. Longevity could mean over ten billion dollars.<br/><br/>So we finally have something worth watching from a spatial perspective.<br/><br/>
The notion of an architectural film, started with Orson Welles' `Othello,' on which he spent everything he had over many years. Until then, the camera was attached to a virtual human who acted as a ghost or god. All the shots were nominally at eye level and when they weren't, they were at places you would imagine being if you were a ghost. That is to say, they were all in generally possible places or perches. Welles' camera already in `Kane' was placed in locations that no ghost would pick because they were impossible: below the floor for instance.<br/><br/>In `Othello,' the camera is not attached to any human, but to the buildings themselves. Every camera is attached to a surface and moves with that surface as if the building itself were alive, perceiving what was going on, and reporting it to you. Walls, floors, corners, posts, various embellishments take on roles as characters in the shots, so a frame would as likely include one of these elements as a human and every shot has some explicit reference to the space. Some interesting experiments have been made since then by Tarkovsky, Greenaway, dePalma and Gilliam, and in single films like `Liebstraum' and `Million Dollar Hotel.' But no attempt ever had the art and special effects budget of this film. <br/><br/>Watch how often they `establish' the complex at Hogwarts, sometimes seamlessly entering the scene. Watch how often the camera covers the interior space more than the kids. Watch how the position of the camera is in places that only the building would know about. Watch when the camera moves, it moves in the plane that a surface of the space would have.<br/><br/>They decided to do this because they could afford people who could do it, and it subtly improves the effectiveness of the magic. Lucas doesn't know how to do this, even with his amazing structures.<br/><br/>This decision is driven home with the Shakespearian approach and references:<br/><br/>--Harris here plays Prospero, in a very literal sense; the player/magician in his last real performance. Some of the shots are taken from Greenaway's `Prospero's Books,' which also deals with a book that animates characters in the film that enter the world and space of the film. Many references here from `Books.'<br/><br/>--The cinematographer (Roger Pratt) is Gilliam's. Now that Sacha Vierny is dead, he's probably the most architecturally aware experienced man in the business.<br/><br/>--He's also worked for Branaugh who is the best filmer of Shakespeare ever. His `Frankenstein' was both architectural and Shakespearean. Branaugh appears here in a parody of his `Wild West' role with was a parody of Professor Marvel in `Wizard of Oz' who (it is widely believed) was based on the Shakespearean of `Huck Finn.'<br/><br/>--Even in the minor role of Father Weasely is Mark Williams, who is defined by his role as the inept performer in `Shakespeare in Love.' Fits how redheads are used in Shakespearean productions.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

I was thoroughly disappointed, and don't know if I can express my discontent in 1,000 words, so I'll cut to the point. If you are interested in Harry Potter at all, and have yet to see the movies, you should see the first one, ask a friend to sum up the gist of the second movie (should take roughly 25 seconds) then go rent the third one from the library, so you won't get charged to see that horrible (but not quite as horrible as CoS) movie.

(Indiana Jones scene of almost falling out of the flying car in the second movie? Artistic freedom? What artist? What art?) Not to mention the fact that if we hadn't read the book we would not care at all about the characters of the film since they are never really developed in the movie...It is hard for us to notice this fact since we do heavily rely on our memory of the book to follow the movie; yet the fact that there is very little connection between the audience and the kids does subconsciously ruin a great deal...Bland conversations, overdone special effects (was Dobby really THAT freaky and unlovable looking?? Since when??? Couldn't we have a touch less computer graphics and a bit more human touch?) and cheap shots at making us laugh...mostly relying on Ron saying things like: ""can we go now, I am scared"" (insert a stupid and annoying facial expression)...Where did the subtle darker humor go? Basically, it is sad to note that this may be the fantasy children movie of the new generation...No memorable original moments, humor or truly magical scenes (ET, Goonies, Time bandits, Mary Poppins etc)...Basing it all on computer animation, special effects, plot and mooooney...Brainwashed kids will like it, adults will forget what to look for and we can all be convinced that since the media tells us it is grand, then it must be so...A good fantasy movie is not supposed to make us bored, not even for a minute; it is supposed to keep us wanting to see certain scenes again and again, making us remember the movie as something we find special and original, and I just cannot wait to see that scene where Harry is walking and then he stops and says something!!!!!

","Maybe it was keeping on Chris Columbus as director- he helmed the first Harry Potter and did an OK, if not that terrific, job at it- or in making it about as long as possible (whether or not everything in the book, as someone who's seen the films but not read the books, I can't say, though it feels like they crammed it all), or in making it a wee bit too corny, but Chamber of Secrets is a bulky kids movie. It has an appeal for the whole family, as does the first one, and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes, but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over (unless, of course, you're a hardcore fan). It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel: same characters that like Potter just as much- his closest friends Ron and Hermonie- and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy. <br/><br/>Although the film/story does set up ""he-who-mus-not-be-named"" in a good and ambiguous way, this is more in hindsight of the more recent Potter stories, where that is made much more clear and sinister. It does have some rousing bits in there, as I recall, John Cleese is particularly good as Nearly Headless Nick (basically plopping a Monty Python performer in the midst of it all, which is the case) and there's always Richard Harris as Dumbledore (I still prefer him over Gambon, even though the latter is still good). But a lot of it seems much too clichÃ©, even coming from the decent lot of Rowling subversions, and the whole bits with the character Dobby is just really cheesy. In short, it's the only one of the Potter movies I don't have a desire to see too soon, and if I ever do read the books I only anticipate it can only go up from here in quality."

","Who would have thought it?  Director Chris Columbus has actually made a very good film!<br/><br/>This film follows Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts with a much darker tone than the first film.  However, the film should be dark--the books are.  This film is much better than the first.  The first had to spend a lot of time introducing Harry, his friends and Hogwarts.  This film assumes you know all about it and kicks right in.  It moves quickly and has better (and more) special effects.  Little time is spent on characters and motivations--whether that's good or bad depends on what you like.<br/><br/>The acting has improved.  Daniel Radcliffes (Harry Potter) voice has noticably deepened and his acting has improved (a little).  Emma Watson (Hermione) has blossomed into a very pretty young girl and gives a very good performance.  Rupert Grint (Ron) is just OK--he's got to stop being so bug-eyed over everything.  Also Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and the (sadly) late Richard Harris offer strong support.  The only bad piece of casting was Kenneth Branaugh as a new teacher.  He's supposed to be funny yet sinister--he's neither--just boring and silly.<br/><br/>The film is NOT for small children.  As I said before, it's dark and has some very scary moments (all of them involving giant, hungry spiders and vicious, huge snakes).  Also there's some fairly bloody violence (for a PG-13).<br/><br/>The main problem is the films length--2 hours, 41 minutes.  It's long and there's a lot of action and story covered.

","WARNING: Possible spoilers towards the end<br/><br/>Not since Blair Witch II has there been a film in which the acting and directing was so sorely lacking. Chris Columbus seems to have a career littered with mediocre movies - Home Alone, Home Alone II, Bicentennial Man. That Bicentennial Man was such a mangled version of Isaac Asimov's novel might suggest that he cannot properly translate books to films;<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was mostly saved by the talents of seasoned actors such as Robbie Coltrane (the lumbering Hagrid), Richard Griffiths (the detestable uncle Vernon), Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, John Cleese and the outstanding Alan Rickman. The casting for these parts was beyond reproach (except Richard Harris, not the perfect dumbledore in my opinion -- however he delivered a sterling performance anyway).<br/><br/>Although the actors and actresses reprised their roles flawlessly (Miriam Margolyes in particular delivered an excellent, though short, performance), this was not enough to redeem this film in light of the dull, monotonous acting by Emma Watson as Hermione (there were points in this film where one could really feel her reaming off the lines from the script, not putting feeling into her performance). Daniel Radcliffe's performance was better, but by no means up to the standard one would expect.<br/><br/>When I watched Sorcerer's Stone I wondered about the casting of Rupert Grint as Ron. This film made my mind up. He looks the part, but as soon as he opens his mouth he is wrong. In some of the more ""frightening"" scenes of the film he was squealing like a suckling pig - these destroyed any atmosphere Columbus had managed to scrape together. There's something about hearing the missing link between a piglet and a human in Dolby 6.1 Surround Sound that distresses me.<br/><br/>While on the issue of the sound, I think it was very overdone -- in the Quidditch match, for instance, when the bludger is following harry, the sound of it crashing through things sounded more like a cannon being fired than some wood being broken); in the scenes with the giant spiders (where a silent padding sound would have built more atmosphere) the sound was more like spiders wearing steel clogs walking across glass. Either that or they were chopsticks on legs.<br/><br/>While talking about the sound, the (presumably computer generated) fire in the torches on the outside of Hogwarts at the end just didn't feel real -- more like silk being blown in a stream of air.<br/><br/>This film, for all its failings, isn't the worst film you could waste your time watching (xXx comes to mind...). If you read the book and had a vivid picture of what things should be like I'd really advise against it, though. If you haven't read the book, the quality of the good acting is really good (although, conversely, the bad acting is REALLY bad), so if you can bear it, you'll be rewarded by the performances of Miriam Margolyes, Alan Rickman and others. Unfortunately, Richard Griffiths (uncle Vernon) just doesn't have enough to work with in order to give as good a performance as he did in the previous film."

","I ignored the hype of the Potter books and also the movies until now. In China I can buy them at just over a dollar so I got the all except the most recent one. I thought I would see what this world was about. How disappointing! Clearly the author, Rowling I think her name is, was just making stuff up as she went. She had not thought through the complete storyline. New things just keep on popping up with no real foundation in storytelling. Also new actors take turns in appearing for no other reason than to grandstand. This movie had Kenneth B and he was a complete misfit.<br/><br/>I was also annoyed by the frequent awe accorded Harry Potter all with no reason I could see. In summing up the first and part of the second movie I could see no reason that he was a master wizard. He did not know spells or incantations. He was easily cowed. He appeared lost and befuddled on many occasions.<br/><br/>Please don't start me on the family he was living with. Such cardboard figures that he lived with. They were all one-dimensional, not real characters at all.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the Lord of the Rings books and movies. they were written to be appreciated by both adults and children, and they stay with you. These Harry Potter movies, at least so far, seem to be meant for seven-year-old's. There just isn't any adult material in them. I notice I have used the speed-up key many times already in the second movie to bypass obvious parts.<br/><br/>I can't stress enough how the appearance of everything being made up as the story progresses strikes me. The Lord of the Rings was carefully thought out while this seems to be off the cuff, with new ways to do old things always appearing out of thin air.<br/><br/>I give this move a 3 because of the emptiness of the subject matter, and for making a movie without continuity."

","Trapped at his home by his foster family, Harry is visited by a house elf and warned not to return to Hogwarts as it holds great danger for him. However this only serves to make him want to go all the more, despite the fact that many barriers seem to spring up in his path.  When he arrives there he finds much changed, not least a new teacher in the shape of Professor Lockhart.  The danger arrives when someone opens the mythical (and hidden) chamber of secrets and releases a beast that aims to kill all the mixed blood wizards.  Himself a suspect, Harry must race to find not only the beast, but also the one who released it, before it kills again.<br/><br/>After having a poor impression from the first film, I decided to skip this at the cinema Â the idea of an average film being worth the horror of sharing a cinema with talking children being a major factor.  However on DVD I decided to give it a go and was happy to see that it was actually quite an enjoyable film that has a good plot to it.  I still feel that the running time (almost 3 hours) is far too long for this type of film and that some brave editor needs to take it and really be harsh with the material, the plot here sort of demands the long run but at times scenes are too indulgent and the cuts to reduce time could have been found without too much loss.<br/><br/>The film does move quite easily though, despite the 3 hour run.  The problem is that children will generally lose interest faster than adults, making it harder on the rest of us to stay with the film Â I mean, how many toilet breaks will be taken during this film?  Despite this I did find it involving and the film kindly tailored itself to be user-friendly to both fans and those like me who have never had the desire to read a single HP book.  The material is probably too dark for children and I doubt many younger than 10 will actually have followed the full run of the narrative.<br/><br/>The action scenes are an area that could have been trimmed down.  I don't know if the film is trying to stay very true to the book but I did feel that some scenes (the flying car, the Quidditch games) could have been either reduced or removed altogether.  Some scenes work very well and are exciting and creepy and this is due to better direction (maybe from not feeling the pressure of starting a franchise?) and also some very good effects.<br/><br/>The cast is still deep in faces and again suffers from not having enough for everyone to do.  Radcliffe is a bit better in the lead role but Watson and Grint seem to have been put back into second place despite being a real strength of the first film.  Rickman is enjoyable and Branagh is a good choice for the character of Lockhart, OTT enough to be a comedy character but not so much a clown that he is ruled out as a possible bad guy.  Richard Harris has little to do and it is sad that when he died most obituaries in the popular press made reference to this role rather than any of his massive back catalogue.  Cleese is once again wasted, Maggie Smith gets a few days work out of it and Coltrane serves only as a red herring at several points along the way.  Faces from British comedy make for local interest but again it is a problem that the film tries to have the same rich tapestry of characters that I imagine the book did Â at some point a disciplined focus is required in this series, imagine the running times once they start making the thicker books in the series with the same approach!<br/><br/>Overall I had no intention of ever watching this film but am glad I gave it a shot.  I still feel that it is a little over indulgent and that it needs to be better controlled, but the good plot and enjoyable set pieces made for a good film.  I have not been won over enough to see the next chapter in the cinema but I'll get it on video a few years later."

Best of all are the characters.  Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy and Jason Isaacs as Draco's father Lucius are hissable.  Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is huggable.  Richard Harris as Dumbledore is honorable.<br/><br/>The pinnacle is the chemistry of the three main characters.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint (which could be a great character name itself) as Ron Weasley act like they are true friends to the end.

","Unlike the first film, I saw this movie in the theatre and I wanted my seven dollars back at the end.  I haven't read the books so I really can't say that the movies are lame because of it.  I found the movies lame because it was too neatly pressed and cleaned up for this sort of  film regardless that they were based on previously written material.  According to what I have heard, the books are loaded with great dialogue and sarcastic and witty commentary.  Both films were devoid of those aspects.  Some found the films funny and I didn't find them such.  The plot could have been written too fit an hour and a half as opposed to one and a half days.  The subject of witchcraft is not one that entices me either.  The few redeeming qualities of this movie are the performance of Jason Isaacs and the darkness and dankness of the Hogwarts setting (the art direction was brilliant). Overall, this is the longest and lamest film of 2002.  I give this dumb film 3 out of 10!<br/><br/>Here ends my rant!"
"phiggins","Null","3","5","12 November 2002"," Harry Potter and the Mansion of Tedium
","Just what is it about ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" that makes it so bland, so uninteresting?  I walked into the cinema on Friday night feeling a certain trepidation about the new HP film.  As one of the few remaining people on the planet who has never read an HP book, I wondered if spending the next two and a half hours in the company of Griffindellstumblebumhumblepiebumblebeepainintheass was really a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  It was not long before I had my answer.  No, it was not a sensible, grown-up thing to be doing.  As seemingly intelligent adults all around me cracked up at the hilarious antics of Valdemort and Fiddlededee and Sultanabran, I began to feel very uncomfortable indeed. Perhaps a pillow and a cup of cocoa would have helped.  Cinema seats are not designed for the sleepy.  To keep me awake, there staggered across the screen a succession of much-loved British character actors.  Oh, look, it's Julie Walters.  And that bloke from ""The Fast Show"".  And, oh, how lovely, it's cuddly Kenneth Branagh.  Marvellous.  Meanwhile our three heroes are proving, once and for all, that they cannot act.  The dolt who plays Harry has two expressions: ""I'm grinning"" and, ""I'm trying not to grin"".  The one who plays the other boy has one expression: ""I'm going to be sick"".  The girl has several, and is reasonably talented, but even she looks bored in this, and possibly very annoyed that she spends the second half of the film in a coma.  The plot, such as it is, can be summed up as follows: a succession of events occurs at the magical school of Hogwarts, or whatever the heck it's called.  HP sorts everything out.  The end.  The action (and I use the term very loosely indeed) is dull and plodding.  The special effects are bland and lifeless.  Each scene has no relation to the one before or after it.  The ""climax"", when it eventually arrives, is no more or less exciting than any other scene that has gone before it.  The entire film feels like it's been put together at random - some spiders here, a snake here, a flying car here, blah blah blah.  There is nothing magical or enchanting about this film.  It is dull and inane.  The only genuinely amusing moment comes when the boy who is not HP says, after the spider sequence, something along the lines of, ""What was the point of that, then?"" It's a very good question.  The scene (which probably cost twice as much as the whole of ""Monsoon Wedding"" or ""Ghost World"") has no reason to exist.  It serves no purpose.  It's not even scary. The entire film is two and a half hours of nothing at all.  And don't get me started on Quidditch.  As in HP1, the scene involving this pointless sport looks like it has come from an entirely different film.  The lighting is all wrong (being entirely computer-generated, this is not surprising, I suppose) and it jars with the rest of the movie. Two and a half hours of my life that I will never get back.  You'd think, after LOTR, TPM, AOTC and Spider bloody Man, that I'd have learned my lesson, wouldn't you?  Oh well.  If I can spare you the horror of this tedious drivel, then those two and a half hours will not have been totally wasted."

It also introduces more hate/anger into the story, while the first spent little effort in this and it didn't need to.  We can see who the bad guys are easily enough.  How folks can tolerate this as good story telling, I'll never know.  The first was a 6+, but this one can't rise much above a one of ten."

Also with the cake and everything.<br/><br/>Too bad that I still didn't see Peeves here. Thought I found him here. And the one who plays Tom Riddle is so cool. Full of hatred. The scene with the basilisk is so damn cool. So nerve-wrecking. And Gilderoy really brings the comedy to the movie. I'm so glad that the movie changes the person where in the book Harry Potter irritates Moaning Myrtle by saying that she couldn't get hurt because she's already dead. In the movie, Ron says that line. I think it's appropriate because Ron always be cynical."
"barnabyrudge","4","2","3","9 August 2009"," Disappointing sequel with too many plot holes and a lot of indifference in the script and direction.
","It must be rather relaxing to be a writer, producer or director preparing a new Harry Potter film. Most films are a gamble â will the audience respond enthusiastically? Will the film recoup its money? Will it pull in the crowds? But in the case of these films, there are none of those issues to worry about. The fan-base is so broad and so eager that people would walk through fire to see the films. In the case of Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets, the makers have too often been lazy because they're already guaranteed an audience. The film is uninspired and the script is totally by-the-numbers. It's a showy special effects movie that lacks real heart â just a professionally executed exercise in commercial efficiency.<br/><br/>For the second year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson). Dark happenings leave an air of fear over the school â a bewitched cat, messages written in blood, strange whisperings, pupils frozen under petrifying spells. No-one is sure exactly what is happening, but there are murmurs that someone could be trying to open the Chamber of Secrets, a forgotten corner of the school with a mysterious history. When Harry finds an old diary belonging to a past pupil know as Tom Riddle Marvolo, he thinks he's close to solving the mysteryÂor is it all part of some bigger, more sinister plot? <br/><br/>On the positive side of things, it's nice to see the adult cast breathing life into their characters. Newcomers include Branagh and Isaacs, both very good in their respective roles (though the Branagh character comes across as rather pointless), while the likes of Smith, Harris, Rickman and Coltrane are solid in their resumption of roles from the first movie. John Williams scores the film well, and the sets, costumes and special effects look good throughout. Where the film falls down is in its child performances (Grint, for example, wears the look of a kid who needs the toilet when trying to convey nervousness). Even worse are the frequent lapses of logic in the story. There are plot holes galore everywhere you look. A few examples: If Hogwarts could be closed due to danger to its students, then why do they play Quidditch? The game is apparently often sabotaged by someone in the crowd, and players risk decapitation while zooming around below the stands. Crowds turn out in their hundreds to watch THAT! How come none of the older, wiser characters can tell when a piece of Quidditch equipment has been affected by a bad spell? How does Harry manage to speak snake language to unlock the Chamber of Secrets, when earlier he confessed that he doesn't realise that he's speaking a different language at all? Why does the magic car rescue them from the spiders when it has been made evident earlier that it is broken? In fact, how does the car even know where they are, or that they're in danger? Perhaps in the book these things are explained, but in the film there's an air of laziness running through the story. I'd happily overlook these goofs if it weren't for the fact that the film seems to pride itself on attention to plot details. Overall, this is weaker than the first film and proves once more that Chris Columbus is the wrong director to trust when bringing fondlyâregarded books to the big screen (Bicentennial Man, anyone?)"

They know he is a powerful wizard yet they treat him like crap and the fat kid bullies him? HUH? Why if they hate him so much do they want to keep him instead of letting him go to school which they don't even have to pay for? Why do you need to changed gears in a flying car powered by magic? Why does it fly perfectly, then break down, then come alive? Why is there a killer tree in a school yard? Why does everything in these movies need to be alive and magic and incredibly boring all at the same time. What is the point of replanting screaming killer plants? Why would they continue to play the ball game when it is so easy for all the wizards and witches in the audience to cheat, what's the point? Why would they let children play such a ridiculously dangerous game? Why do Harry, his friends and his one enemy get called for everything in every class? Are they the only kids in the school?

But Dudley''s character, portrayed extremely well by Harry Melling, is more atrocious and hate-inspiring than ever.<br/><br/>Dobby was a most endearing, if rather buggering, addition to the cast of characters this time around. We thoroughly enjoyed the ""Dobby effects"" perpetrated by the CGI technicians. His character, while wholly non-human, was quite sincere and entertaining.<br/><br/>I don't have the problems with CGI in the movie industry with which many seem to suffer...I see that some parts cannot be portrayed by human actors; therefore CGI enriches this final product in such a way that the lack of CGI actually would create a total loss of effect in the movie.<br/><br/>This year is Ginny Weasley's first year and she has the crush of her young lifetime on Harry Potter.<br/><br/>""She's been talking about you all summer. Rather annoying, really."" Ronald Weasley to Harry Potter.<br/><br/>This time, Harry and Ron can't seem to get to the platform for Hogwarts Express, and time is quickly wasting. If they are late for the opening ceremony, it is entirely possible they will not be allowed to attend Howarts this year. What to do? What to do? Good thing for Harry that Mr. Weasley is a tinkerer, or Harry and Ron would be in a world of trouble. But wait...it seems their only way to school is the flying car created by Ron's dad. And when they get to the castle grounds, they discover they ARE in trouble. Big trouble.<br/><br/>This movie is just as entertaining and well done as the first. Again directed by Chris Columbus (who STILL neglected to do his homework and put that pumpkin patch and such where they needed to be), the screenplay done as a joint collaboration between Rowlings and Steven Kloves as in the first, and the same, lovable (and hate-able) actors in our favorite ""Worst Witch"" reincarnations.<br/><br/>As sequels go, this production is quite wonderful; though not quite as excellent a sequel as was the original literary work. While there were as many changes in dialog and such, it is quite well adapted and extremely well perpetrated, although it does lose a bit in the process.<br/><br/>There are secret whispers (unheard by all but Harry himself), mysterious magical books and a conjured beast of Dragonkind!<br/><br/>This is a wonderful story, not just the piece of commercial sequellistic fluff I expected. More secrets of Harry Potter's mysterious past are revealed and you get a good rumination of the back story.<br/><br/>The addition of some of new teachers was a wonderful step and as in the first, Rowlings creations are applied to this production with an inspired intelligence and creativity that it seems as though she, herself, is of magic. Absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>The message that prejudice is horrid comes through loud and clear in Malfoy's treatment Hermione. It made me want to tie his ears together and hang him up by the other end. While hatred itself is wrong, if you must hate someone, hate them for WHO they are (their personality and the choices they make), not for WHAT they are (their lineage, bloodline, race, or religion).<br/><br/>Only when the heir of Slytherin house has returned to Hogwarts can the Chamber of Secrets be reopened and the evil within set loose.<br/><br/>I was happy to see the inclusion of Dumbledore's Phoenix, Fawkes. We did not get enough of him in the first movie. I enjoyed this movie just as much as the first. This is awesome as a sequel, but it can also stand alone. It does not rely upon the first installment, yet does not repeat the same information we learned in the first. While it was as faithful as it could be, it (as did the first) failed to capture the atmospheric darkness and overall feeling of the novel. It was almost as if the faithfulness was more important than the ambiance, which is a common mistake made in this industry.<br/><br/>I must also add that the trio has shown some great improvement over their initial forays (not that they needed it). <br/><br/>It gets a 7/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is much darker and more insidious in nature than 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  This is not meant as a criticism; indeed, it is partly due to the undercurrent of menace, that this second filmic journey into the wizarding world surpasses its predecessor in terms of quality, enjoyment and heart-in-your-mouth scares.  While it is funny and light-hearted in places, it doesn't gloss over the unpleasant aspects of life, and deals with racism in particular.<br/><br/>
It is Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but owing to a blocked up wizarding portal, a flying Ford Anglia, and a whomping willow, the beginning of the term is far from ideal.  Then Harry begins to hear voices in the walls of the school; voices that no one else is aware of. It would seem that the fabled Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and that the horror residing within has been unleashed upon the students.<br/><br/>It is nice to see how the young actors have developed their roles, although Ron's (Rupert Grint) slightly overdone comedic style would perhaps be more suited to stage performance.  The real stars of the film however, are not the actors, but the wonderful and intricately detailed sets.  From Hogwarts' gothic cathedral, to the glorious muddle of the Weasley household (complete with self-washing dishes and self-knitting jumpers), to the grime and nastiness of Knockturn Alley, the built sets are far more impressive than the CGI wizardry.   In particular, the Quidditch match takes far too long and isn't really all that exciting.  Having said that though, the computer-animated outsize spider sequence will likely scare the socks off small children, and probably even some parents as well!"
"jneiss","3","2","3","9 June 2003"," A triumph of marketing over filmmaking!
","It never ceases to amaze me how Hollywood can spend millions of dollars to make a beautiful, sweeping piece of film and have it still turn out to be garbage. The first Harry Potter film, while not award-winning cinema, was at least somewhat amusing. The second installment, however, was simply a mess.<br/><br/>First, the good points: the character Ron was consistently fun to watch, particularly in the spider's lair. The actress that plays Hermione is adorable (though her character is an annoying know-it-all), and may grow up to be a good actress if she can avoid being stereotyped. The sets were charming and often interesting.<br/><br/>Now, the bad: it's rare that one gets the opportunity to watch computer-generated characters overact, and rarer still that CG over-actors can outdo Kenneth Branagh, but here that's exactly what happens. There's an episode of ""Third Rock From The Sun"" where Dick Solomon plays a grotesquely over-acting ham in a high-school performance of 'Romeo and Juliet'; the scenes with CG characters, particularly the death of the basilisk, reminded me of nothing so much as that.<br/><br/>Speaking of Kenneth Branagh: are things truly so bad for him that he has to take scripts like this and 'Wild Wild West'? A brilliant Shakespearean actor, his talents are utterly wasted on this tripe. The same goes for Richard Harris and the other excellent adult actors in this film. The child actors can perhaps be excused for any ill-made script choices in their careers; actors who are something of elder statesmen can be expected to make wiser decisions.<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, is simply a mess. Harry lives with his uncle and aunt, who are grossly abusive (and who would be imprisoned for child abuse in the real world); yet Harry, who for reasons not entirely clear is apparently the second coming of the wizardly Christ, not only tolerates their ridiculous behavior, but accepts it as if he has no backbone whatsoever. Things get no better once he goes to Hogswarts, the land where magic infuses everything with no rhyme or reason and incantations are used when it would be easier to do something by hand.<br/><br/>And there lies my major complaint with the Harry Potter franchise: there is no logic behind the magic in the story. Pictures of people are alive; stairways reconfigure themselves at will; ghosts are people who just happen to be dead yet act (and are treated) as if they were still alive...there is a huge amount of random magic, but no explanation as to why things should be like this. Are the wizards inherently magical, and simply in need to training to control their powers, or is magic something anyone can learn? If the former, then how to characters like Hermione (whose parents are both ""muggles""; that is, normal people) able to perform magic? The muggles generally seem to be aware of the existence of the wizards and the school; yet at one point Harry and Ron get in trouble for allowing seven muggles t o see their flying car (which, in two other unexplained moments, shows a surprising amount of intelligence, acting as a deus ex machina for no apparent reason beyond plot contrivance). Also, Harry is something of a celebrity: everyone knows him and is pleased to meet him. Yet his skills and personality are such that anyone in their right mind would be less than impressed once they'd gotten past the glamour of his reputation. Of course, when the adults in the film are ready to throw in the towel because they can't figure out the simplest of problems (thus leaving it to the know-it-all Hermione, the charming yet useless Ron, and the fumbling, worthless, personality-free Harry) one is perhaps not surprised.<br/><br/>Two final notes: Draco Malfoy and his father Lucius (the bad guys--we know they're evil because their hair is greased back; thank you Quentin Tarantino for that enduring signal) are utterly one-dimensional; evil merely because the script says they are...not because of any actions or behavior on their parts. If there were a reason for the snotty scowl constantly on Draco's face, it might be tolerable; as it is, combined with his ignorant, selfish behavior, any reasonable school administration would spend a great deal of time either counseling or punishing him. And the grossly cutesy names and words are kind of fun at first: 'muggles' for normal people; 'Dumbledore', 'Slytherin', etc; but after a short while, they become contrived, ridiculous, and annoying...particularly when the main character's names are ""Harry"", ""Ron"", and ""Hermione"".<br/><br/>And would somebody PLEASE tell the actor playing Harry that a smile is more than just showing your teeth?! Sheesh.<br/><br/>3 stars out of ten, mostly for the scenery. This movie is to the elementary school crowd what Pokemon is to the kindergarten crowd: a way for adults to avoid spending quality time with their kids."

","(probable spoilers ahead, so be warned)<br/><br/>I have said it once, and I'll say it a million times to convince people: Daniel Radcliffe is the worst thing that happened to Harry Potter.<br/><br/>He's bland, and unexpressive, and gives off the impression of being painfully stupid. During his little diary-writing session, WHY OH WHY did he have to speak it as he wrote it? The whole scene was so tedious and repetitive that I very nearly started snoring. Ugh<br/><br/>Of course, he wasn't helped by terrible, jerky scripting (who REALLY talks like that?) and clumsy directing, but as the leading character I would have expected something more than 'I think we found the train' said in a monotone.<br/><br/>His supporting actors are brilliant, almost without exception. Rupert Grint is precisely how I imagined Ron, and Emma Watson was equally convincing as Hermione. Although neither of them seemed to feature hugely in the film. The two of them have improved notably, although some of my friends are getting fed up with Rupert Grint's gormless expression. I also thought Tom Felton's performance as Draco was great, although his voice really did scare me at first!<br/><br/>If you look even further back into the maze that is Hogwarts, you will encounter the fantastic actors that are the professors. Maggie Smith is particularly impressive, a perfect MacGonagall. And Alan Rickman ... well, maybe I'm biased, but I love him a lot. And I think his Snape is wonderful, albeit a little concerned-looking. Although he was FAT!!!! Noooo ... Richard Harris was a excellent Dumbledore, if a little calculating, and the list goes on ... I was particularly impressed with the narcissicistic Kenneth Branagh as Lockhart - I can't imagine a more perfect portrayal! What I do want to know, though, is why all these incredible actors are demeaning themselves in a Harry Potter film when they could simply get together and make a much better film, possibly with a convincing main character?<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, though, needs changing. I live in hope that he will decide he doesn't suit the role of Harry Potter (s**t a brick!), and hand the part over to a competent, expressive actor so we can watch the film with a straight face. And please, get rid of the cheesy grins."

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","14 November 2018"," Makes the first one feel like an appetizer...
","""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" was an already satisfying meal but ""The Chamber of Secrets"" make its feel like an appetizer... and what an appetizing premise its title carries.<br/><br/>A second installment that is basically telling you in every frame ""wait a minute, you haven't seen nothing yet"" is the kind of offer any movie lover can't refuse. And on that level, let me enumerate a few things ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" have: the thrills of an Indiana Jones movie, the CGI expertise of a ""Star Wars"", the smooth pace of an Agatha Christie mystery, the whimsicality of a ""Disney"", the capability to immerse you into a whole universe like some blockbuster adapted from Tolkien, and yet... it is a straight continuation of the original film, in plot and spirit.<br/><br/>And that's the mark of a great franchise: you have a first film that doesn't try to play it for the profits only and then the second that doesn't take the previous success for granted and gratifies the audience with denser and richer material. ""Chamber of Secrets"" might be a tad overloaded but things never go overboard thanks to Chris Columbus's alternation between action and mystery... and action is an understatement when you have a flying car, giant spiders and a confrontation with a giant snake that makes the first film's climax feel like a tea party.<br/><br/>The mystery part is even more fascinating because it's all built on the first film's established elements: Hogwarts and its four founders, the evil Salazar Slytherin whose true intents were foreshadowed by Hagrid's statement that not all wizards turn out to be good and the fact that some students are Muggle-born like Hermione Granger. The original canvas stays the same but the scope gets bigger, as if the clear picture we had on Hogwarts in the first film turned out to be only the tip of an iceberg, a puzzle with many pieces missing and it's impossible to identify which. But this time, the stakes are high, and even innocent students can be killed... or in the best case, petrified. Yes, the material is pretty heavy.<br/><br/>But I guess the choice to make the story darker and edgier was inevitable. In the span of one year only, many kids had their voices broken, they all grew up, Hermione's interactions with the boys get more awkward for obvious hormonal reasons, so they're all fit for more challenging experiences. And guess what? That's probably the secret of the franchise: the audience grew with the characters, which takes me back to my brother who showed me the first film, he was eight when it was released and entered university with the last one. We're talking of life-shaping series, like ""Star Wars"" but with more humanity.<br/><br/>So yes, for a whole decade, the ""Harry Potter"" series defined the word 'Fantasy' and its maturation of tone was almost a natural process. Author J.K. Rowling knew she could go darker in the depiction of Hogwarts; just like a known place that reveals hidden corridors, passageways, chambers or even residents. Things that existed all along but whose absence in the first film could make sense, as these additions never seem contrived... neither do a few coincidental accidents. Magic can work in mysterious ways after all and what goes for locations goes for characters as well.<br/><br/>So, in ""Chamber of Secrets"", we get a closer look on the Weasley family, we meet the little elf Dobie (Toby Wilson) who looks like a mix of Jar-Jar Binks, Gollum and E.T., a phoenix named Fawkes, Lucius Malefoy, the father of Harry's nemesis, played by Jason Isaacs who once again embodies the expression: ""if looks could kill"". We also meet the closest to a human comic relief as the vain and self-absorbed new teacher Lockhart, played by a hammy Kenneth Branagh and in Moaning Myrtle, the ghost of a young girl played so convincingly, I didn't recognize Shirley Henderson. These new characters are all promising but never given a full VIP treatment, their legitimacy always comes from their interactions with the regulars and I must say the eye stares between Harry and Malefoy were quite chilling.<br/><br/>And the good all folks are there, Richard Harris, plays one last time his Albus Dumbledore before his sad passing in 2002, there's also Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman but this this time in rather static positions, as if the bizarre shenanigans happening within Hogwarts were scary even by their own standards... which is saying a lot. We suspect everything will be all right by the end yet the suspense is all there and the action too, served by convincing CGI-aided special effects. A few things didn't age quite well but I can imagine how impressive the film is for a theater audience, especially during the final act.<br/><br/>Now, it's not indispensable to know the first film but don't expect much exposition: as soon as it starts, Harry knows the place he belongs to (remember his reluctance to go back home at the end of the first), he knows the extent of his power and his friendship with Ron and Hermione. He knows his place and he knows... well, he doesn't know everything and the film turns all his interrogations to plot-driving elements and interesting unveilings of backstories, secret identities, some good, some evil, not to mention those hints you only get after several viewings.<br/><br/>Now, I probably missed a few things but I suspect I'll never know the series as much as I handle ""The Godfather"" or ""Back to the Future"" but you don't watch all movies the become an expert, do you?<br/><br/>(On a side note, there is one shock during the film that proves that back in 2002, people didn't make a fuss about boys or girls being equally heroic. Not sure the plot point involving Hermione would have been used today. That's how ""old"" the film is)"

"OscarMcGeachie1995","5","1","1","14 October 2018"," If you've seen the film, please go back to the book
","I was seven years old, when the second Harry Potter film 'The Chamber Of Secrets' first came out in 2002, a year after the first film 'The Philosopher's Stone'.
First of all, it is also directed by Chris Columbus, and it features the return of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast. Second, it introduces new characters like Dobby the House-elf, Mark Williams as Ron's father, Arthur Weasley, Jason Isaacs as Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, (who we would later see until the 4th film, as one of Voldemort's Death Eaters) and Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart. Lastly, it was Richard Harris' final film role as Dumbledore who had passed away in October 2002 before the film was released.<br/><br/>Like the last HP film, I read the book (although it is the 2nd book in the Harry Potter series) or listened to the audiobook read by Stephen Fry, after seeing the film.<br/><br/>Firstly, it leaves out the scene where Harry does all the chores before the Dursleys have the Masons over to their dinner party.<br/><br/>The scene where Harry gets the official warning after Dobby performs the hover charm is omitted, which would cause a continuity error with the later films.<br/><br/>The scene where Harry and Ron de-gnome the garden during Harry's first time at the Burrow is omitted.<br/><br/>The scene with Lucius Malfoy and Arthur Weasley's fight in Flouish & Blotts and Hagrid pulls them apart is omitted.<br/><br/>The scene where Harry and Ron are caught by Snape and brought to his office is also changed when they meet Filch at the top of the staircase who brings them to Snape's office.<br/><br/>While Harry spends detention, helping Lockhart answer his fan mail, there is no mention of Ron's detention which is helping Filch polish the trophies in the trophy room.<br/><br/>The scene where Harry is got, dripping mud, and finds out that Filch is a Squid while reading his Kwikspell letter in his office is omitted.
The scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione go to the Deathday Party on Halloween, before hearing the murderous voice, which leads to the message about the Chamber of Secrets and Mrs Norris petrified, is omitted. Because, in the film, Harry hears the murderous voice for the second time, after spending detention with Lockhart and meeting up with Ron and Hermione who were looking for him. Of course, in the book, Ron and Hermione were with him the whole time.<br/><br/>The scene where Professor Binns explains about The Legend of the Chamber of Secrets during History of Magic is replaced with Professor McGonagall who explains it, during Transfiguration.<br/><br/>The scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione go into Moaning Myrtle's bathroom for the first time and are got by Percy in the corridor is omitted.
The scene where Herimone ask Lockhart for permission before taking out 'Moste Potente Potions' from the Restricted Section in the library is omitted.
The scene where Harry and Ron use one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks to put into Goyle's cauldron while Herimone sneaks into Snape's private stores to steal the Bicorn horn and Boomslang skin ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion is omitted.<br/><br/>The scene where Herimone comes back from the hospital wing and looks at Tom Riddle's diary with Harry and Ron is omitted.
The scene where Hogwarts celebrates Valentine's day with Lockhart is omitted.<br/><br/>The scene during Herbology, where Ernie Macmillan apologises to Harry for suspecting him is omitted.<br/><br/>The scene where Ginny tries to explain something to Harry and Ron before she is taken by Slytherin's heir into the Chamber of Secrets is omitted.<br/><br/>And Lastly, after Harry, Ron, Ginny and Lockhart fly out of the Chamber Of Secrets, scenes where they go to Professor McGonagall's office and find Mr and Mrs Weasley who take Ginny to the hospital wing are omitted, while in the film, it takes place in Dumbledore's office instead.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think both 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets' are both above average. If you haven't seen the films yet, I recommend you should read the books first, but they are always better, as usual."

However, the visuals are still great and the acting is better here. Those are two things that get better with each movie. The visuals are obvious, but the acting is an improvement that is very welcome to make the film good enough to watch even with the boring bits."
"mark.waltz","7","1","1","11 October 2017"," Always something evil sprouting up at Hogwart's.
","Even a piece of children's fiction like the ""Harry Potter"" series can stir up controversy over the themes it deals with. Stories of witches and magic and supernatural powers and beings have cluttered literature since the days of Greek mythology, and people simply looked at it either as the remains of an ancient culture, a piece of art from a creative mind or a reminder of the many worlds out there which we know nothing about. In reading claims that the ""Harry Potter"" books and films open up the minds of children to magic, black or white and is a Pied Piper journey towards evil, I had to remind myself that as far as I can see, it's only a piece of fiction, that children have wild imaginations, and that as long as they are made aware that it is indeed, pure fiction, no evil can come from reading books or watching the films. If there are hidden messages there, they are way hidden beneath the theme that evil is always destroyed by good, that monsters of all sorts are conquered, and that children can be influenced to help others in times of crisis, something everybody in life needs to be prepared for.<br/><br/>Having spent a miserable summer at home with his aunt, uncle and awful cousin, Harry Potter is rescued by his old pals and returns to Hogwarts for his second year in spite the attempts of an elf to prevent him from going back. It seems he's in some sort of danger, and as he gets settled back in school, strange occurrences start to unfold. Students who are not of full magical backgrounds (think of Samantha and Darren's kids in this category if they were Harry Potter characters...) end up ""petrified"" (frozen), and even Harry ends up with a boneless arm thanks to an inept professor (an over- the-top Kenneth Branaugh, mugging delightfully) who fixes his broken arm after a game but removes the bone. Rumors of a monster of extreme power (enough to ""petrify"" the students if they only get a glimpse of its reflection) take over the school, scaring even the local cave spiders which at one point trap Harry and Ron in the forbidden woods. Warning: If you are at all arachnaphobic, proceed with caution; The spider sequence is quite gruesome. The monster, too, is quite a sight, straight out of those 1950's and 60's Ray Harryhausen adventure films that hold up quite well today.<br/><br/>The film goes into detail as to the past of the school, and it becomes clear how loyalties were formed, how the evil dark wizards came about, and why certain characters are the way they are. The presence of Malfoy's father gives a great indication as to why he is the way he is, but there's certainly no sympathy added for him, as he still looks like he could give Rhoda from ""The Bad Seed"" and Damien from ""The Omen"" films a run for their evil money. Richard Harris and Maggie Smith continue in their showy but quiet loyalty for Potter and his band of friends, and there's the presence of a ghostly student whose fate is revealed and seems tragic in spite of some annoying qualities she has. Emma Watson, as Hermoine, is off screen for a bit as she is one of the petrified students, so there is a break from her know-it-all attitude which sometimes put me on the side of Malfoy when they would go up against each other.<br/><br/>For me, the first two of the series were the best, and from then on, they were of very mixed qualities as the special effects and CGI went way over the top at times as did some of the newer characters and plot elements which drove the series to its conclusion. I watch these films simply for the magical elements that take the viewer away to a world that doesn't exist, or one that at least those in tuned with a different type of spirit world can block from intruding into their lives. The quality of the veteran actors here is another attraction, and rising stars with true talent make it nice to see the next generation at their beginning. To see this series as anything other than a children's dream as seen through the eyes of an adult becomes pointless."
"leptir_bez_krila","10","1","1","6 October 2017"," wEIRD REVIEWs - One Of The Best Family Movies Of All Time !
","The first Harry Potter movie broke some big records and started one of the biggest and beloved film franchise of all time. And this movie improved almost on everything the first gave us. In this movie you can clearly see that the main cast is transforming into great actors. Daniel, Emma and Rupert are really good in this movie, and so is the supporting cast too. The great new addition comes in the form of Kenneth Branagh who plays Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. He is one of the highlights in this movie, and is a great comedic element in it. He steals every scene he is in it. He's such a disgusting character but you cannot help yourself, and love that brilliant character. The story is more mature than in the first movie. I would call the movie a horror movie for children. There's a lot of twist and turns that keep you entertaining through this very long movie. And this is the longest of the Harry Potter movies, clocking at 161 minute. But you don't feel it, every minute is entertaining. The story is really well done, wrapped with suspense, adventure and mystery. The negativities I had in the first movie (little bit of 3rd act and CGI) are gone in this one. Every act in this movie is stable. The CGI is incredible improved, and not only that, but after 14 years, this movie looks absolutely incredible. The flying car scene is one of the biggest highlights of the movie. And the House Elf Dobby is incredible to look at, even in 2016. I would even dare to say this version of Dobby looks better than the Deathly Hallows one when it comes to CGI. And the final battle with the basilisk, again, firework for the eyes. This is Chris Columbus second Harry Potter movie, and the direction is, like in the first one, good. He knows what he wants. He's a great visionary director, a talent very important for a series like Harry Potter, full of CGI and action. The cinematography is improved too. This is a very good looking movie. But speaking about the technical stuff of the movie, the real winner is John Williams score. I said that the first Harry Potter movie had one of the best scores of all time, and John didn't disappoint this time either. Such a magnificent and beautiful score this is. And I have to mention this, this movie didn't get any nomination at the Oscars in 2003. This movie, without a doubt, was snubbed for Best Score and Best Visual Effects. This movie is almost without any flaws. The high quality of the movie sticks to the end. I only can recommended this movie to anyone. This is truly one of the best family movies of all time, and maybe the best Harry Potter movie too.<br/><br/>+ Incredible CGI for that time + Story and Characters + Fantastic Music from John Williams 10/10"

","Another awesome movie of Harry Potter which I liked. The chamber of secrets has been opened by the heir of Slytherin, who is a Gryffindor. The chamber has been yet again opened by Ronald Weasley's sister, Ginny Weasley. This chamber when opened, unleashes a strong, powerful snake, and that, that if you see its eyes, you may die.<br/><br/>This snake always travels in pipes and drains, so that it can prevent people from seeing it. The chamber of secrets is also very hard to find. It's hidden somewhere underneath the washbasin of the girls' dormitory and to open it, you need to speak in Parseltongue (the language which snakes speak). Harry Potter knows Parseltongue and therefore unlocks the chamber to kill the great snake. The chamber has many passages to the main area. Harry Potter also meets Tom Marvolo Riddle (when unscrambled ""Lord Voldemort"".<br/><br/>Now it's Harry Potter's adventure to close the chamber of secrets and prevent chaos and a number of people from dying."
"Uriah43","7","1","1","8 September 2017"," A Bit Darker but No Less Entertaining Than Its Predecessor
","This film essentially begins where its predecessor ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" left off with ""Harry Potter"" (Daniel Radcliffe) leaving the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the summer. Naturally, since his only living relatives weren't very nice to him previously he dreads the thought of spending staying with them. Sure enough, they waste little time in making his life miserable and doing everything they can to prevent him from conversing with his friends or going back to Hogwarts. Then one day he gets a visit from a goblin named ""Dobby"" (voice supplied by Toby Jones) who also does everything he can to prevent him from going back as well-and the reason is more sinister than either of them realize. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this sequel was just as good as the movie before it due in large part to the darker and more intriguing plot. However, like the first film, it does run a bit long (161 minutes) so that might be one consideration for those wishing to watch it. Even so, it was still quite enjoyable and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
"stormhawk2020","7","1","1","10 June 2017"," My second Harry Potter-saga favorite movie
","Here's round two of the adventures of young wizard Harry Potter and friends. While not a terrible movie, this one is probably my least favorite and the most forgettable. It's more faithful than the previous film, but that's not entirely a good thing, as this one really drags, and, at this point, it's not quite necessary yet since the books didn't start getting really detailed, ambitious, and overblown until part 4. Columbus returns as director, and this time we follow 12 year-old Harry going through his second year of schooling. As if rival students, menacing teachers, and loads of schoolwork weren't enough, things start getting dire at school when people are found petrified like statues, threats are written on walls in blood, and a monster is on the loose. Even a gifted wizard like Harry may have some serious trouble coping. I can appreciate that they were trying to be more faithful to the book, but they might have been too faithful. It's my least favorite entry, and, while it's not boring, it's just not gripping enough, I feel, to warrant a film of such length. At least the film is good about balancing the tone fairly well. All the actors are fine, and they are only getting better and more comfortable with the characters with each new entry. Harris made his swan song here as Dumbledore, but his replacement in part 3 takes up the mantle with ease. All in all, a decent movie, but like I said, probably my least favorite."

But is Tom Riddle all he says he is. The effects are very good and I notice that this movie is just as dark as the original one. The cast is all back and also starring in this version is Kenneth Branagh(who plays a professor in this film). <br/><br/>If you are a fan of the 2001 version than you will like this one. I liked Emma Watson since the first one so I love how her charchter Hermoine grows up so fast. Daniel Radcliffe is still good as Harry Potter. <br/><br/>My only complaint with Harry Potter is that it gets kinda boring and every one of them is on for 2 hours and ?? minutes. <br/><br/>The last two thirds of this film like the first is scary for younger children."
"zkonedog","7","1","1","4 March 2017"," Slowly But Surely The Details Unravel
","The first Harry Potter film, ""Sorcerer's Stone"", set the groundwork for the wizarding universe and the Potter characters. This second film, ""Chamber of Secrets"", slowly continues to unravel the narrative (with a lot of hi-jinx thrown in as well).<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Chamber of Secrets"" begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) being warned by Dobby (a house elf) not to return to Hogwarts for his second year. Not heeding the warnings, Harry does indeed return to his wizarding school and reunites with friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). Not long into the year, however, Harry and co. discover that a secret chamber does indeed exist in the bowels of Hogwarts, housing a monster hungry for the non-wizard blood of the young Hogwart-ians.<br/><br/>The positives of this movie are that (with a few exceptions) it remains very faithful to the novel. It also is still a visual treat and contains some interesting special effects. The entire first half of the film contains a lot of what I would call ""hi-jinx"" (or adventurous material), which lends itself to a lot of fantastic visuals based on the crazy characters imagined in the novel.<br/><br/>Another interesting little track to follow in these films is that the main actors continue to improve on their performances as they age. Radcliffe, Watson, & Grint were all quite young when the series began, so to see them mature as actors on the big screen is a treat. Of course, the auxiliary cast is tremendous again, with Kenneth Branagh (as Professor Lockhart) particularly engaging.<br/><br/>The only reason I give this film four stars compared to the original's five is that I'm still waiting for the narrative to shift into high gear. I'm probably not being all that objective here. but the primary plots so far have been very conducive to the age of the main protagonists. As the characters age, however, I have been told that the stories mature a bit and really begin to take off.<br/><br/>Do not be alarmed, however, as this is still a great, entertaining film."
"thesar-2","5","1","1","3 March 2013"," The Secret of Numb
","My headline is a little misleading, The Secret of Numb, for I actually enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. For, it's a tremendous improvement over the kiddie movie the original was and on its own, it was adventurous and a tad bit more for the YOUNG adult set.<br/><br/>And what a difference a year makes: the sets were more elaborate, the special effects thoroughly improved â namely the flying segments during the Quidditch match and they even toned down the five endings from the original to three. Albeit, they were rather long conclusions â I even checked the time when the first of three ended and realized there was still 25 minutes left. I sighed.<br/><br/>So, we're still heading into pacing problems and an editor who never read his own job description. And yes, I know we're dealing with writers who want to appease the book club fans and jam every last plot twist, every single character of thousands into more than two and a half hours. Trust me, it's unnecessary.<br/><br/>If you want everything from a book, there's an easy solution. READ IT. After reading the fantastic The Stand by Stephen King, I can understand a theatrical release of about two hours simply couldn't put it all in and I'm okay with that. A screenplay writer must read the source material and determine the most important areas to keep and dismiss, regardless of what the audience wants.<br/><br/>I digressÂ Even though this movie was, unfortunately, even longer than it's predecessor, it was a lot more fun. And contained a jaw-dropping scary and wonderful spider-attack scene. I'm a sucker for When Animals Attack films and the ones that scare me the most are the ones involving my real-life fears: spiders.<br/><br/>But, for the target audience, or at least what the first one seemed to be aiming at, this had to go over their heads a bit. I'd love to count the plot twists and points and the multitude of unusual names and characters because they had to hit close to a hundred. Now, that said, the end all but had our heroes turn 4-D and explain everything in simple English to the viewers.<br/><br/>After yet another long stretch of getting Harry back to wizard school following summer vacation, he mercifully uncovers the film's mystery fairly soon after (unlike the original's almost two hours to get to the point.) Even though it's been almost a decade since original release, I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, Harry & the Gang use their individual detective skills along with some sorcery to find out why the Hogwart's residents are being terrorized and/or frozen.<br/><br/>When I saw this, again, almost a decade ago â the only time I've seen it, my first impression was of disgust. ""It's a shot-by-shot remake!"" I exclaimed to my partner at the time and I vowed never to see another Harry Potter film again. (I will, however, be breaking this rule later today with #3 in my venture down HP LaneÂ)<br/><br/>Today, I say: Eh, it did have a lot of the same elements and almost the same ending(s), but it certainly evolved as I hear the rest of the series does as well. If someone were to ask me where to start with Harry Potter and they've never seen any of them, I would â right now â say this one. There's zero reason to begin with #1 when this gives you all you need to know about the cast and settings rather abruptly and efficiently.<br/><br/>It's not perfect and it's not a movie I will rush to any time soon, but thinking of it as a stand-alone young adult ticket, it's recommended.<br/><br/>(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series. I've only seen the first two, both once and in first run theatres. Since it's been around a decade since the initial releases, I've started over with #1 and will get to what everyone calls: the better years. Cheerio!)"
"MovieGuy109","5","1","1","3 September 2011"," I was letdown by this overblown installment.
","I really liked the first Potter film and I was disappointed by the second Potter film. The thing I was let down by was the film's sheer overlength. At 161 minutes, the film is overlong and lacking the emotional sweep needed to make up for it. Director Chris Columbus uses the same techniques as his first film but this time the results appear clichÃ©d and stale. It does not have the same powerful impact it had the first time. I enjoy watching such talented actors at work however and the filmmakers stay true to their subject matter and do not abandon the charm of J.K Rowling's now classic characters. Yet when it comes down to it, it is a disappointment and lacks the sweeping sense of freshness of the first."
"mccormick632","6","1","1","18 January 2011"," Improvement on the Original By Far
","Anyone who has read my other Harry Potter movie reviews knows that I have been pretty cruel against this series. I despised the Deathly Hallows, I hated The Sorcerer's Stone, and I was ready to hate this movie as well. Yet when it began I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It wasn't great and did have some flaws but for the most part this film had a very good opening to it.<br/><br/>One question I have: why are the Malfoys always the a*****e characters in this series? With a name like Malfoy your not giving them much character development when their name alone sets up that they are going to be the bad guys. Draco's d*******g attitude doesn't help either.<br/><br/>Anyway, my first big problem with this movie is when Harry and Ron are flying the car, how come it can turn invisible? That would be pretty useful when Voldemort rises to power again, they could just turn the car invisible and run him over? It would make things so easy! Also, how does Ron know how to drive the car, let alone a FLYING car? He's what, 11 years old in this movie? Maybe 12? Whatever age he is he shouldn't know how to drive. And when they get out of the car, it starts driving itself. How can it do that? When Snape is yelling at Harry and Ron, he mentions that they allowed themselves to be seen and jeopardizing revealing the wizardry world to the general public. Yet it seems that they have no problem running into columns in general public, breaking Harry out of his house in general public, and the idea that a castle that features flying broomsticks has yet to be detected by any countries radar baffles me. This comes up again when Hermione is called a mudblood. This confused me because they say that the world of wizardry cannot be revealed to the general public, yet they allow students with parents who have no magical background to come into Hogwarts, thereby revealing the world of wizardry to the public.<br/><br/>Ah, and another Quidditch game. Once again my complaints that there is no such thing as disqualification makes itself known. This time it's even worse, as Harry is followed by a heat-seeking dodge ball. Not only is this clearly in violation of the rules, if there are any, but the Gryffindore players are yet again attacked by the Slytherin players who consistently attack them. Every thing I said about this stupid game was already mentioned in my last review so I won't go into it further.<br/><br/>And then there's Dobby, Harry's house elf. I honestly don't see the point of his character. He has good intentions but does not know how to do it properly. It was his fault that Harry and Ron did not get into the train, and it was his fault that Harry was attacked by the heat-seeking dodge ball. I know he wants to keep Harry safe but there are better ways to do it without threatening Harry's life.<br/><br/>After that little kid, Colin, gets petrified, Dumbledore says that the school is unsafe. Clearly he is forgetting about the forest that has the deadly creatures, and that part of the school that he said would guarantee certain death. And if the school is so unsafe, then why is it so easy for three young student to fix the problem? If it's so unsafe then the problem should be left to the trained professionals, not the young students. It may be anti climactic, but its logical, something this series desperately needs.<br/><br/>Harry's bad luck continues. He runs into another petrified student along with a petrified ghost. How do you petrify a ghost? He is already dead, what could scare a ghost so? It makes sense for a person to be petrified but why can a ghost be petrified? It's things like this that takes me out of the story and really hurts the movie.<br/><br/>The movie does pretty well until we meet Aragog, Hagrid's giant pet spider. The spider effects were actually pretty good, but it is ruined the moment it talks. How can a spider talk? It is on the same level of stupidity as a ghost being petrified.<br/><br/>After a series of sometimes interesting scenes we finally get to the climax. Ginny Weasley is taken into the chamber, Lockhart is revealed to be a fraud, and Tom Riddle is revealed to be a teenage Voldemort. Instead of melting Riddle's face like he did in the last movie using the b******t power of love, Harry defeats the basilisk (which looks more like a dragon than a snake) by using a sword he pulled out of a hat. The scene lasts too long and demonstrates Harry's poor swordsman skills. While this scene takes place Voldemort does absolutely nothing, no doubt foreshadowing his uselessness in the newer films. He literally stands there and does nothing while Harry kills the basilisk and stab the book, thus defeating him.<br/><br/>So all is well, Voldemort is gone and Harry and Ginny are free to get together in the Deathly Hallows. Hagrid is freed from prison and all those petrified are free.<br/><br/>So that is The Chamber of Secrets and is it as bad as the other movies? Well in some ways yes and in some ways no. It is a definite improvement from The Sorcerer's Stone, but it is far from being good. It has some plot holes, some moments that don't make that much sense, but I will have to say that it is at least entertaining. Okay is as far as I'll go. It wasn't horrible but I can't say that it was that good. I will say this however, it is easily the best of the films in this franchise I have seen thus far."

","Spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>In Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter goes back to school for his second year of learning to be a wizard. Whereas the first movie was more episodic, this one tends to be more cohesive, focusing on the mystery of the Chamber.<br/><br/>Students are being attacked at Hogwarts by an unseen monster, and messages are being left that claim it is because someone opened the Chamber of Secrets. We are told that this is the hiding place of a monster who is supposed to get rid of anyone who doesn't have magical parents, and the one who has opened it is the modern day servant of the evil wizard who created the chamber.<br/><br/>It turns out that a ""memory"" of Voldemort possessed one of the kids and used them to open the chamber. Harry finds the entrance to the chamber and confronts Voldemort. He isn't real, but nearly gains enough power to come to life before Harry destroys him and the monster, and everything goes back to normal.<br/><br/>This episode didn't leave me wanting more as much as some of the others. My favorite thing about it was the comedy: the opening scenes with Harry's family, and the character played by Kenneth Branagh, who was nicely over the top as the self absorbed fraud. The ending was a bit anti-climatic, and there are many reasons why Christopher Columbus was not a very good choice to direct the Harry Potter series. Each of the films that have come after these first two have been much better done. This one spends way too much time explaining things rather than showing us. I think it is probably the weakest of the bunch."

","Once again, the fantastic production design almost fools you (and does fool many people) into thinking that you are watching a good movie. But it doesn't hold up in the end, as the completely non-heroic ""hero"" Harry Potter is led by the nose through another predictable mystery in the mechanical, eliteist Hogwarts. A lot of respected actors try very hard to appear quirky and compelling, but in the end this story has little interest and the film has no heart or soul."
"MalGal16","Null","1","1","19 August 2003"," An exceptional film
","I have seen ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets"" dozens and dozens of times and my opinion has not changed.  It is an exceptional film, with an amazing cast, and extrodinary special effects.  The movie starts out with Harry Potter living back at Privet Drive for the summer until school is back in session.  Harry recieves warnings from a house elf named Dobby saying that ""Harry Potter must not go back to school!""  But Harry ignores the warnings and returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry (the magical school that has become more like a home, in which Harry has friends to be his family).  After he returns is when the real adventure begins! Something evil has returned to the school and the students are being petrified!  In the end, Harry prooves that he's more than a wizard, he's a herro! Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) has grown a lot since the first film and his work has improoved greatly.  His acting abilities really stand out and I couldn't help but to put all of my attention on him.  I can seriously say that the movies would not be the same without him... and definately not as good.  He was the star, and for me, the true enjoyment of the whole film.<br/><br/>I would definately recommend this movie to anyone who loves action, adventure, and magic all wrapped up into one!"
"anonymousfangirl","Null","1","1","26 July 2003"," I guess you really can't compare a book to a film...
","Let me say this first-- I write SS/HP slash. I debate Blaise Zabini's gender (I support boy!Blaise, btw.) I scowl angrily at Sirius Black but still get a little choked up when...well, you know. Or maybe you don't. I'm an elitist, I guess, but I don't believe HP films should be made for anyone who DOESN'T know what makes someone see a thestral. I'm a purist. (Take that, Mudblood reviewers!)<br/><br/>That said--CoS was painful for me to watch. Granted, it's also the weakest book in the series, so I wasn't expecting brilliance...but dear lord, I was about to gouge my eyes out by the time we got to ickle Ronniekins and the spiders. The Quidditch, the spiders, and GollumLite...oh, excuse me, DOBBY...all of it was substituted for, oh, you know, plot and character development.<br/><br/>The film was just too long. Now, as a purist, I would watch 12 hours of film if it remained TRUE to the SPIRIT of the canon...but the movie just can't do that, and instead drags on...and instead of putting in scenes from say, Potions class, we throw in an ENTIRELY made up shout-out to frickin' Hagrid, of all people. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for maudlin, pointless sap!<br/><br/>The acting, as before, was good. That's not the problem. Alan Rickman IS Severus Snape...or at least a distant cousin. He's so fabulously camp, and pathetically underused. His only good scene was the sexually charged duel with Gilderoy Lockhart, portrayed by the typically flamboyant Kenneth Branagh. Jason Isaacs was deliciously, patricianly evil as Lucius Malfoy...even though his fistfight with Arthur Weasly, one of the book's highlights, was oddly missing. The kids were decent-- Tom Felton as Draco sneers just as well as his fictional Head of House, and Emma Watson makes a passable, but too PRETTY Hermione. Ginny Weasley was blink-and-you'll-miss-her, odd, considering the pivotal natue of her role. Rupert Grint...eh. He's likable enough. Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore? I find his portrayal to be a little lifeless-- and I swear, there is no pun intended. I have all the respect in the world for the man, but he just lacks a certain...je ne sais quoi for Dumbledore.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm grateful that Chris Columbus is NOT helming the next adaptation of this series. After what he did to a mediocre book like ""Chamber of Secrets,"" I couldn't bear to see him butcher an intricate, layered story like ""Prisoner of Azkaban."""

Six minutes, and I'd be in. Six minutes, and it would be November 15 - the day that I had been waiting for since early that summer. For as I held my breath alongside my friends and fellow fans, I couldn't help but keep thinking: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was being made into a film!<br/><br/>Within a few minutes I was hooked. While Uncle Vernon yelled at Harry, and Dobby forewarned him about the following year, the plot unravelled and the audience held its breath. The hours dragged on, but ""dragged"" really isn't the best word to describe it. . .I was held on the edge of my seat. Simply sitting there, watching the movie (sipping a Coke), I couldn't contain my enthusiasm. Well, actually, I could, so I sat through the rest of it with a grin upon my face.

"Cris_Null","4","1","1","12 April 2003"," A Disapointment
","*** Contains some spoilers***<br/><br/>When making a film about children, its best to let children act the parts, and in the first Harry Potter film, the child actors were perfect for their roles. Unfortunatly the producers waited a little too long before making the second one and so all of the kids now look and sound a lot older than the characters they are suppose to be playing and most of them now suck at their roles anyways. While i think that the adult actors filled their roles well, the new characters have almost NO development besides a slightly brooding musical tone when they appear. Another point against it is that script was very cheesy you cant get a grip on whats really happening until the end when everything is explained in a good minute! It would have been a lot better if there was more subelty to this film instead of the blantent actions of the characters.  I will say that the special effects are quite good but cannot save it. So all in all this movie is a one shot deal and i dont suggest seeing it anymore after that<br/><br/>a lowly 3/10"
"ilfulo","4","1","1","8 December 2002"," weakest of the books, it's also a quite boring movie (spoilers)
","I went to the theater in Rome with fair expectations last night, and I was quickly upset. I didn't really love the first movie, even if I 've enjoyed some nice ideas and visual effects... overall it was a fair children movie, with a linear story behind, not that impressive, but still entertaining for some.<br/><br/>Alas, this new HP movie really bored me down... 2 1/2 hours of the same long, repetitive and boring sequences, with absolutely nothing new compared to HP/SS.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I can save<br/><br/><ul><li>kenneth Branagh's character (he's a hell of an actor, and he proves it, even if maybe Hugh grant was better for the part)</li></ul><br/><br/>-the improved quidditch CGI (much better than the first one).<br/><br/>-Hermione Granger: she'll be a good actress, my bet is...<br/><br/><ul><li>Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy: very good indeed, as usual when he plays the villain...</li></ul><br/><br/>
On the negative side:<br/><br/>1) the other children act terribly . Daniel Ratcliff and Rupert Grint are simply not as good as they should be.<br/><br/>2) the story lacks of interest and is reeeeally slow (that's a problem of the book anyway, which is the worst of all four)<br/><br/>3) Chris Columbus! He's not a great director, and proves it shockingly whit this film. Not only he's not on the same level of Jackson(director of the LOTR trilogy, which has been compared - wrongly- to the HP movie effort these days, who proved to be a great artist in his portrait of the wonderful Tolkien's vision), he's just a barely fair artisan, nothing more. His decision to adhere strictly to the book storyline is one of the causes to the film mediocrity.<br/><br/>4) CGI (apart from quidditch) is on average (especially the Phoenix and the spiders).<br/><br/>5) The other actors ,great names including harris (recently deceased) and Maggie Smith, simply aren't given the chance to act as they know, and all seem to ask ""why am I acting in here?""...<br/><br/>6) the strongest points of the books (the school scenes, the lessons, the dream of all kids to be part of a big, magnificent magic school of old) are all gone and lost, sacrificed on the altar of the ""plot crusade"" which is so important to Columbus... He's no Peter Jackson, who also adapted a very difficult book to the screen - Tolkien's lotr - but with much better results... this is why this film is so mediocre and will be surely forgotten in the next years.<br/><br/>** on *****"

"MovieAddict2016","3","7","18","4 December 2005"," Harry Potter and the Dumbest of Sequels
","""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is an ultra-long, boring mess of a movie. Of course, like all movies of its kind, it has a huge cult following. Living in the UK, it's even more popular than in the States, where I first experienced its major influence. The books by J.K. Rowling made ""children read again."" So the next logical course of action is inevitably to make a huge-budget movie adaptation and therefore eliminate all advancements made in literature. What's that? Kids are starting to read again? Then why don't we make a two-and-a-half-hour-long movie, in seven parts, that will negate this and cause them to start watching TV again?<br/><br/>The first ""Harry Potter"" movie (subtitled ""And the Sorcerer's Stone,"" or ""The Philosopher's Stone"" if you live in Britain) was OK, but rather predictable, not to mention utterly silly and far too long. I give kudos to Rowling for managing to totally rip off Roald Dahl's unique style of storytelling without crediting him at all. I'll even thank her for managing to make a book that pretends to take place in reality, yet abandons all reasonable concepts of life (such as...how in the world do you get a job as an honor graduate of Wizard School?). Heck, I'll even smile at the thought that she's managed to turn the image of sorcerers, witches, and such evil, into a pleasant little happy-go-lucky book that thins the line between Good and Bad. Christian fundamentalist groups originally held anti-Harry Potter ceremonies after the initial novel and film's release a few years ago. The media acted as if they were crazy. Okay, maybe they went a little overboard. But it's not like Rowling is treading on quaint, cheerful material here. The main character, Harry Potter, goes to a school named Hogwarts (get it?), where children learn the arts of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They recite little lines of evil dialogue that make spells happen. This is treated all rather calmly and gentile...but of course what Rowling (who used to dabble in a bit of black magic herself, and was on the verge of suicide before the idea for Harry Potter ""popped into"" her head) is doing is quite clear: She's blurring the lines of decency. One baby step at a time.<br/><br/>It sounds silly, doesn't it? Maybe. But regardless, ""Harry Potter"" itself is a tremendously boring movie. It's devoid of any imagination. ""Labyrinth,"" which it seems to borrow its style from, is far superior and far more unique.<br/><br/>The movie is about a poor sap that is knocked down in real life (maybe because he wears the most dorky glasses in the world?) and therefore takes comfort in knowing that he is the last savior of mankind. What a minute...that sounds like ""The Matrix""...actually this is about something totally different, but I've lost my train of thought. Watching this movie will do that to you.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), now in his second year at Hogwarts, is faced with the reality that recent student paralysis may be attributed to a dark lord who killed his parents and gave him a lightning bolt scar across his forehead (which mysteriously disappears between shots). Soon Harry finds out that his life is in danger and he may be...well...in danger! No duh.<br/><br/>Okay, this might have made a rather good 90-minute movie. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is about 150 minutes long. I saw it in the theater when it was released two years ago and almost fell asleep. I thought I was the only one until one of my friends nudged my and said, ""This is the most boring movie I've ever seen.""<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, all the individuals who seemed to enjoy the movie in the theater were little kids all hyper on sugar-packed Coca-Cola, running around the theater screaming, ""Harry Potter!"" Of course no one ran around the theater but I started imagining how funny it would be if...<br/><br/>Where was I?<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Christopher Columbus, who sailed to America in 1492. Of course in 1942 ""Casablanca"" was released, which didn't star Columbus, or any of his relatives. Which reminds me: It's a much better movie; go see it instead of this. And of course I'm not talking about *the* Christopher Columbus, but rather Chris Columbus, who is the writer of ""Gremlins"" and who directed the John Hughes-scripted ""Home Alone."" Columbus was very good during the '80s and early '90s, but it seems he's lost his sense of utter imagination that he used to have.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" might have made a good 90-minute kiddie movie. As a 2.5-hour movie, it's almost unbearable. Let's hope the new installment - which is rumored to be more ""adult"" if that is at all possible - is better. I'd rather be thrown into a gas chamber than have to see this ""Chamber"" again. I'd even rather watch ""The Chamber"" with Chris O'Donnell. Am I rambling?"

I can't believe this movie got a 7.3 rating. And what truly shocked me was that the third movie only got a 7.8. I'd give this movie a negative rating if I could compared to the The Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso CuarÃÂ³n did a great job on it, made it a much darker movie, a much more of a serious movie. He managed to turn it from a kids movie, from something you'd expect the Olsen Twins or Lindsy Lohan to pop up any second to a real quality film. Maybe not an excellent movie, still, something you could enjoy watching. <br/><br/>While watching the first and second movies I felt like I was about to vomit any minute, and the look on my face was as if I just turned on my TV only to that all my channels turned into VH1 Classic on a permanent 70's clip show, or MCM on a never-ending french clip run (AKA - MCM at any given time.)

","In my review of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I told why Chris Columbus was a terrible choice for the Harry Potter films. Now I will briefly say it again. CHRIS COLUMBUS WAS A TERRIBLE CHOICE FOR THE HARRY POTTER FILMS. There. Now I am going to focus in on corny parts.<br/><br/>1. Daniel Radcliffe's acting in Dobby-in-Harry's-bedroom scene. It was just... not good. I only 5% blame this on Daniel Radcliffe, though. He was only 12 at the time, and also, I've noticed that Dan's acting improved when he was working with Alfonso Cuaron, and improved even more when working with Mike Newell. So I blame 95% on Chris Columbus' bad direction. 2. The pudding falling on Mrs. Mason's head. This gag has been used so many times that it just makes me sick. 3. Harry's reaction to the Floo Powder. Is this all Dan is good for, Chris? Wide eyes and shock? 4. Harry's reaction to Hermione's Oculus Reparo. Harry has seen so much magic that that should barely make him blink at it. 5. Draco... he's just too much of a typical bully. 6. ""Scared, Potter?"" ""You wish."" I know it was in the book, but in that context, it was just Malfoy just being a git and Harry being annoyed. However, in the film, it is like some huge confrontation like Harry and Draco are about to fight to the death! 7. Ron in the spider scene. So this is all the character of Ron is good for, Chris? Being Harry's stupid, wimpy sidekick? 8. ""Well let's just hope that Mr. Potter will always be here to save the day."" ""Don't worry. I will be."" I read that this was in fact improvised, but it is soo corny! You can't deny that it is corny! Harry is not a little hero, he is a pre-teen who has other things to do besides having ""magical little adventures with his sidekick-like friends!"" as so many anti-Potters say. 9. Why the hell was everybody clapping for Hagrid like that?!?!?? Most people think he's stupid and he wasn't even missed by most students. It's not in the books like ""Hagrid is everybody's friend!

As soon as I hear the lines ""But where is Thorac, 3rd son of ... Twattius"" or someone, I'm dying to shout out ""I don't know. I don't care where he is"" Then realising they're going to start looking for him I'm thinking, ""Look fellers, just leave him alone, we can all save ourselves half hour & be home by the 2nd half of the football.""<br/><br/>Nearly three hours, Harry Potter lasted & the whole thing went way over my head. There was this kid about 7, further along in our row who kept asking ""what's happening now mummy""? To everyone else in the cinema he was a right pain up the arse, but to me he was a diamond. What few bits I did understand was thanks to him asking & 'mummy' explaining.<br/><br/>I'm not for one minute saying it was crap. It may even have been quite good if I knew what happened. There was a while in the middle where I rubbed the old hands with excitement as it has a touch of the Agatha Christies about it & looked like it was building up to a Whodunnit. But that lasted about 30 seconds. In the end I'm led to believe the villain was a book. Oh, closely assisted by a dead bloke. Not Ken Branaghs character (who I never really saw the relevance of) or Robbie Coltrane (who again was excellent) but a book.<br/><br/>Some more intellectual criticisms were that much of the opening seemed to be merely repeating the first film, and then at the station when the entrance was closed were they stranded from the alternative world? No. They just took the car & somehow ended up there. This was probably explained, but I missed it & it seemed to defeat the purpose of the entrance. The quiddich game & as interesting as it looks, seems of little relevance in enhancing the plot. We're supposed to cheer on Harry and / or his school team (whose name escapes me) against the baddies' but I don't bond enough with any of them to gain pleasure when they win or are awarded extra points. The 'Malfoy' character for instance is for me, is just about the best in the film (as with the 1st film).<br/><br/>The problem I see is that Harry Potter does not seem to know whether it wants to market itself as a film for kids, teenagers or adults. Consequently it seems to want to do all 3. There were several 'bloody hells' and a plot I'm convinced no 8 year old could fully grasp. Therefore the film has be open to some criticisms that wouldn't otherwise apply to a traditional childrens' film. I'm a little dubious of anyone, that is so into Wizardy that they can churn out endless books, characters, stories and ideas about the subject. Rightly or wrongly, for me JK Rowling verges on 'Trekkie-ism'.<br/><br/>The scenic shots & the cinematography in general was pretty impressive but I think Chris Columbus should stick to exploring & colonising natives from Haiti. Fair play he was superb at that, but I've just not got the imagination for Wizards, giant dragons, trap doors or people whose names end in 'ius' and consequently cannot appreciate this sort of film to anywhere near the level it is supposed be viewed at.<br/><br/>A low 4/10"

Yes, great CGI but nothing beyond it. The huge number that rated this a perfect 10 here are either kiddies or ballot stuffers. You will be disappointed. The movie is entertaining but drags on for over 2 and a half hours. Harry wonders why Hagrid mentions to go somewhere and then after they do, you'll begin to wonder the same. Bad pacing, bad flow.<br/><br/>Worth seeing? Perhaps as there is a lot of shlock playing now. But don't expect a great film -- this isn't one.

","Christoper Columbus' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is a far cry from the preceding Harry Potter movie. For this time, a more fearful mystrey awaits the willing youngsters from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Columbus' witty ideas, the musical score, and the realistic-like visual effects brings true magic to the screen. Also the acting has taken a sharp turn from Sorcere's Stone, the players have grown and taken these films to a more proffesional level.Even John Williams' musical score will keep you in complete suspense as you sit on the edge of your seat. Although the new movie has a more frightening touch it has the audience anxiously waiting to gasp and gaze at the impressive dramatics of the big screen. With a new approach to the special effects, the movie franchise has introduced a greater excitement in scenes such as the Quidditch game, Aragog's lair, and The Chamber of Secrets. Chris Columbus takes a new perspective on the movie, as he draws away from JK Rowling's literary works. Subtle changes have been made in the movie and have finally created a comfortable enviorment for the wizarding world. The new action sequenes may be quite scary to children below the age of seven, but the tasteful violence will enthrall young audiences as for older ones too. The transition from the first to second movie is smooth,not like a choppy pass on such as The Mummy Returns. This masterpiece deserves much praise for the hard work for the cast and crew, yet there are times when there is not enough background information for one to fully understand the Potter history. This movie will take anyone to hights in the Weasley's flying Ford Angila, and take one to the spooky depths of salazar's chamber. Harry Potter fans will leave not disappointed to the least bit, and ordinary muggles will return with a drop of magical blood in them, for they have been to Hogwarts... and back. (A+_crazykoura)"
"tomgillespie2002","4","2","4","13 July 2014"," Bloated and Americanised adaptation
","Director Chris Columbus, responsible for popular cuddly, family-friendly movies such as Home Alone (1990) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), here makes his second, and thankfully last, entry into the Harry Potter franchise. The series needed to go way darker after Chamber of Secrets, and did, and this film marked the ending of the bright, and non-threatening, adventures for Harry and co. It's also the last time Potter the film so painstakingly stuck to Harry the book, and here everything that should have been cut in fact remains. Due to this, and the exhausting running time, Chamber of Secrets is the worst of all 8 films.<br/><br/>Still stuck with his horrible adoptive parents (Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) for the summer while he awaits another year at his beloved Hogwarts, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is visited by house-elf Dobby (voiced by Toby Jones), who warns him that he must not return to the school of wizardry this year. He finds his efforts to catch the Hogwarts Express scuppered, and instead must travel by flying car with his daft friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). When he does arrive, students begin to turn up petrified (literally), with whispers of the mythical Chamber of Secrets being re-opened and unleashing a terrifying monster into the school.<br/><br/>While the first film needed to spend time on developing the world that J.K. Rowling so beautifully imagined and the colourful characters who inhabit it, Chamber of Secrets has no such baggage. Yet Columbus, along with screenwriter Steve Kloves, have done little other than simply film the images millions of fans already have imprinted in their mind. We seem to slog through every second of Harry's second year at Hogwarts, with little thought having been given to the humour and charm that seemed to spatter every paragraph in the engrossing novels.<br/><br/>Instead, we get special-effects aplenty, with long periods dedicated to a flying car with a mind of it's own, some hungry spiders in the forest, and a Quidditch match that does little that the first film didn't do already. Rowling's books are so recognisably British, with old eccentrics who all seem to have Monty Python-silly senses of humour, and that feeling of the characters all sitting near a comforting roaring fire. Even though Columbus have upheld Rowling's demand for an all- British cast, everything in the film seems fat and Americanised, all CGI and no heart, so far removed from Britain that I almost expected Steve Martin or Robin Williams to walk in.<br/><br/>There are a few saving graces, namely the stellar cast of adults, all returning from the first film. It also introduces Kenneth Branagh as celebrity wizard and new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs as the father of Harry's arch-nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). They chew on their scenes, helping save the still- struggling Radcliffe and Emma Watson (who would get better as the films progressed). It also marked the sad passing of Richard Harris, here appearing for the final time as Dumbeldore, before being replaced by Michael Gambon in the role. But a few decent performances cannot save this bloated, sickly film from feeling stretched and an hour too long.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Harry and friends solve a new mystery, while getting better acquainted with their talents. This adventure sees them tackle another quidditch match, a flying car, giant spiders and the like.<br/><br/>Made at a time when the Harry Potter book series had been fully recognized for what it was - an unstoppable literary phenomenon - Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, the movie, embodies a disappointing lack of courage and compromise from its ,makers: adapt as much as you can from the increasingly long books seems to be the motto du jour. The result is a lumbering 160 minute film that manages to shy away from the darker elements of the book. As such, there is little sense of threat (the aforementioned giant spiders are underused) and the numbing length and uneven pace make this a tough film to enjoy, particularly for non-Potter fans.<br/><br/>It's time Columbus left. His greatest legacy will remain the casting an launching of the Potter machine. But still, other than aim at maximum faithfulness, the films have accomplished little so far, except fatten Rowling's and Warner Brothers' coffers.

","OK, I just finished The Chamber of Secrets, whoo! That was a long movie! But I can understand, these are long books, these movies have a lot to fit into. But I have to say that actually I think I enjoyed Chamber of Secrets a little more than The Sorcerer's Stone. It had more humor and a lot more chilling action sequences. The Chamber of Secrets is a great continue of the sequels to come I'm sure. I loved the new characters, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart was my favorite, but I'm a huge fan of Kenneth's, so I think I just am a soft touch for him.<br/><br/>Harry is about to start a new year at Hogwarts, looking forward to seeing his friends again, Ron and Hermione, getting back into the spells. But he is warned by Dobby, a house elf that there is danger ahead. As it turns out he's right, there is a creature that is after the ""mudbloods"", wizards who were not born from magic, had normal parents. Also there is Tom Riddle who wants to make sure that his memory will live forever and Voldebolt's as well.<br/><br/>The Chamber of Secrets was great for me. I thought it had great characters, great magical effects, and is brilliantly made. I have to say that I'm more impressed and am very glad I'm giving these movies a chance since we have like 12 more coming up, lol. Although the kid, Malfroy is a bit annoying, I'm looking forward to The Prisoner of Azkaban, it has an even better rating, so please IMDb users, don't let me down, I hope you're right. <br/><br/>8/10"
"DaRick89","5","2","4","10 January 2006"," Difficult to recommend to anyone other than Harry Potter fans
","This movie is difficult for me to rate. On one hand, it remains faithful to the book. On the other hand, despite being well-acted, with some good use of CGI, the Chamber of Secrets is often frustratingly dull and never really picks up until the final fight scene but then the movie slides back down into dullness again.<br/><br/>Those who have read the book know how exactly the plot will turn out, but I will give a brief synopsis: Harry, after escaping the wrath of his twisted aunt and uncle and meeting a persecuted house elf who tries to stop him from going to Hogwarts, heads to Hogwarts anyway and finds that a 'horror' is lurking the school, targeting certain students, thereby arising talk about the Chamber of Secrets. Harry, Ron and Hermione (inevitably) must find out what's behind these 'attacks'.<br/><br/>There you go. That, I reckon, is more entertaining to read than what actually happens in the movie. Most of the time, it plays out like a desperately dull episode of Law and Order, with the students finding out who the 'murderer' is through several clues and happenings elsewhere. It is like the whole book played out on screen, as such, each 'attack' is too thinly spread to create the interest that the film wants to coerce out of the audience.<br/><br/>The acting, as ever, is pretty good. The actors who play Harry's aunt and uncle are suitably evil, while 'Dudley' is appropriately mean-spirited. Daniel Radcliffe, Hermione Granger, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton do well as Harry, Hermione, Ron and Malfoy, while Jason Issacs delivers a cold turn as Malfoy's father.<br/><br/>The CGI, may I add, is quite good. The realism in Dobby and the Basilisk is almost eerie, as is the blood that pours out of the basilisk. No doubting that this is a well-made film.<br/><br/>As I have said above, the only time when the movie gains impetus, however, is when Harry fights the Basilisk, however, that scene comes too late to reverse the dullness that precedes it. It's a shame really, as The Philosopher's Stone and The Prisoner of Azkaban are both pretty good movies.<br/><br/>Maybe the fact that I dislike the book affects my outlook on this film. Now to the most pressing question: do I recommend the Chamber of Secrets? No, as I find it difficult to think of anyone who is not a Harry Potter fan getting real entertainment out of this film.<br/><br/>See it only if you are a Harry Potter fan.<br/><br/>2.5/5 stars"

Naturally, Harry doesn't listen to this. But when he does arrive at the school, he finds that there's a number of things not right. And the answer is closer than he thinks.<br/><br/>Obviously, the filmmakers couldn't go straight from ""Philosopher's Stone"" to ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", so they had to include ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". This is probably the HP movie which I recommend the least (but make no mistake, I do recommend it). Sometimes, it just seems like a big Hollywood production, but I consider it a good movie nonetheless. The Oregonian's review correctly stated that it maintained the first movie's strength and flaws. Radcliffe plays Potter to perfection, while Rupert Grint and Emma Watson also return as Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively. Aside from the other cast members from the original (Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Richard Griffiths), there are two new ones: Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart (the overstuffed Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher) and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy (Draco's father).

","Warning: This may contain Spoilers<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about this movie, but I do know one thing. Chris Columbus likes his Quidditch waaaaaaay too much. Apart from that, (and the script, it's hardly improved from the last film) the film is pretty good. I made the mistake of using it as a book substitute while re-reading the series, as I had copies of all the others at hand, but not this one, and we had it on video, so I decided to watch the film instead of reading the book.<br/><br/>BIG mistake. The film was switched off in disgust before Gilderoy Lockhart's first lesson. It made me realize, compared to the books, the films are as flat as steam rollered pancake. <br/><br/>The acting is still good, despite the miserable script. The anonymous children making comments, and pointing out back characters make me want to puke, and I cringe every time it happens, also, the bit with Hermione saving the day from the pixies, slightly amusing, but why didn't she just do that in the first place? Hermione's good, but not that good. (Yet)<br/><br/>I'm glad Chris Columbus has packed in the directing, because so far, all I've seen him do is sacrifice valuable plot pieces to squeeze in intricate Quidditch scene's that never happened. I mean, that bit under the stadium chasing the snitch, it was ridiculous. The whole tension build up, it's pointless, we've seen it all before, change the record! Going for the shorter, snappier ending to the match that happens in the book would have made the film more effective in my point of view. Also, do you know what happens when that number of supports are smashed to pieces? The stadium falls down! <br/><br/>It does."

I approached COS the same way. There was a lot of ink written about how CC had accepted his limitations and was working within them comfortably on COS, so the movie seemed like a more comfortable, smoother film. I'm sad to say that, while the film is definitely more limited, it's not at all comfortable.<br/><br/>The pacing was just horrible, with absolutely no dramatic tension. There was a superfluous car chase scene, which I guess was supposed to add action, while the ""action"" sequence with the whomping willow was ponderously slow. To top it off, Snape's scene was cut in favor of a sequence obviously culled from HP 1's cutting room floor. The enchanted bludger was quite fun. But then we go back to our stupor, until the final sequence with the slythering monster, which is even more unfrightening than dobby.  All in all, this was a severe disappointment."

","Many films fail to measure up to the books on which they are based. The Harry Potter movies are a particularly bitter disappointment for two reasons: the contrast with the book, an unexpected jewel of perfection abundant in cinematographic delights, and the magnitude of the failure given that the project takes 7 years to complete. Short of remaking the first two episodes while the kids are young enough to pass as 11 year-olds, there is only one hope. Teach Daniel Radcliffe to act (which should be possible) and find a director who has taste, style and appreciation for the elegant magic of Joanne Rowling (which is definitely possible).

","* spoilers ahead *<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books you may not think very much of this film. I haven't, and most of the film seemed like a random chase from one arbitrary scene to another.<br/><br/>""Deus Ex Machina"" - something with no other point or explanation than to resolve a scene - is all over the place. Oh, the water is overflowing from the toilets. Why? So the characters can go into the toilets and find the chamber. Harry's about to get killed by the basilisk. Oh, here comes the phoenix. Harry's about to get killed by the basilisk AGAIN. Oh, there's a magic sword in the bag. They're about to get eaten by spiders. Oh, here's the magic car. THIS IS A SIGN OF COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE. It's a beginner's mistake in writing stories, like the ""and then he woke up, it was all a dream"" trick.<br/><br/>Then there is the lack of follow through. We're constantly going into a scene that shows promise then just stopping, such as having Harry tell the snake to threaten some kid for no apparent reason. Whoah, maybe Harry has a little streak of nastiness in him. No, the scene just stops and Harry goes ""I don't know"" and that's the last we hear of it.<br/><br/>What is with this Quidditch thing? It only makes sense in the context of a ""jolly school tale"" which this is mostly not. Plainly, they just put it in because the fans want it. It's completely irrelevant to the actual plot. Granted, it was a bit more fun than in the first movie, but it could have been entirely deleted and saved some time.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, this movie is too long. There's just no need to wander on for almost three hours telling such a shallow plot. The introduction could have been mostly deleted, since there is so much in this film that relies on the first film/book anyway. Take out this and the Quidditch and you would have a reasonably focussed movie.<br/><br/>It is darker, with more action, which for adults is an improvement on the fuzzy, slow moving feel-good of the first movie. It doesn't really need to be any darker. What it needs is just to be better.<br/><br/>The actors/characters are pretty crap, on the whole. Harry never gets excited or worried. He seems to have these few unexplainable (deus ex machina, again) talents like talking to snakes, otherwise he just blunders around and lets others do the work (Hermione, Ron, the professors, Hagrid). Maybe that's how he's supposed to be, but I find it pretty boring. Ron is just too hammy. He has his ""afraid"" expression and his ""gosh I'm thick"" expression and overdoes both. Hagrid was mostly uninteresting except for Robbie Coltrane's general charisma. Prof Dumbledore was never impressive.<br/><br/>
I have to assume that the book is more detailed, coherent and gripping, because otherwise I can't see why anyone would really like this film - except for the surface glitz. But I can tell you that this film doesn't encourage me to read the books, because the plot is very amateurish, the characters are caricatures, the atmosphere is hit and miss, the action repetitive.<br/><br/>I like fantasy, and wish more good stuff would make it into movies, like say Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea novels. For some reason it seems rare. From this point of view Harry Potter is a good thing. And of course, it seems that many people do like both the books - so much so that it doesn't really matter how good the films are, so long as they evoke a reasonable echo of the book millions will go see them.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I have to say this is not a very good film, at least for adults, and I think the main audience for it is existing fans of the books, who can fill the gaps and ignore the inconsistencies with their memories of the books. Rating: 5/10."

""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It's still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.<br/><br/>The magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.<br/><br/>In ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby's elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.<br/><br/>Characters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting m"

"Kostale","6","0","0","29 May 2020"," It could be better!
","Ok. Year is 2002 and I am nine years old. As a nine years old boy, I can say this is a good extension of Harry Potter movie. But! I am 27 years old, at the moment, and I can say it could be better extension, and here is why. I posted a pretty positive and optimistic comment for Harry Potter 1, with the hope that its second extension will be if nothing else as good as the first one. But that did not happen. I'm not strict and sarcastic, but I think I'm pretty realistic. I would start with the only thing that I think is the same as in the case of my reviewing of Harry Potter 1 and that is the plot of the film written by JKR. She is the only one who has maintained continuity in terms of quality and JKR once again gave us the opportunity to hang out with wizards and enjoy the world of magic and she did it masterfully which was worth recording another part. Of all the Harry Potter books, I read this one and of course I felt that bitter taste when the film fails to justify the quality of the book, which is the case in most cases. When we speak about choice of actors, whether it is the setting from the first part of the film or whether it is the new actors who appear in this part, the choice is again good. The wonderful symbiosis of the entire cast was noticed in this sequel to the film.
For my personal taste inserting the character of Professor Lockhart was unnecessary. Maybe it could be someone who is not a coward but a person who is more serious. I think that would gain in seriousness from the plot itself and strengthen the legend of Harry Potter himself. Costumes, audio and visual effects and animations are outstanding in this sequel to the film. One of the bad things about the film is the impoverished dialogues and predictable situations that seem to be adapted to children, which later resulted in the overall impression of the film being somehow more amateurish than professional. That is, it is as if the film was made for a younger age, discriminating against older viewers. In some parts, where a more serious level of drama and mystery is necessary, the situation is resolved by inserting an element of comedy, which greatly undermines the dramatic seriousness of the film, which is not good at all. I'll take the example of a scene where Harry fights a vicious snake, at the end of the film where Tom Riddle stands petrified as in some weird video game and tells us what happens in scenes as mystical as the one when a phoenix enters and blinds a snake. In that scene, the level of seriousness collapses both when the phoenix flies out of nowhere and the door is closed, and when he heals Harry's wounds with his tears. You will notice that in just 60 seconds Harry says goodbye to young Ginny and tells her that everything will be fine with him and that everything is over. Totally amateurish in my opinion. There are a lot of such scenes and that is what leaves the viewers with the impression of bitter taste because the book was quite mystical and serious and did not deserve to be superficially screened by the film. In order not to go any further, I would like to point out once again that the film did not justify the expectations of the audience in general, but only provided pleasure in the domain of that, and that year we enjoyed the magical world of Harry Potter. A lot of dramatic seriousness was needed, a longer duration of uncertainty and mystery and the elimination of unnecessary staff, as well as their replacement with more serious and complicated staff that keep us in suspense until the very end. I will take another concrete example. The snake that Harry Potter kills was described at the end of the whole film as a monster that everyone is afraid of, and when it appeared, it died faster than it appeared. Too fast and unused by the director. But well, maybe it is possible to characterize all this as the best for that time and that level of technological development of cinematography. My rating is 6/10. We are waiting for the next sequel."

Attracted by the strange and weird spells, the unknown and novel magical world, and then out of control. At that time, I was 13 years old and I was in the second grade.<br/><br/>Then, with anticipation, watched the arrival of the Goblet of Fire, the Half-Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows. It has to be said that the further the story is, the more the plot is no longer suitable for children, and some fall into the stereotypes, but with the growth of Little Harry, our original readers are also growing.<br/><br/>When Harry Potter turned into a real image for the first time on the big screen, I still remember seeing Harry 's excitement when chasing the golden thief on a broomstick, like a long-awaited wish turned into reality.<br/><br/>In fact, overall, the Magic Stone should be the best in the entire Harry Potter movie series. Regardless of the plot, the original book alone is the thinnest in the entire series, and from the perspective of the length of the movies in the subsequent films, the time of the first part is relatively ample.<br/><br/>It's just that as the book gets thicker and more filled with violence and blood, death and parting, the blockbuster black covers Hogwarts and the screen, too. The screenwriter and director who couldn't think of it deleted too many books In the classic scene we are expecting.

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was the second film in the series, being released only one year after the first.
This film has a somewhat more adult plot, exploring the origins of the Hogwarts school, narrating different events such as almost student murders and the probable closure of the school due to them.
We are also presented with several new characters: the domestic elf Dobby, the believed new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts Gilderoy Lockhart, the influential Lucius Malfoy (father of Draco) the ghost Myrtel ""La Llorona"" and finally Tom Ryddle a former student of Hogwarts whose memory is in a newspaper and who ends up being Lord Voldemort. All very well developed and with more or less importance on the plot.
In this more classic mystery-style film, the history of Harry and Voldemort is deepened further, presenting us with the ability to talk with snakes and, as in the future, the first horcrux, the newspaper, would be discovered.
In The Secret Chamber we can see the physical evolution of the characters, as they begin to stop being children and become teenagers. It is appreciated in Harry, but especially in Hermione, with a new hairstyle.
One of the most acclaimed aspects is the domestic elf Dobby. It is a magnificent representation and faithful to the book, both physically, an achievement of CG, as in acting and dialogues.
In spite of all this film is the most criticized of the saga, qualified to be long and repetitive with respect to the previous delivery, something that is due to follow the same visual design, be shot just below and have the same managers. It also criticizes a certain lack of innovation in the plot and loss of the ""magic halo"" of its predecessor; Something arguable.
Nor does it help that the soundtrack manager, John Williams, had agenda problems, mainly due to Star Wars II, so he chose to repeat the vast majority of the themes of the Philosopher's Stone. Even so, John Williams does not surprise with the great Gilderoy Lockhart theme and the spectacular Fawkes the Phoenix.
Despite all the controversy, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a totally enjoyable and magical movie. A great installment of the series."

After the first hour my vote already drops to 5.4
Flaws:
1) How did Ron know about the bars in Harry's bedroom window? He immediately proceeded to pull out a kind of hook to detach the bars. I know you'll say ""It's magic, what do you expect?"" Yes, but for the sake of the film, he could have said something like ""Hey Harry, we've been watching you without getting caught in these months ...""
2) And it was not explained how Harry had the suitcase ready at that exact moment. ""Magic, dude"", all right but Logically, he would have already prepared it because he was trembling at the idea of returning to Hogwarts, but I'm still not sure, he doesn't even mention it ...
3) Harry Potter ends up in Diagonally and what do the Weasleys do? they leave him defenseless, without protecting him.
But luckily he meets Hagrid, and this saved him from the dangerous people around Diagonally. Very very dangerous.
4) Ron and Harry have to take the train, and they are late. Since the wall is impenetrable, they lose the train. The demented Ron is convinced that his parents will never return, so what does he do? The right thing to do is to use the car and fly with Harry to Hogwarts. Are you serious? But also Harry, why does he let Ron do that, when both are only 12 years old? his head doesn't seem to work sometimes. I'd forgive this huge mistake of using the flying car if they were influenced by Dobby, but the elf never mentioned it. Can you ever imagine the reaction of Ron's parents? When they say goodbye to the children and see the train disappear, and go back to the station parking lot and then notice that they are left without a car?
5) As soon as they arrive to Hogwarts, the car starts to mumble and ends up on a giant tree, this tree is deadly and furious and would have killed them and destroyed the car in a flash. Ron and Harry survive, the car is in pitiful condition now. The car at a certain point, after the impact, drives off into the forest, without a driver. Wait a second, why couldn't the magic car get away from the tree first and save two children from certain death? Or maybe it was Dobby the driver? I don't know, I'm confused ...
6) The Herbology professor who tells the children after Neville Longbottom's fainting something like ""Just leave him there"". Seriously? It's funny though.
7) I would have liked to see the sorting of Ginny since she is an important character in the film.
8) But what happened to the first lesson of Gilderoy? As a coward, this teacher runs away leaving the children in danger. Not a big deal, in fact Hermione saves everyone with a spell. What a child prodigy, really. But everything that happened in that class is still serious. Neville was hung several meters high. We don't know what happened next, like how the other teachers reacted? Would Lockart hide everything from the other teachers? I have no idea...
9) The school is incredibly big. But somehow, the whole school meets the trio right in front of the crime scene ""The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware""I don't really buy that.
10) Why didn't the more experienced wizards stop the crazy ball during the Quidditch game? Hermione hinted that it would be dangerous to do so, to stop the ball, for the risk of accidentally hitting Harry. The most powerful sorcerers in the audience would have had no problem stopping a crazy ball. But finally, Hermione destroys the ball. Again, what a child prodigy.<br/><br/>Best parts:
Music always so nostalgic
Dobby's scene is a classic, the cake and the flying car and the fall of his uncle.
The journey to Hogwarts with the flying car visible to all muggles.
The lesson of mandrakes.
The scene of the blood on the wall and the petrified cat. Unforgettable.
The scene where Hermione is bullied by Malfoy and Hagrid's words of comfort for Hermione.
The quidditch game in which Harry is hit by the crazy ball but still manages to win the game. Quidditch is always cool to watch. And the scene in which Draco complains about a pain in the hospital, and Harry who spits the potion thinking he is drinking pumpkin juice, very funny.<br/><br/>After the second hour my vote went down to 4.0
Flaws:
11) I would have liked to see more of the ""underwater"" house, the Slytherin house, a little consideration for them would have been highly appreciated.
12) Hermione turned into a cat. I would have liked someone else's reaction besides Harry and Ron, like Madame Pomfrey or Minerva.
13) In one scene, the bathroom of ""Moaning Myrtle"" floods and Harry and Ron go to see what happened. All right, but in the end what happened to the flooded bathroom? How had Argus reacted? I would have loved to see his reaction. With the mop, cursing death curses.
14) In a key scene in the film, Hagrid warns Harry and Ron to go to the forest, they must find the answers from the giant spider Aragog. The famous ""Forbidden Forest"", of which Harry encountered something very dangerous the previous year: voldemort who was sucking the pure blood of a dead unicorn. He certainly would not have gone to the forest without his precious invisibility cloak. But for some mysterious reason, Harry forgets his cloak at Hagrid's house and walks through the dark forest, chasing spiders in the middle of the night, with Ron. With their cloak, they would have been immediately saved from certain death by hungry spiders. But guess what, the movie likes it difficult.
The best parts:
The Polyjuice potion scene.
The Slytherin house
The victims of the basilisk
Tom riddle's diary scene<br/><br/>Final part of the film: vote dropped to 3.2
Flaws:
15) The Chamber of Secrets scene was perhaps the most important scene in the whole movie. In my opinion they had to add more drama and epicness to this part.
16) The basilisk, terrifying. But the film doesn't do it enough justice. He shows up for five minutes and dies.
17) The CGI ... but you have to appreciate the effort.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film:
The music
The Chamber of Secrets
Fawkes, the phoenix
""It's not the abilities that define us but our choices,"" says Dumbledore. Well said.
The ending, perhaps the most beautiful ending of the entire saga."

It is the second movie of the franchise and compared to the first one it doesn't have to dedicate a lot of it's time on introducing us to the wizarding world of the Harry Potter universe, as it has already been set up. Therefore it can use its entire run time to expand on the first entry.<br/><br/>The story is a lot darker than the previous one and for the first time there is at least a slight feeling that our characters are in real danger. Furthermore the movie improves a lot on its visual effects and has a score and both costume and production design that are just as good as in the first one.<br/><br/>Although the movie has a lot it improved upon in its details, I still think that this film is the worst entry in the franchise. This is due to a rather poor story, which is somewhat darker than the first, however it doesn't capture the magic as well as the beginning of its predecessor and ends up just as unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>Like I have mentioned in my review to ""the Philosopher's Stone"" these two movies (compared to the later instalments) struggle to find an adult-like ending. This could be a result of the age of our lead characters, however it is very likely that the director and the whole crew behind the project just didn't know how dark of a story they can tell and get away with it.<br/><br/>Overall this movie just seems very similar to the first one, in some ways its better and in some ways its worse. I just really appreciate the decision to have a new director handle ""the Prisoner of Azkaban"", as it is considerably the best entry in the franchise."

","Review:
'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is a fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus. It is based on J. K. Rowling's novel of the same name and is the second instalment in the Harry Potter film series.
This movie is said to be the worst in the series. I really don't consider that to be the case. I enjoyed this movie for what it is, a mystery film.
Its story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a monster that petrifies the school's denizens.
The acting is miles ahead of where it was in the first movie. Many of the original cast return and a few new characters appear in this such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs, who are great additions to the cast. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still not fully into their prime yet, but still put on good performances.
The runtime is a bit long, and some of the elements get lost throughout, but the overall story is entertaining and keeps you engaged. I also enjoy the mystery element that this movie brings. Finding out who opened the Chamber of Secrets and finding out who Gilderoy Lockhart actually is.
Overall, it doesn't have the nostalgia of the first one, but still holds up in the franchise.

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second of the Harry Potter film franchise and again directed by Christopher Columbus. Now the film is the kind of movie that feels like it is made for kids but in truth, is very entertaining for all. I liked the film, and even though I have seen this many many times, I still thoroughly enjoyed the plot and given the massive running time, it is hard to enjoy a movie that is this long after so many viewings.<br/><br/>Now the plot is different from the first movie, it is much darker, much more sinister and could be said to be ever so slightly more violent. Now it isn't so much a scary film, but some kids may not like it so much in areas and very little one's could be frightened so heads up. But anyway back to the plot and it's interesting, yet again mysterious and if you have never seen this before, it is one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>The young characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione come back same as ever, although I did feel this movie explores them a bit more and establishes there personalities even more so than the first. Richard Harris is pretty memorable as Dumbledore, he just becomes the most majestic of all actors here and any scene with him in is engaging and thoughtful at times. Steve Kloves who adapts the books for the big screen for me is one person to mention, he makes the film exciting and although still faithful, adds bits here and there to make it more exciting.<br/><br/>Now Columbus directs this in a way that makes it still faithful to the written material, but brings it into a new cinematic era of fantasy movies and this makes it different from others. Columbus also works well with the actors too, all the cast seem to work well and despite the odd parts of bad acting(to be fair they are young) Columbus uses a steady hand. With the writing and directing comes the absolutely wonderful and beautiful score by John Williams who yet again smashes it and creates some of the best work of his career.<br/><br/>One thing that makes this a step forward in the film series is the humour, now the first movie is pretty funny but this really gets it right and the script is mixed well with drama and comedy. Kenneth Branagh is a great addition as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart who is as vain as he is stupid, and also one of the funniest but kind of silliest things about this movie. Some of the one two's between Branagh and not only Radcliffe, but also Alan Rickman etc, are just fantastic.<br/><br/>I felt the main negatives I see in this are that it is too long, there isn't really a lot wrong with this but the length can really drag this out and although this movie has substance throughout, the repetitive tone can get a little dull. I think of the biggest improvements on the other hand are the special effects which show that not only having a massive budget can help, but also that the film series is so big it can now get that kind of fantastic work done on it.<br/><br/>Overall I felt it to be a good movie and very little has changed in my mind since seeing it last. It is the kind of movie though where you can just see it over and over and still not get too bored, just great fun for all the family and probably the last Harry Potter movie that contains that really sweet feeling the youngsters create."

","Since the world has already been introduced to the wonderful wizarding world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts, and since all the major characters have all been introduced, what else is there to do to make the other movies special? In the second installment, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton all return to their magical school for another year. Somehow, even though they were all placed in a great deal of danger the previous school year, no one expects anything bad might happen. Bad things do happen, and even though the school is host to a staff of enormously competent and powerful wizards and witches, the little children find it's up to them to save the day! It's quite an accomplishment for the three heroes, since there's an army of giant spiders living in the forest, a mysterious villain lurking in the halls who literally petrifies its victims, and a magical diary with its own hidden agenda. Get ready to cut young Harry Potter some slack and keep in mind that he's only twelve years old and liable to make some pretty big mistakes; if you found a talking diary, would you confide in it?<br/><br/>Ironically, the second novel was my favorite of the series, but I don't watch the second film very often. The most memorable part of this installment-even more than the famous diary-is the arrival of Dobby the House Elf. While the little kiddies might be endlessly entertained by his scenes, I couldn't get past his squeaky voice. He's written that way in the book, but imagining his voice and having to sit through it in a movie are two different things. Probably the third most memorable part of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets can be summed up by Rupert Grint's line: ""Follow the spiders? Why couldn't he have said, 'Follow the butterflies?'"" Anyone out there who's afraid of spiders, let alone allergic to their bites, probably won't want to watch this movie very often either. When doing a marathon, as I recently did with my nieces, it's just blasphemous to skip any of the films, so you'll have to just close your eyes or use the spider scene as a popcorn break.<br/><br/>There are some fun parts to this movie, though, so when you're watching a marathon with your nieces, you'll be able to have fun once you return from getting more popcorn. Kenneth Branagh ""guest stars"" as a hilariously conceited and incompetent new teacher who has girls swooning at every turn. John Williams's beautiful music is still used, and the new themes he wrote for the second movie are just as lovely as in the original. The kids decide to go undercover by making a magic potion that turns their appearance into whoever they've stolen a hair from, and Emma Watson's potion backfires with a pinch of cat hair. And don't forget, this is the movie with the flying car! With all that to focus on, who cares about a few spiders and a squeaky voice?<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to an upsetting scene involving an animal as well as scary scenes involving spiders and snakes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

","Chris Columbus said he wanted to make a 2,5 hour movie that feels like 30 Minutes. Well, in my case he surely succeeded! I saw the movie as a member of the press and couldn't get enough of it. I would have gladly sat in the cinema for another two or three hours with a biiiig smile on my face.<br/><br/>Like part one, ""chamber of secrets"" stays true to the book. I don't know about you - but I HATE it when movie makers change the storylines, add or remove characters and do it for the ""sake of the art"". I think they do it because they are too lazy to create their own storys, so they rip off other peoples ideas and crush them to make it more comfortable... If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. Chris Columbus has captured the essence of the book on screen. So, after ""philosophers stone"" he delivered again!<br/><br/>When reading the book I always envisioned Michael Crawford playing Gilderoy Lockhart. His broad smile and clumsiness ÃÂ  la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. But instead we get to see Kenneth Branagh, so of course you won't see ME complain. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. In his short scenes onscreen he makes your blood freeze. And again: all the casting is brilliant. Every character just feels right - even if you imagined something different when you read the book. There also has been talk about the young actors getting older. Well, let me remind you that this also happens in the books. In every book Harry Potter and his friends are one year older. So there's no excuse to take the roles away from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. I couldn't imagine someone else playing their parts.<br/><br/>Go see ""the chamber of secrets"". It's pure fun and excitement! And it will wet your appetite for more to come. Richard Harris couldn't have asked for a better movie and legacy to be remembered by."

","Now we're moving on the the sequel of the Harry Potter franchise. We've already known a lot from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001): Harry being thwarted by a bunch of a-holes (The Dudleys), Hogwarts, the main characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione and more). It was once again directed by Chris Columbus (this is his last Harry Potter movie) and scored by John Williams. This movie is a bit darker than the first one and the mystery was scarier for kids.
We started in the Dursleys' house when Harry saw Dobby jumping on the bed (just look how adorable the elf is). At first I don't like him much because he had annoyed Harry so much. At least he was a good character in the end because we've already known what had happened and this guy Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father, was worse than his tongue and knowing that Dobby's his slave made me calling Lucius a piece of excrement. The most adorable part of this movie is that Ginny went down and looked at Harry with wide eyes. That's just cute! As I said I hated Malfoy, I really liked the Quidditch scene when Malfoy was hit by Dobby's Rogue Bludger and had an accident. Good Riddance! There's this character I don't like, Gilderoy Lockhart: an arrogant guy who only learnt one charm and had been a fraud for a whole time writing books which had fake information about him fighting a creature and more. Even though he had writing skills, he's one of the weakest wizard and it was a pity when he lost his mind by his Memory Charm.
There're more creative thing about the sequel. There're more creatures like The Basilisk and Dumbledore's Phoenix, the creature which had petrified Hogwarts students who were muggles (raised by human parents). There're a few parts I like better than the first movie. There's a Flying Ford Anglia showing audiences what magic is truly capable of and the mystery had more clues than the first one. Audiences were wondering what the Chamber of Secrets was. The clues were really scary seeing kids being petrified. In this movie, we had our first time seeing Lord Voldemort from the past still with the title Tom Marvolo Riddle. We also saw the first Horcrux: Riddle's Diary. There're more magical objects in the movie like Godric Griffindor's Sword. The CGI is as good as the previous movie. But the problem is that Hermions knew too much but in here she's petrified so we couldn't have her solving too much. They mystery should remain longer.
This one's not as good as the Sorcerer's Stone but it's one of the darkest of the franchise and we're introduced more to magic and I like the way they were introduced.<br/><br/>Points: 7.9/10"

","The pace of this film is much better. It definitely has a strong flow compared to almost every other HP film, so much that it can stand alone as a complete film.<br/><br/>I believe it's because of Chris Columbus' excellent direction, and his established rapport. He managed to bring out all their characteristics accurate to those described in the book, and even if we don't consider that, they are just well rounded, realistic ones.
Harry's kind, brave side is continuously developed through the movie. Lucius Malfoy's cold blue eyes and cold words are perfectly delivered. Riddle's charming, perfect headboy character, too, is on point. Hagrid's performance throughout is outstanding.<br/><br/>In all the other HP series, there is always so much over acting just to add the comedic element, something not at all needed in this beautiful world of Rowling's.<br/><br/>However, one thing that Columbus did start that was not so nice is the merging of the two characters of Fred and George. They have their individuality taken away from them just to add a bit of humour, and surprisingly, the following directors follow this silly decision."

First, as the actors grow up, their voices started to break especially for the Draco Malfoy, the actor Tom Felton did the brilliant job by portraying this character on the second film.
Second one is the CGI, comparing to the first one, the CG and animatronic in second film has greatly improved especially the Basilisk scene, the crew members did the great job by bring the robot snake to the action and it made almost all the audiences think it is real. And when portraying Donny, the CGI of the film is even greater than ever in that 2002 era.
Also, the film is also the longest one within all HP series and personally I like the long film because I can enjoy watching it on my bed when I was 14 and it felt pretty good."

","This movie is 2 and a half hours long and feels like less than an hour, this is both good and bad as I can happily watch this film over and over again but it also means its quite forgettable and fails to really make an impact. That being said this is a great sequel and many of the things that made Philosopher's Stone good is carried onto this one. Where this movie falls short in my opinion, is the plot. Chris Columbus has been called a tactless director and I can see where some of his scenes, particularly the action ones, are played so broadly that they lose all semblance of meaning. He is not particularly adept at handling the young actors, who come across as pretty bland and uninteresting. Rupert Grint as Ron is sort of annoying, overplaying the stuff that was likeable at first. Likewise, he is unable to invigorate some of the scenes, especially action scenes like the car scenes, the spider scene, and even the final encounter between Harry and the Basilisk and they come off as overlong and particularly flat. The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull, bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him, Chris Columbus seems intent on making the film a magical version of a school where kids merrily skip around solving problems, like in Scooby Doo."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a film directed by Chris Columbus. After watching the first film which I liked a lot, I was pretty excited for the second part. After watching it I can say that I enjoyed this particular part too.<br/><br/>Plot: Harry Potter is warned by Dobby, a House elf not to attend Hogwarts School of Magic as danger awaits him.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film is one of those rare sequels which improve upon the first. This film doesn't take time to set up things. But instead we are immediately thrown into action. Also introduced are some new characters which impressed me like Lucius Malfoy and Ginny Weasley and another one not being of much importance like Gilderoy Lockhart. If this character was removed it wouldn't be much of a loss to this film. The funny scenes also feel funny and not forced. John Williams' score is again awesome and I can just hear it again and again. The film deals with another theme which I liked a lot the way it was handled. As for the VFX, although it has improved much from the first part but still there are some imperfections. There is some animatronic work with creatures which were excellent. It felt like the creatures were real and would jump out of the screen. The sets are massive and adorable. The action scenes in this film were great.They were so believe-able that I had goosebumps. Even though the film is longer than the first part, I felt much more entertained by this film. Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves have again done a wonderful job in providing us another chapter in this universe that not only makes us happy but also makes you feel for the characters in those particular settings. This film does have a post credit scene but I didn't think that the film did need that.<br/><br/>Performances: All of the regular cast members did an outstanding job. Jason Isaacs was bad (in a good way) as Lucius Malfoy. Kenneth Branagh was also good in the material that was provided to him. Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley did a fine job. The voice of Dobby by Toby Jones was awesome. I didn't know that he voiced Dobby until I read it in the internet. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be one where Hagrid consoles Hermione about her parents being muggle and both Harry and Ron providing support to her. This scene showed not only showed the strong bond between the kids but also how much Hagrid cares for Harry's gang.<br/><br/>Verdict: For a sequel, this film just ticks all the boxes. I had a great time with this film. It improved upon the first and also opened many new doors for the future films. I just can't wait to see what this series has yet to offer me.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8.5/10."
"TheNabOwnzz","8","0","0","23 June 2018"," A dark, tense & mysterious superior sequel
","While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was more of a set up of its great world and many colorful characters, the Chambers of Secrets manages to expand further on its world with a more serious approach. The film is darker in tone and theme & its tension far outweighs the original.<br/><br/>Visually the film is not as much obsessed with capturing this great fantasy universe that Harry Potter is set in, as much of that was already done wonderfully in the original film. Instead, Chamber of Secrets focuses on creating a fascinating mystery, which admittedly the first one also was, but the narrative structure in Chamber of Secrets is a bit more complex, with a lot of past events taken into account. I cannot stress enough how important John Williams's score is for these series, as they always seem to embody the feel the audience gets when watching it. In the Sorcerer's stone, we had a lot of joyous and adventurous themes, but in Chamber of Secrets most of the times quite an onimous and mysterious theme is used, which is also brilliantly composed by Williams as the music seems to tell a story in itself. Look at the scene where the chamber is finally opened for example. This scene is extremely memorable mostly due to Williams's fantastic orchestral score which captures the essence of the discovery perfectly.<br/><br/>Normally i'm not a big fan of adding new characters to an existing new franchise as this, but Lucius Malfoy ( Jason Isaacs ) with the arrogant like back tilting of his head is very impressive as he embodies the over confidence of his character perfectly, & Gilderoy Lockhart ( Kenneth Branagh ) who is a great addition of a character that seems to have an ego that far exceeds his capabilities. Furthermore, the brilliant performances of Alan Rickman ( Snape ), Richard Harris ( Dumbledore ) & Maggie Smith ( Professor McGonagall ) return and have not diminished in the sequel. The three main leads Daniel Radcliffe ( Harry Potter ), Rupert Grint ( Ron Weasley ) & Emma Watson ( Hermione Granger ) are also admittedly growing in acting prowess although it is still the case the adults mostly steal the show with their acting at this point.<br/><br/>It still does not deal directly with death as a theme, as its victims are petrified instead of killed by an unknown assailant, but this in turn creates a more mysterious feel to the film as we know everybody has the power to kill, but do not quite understand who has the power to petrify, which leads to the audience becoming fascinated in its mystery and the solving of it. It is not that the film gives the audience a clear view that the 'good guys' cannot be touched, since a real threat seems to be around every corner. The sheer teamwork between the tree main leads into solving this mystery and their great use of eachothers strengths and weaknesses furthermore enhances the emotional connection we have with them, and the final scene in which they are re-united with a certain friendly character is truly one of cinema's warmest moments, as it provides an over emotion of joy since our bonds with the characters have become so close over the first two films.<br/><br/>The true star is its complex narrative structure, since its mystery is always evolving until the conclusion will leave you with emotions of self discovery and joy, as if we were really there in the moment due to the fact that the camaraderie between the characters seems to genuine."

Being Chris Columbus's second (and last) director's outing of the franchise, this was back before the other novels got longer and more intriguing. And you know what?

The movie felt just as dark, or maybe even more darker than the first one, and that was a good thing I feel. It's the suspense that got me to like Chamber of Secrets. The characters were further developed, and that was important since the series would obviously continue with Prisoner of Azkaban.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","5 January 2015"," A slight decrease in quality
","This film is the second entry in the hyper-successful Harry Potter franchise. In terms of box office, it became number 4 of the year 12 years ago. Like the first, it was directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""The Goonies"", ""Home Alone""), who did not return for film number 3, and written by Steve Kloves based on a Rowling novel. Kloves kept writing for all the films that followed afterward. Just like for Columbus, this was also the last performance for Richard Harris. The actor who portrayed Albus Dumbledore died not much later. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" included some creative inclusions of new characters and story lines, but it also fell flat on developing on some of the parts from the first film. Very early on we are introduced to Gobby, an interesting character and the Potter equivalent to Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"". You could almost say that this film has a message against racism with the victims here being Mudbloods. Fittingly, Malfoy's dad who is also new in the movie has an equally Arian look as his son. The Slytherin house is the one who is against letting Mudbloods (children with magic abilities from non-magic parents) into Hogwarts. At the one scene with the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher (Kenneth Branagh, one of the more forgettable) and Snape I was wondering why they would support the Potter-Malfoy rivalry by letting them fight against each other. I don't expect good teachers to do that. This film is maybe the one that tells us most about the Malfoy dynasty, also about Hagrid and about the history of the different houses, well actually mostly about Slytherin. Too bad the other houses except that and Gryffindor are rarely mentioned. I bet they have some nice stories too.<br/><br/>I was not too big on Moaning Myrtle, who did not add something really interesting to the story for me and same goes for the way they travel by a flying car instead of the train this time. Good job to the car though for rescuing the boys from the spider invasion. Man these spiders were creepy (another ""Lord of the Rings"" parallel). And Ron's face expressions there were simply priceless. We get to find out a bit more about the Weasleys and especially Ginny plays a bigger role here and gets slowly introduced as a love interest to Harry's character with how she was talking about him all the time during the holidays and how Harry is the one who has to save her in the end in a 1 vs 1 battle again just like in the first film. Okay, this one also has a giant snake, which makes things tougher for little Harry. Then there was this part where the boys transformed into two boys from Slytherin, which was basically a good idea, but the way they constantly kept almost revealing themselves by accident made it a bit ridiculous sadly. For most of the film, Potter is hearing strange voices and wonders if Gryffindor was really the right choice for him, a bit of an identity crisis? A lot of it is also about his ability to speak with snakes as this was an ability the creator of Slytherin possessed as well.<br/><br/>The film is very long, runs for 160 minutes and I believe they certainly could have cut 15 or more minutes and it would not have hurt the film, maybe even helped it. For example the Quidditch game did not add anything for me apart from another random way of Malfoy and Potter going against each other with the usual outcome. I personally felt the film came a bit short compared to the first and also the third (the two best films in my opinion), but it is nonetheless worth a watch and be it only to see the development of characters. Many people may have felt the same as this is one of 2 Potter films that did not score any Academy Award nominations. It got a couple noms for its visual/technical work at the BAFTAs though. However, it has still its funny moments, like Hermione's face expression when she hears the exams are canceled and everybody else is cheering or also the letter to Ron from his family. Lots of cute little details included here again. Only the main plot was not so good this time. Recommended."

","The Chamber Of Secrets is one of the my favourite HP novels, and it packs loads of excitement and fear without the padding that would affect later novels. This was one of my favourite HP movies in the past as well, but comparing it to the others, it stands out as a perfectly watchable and likable, but ultimately underwhelming adaptation. It's not bad, and certainly an improvement, but it's not perfect.<br/><br/>This is more dark and horror like than the first film. It follows people at Hogwarts getting attacked by a mysterious creature and Harry trying to stop it. It's the closest Harry Potter comes to being horror, with its large collection of giant spiders, scary snakes, dark, shadowy locations and ghosts so naturally it's still a syrup filled kids movie. It is an improvement to the first, but a lot of what was wrong with the first one is also present here.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus improves as a director, and there are many tense and alarming set pieces. John Williams provides another great soundtrack, and the adult cast is still brilliant. The stand out is Kenneth Branagh, who is wonderful as the annoying but hilariously so Gilderoy Lockhart and maybe the best thing about the movie. The child actors are far less annoying in this movie, or at least less noticeably irritating. It's an interesting plot, and it's more exciting and watchable than the first one.<br/><br/>Like the first, this is exactly the same as the book, although despite this it does deviate from the novel a bit more. 160 minutes is far too long for one of the shortest books in the series, and they could have easily streamlined it. The film is enjoyable enough, but it lacks genuine bite and there's little emotional depth while in the book it was more powerful and fun. The most frustrating thing is that it was a natural direction for the series to become darker and more mature and this doesn't take an opportunity to take the series in a new direction. Some of the frightening bits aren't as scary as they could be.<br/><br/>Overall, an improvement and the 5th best HP movie. It's less boring than some of the later ones, but it lacks imagination and style and is a missed opportunity overall."

","Harry and friends return for a second term, where they're quickly caught up in a long-standing plot to rid the school of so-called ""impure"" students. Between the celebrated, absurdly deep cast, the charming, nuanced world at large and the constant manipulations of a shadow-clad foil, this picture had an awful lot going for it right out of the gates... so why does it feel like we're just treading water? A large swath of The Chamber of Secrets seems inessential and redundant, which isn't to say it's without merit, just that it could be using this time to fry much larger fish. Did we need to reinforce the idea that Harry's adoptive parents are cruel people? Didn't our hero avoid an attempt on his life on the Quidditch pitch last time around? For that matter, wasn't the entire endgame eerily similar in the preceding installment? Too much time smelling the roses when there's a fire down the block.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not all bad news. The CGI, though still not without the occasional hiccup, has vastly improved since the last picture. That doesn't excuse the force-fed inclusion of an all-digital supporting character, but at least these appearances are kept mercifully short and to-the-point. Although it's the longest installment in the Harry Potter franchise, this chapter skims along at a strict pace and feels much shorter than it actually is. Though seemingly inconsequential as a whole, the plot does drop frequent hints at a darker side of the Hogwarts mythos before, ultimately, allowing such things to continue lurking in obscurity. It shows promise in spades, and will certainly capture the hearts and minds of the younger audiences it's primarily there for, but more demanding viewers will likely find it too thin and sugary for serious digestion."
"Sinth01","6","0","0","18 July 2013"," Chamber of Dusty Secrets
","Harry Potter the incoming great sorcerer returns to Hogwarts! After watching the first Harry Potter movie, I wasn't sure what to expect from the second one since I am not a fan of Harry Potter movies and I usually don't care about sequels. But because I knew Harry Potter saga works as a complete growing up story, I gave it a try thinking it wouldn't feel like a sequel. That the movie would actually take the main story forward. Unfortunately it ended up feeling like a fill up sequel.<br/><br/>Where the first Harry Potter film already showed us the magical world and it's Oz kind of atmosphere, the second movie is located inside the dusty halls of Hogwards and got only little bit of the original movie's atmosphere. The plot and the ambiance of Chamber of Secrets is overall much darker than in Sorcerer's Stone. The first encounter with Dobby makes us aware of it too. The darker ambiance is at the same time a positive thing that makes this movie a different from the first one but at the same time we lose the Wizard of Oz feeling and the movie becomes more like one of Tim Burton's Gothic movies.<br/><br/>After arriving to Hogwarts we are let known that something scary might be going on and the movie becomes a detective story where the three main characters are working out to solve the ancient secret of the school without anyone else in the school even minding or caring about it. This time the teachers are a bit more alive in the school and the new teachers give some new spice to it and actually seem to even care about their students lives but still way too many characters are nothing more than a background. This is very visible in the scene where Gilderoy Lockhart releases the pixies and points out ""Well, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back to their cage"" totally ignoring the existence of the rest of the class excluding the main character hero trio.<br/><br/>On the other hand the movie got also its funny moments. I was first afraid that Dobby would turn out to be an annoying unnecessary characters but I find he did suit to the movie very well and was balanced between comical and serious. The last scene where he got his freedom again smoothened the film and helped to get rid of its dark parts. Also the return to the dark forest and meeting up the spider kin was an interesting and nice scene with it dark tension which, unfortunately, might have been even darker and more powerful than the final encounter with Voldemort and the basilisk.<br/><br/>Overall the plot has improved from the first Harry Potter but at the same time the atmosphere, which was very detailed and interesting thoroughly the first movie, is a bit more forgotten in this movie. Music is still giving the nice touch to the film same way as in the first one. I still can't say I liked this movie as much as the first one though. Movie seemed like a fill up sequel that didn't take the main plot forward at all. It was an amusing, balanced and safe movie to but didn't wake up any big feelings or leave any remarkable moments to my mind which would force me to consume the next part right a way. I'm still sure the true fans will enjoy this sequel as much as the other parts of the saga though."

","My adventure into the world of Harry Potter continues with the Chamber of Secrets. While I enjoyed the film, I didn't think it was as good as the Sorcerer's Stone, as typical of most sequels. In the Chamber of Secrets, we see Harry return for his second year at the Hogwart's School of Wizardery. In year two, students are being attacked, and Dumbledorf knows why. The legendary Chamber of Secrets has been open and a mythological creatures has been released. Harry and his friends have to find out who opened it and why before they are able to do anything about it. This story wasn't as mysterious or edge of your seat as the last adventure was, and I found some parts of it to be downright childish. What I enjoyed about the first film was that for all it has for kids, it had an equal amount of content that adults would enjoy. In the Chamber of Secrets, that element has been replaced with things like giant talking spiders, flying cars, and worst of all Dobby the troll. The story was pretty good, but it wasn't as refreshing as the last film, the cast was once again terrific, but the Chamber of Secrets seemed to be much more like a kids movie to me and for that reason was kind of a disappointment."

I decided to start with the moviesÃâ¦. <br/><br/>The second film in the series was as competently done as the first one though perhaps a little on the long side. The acting from the young leads improved and additions to the adult cast were welcome. It's hard not to be swept up by Robbie Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid and I was impressed by Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw who are convincingly awful and bring great comic timing to their parts. <br/><br/>I was underwhelmed by the big set pieces at the end which followed a standard quest where the hero has to overcome certain obstacles to win through. Nothing wrong with that except that there are elements of Raiders here and the use of underground perils you've seen in a thousand other films but with more CGI. Speaking of CGI I noted that the CGI character, Dobby, was nowhere near as annoying as the over-the-top portrayal of Gollum in Lord of the Rings (I'm still convinced that Andy Sirkis would have made a better Gollum without the use of GGI but that's another story). <br/><br/>There's another boring Quidditch sequence and lots of unconvincing use of magic (wave the wand and mumble something vaguely Latin) but otherwise another sound and enjoyable film"

","This movie, like the first, was very well done. Also like the first one, there were some major and minor differences; however, not all of these seemed to work as well. Obviously it's impossible to include every aspect but there were some things that I think they could've/should've done differently. The most glaring example is how they butchered the ending of the movie. That didn't happen even remotely that way in the book. They made the Harry Potter character look kind of dumb with the way he reacted in the chamber whereas in the book, the things that happened weren't necessarily in his control and he had to react in certain ways in order to survive. Also, they cut out quite a bit of the process Harry, Ron, and Hermione took in discovering the secret. Still, they ultimately got the gist of the book and didn't really leave out anything too major. The acting of the students was drastically improved so the movie flowed smoother. I just thought they could've done a much better job with the book-to-movie adaptation."

","The SFX were impressive, especially the character of Dobby. He was well great. I couldn't tell he was CG by his bad creation, but through the fact there was no way they could have done it otherwise. In fact the CG character of Dobby is very similar looking to Gollum in Lord of The Rings and the CG Asgard in television series Stargate SG-1 (speaking of textures) which which speaks well for Stargate SG-1 if it can do just as good as a top movie like this...and top it is. The CG Spiders were incredibly creepy and realistic looking. Not being too scared of Spiders, they kind of made me jump. I felt by body tense up as the gave case to Harry and Ron, which is a good thing because not often do I find myself doing this in movies. The person I had sat beside seemed pretty scared of the spiders as well.<br/><br/>John Williams score was very much like his original score with old themes returning and some of the music sounding like music from his Indiana Jones scores.

","As luck would have it, Chamber of Secrets has more of a story sweep than its forerunner, though it lacks much determination or tension. But, most importantly, it does preserve the light-hearted sense of humor and childlike buoyancy that made the first film entertaining. The humor is slightly on the mawkish side this time, and Columbus hasn't decided against tacking on another winning-is-good wrap-up, this time even more peppered with honey-baked schmaltz than last time, but the light-hearted youthful nature of the material is still intact and keeps it engaging even for those of us who haven't seen it in nearly ten years.<br/><br/>This second annual production design festival starts with Harry reuniting with Hermione and Ron, and his arch-rival, Tom Felton's Draco, as they prepare for sophomore year at Hogwarts. Many of the old faculty return, including Dumbledore, the stringent McGonagall, and the gloomy, hostile Snape. There's a new recruit, a totally engaging Kenneth Branagh as the charming, narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart, who is more engrossed in fan mail than teaching defense against the dark arts. But all's not sound at Hogwarts. A sinister conspiracy is looming, with someone plotting to burglarize the renowned Chamber of Secrets and let loose a monster. It's up to Harry and his mates to expose the perpetrator before Hogwarts finishes.<br/><br/>All real inspiration motivating this hat-in-hand outing is rooted in Rowling's original ideas. The Harry Potter stories don't break new ground, but they merge time-honored fantasy blueprints into a breezy, creative and contagious concoction, but Columbus isn't poised to make any real leaps with the material, and periodically this suit-following sequel seems more like processed merchandise than a live, three-dimensional film. It pleases, meets expectations, but doesn't blow one's mind.<br/><br/>All of the unforgettable moments happen in the powerfully dynamic latter half of the movie, including an staggeringly accomplished gathering of giant, inhospitable spiders and a likewise arresting encounter with a massive snake. These scenes, with their perfect virtual worlds and graphic effects, minify even the most imposing sequence from the first movie. The film's other significant effect is Dobby the computer-generated House Elf, who at once manages to be little more compelling and a little less grating than Jar-Jar Binks, sans minstrelsy.<br/><br/>Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are more self-possessed and practiced than in their previous excursion, especially Grint, who has settled impeccably into the role of the more hapless, more neurotic comic relief. Branagh had been below the radar in the past few years. It's refreshing to see him burst back into the public interest with something this pleasant. The other noteworthy add-on is Jason Isaacs, who admits emits unadulterated wickedness, as Draco's father, Lucius.<br/><br/>Indeed, much of what made the first film so charming stays resolutely primed, from the strapping ensemble performances to Stuart Craig's impressive production design. The atmosphere of invention, that early interface with the stories' vibrant characters and quirky corresponding world, is absent. In its place comes frenetic commotion. As companion pieces, Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets interlock perfectly. Not shocking, bearing in mind that many of the same people were responsible for both."
"gavin6942","7","0","0","2 May 2011"," And the Series Continues...
","Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) ignores warnings not to return to Hogwarts, only to find the school plagued by a series of mysterious attacks and a strange voice haunting him.<br/><br/>With Chris Columbus still directing, this film maintains much of the element of fun the first film had. The danger is upped a bit with the inclusion of some ""creature violence"" that may be scary for younger viewers. But, overall, these are still kids (12-year olds now). The best addition to this cast is the girl who plays Moaning Myrtle, whose name I unfortunately do not know.<br/><br/>I find this one to be the least memorable of the first few films. While it has some important parts to it -- such as establishing the Malfoy family's dark connections and introducing Tom Riddle, Dobby and Moaning Myrtle -- the overall story is relatively uninteresting. Those who see the later films or have read the books will tell you that Ginny Weasley, who plays a prominent role here, will come back in a big way later, so it is important to make her a focus. And I agree, but they still only make casual references to her despite her centrality to the plot.<br/><br/>One positive note about its being less than memorable is that the film has a healthy dose of mystery and suspense, and although I watched it a second time barely a year ago, I had already forgotten much of it by my third viewing. There was also much going on that I did not realize was important in the long run..."

","This book pulled more interest to me then others did. This is the only Harry Potter book i have fully read before watching the move. The fact that Harry is still younger and he is still figuring this whole wizard thing out is absolutely amazing. Harry is very gifted, Rowling's does very well with his character harry by making him still seem so definitely out of control, but somehow harry always finds a way to make the right things happen. As one of the most famous Authors out now because of these books Rowling's is still making books about this, he has built an imaginary world that kids will be reading about for years and years to come. Harry, Ron, and Heromine all figure out that the chamber of secrets has been opened and Harry must figure out all the clues to save his friends. I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of 8, for it's full of exciting adventure and scary situations that only one wizard could over come. I have learned something from this book also its that no matter how hard something is as long as you stay brave and trust yourself to do the right thing"
"wolverinesforever","7","0","0","23 October 2010"," Passable thanks to some good casting and improved special effects, but it's a slight step down from ""The Sorcerer's Stone.""
","I will give Chris Columbus this much: he succeeded in making a 2.5 hour film feel 30 minutes long. Never while watching ""The Chamber of Secrets"" did I feel bored or impatient, as one scene after another fired away with the latest revelation of the ""Harry Potter"" universe. Yet as the picture went on it didn't feel like it was adding up to a whole lot. For all of the events and discoveries that occur within the film, the direction feels less inspired, the script feels less assured, and for all of the horrors that are occurring within the school, there doesn't always seem to be a whole lot of jeopardy. That takes away from what could have been a massively entertaining epic.<br/><br/>This film picks up right where #1 left off. Harry is having a miserable time with the Dursleys, and to make matters even more confusing for him, he receives a strange visit from a house-elf named Dobby (well voiced by Toby Jones) that he mustn't attend Hogwarts because if he does, his life will be in danger. Harry manages to escape and get to school anyway (although very unconventionally), but as soon as he arrives, a series of strange events begin to occur immediately. When some students begin getting attacked by an unknown monster, Harry quickly turns into a prime suspect, and he, Ron, and Hermione work relentlessly to track down the culprit.<br/><br/>I mentioned Toby Jones earlier, and that brings me to some great casting choices this film has. First off, Jones brings an honest, well-intentioned, earnestness to Dobby, which is a very good thing, considering that Dobby could have been easily portrayed as annoying. Also inspired (and quite funny) is Kenneth Branagh as the self-centered and incompetent Defense against the Dark Arts Teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart. Then you've also got Jason Issacs as the icy Lucius Malfoy (he holds back no contempt against Harry Potter and Arthur Weasley), Julie Walters and Mark Williams as the endearing Mrs. and Mr. Weasley, and Christian Coulson as the power hungry Tom Riddle. And don't forget the good retentions from the first film, including Tom Felton still relishing his role as the snarky Draco Malfoy and Robbie Coltrane holding strong as the semi-father figure Rubeus Hagrid.<br/><br/>Although those performances shine, some others don't. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, nor Emma Watson are a whole lot better here than they were in film #1. Part of that problem is because the script by Steven Kloves doesn't feel as sharp. He doesn't seem to build up to the sense of jeopardy the school is in as well as he did previously. Okay, he didn't do it terrifically then either, but at least it was better. Too many scene transitions feel abrupt as well. And the revelation on who opened the Chamber of Secrets doesn't pack nearly the punch that it should because the person at fault is underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Adding to that, Chris Columbus's direction feels less inspired. In the first film, he had an honest interest in the world of ""Harry Potter,"" and was keen to reveal all of its wonders. Here, he seems stuck on that mode, when the story calls for more ""sinister"" direction. Hogwarts still feels like a warm, confiding place to be (although the picture tone is a little yellower and drier than in the previous film), and the sense that something awful is trying to emerge from underneath doesn't get through.<br/><br/>I also recall saying in my previous review that had it not been for John Williams' film score, it would have been a 7, not an 8. Well, in this film, there felt like there was too little of his wonderful music. There's nothing wrong with silent scenes, per say, but when the script and direction aren't always good and you don't have great music to listen to anyway, something feels lacking.<br/><br/>Is anything better? Yes. The special effects are more polished this time around. The best example comes during the Quidditch game. The movements by the students on their brooms feel far more realistic this time, or at least, as realistic as you could possibly make Quidditch. Before, they felt jerky and computer animated. Now, they feel gradual and human calculated. You get a feel for the turn of direction, the maneuvering through the underground barristers, and the resistance of air at any given point. Also well realized are Dobby the house elf (not quite Gollum-realistic but still well-integrated into the scene), the Weasleys' flying car, and the monster in the film's final battle. These were improved despite a small slashing to the budget.<br/><br/>Do I recommend ""The Chamber of Secrets""? For the most part, yes. There's too much talent around for the film to go wrong, and some select scenes (the Quidditch match and the climax, for example) work terrifically well. But overall, this simply does not feel as fresh as ""The Sorcerer's Stone,"" or as good. Let's hope that, by the time part 2 of ""The Deathly Hallows"" rolls around, this will remain the weakest ""Harry Potter"" film."

","Daniel Radcliffe is back and this time he is slightly older but still the same Potter. Only this time, there is a flying car and a diary involved. Does this sound great to you?

This is much like ""Ernest Goes To Camp"", when the golf cart drives itself around and shows up almost when you least expect it. However, the car is not as funny.<br/><br/>For me the Diary of Tom Riddle is OK. Near the end of the film when you find out who Tom Riddle is, and its not Peter Pan, it makes alright sense.

","Night 2 of my 4 night Harry Potter week! Each time I view these movies, I kick myself that I have not read the books... One of these days... The basic plot is that Harry Potter enters Hogwart's for his 2nd year, even though he is warned not to come back! The adventures start even before he gets to Hogwart's, and continues on as he and his friends try to find the ""Chamber of Secrets"". The movie is a bit darker than the 1st with scary spiders, students being petrified, and one large basilisk slithering around. It is interesting to see the character growth of the actor's, plus their own growth in real time. Harry and Ron a looking a bit older than their ""12 years""... Malfoy is back, and even better is the introduction of his father, Lucius Malfoy, played by Jason Isaacs. One of my favorite ""bad-guy"" actors. Ever seen ""The Patriot""! Kenneth Branagh is also new as Professor Lockhart, a pompous, self-obsessed new wizard. A different take for the usual serious dramatic actor. And Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are once again great, but I wish they had more screen time. And it is very sad to see that Richard Harris will no longer be with us as Dumbledore. Such a loss of a great actor! Now rating the 2 disc widescreen DVD: Disc 1 has the movie, plus 2 trailers ( one current and one for Year One). There is also the cast/crew lineup, which once again, I wish they would go a bit more in depth. Disc 2 is great! There are 19 additional scenes. Some good like extended scenes of the ""horror"" shop, a scene with Lockhart, and talking about the ""heir"" in study hall. Some were very...huh? ""Behind the Hogwarts"" has an interview with JK Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves. Very good! Also, there is ""Dumbledore's Office"" which has the making of Dumbledore's office and the greenhouse scene, and a tour of the office. The making of the office was a great docu with a lot of wow moments on how they put everything together. There is also various interviews with the cast. Some good and some bad. I wish Isaac's, Rickman's and Coltrane's were longer, as they are genuine funny people. Overall, another great Harry Potter movie in the series, and a great DVD! Highly worth buying and adding to the home collection!"

","As a rabid Harry Potter fan, I eagerly awaited this movie and I couldn't help but be disappointed. Naturally, since I've devoured all of the books, I had some ideas about how this movie should be and, as a result, came away feeling let down. It can't be said enough that the casting of these movies is masterful. Snape was never a particular favorite of mine and although I initially felt that Alan Rickman was miscast, he soon did away with all of my apprehensions. He is masterful as Snape. With the simple curl of a lip or a subtle change in the slant of his eyebrow, he can convey the sinister nature of Snape and his expressions are every bit as inscrutable as the Snape from the books. It was a pleasure to see that Rickman was not the only wonderful cast member to return. The actors do a wonderful job of really inhabiting their characters and the child actors have grown since the previous movie. The fact that they're the same actors helps maintain the continuity that is so important to the HP works as a whole. Not only are Harry and his friends growing in the books, so are the actors who portray them. Another very strong point of this movie was Dobby, a character I loved in the books. In spite of his odd and rather ugly appearance, there is something sweet and endearing about him. He's loyalty personified--even though he can be a pain in the rear. His voice was wonderful too and it was such a treat to see him move from the page and into ""real"" life. Jason Isaacs is another welcome addition to the cast of characters and he infuses Lucius Malfoy with cold, elegant menace. He's every bit as intimidating as Snape but with a thin veneer of charm and elegance. Isaacs really made the character come to life for me. Yet in spite of all this, what I sorely missed in this movie was the delicious humor that permeated nearly every page of the book. I've long felt that Chamber of Secrets is the funniest of the HP books but much of the humor was stripped from the movie in order to move the plot along. I felt that this did the story a disservice as humor so often proves such a saving grace in Harry's world."
"valadas","6","0","0","20 February 2008"," A prodigious original creative imagination
","The books by J. K. Rowling narrating Harry Potter's saga are indeed the product of a powerful creative imagination and an original one into the bargain. She creates an universe that lives entirely in her head around a school of wizards that is described in all its details, rules, habits and characters whatever odd or strange they may be making it to appear as real. The atmosphere of the school situates itself in an old mansion or castle or palace which lends it a Gothic atmosphere that adds mystery to the stories involved. This movie follows faithfully these features without losing its aesthetic autonomy as a movie (which is an art other than literature) translating the most thrilling moments of the book by effective visual effects. The fantastic scenes which we see, however, are not more thrilling than others shown on other fantastic movies. And of course we cannot forget this is a movie for children or teen-agers therefore we adults must forget our own values while watching it. Nevertheless, as usual, the general subject is the fight between Good and Evil which always ends with the latter's defeat though only temporary because in the following movie of the series that fight is resumed again. A good movie to entertain and amuse and nothing more."

","Harry Potter is an English schoolboy who wears trademarked and copyrighted glasses. He goes to school in a school of magic. Which is quite a change from the usual English school boy drama (viz. David Copperfield). Unfortunately, Harry has enough gruel. However, conflicts come about because Harry and his pals are the good kind of Satan-worshippers, and they fight against the bad kind of Satan-worshippers. Anyway, Harry lives in this castle where he goes to school with a large group of English character actors. Some of them wear fake beards or wigs.<br/><br/>There is also a delightful, new character named Dobby. Unfortunately, I have been unable to yet find a Dobby doll or drinking cup; perhaps he didn't test as well as Jar Jar Binks. Dobby is a CGI character, as are many of the other fine characters in the film. I was vaguely worried that Harry would be killed (or at least given a nasty electrical shock) when being chased by various of the CGI characters.<br/><br/>So, after being chased by the bad guy's snake through some chamber or other, Harry survives and becomes a Big Time Magician."

","I have not read the book to the ""Chamber of Secrets"", only watched the movie on TV recently.  The special effects were really great, but the story line was a bit disappointing.  The story was altogether a bit too similar to the first movie, but it somehow lacked its charm.  The ending was a bit too rushed for a movie of this length and some of the final scenes looked a bit awkward and forced.  I also did not quite understand the purpose of the spiders, but maybe that's just me and it might become clearer if I read the book one day.  I sincerely resented the character Dobby, it was too reminiscing of some annoying CGI-character from ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"".<br/><br/>Having said that, the movie was certainly funnier and at the same time somewhat 'darker' than the first one, which were certainly refreshing new aspects.  The acting by the cast (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, McGona..?, Snape, Malfoy I+II, and many others) was really great.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to the next sequels to come, and I seriously hope they will not be a repetition of the same story pattern over and over again.

Hermione is as childlishly practical (although not as cute) as the first film. Radcliffe shows loads of improvement in his acting abilities (he was somewhat cheesy in the first film, but to a certain extent it's hard not to be in a film like these films) My favorite scene is the sequence where Tom Riddle shows Harry his capture of Hagrid. The greyscale brownish look is very effective (although I think they should have cast someone besides Harris to play young Dumbledore, and perhaps dubbed in his voice later.) This film is a great cap to Harris's career, and I am sure to miss him in the later installments.

I prefer fantasy movies to be fun. The characters were fleshed out quite a bit more, but that is to be expected when they are seen the second time around.

","After a wonderful introduction produced by the first movie, i was a bit dissapointed to see very little improvement in almost every area. Granted i do enjoy reading the books written by JK rowling but i am a little shocked at what it seems to have very little effort to capture the true identity of each charater. I personally think its not necessarly the actors and actress's fault but more the script let them down by not being more about all the characters ( even the minor ones). The movie tends to revolve around harry,ron and hermoine and yes they are the main charaters but i feel that some of the minor characters need to be shown more so we can learn more about them. For example, our two practical jokers Fred and George weasly. allowing them to have more lines would definetly spice up the movie a bit. Also Ginny weasly, she is becoming more of a character who's not quite so shy but kind of a bad girl inside and i hope in the future movies we see this side come out. Also Lee Jordan, he is a funny joker to since he hangs around w/the twins and finally neville longbottom. I feel that the tension between the houses are exposed a little to much as well.

Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley manages to give the funniest scene in the entire movie as he manages to put a very unpleasant spell on himself. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy looks hellishly evil and I look forward to seeing him in the fourth movie and Emma Watson is much less annoying in this second installment. But the movie is (again) overly long for what it has to tell, which is stupid since the main public are the children. Some nice scary spider moments, though.

","HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS / Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson / Directed by Chris Columbus and Written by Steve Kloves / Rated PG / ***<br/><br/>
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was once a thing of beauty, in some ways playing like a resort beach house, a vacational spot which happened to be occupied by kidlets of the magical kind. However, that time has passed, and Hogwarts School is under an attack from it's own past. For when Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) receives warning of this dark force by an extremely worried house elf called Dobby, he is determined to save his magical school, not without, though, the help of his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).<br/><br/>With Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, it's clear that director Chris Columbus is taking the safe way with the beginning chapters of the film franchise based on J.K Rowling's bestselling book series. Of all the 161 minutes I had witnessed of this second movie adaptation, I do not believe seeing any piece of the material dismissing what actually happened in the original source. Columbus is a rather uninspired director and this, like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is a cut-and-paste job. There was no bravery in making this film, but what I did see still entertains. Even though the movie barely differs from the book, it's magic lies in the ability to entertain young and old.<br/><br/>The real pleasure in Chris Columbus' direction is that he seems to be a brilliant artist. He paints in the corners of the screen. There are very few scenes with at least a touch of computer animation or digital work. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is beautiful to look at. The images conjured in the head of a reader while reading Rowling's original novel is magnificently brought to life on screen. Watching these images unravel themselves on screen alone makes this movie worth recommending. The scenery surrounding the majestic Hogwarts is lush and utterly captivating. This is a movie about transporting you to a new world full of strange and illogical rules, much like Alice in Wonderland or even 2002s Spirited Away. In terms of the fantastic, it's vastly superior to that other big-budget franchise called Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones but never reaches the stunning images and affection found in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. <br/><br/>But what about the story? With all these fantastic images, the story is king, right? The story here is, I think, a little bit better than the first installment. Chamber of Secrets is a more narrative arc than The Sorcerer's Stone. Anticipation leads to a stunning climax battle with a deadly snake, the only trouble is getting there. I think it can be argued that the plot in this movie unfolds much more slowly than it's predecessor. It is a mystery tale, plain and simple, with little touches of Quidditch and other magical activity. Much of the detail in this movie is focused on Daniel Radcliffe, and really, why shouldn't it be? Radcliffe plays Potter with more elegance and confidence. He is the enemy in his own story. As his classmates claim him to be the dreaded Heir of Slytherin, Harry is even more determined to clear his name. Radcliffe shows much, much promise with his acting here.<br/><br/>This movie, like the last, includes an array of supporting characters. The two most notable are Ron and Hermione, Harry's closest friends. Even with only two movies in her filmography, Emma Watson is probably the most talented young actress in the film world today. I hope many other producers notice her role in these two films and snatch her up for their own. Grint, on the other hand, has trouble with the script. Screenwriter Steven Kloves has Grint doing nothing but standing around, looking scared. What's more of a tragedy is that Watson is absent from all of the film's third act. The adult actors get a bit more screen time than they did last time, however. Still, the greats like Alan Rickman, John Cleese and Robbie Coltrane are reduced almost to mere cameos. The saving grace of this cast is Richard Harris in his last screen role as headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Unlike his sleepwalking role in the first film, he brings grace and presence in his role. I just wish he had a lot more to do.<br/><br/>With Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as a sequel, there are much new dazzling sights to see and new things to hear about. There are many nifty digital effects in nearly every scene, giving us more insight to the world of wizardry. Though aside from the technical magic, Kenneth Branagh as the flamboyant Gilderoy Lockhart is the greatest addition to the film. Much like the Wizard of Oz, Lockhart is only a cover-up, style over substance as he fails to generate any magical power throughout the movie, covering up as he goes along. There is also Professor Sprout of the greenhouses and Madam Pomfrey of the hospital wing.<br/><br/>Even with all the ga-ga sets and spectacular special effects, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I think, betters the original ""Potter"". This story goes a little deeper, the acting stronger and the art direction gorgeous. However, it still feels hollow in the core, that this maybe isn't the real Harry Potter we should be seeing. It isn't strong enough to stand as it's own movie franchise. Many who have not read the books I think will find very little in the film to enjoy. The entertainment is mostly in the visuals. It does remain a solid piece of enchantment for the 161 minutes, but that's all it is. The books created this vast world, complete with fully fleshed-out characters and interesting subplots. The movies follow the main story, not daring to turn the camera off the story and into the deeper interactions between Rowling's vivid characters. But then again, at 161 minutes, maybe we're lucky not to experience the full Potter."

Harry is warned not to go back to Hogwarts by a strange and pathetic creature named Dobby, but Harry wouldn't miss his second year for the world.

Once again, Harry must confront an evil foe and the future of Hogwarts is tied into his success or failure.<br/><br/>I haven't read the Harry Potter books, so I'm commenting on the movies alone and not how faithful they are to the books.  My favorite of the two Harry Potter movies is still the first, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. That movie is a magical movie, no pun intended!  This installment, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is very good, but it just can't top the chess game in the first movie, nor does it quite match the quaint and lovely atmosphere of the first film.  However, it comes close and is a good movie in its own right.  Well done!  I rate it an 89/100.  The first one is a 91/100!"

","And so, here we are, at the second Harry Potter film. Ah, the memories of the adventure! Where, then, to begin? <br/><br/>Perhaps we should start with the magnificent title sequence. Throwing back to the classic Warner Bros. features of ancient years (80 of them, as a matter of fact), the first fade-in finds us flying through a cloud-filled morning sky. Coming right at us once more, as we knew it inevitably would, is the much-beloved WB shield.... but the flight doesn't stop there. As the shield does a perfect left turn up, some of the clouds part, revealing the film's title logo in all its glory, coming straight at us....<br/><br/>From there, we get on with the tale proper. Dobby's warning that Harry must not return to Hogwarts only makes him more determined to get to the bottom of this ""plot... to make terrible things happen."" Along the way, we meet a few new Hogwarts teachers, starting with Miriam Margoyles' deliciously silly Professor Sprout, who knows a thing or two about Mandragores. (Dolby Stereo can kill you? Consider the cry of the Mandragore first!)<br/><br/>But of course, it is Kenneth Branagh as ultra-vain Gilderoy Lockhart, the latest teacher in Hogwarts' most severe course, that of Defense Against the Dark Arts, who steals the show. When Harry and his sidekick Ron Weasley ultimately expose Lockhart as a fraud, one cannot help but wonder why Branagh's character chose that particular route, knowing that were he to attempt to rescue Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, such a bid would only cause his failure.<br/><br/>The Quidditch match is more brutal than last time --- until you read between the lines about the rogue Bludger. It's not spoken of throughout the scene, but one can guess that Dobby was responsible for tampering with the Bludger --- a part of his bid to ""protect"" Harry from the ""plot."" Dobby's every move somehow becomes a series of mental puzzles that keep us guessing until Harry's final rematch with Voldemort, in his teenage form as Tom Marvolo Riddle, Jr. One hopes that newcomer Christian Coulson will have bolder, sexier and more action-packed roles like this one.<br/><br/>Oh yes, there's the little matter of yours truly, as embodied by Richard Harris. Pity that this was his last major role; I would have loved to have gone on with him as me. Still, not all of us can have what we want, and I certainly hope Michael Gambon will be perfect to carry on that proud ol' Dumbledore tradition when Prisoner of Azkaban completes production later in the year.<br/><br/>What, ultimately, to say about Chamber of Secrets overall? Well, I imagine it's just the perfect film for good dreamers. And, as the film comes to an end with a deliciously sumptuous ""Welcome Back Feast,"" our Mr. Potter celebrates my good friend and gamekeeper as simply as possible: ""There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."" Truer words were never spoken of a more honorable friend. <br/><br/>And so, if I may, a toast. Here's to happy endings --- Hogwarts style, of course!<br/><br/>Faithfully,<br/><br/>Dumbledore"

","This one was pretty much a flop for me. While it wasn't all bad, and I've certainly seen worse movies... it just didn't hold the same appeal as Sorcerer's Stone. The magic was gone and in it's place just a few whiny sidekick kids and Harry. And, slight spoiler... the ""Chamber of Secrets"" is very poorly named indeed.<br/><br/>Many things disappoint me about this film. The first of which is the utter lack of magic in a school of magic. Flying cars, check. Ghosts, check. Bunch of other ridiculous things having nearly nothing to do with magic, check. But actual spells and wizardry? Very little. The only one of this whole gang of wizards that seems to be able to cast a spell is Hermione, and she sits a lot of this movie out. Apparently Harry and Ron should both be held back a few grades.<br/><br/>Another HUGE disappointment for me, and it nearly ruins the movie, is the constant overuse of the school system. Oh, gee... our three heros are in trouble again because they happen to be in the wrong place. Oh no, better not tell them what's really going on... better break another few dozen rules instead. What's that? You think we did it? Oh no... we might be, gulp, expelled for the 25th time. Give me a break. It's used and reused and used yet again to the point of utter insanity.<br/><br/>The acting is good, nothing mind blowing but good. Harry stands well in most scenes, but Ron is often overacted. Though, from the looks of things, I'm willing to bet he was told to overact. ""Harry, you look brave. Ron, you look cowardly and whiny. - Action!"" Worse is the character Dobby, who I couldn't hate any more than I already do. The best new character is probably the girl ghost Moaning Myrtle. Both her CGI effects and acting were really good, sadly they look like they got stuck in the wrong movie and belonged in something much better.<br/><br/><ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>"

","I mentioned in my first ÂHarry Potter' review, that I had Âbig expectations' when I got around to seeing the sequel titled Âthe chamber of secrets.' Having now seen it, and sure it is an entertaining movie, but for me, it did not have the same appeal as the first film had. But if I was ten years old, I am sure that this movie would be a classic, which I am sure the movie world will one day be calling it. I am not sure whether it deserves such praise.   <br/><br/>Something Evil Has Returned To Hogwarts! At the start of his second year of an amazing journey into the world of wizardry, cars fly, trees fight back and a mysterious elf comes to warn Harry Potter. This year at Hogwarts, spiders talk, letters scold and Harry's own unsettling ability to speak to snakes turns his friends against him. From duelling clubs to rogue Bludgers, it's a year of adventure and danger when bloody writing on a wall announces: ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened"". To save Hogwarts will require all of Harry, Ron and Hermione's magical abilities and courage in this spellbinding sequel. <br/><br/>Back in the lead role of Harry Potter is young star Daniel Radcliffe. I enjoyed his role in the first movie a little bit more, but he has proven in both movies that he is a fine choice as Harry. Harry is saved from his life of misery with his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling), by his best friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) in an immensely enjoyable escape. The other friend Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also good, although her character has a rather less than appealing affect called Âpetrifying' placed on her when she is trying to help Harry and Ron figure out what is going on at Hogwarts.  <br/><br/>
There are also some very new and original characters that have been designed for the sequel of ÂHarry Potter'. The best addition to the Harry Potter cast in my opinion happens to be a computer generated Âhouse elf' called ÂDobby'. He is so funny in what he says and does. It is credit to the creators of this creature, as he looked very Âhuman' from where I viewed it. Another of the new characters that I found great joy in watching was the strange ghost called ÂMoaning Myrtle', who was an important person in the make-up of the movie. Of the human members of the cast that were new to the movie, it happens to be one of Hollywood's better known actors. The fraud book writer Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagher) was a character that I found funny, and shows that he is a person that Harry and his friends need to be wary of.<br/><br/>
Yet the regular adult members of the cast did not have the same impact as they did in the first movie. People such as headmaster Prof. Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) and Prof. McGonagol (Maggie Smith), were all given minor roles in this movie, which brought the film down, in my opinion. In the first movie, these actors had better defined characters and gave adult viewers of the movie something to be able to take away from it. I cannot say this was evident in the Harry Potter sequel, which was disappointing. It must be mentioned that these actors take a risk by taking on such roles, so it would be better if they had greater roles within the film.  <br/><br/> However the story did have some good points to it. The action that was written certainly made for an entertaining story in places. So was the way that the story made the Âchamber of secrets' seem like a very evil and disturbed place at Hogwarts, especially for Harry. The exciting and scary parts of ÂThe chamber of secrets' would have been too much for some youngsters. The movie's screenplay was well adapted once again by screenwriter, Steve Klobe. Also back a second time was director Chris Columbus, who had great success in the first of these movies. While he did an okay job in the sequel, I wish that he had done things a little bit different, like make the adult characters come through a bit better and did certain parts of this film just like the first movie. <br/><br/>Which bring me to the scene highlights of ÂThe chamber of secrets'. I really enjoyed the scene which involved the three main characters and how they a drink a potion that changes them. This was a funny and original part of the film. With great visual effects, ÂThe Chamber of Secrets' had such big moments such as when Harry and Ron are on the run from some menacing looking spiders. Harry's confrontation in the Âchamber' was also great and well produced by all involved, as was the way that Harry learns the secrets of the chamber. The one scene that I found most disappointing was the ÂQuidditch' match. While this was one of the great highlights of the first movie, it was not so for me in the second, as it was not as action packed like it was in the first movie.    <br/><br/>The ÂHarry Potter' movies still makes me wary of how bad witchcraft can be, especially in the hands of youngsters. Harry Potter is also a character that I am sure was created with certain people in mind. I am thinking of youngsters who come from backgrounds like Âtroublemakers', Âpoor kids' and Âparentless children', as Harry fits under all these categories. He would have to appeal to all of the children who might fit under one or more of these banners.  Look all in all this was a good movie, but nothing that I would call great. <br/><br/>CMRS gives ÂHarry Potter and the Chamber of secrets': 3.5 (Good ÂVery Good Film)"

The graphics and special effects were well done and the CGI character of Dobby was also interesting. I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books yet, so there was no bias or expectations before watching the movie. I can now understand its immense popularity. I find it surprising that even though the world developes technologically, at movies, we still seem to prefer our wizards and elf's and jedi's and the magical alternative universe that they dwell in. Three of last years biggest hits were based on fictional alter universes, and it looks like the same this year. And take note of the increased comic book heroes being presented and succeeding.

To get the full experience, you need to buy the DVD and check out the Additional Scenes.  As with Peter Jackson's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", Christopher Columbus seems to have specifically targetted those all important little character-defining, relationship-building scenes as victims of the editor's blade.  In particular, any scene which referred to Harry's gradual alienation from the school body and his own doubts about his identity and heritage were removed completely, to the detriment of the film.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, a fine effort by nearly all involved.  The movie very well captures a darker and much more sinister tone, underscoring more confident performances from Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Emma Watson as Hermione.  I must say, however, that Rupert Grint as Ron, the best of the three of them in the first film, seems to have lost his ability to do more than two emotions, one of which is grossly over-acted fear.  As he has gained other movie experience since Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, this was a considerable disappointment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the genuinely frightening scenes of hung cats, giant spiders and Harry himself apparently going mad, were rather cut down at the knees by a somewhat drab climax (although some of this may be down to the book's resolution.)  This was not helped by the very poor and completely unconvincing performance by the actor who played Tom Riddle.  It beggars belief that Columbus and Heyman couldn't find someone better.  It was also surprising on one or two occasions that they couldn't find a better take of a particular shot than some which appeared in the final cut.  **SPOILER AHEAD** For a ""flashback"" sequence, they got a different actor to play a young Hagrid, and shot him with his face in shadow.  This was somewhat jarring - as if anybody would care that a supposedly younger Hagrid had wrinkles!<br/><br/>Richard Harris gave a fine, valedictory performance (in fact sadly he looked even haler and in better health than in the first movie).  It's just a shame that Dumbledore's role appears to be to behave like every schoolchild's dream teacher - lax, overindulgent, willing to put down other teachers in front of the children - thus rather removing any reason to retain any respect for him.  Maggie Smith reprised her Miss Jean Brodie act again, but her reduced involvement was a little bit sad.  Miriam Margolyes never puts a foot wrong, so she's always money in the bank.  Kenneth Branagh playing Gilderoy Lockhart, a part he could sleepwalk through, suffered from an insufficient exploration of exactly what Lockhart's supposed to have done (but didn't) that merits everybody's hero worship.  In other words we only saw the egotism right from his first scene, rather than see the hero and then realise the egotism and the feet of clay as we get to know him better. However, I was tickled to see that Rowling had cast his first appearance in the form of a book-signing - the book version undoubtedly contains more pointed satirical swipes at the activity in which she had become very experienced during the time since her first book was published!<br/><br/>The effects were very well done, particularly Dobby the House Elf - for my money the most convincing CG creature ever created.  (Freeze frame him while he's moving - I defy anyone to tell the motion blur from the real thing). The light comes off his skin absolutely flawlessly, although they went to the trouble of ""showing off"" this facet in the scene where he hits himself with the lamp.  ""Showing off"" the effects was in fact a besetting sin during this film.  They start the film with a landscape of suburban Surrey (seemingly more densely packed with houses than Hong Kong!) before diving into Harry's bedroom window.  Then a magnificent vista of Hogwarts as the camera flies into the main refectory window.  Then another magnificent shot before going through a skylight in the greenhouse.  Then a wonderful flying shot of the Quidditch field before we cross the wall and join the play.  I was truly rolling my eyes by this last shot.  One of those per movie from now on, please, Mr Columbus."

","...which exactly is the case with this movie.  It's more mature and far more interesting.  Of course, as an eager fan of Harry Potter, it wasn't all the original excitment I felt before seeing the first movie, but rather a routine, as 'Oh well, second part is here'. <br/><br/>Acting was superb.  Kenneth Branagh was far the best, which is undeniable since every movie he's been in, he's thrown other actors in his shadow.  I could not imagine Lockhart being anybody else but him, after he's left the mark.  Alan Rickman was not as good in the first movie and didn't get as nearly as much screen time.  In the first scene we see him, after Ron says: 'But honestly Professor, I think it has done more damage to us', Professor shouts 'Silence'.  That was poorely done and badly cut. <br/><br/>
Fiona Shaw was not as nearly as good as in the first movie, where I think she did her part best of all.  Maggie Smith and Richard Harris were traditionally good.  Jason Isaacs surely did give Lucius a person touch, but I felt that his voice was far too silky and auditious in some parts, such as when he is in Hagrid's hut.  Robbie Coltrane wasn't as nearly as funny as in the first movie, but equally excellent.  <br/><br/>Children actors were again in the shadow of the older and more experienced actors, and despite their attempts to act, they looked funny and immature comparing to the icons of the British film.  Daniel was all right, but he lacks zealousness as Harry Potter, being too timid.  Rupert Grint, despite being very funny, was very bad.  Emma Watson wasn't as nearly as annoying as in the first movie, but just trying too hard.  Tom Felton overdid Draco, so Draco did not seem like a real person anymore. <br/><br/>Overall, movie is great and very fun.  A definite classic."

","""Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets"" I suppose in some ways is better then the first film. It is an endlessly creative and imaginative movie. It has flying cars, trees that fight, a small elf and many other things that set the movie apart from others. But, the real downside to the movie is it's story. It's rather weak. And I even thought this of the first one, but, moreso here, now that I can compare the two.<br/><br/> ""Harry Potter 2"" (Which is how I will refer to the movie from now on) is enjoyable in it's opening moments. We are revisiting a world we have not seen in a year. We meet the same old characters, some new ones, but, I personally became bored with the movie after a while. I felt that the viewer is just going along with the movie to mainly see the special effect. Well, after the appeal of that rubs off, than what? The story in both films was never strong enough to hold the viewers interest for the entire length of the film. I believe, or at least it felt like this one was longer than the first! At 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes, ""Harry Potter 2"" should of been cut down by at least 40 mins. Imagine what kind of truly amazing film that would of been. Because than the movie would move faster, we would see this amazing world that has been created and the action and adventure would be coming from all sides. Then you would really have an exciting movie filled with laughs, special effects, and action.<br/><br/> This movie is about Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) being warned not to return to Hogwarts for fear someone will harm him. Of course Harry doesn't listen because he claims Hogwarts is the only place where he feels he belongs and it's the only place where he has any friends. Once he arrives strange things start to happen. And soon we are told about a secrets chamber that was created a long time ago. The chamber has been opened again and is causing harm to the students. Now, Harry and company must find out who opened the chamber of secrets and save Hogwarts. Does this honestly sound like it can hold your attention for over 2 hours?! Don't get me wrong. I did slightly enjoy the movie. I think it does possess more ""magic"" then the first one. But, the advantage the first one had naturally was it was introducing us to these characters. There was more of a story there then here. The first one had much more to tell since it was opening up a series. This one just seems like it wants to get by on it's creative special effects. I will admit one of the things I liked about this movie is the introducton of Professor Gideroy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh). I found his character to be very amusing. Is this something the kids will like? I suppose so. I do think the ending may scare them though. But, maybe not, kids seem to be a lot more braver than I was when I was a kid lol. I guess this is a movie the whole family may enjoy but I think the adults may become bored with it before the kids do. If you enjoyed the books and the first movie, ""The Chamber of Secrets"" will entertain you. *** ( out of ****)<br/><br/>ps - I'm not very ""schooled"" in this whole Harry Potter thing, but, why is he the main character. When at one point in the movie someone actually says what I was thinking. He doesn't seem to have any magical powers. He just seems to be getting himself in trouble and it's up to his friends namely Hermione to get him out. He never does anything remarkable that makes you believe he would have the reputation that he does."

I felt with the job he did and the credit he began with in the first movie he should have his own room/office/laboratory. The first movie also lacked full information on why everyone knew him as if he was reincarnated, these could have been added here too instead of the constant mention of his scar.

This movie doesn't allow me any suspension of disbelief because it's jarringly obvious that it was filmed out of order--at the beginning, we have taller Harry and Ron with their voices changed.  Through the movie, Radcliffe is at times shorter than Emma Watson, though when we first see them together he's a few inches taller; at times his voice sounds as though it's ""changing"" (it's in the lower timbre, but with a squeak to it); and in a scene near the end of the movie it's still unchanged.  Had they filmed more or less in order, this wouldn't be a problem, but it's obvious that some changes in the characters aren't linear, which pulls me out of the fantasy."

The movie was much like Sorcerer's Stone in its advantages and disadvantages.  The writer did another admirable job of condensing events without losing too much, though again some fairly big scenes were left out (hopefully included on the dvd).  The soundtrack was a bit much at times but nowhere near as overbearing as with Sorcerer's Stone.  My biggest gripe with this one was the ending.  It just seemed to drag very badly, and when they had the big welcome home for Hagrid everything ground to an ungainly halt. Even the battle with the basilisk seemed to take too long (that particular event ZOOMED by breathlessly in the book.

She could have even got trapped behind the rocks with Ron so not changing the final confrontation between Harry and Voldelmort.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how it'll play out in theaters with the main crook being Voldelmort in every single story.  It works fine in books, but I already have heard friends and family saying that it was kind of boring for Harry to fight Voldelmort again.  Many people that say this haven't read the books so they don't know that all seven books will be about Harry's ongoing battle with the evil sorcerer.<br/><br/>I think the Harry Potter books are great but I wonder if they might not need some serious editing to transfer them to the big screen.

Personally I think the film is fantastic and the big imagination of the writer made it a succes. Curiously the adult people who saw the film liked it soo much.

","It's difficult to watch a movie after reading the book without prejudice or bias, so with great trepidation and anticipation I took my family to see the second Harry Potter movie. I loved it! I know it's difficult to include everything in a movie and although I missed a lot of things in the movie, like the denogming and Percy's girlfriend sub-plot, their lack of appearance in the movie didn't take away from the movie plot at all.<br/><br/>The attention to detail made it evident that this was Columbus' favorite book and it made for a better movie. The grounds of Hogwarts were just as I pictured them to be. The casting of Lockhart could not have been better!<br/><br/>
I can't wait for the DVD! This is a definite must-buy for any Harry Potter fan and Muggle as well!"

","The second Harry Potter film follows Harry and friends through their sophomore year at Hogwarts, the mystical school for young wizards. As has been stressed, now that the ground rules have firmly been established in the first film, the second can focus on deeper character development and plotting. And so it does. Hogwarts, wizards, magic, and all the rest of the J.K. Rowling milieu are taken for granted. They play a Quidditch match without having to explain the rules. <br/><br/>Chris Columbus does a great job with the actors, sets, and special effects. Again, we're transporting to a different universe with its own rules and characters. And it works well, its style reminding me of the adventure movies of the 30s, 40s and 50s.  It's a rich mix, but probably much more so for kids that adults. I have only one caution.<br/><br/>As an unread Harry fan, I found the plotting unoriginal. Of course, Harry Potter books and movies are for kids, so let's keep it simple. My fear is that the series will reduce itself to Scooby-Doo style rubber stamp stories, one just like the other. Maybe I'd better read them first, to allay my fears."

","I hated Harry Potter, but when I went to see the movie I just fell in love with it. I have read the book five times each, I have seen the movie about eight or nine times, and my room is literally filed with HP merchandise. This movie is such a compelling story full of mystery and excitement. The story starts as always, when Harry is with his aunt and uncle. He feels traped (which he later is by his uncle) because he has not recieved letters from his friends and is still treated badly by his own blood-family he has. When Dobby, a house elf, shows up in his room and warns him not to return to Howgarts, that a terror has been unleashed on mudbloods (muggle born). Harry ignores these warnings and returns to Howgarts, just to discover that a monster has been petrifing mudbloods throughout the year. When all the clues start adding up, it is up to Ron and Harry to capture the monster, bring Hagrid back, and get rid of all the rumors and evil that has been circling around his life. These is a story which all kids around the world will enjoy and cherish for decades to come. I gave this movie a 10 out of 10."
"IlikeCakebigtime","Null","0","0","22 February 2003"," Better than the first one!
","I think that this film is much better than the first one in many ways: The pacing, the acting, the humour, etc... Although it still wasn't brilliant. It has the ability to be brilliant but it doesn't manage it. The book still beats it easily.<br/><br/>The three leads I think are a lot better in this one. Ron (Rupert Grint) is absolutely hilarious, Hermione (Emma Watson) is less annoying than she was in the first one, and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has more than two expressions in this one. Robbie Coltrane is still very lovable as the big, friendly giant Hagrid, Alan Rickman (who is one of my favourite actors) is still incredibly icy as Snape, Richard Harris, as Dumbledore, is better than he was in the first one but still not brilliant (I don't think he really understood his part) and Maggie Smith still makes a wonderful Mcgonagal. Also, I'd like to give special mention to Jason Isaacs, as Lucius Malfoy, who I thought was excellent. I also thought that Christian Coulson had very good screen presence as Tom Riddle.<br/><br/>I thought the adaptation could still be a little bit better. Like plenty of other things in this film it's better than it was in the first one but there's still room for improvement. Plenty of people might disagree with me but I think that they don't cut enough bits out. I know it's a pretty faithful adaptation of the book but if they want to actually make an really good film then they should think about cutting more out. I think this because they try and pack loads of things into the films and in the end each scene lasts no longer than about a minute, if you see what I mean. The Lord of the Rings was adapted near perfectly (take note, Steve Kloves, take note) Also, I don't think that this film (and the first film) is very good for people who haven't read the book. It works well as an illustration of the book, not as a stand alone film.<br/><br/>I'm still not absolutely sure that Chris Columbus is the right guy to be the director for Harry Potter. He doesn't make it dark enough. He makes it too childish and cheesy. But all that will change, of course, as there's going to be a new director on board.<br/><br/>But I'm going to leave on a positive note because I did enjoy the film and thought it was much better than the first one and I'm convinced that the Harry Potter films are going to get better and better as they go on."

"McHuevo","8","0","0","8 February 2003"," Potter got Better
","There are just a few sequels out there that turned out to be better than the first, and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is one of them.<br/><br/>While keeping a lot from the 'Sorcerer's Stone"" in terms of casting (fortunately), pacing and humor, 'the Chamber of Secrets' is a much darker film. It depicts a more threatening and dangerous Hogwarts; a place in which you could actually die if you're not careful.<br/><br/>The overall performance is also better, if just a little bit over the top, which actually helps narrate a more complicated story to the children (for whom this movie is intended). Jason Isaacs and Kenneth Branagh were great additions to an already great cast.<br/><br/>The first film had very poor computer-generated visual effects, particularly noticeable in the Quiditch game sequence. Well, it seems that the FX department went through a lot of work to improve the look for 'The chamber of secrets'. The perfect example is Dobby, one of the three major digital characters of 2002 (along with Yoda and Gollum).<br/><br/>In general, almost every aspect of the film is better than its predecessor, except for one thing: the 'Scooby-Doo' feeling of it got stronger this time. Since I haven't finished the book, I can't say for sure if this is the screenplay's or the book's fault. It's a very childish end to a not so childish movie. You know what I mean, the ""Ha ha ha, I'm so very evil that I'm going to tell you all the details of my plan for taking over the world so that you can thwart it once you escape from my ellaborate death scenario while I laugh and say, for no particular reason, sarcastic-evil phrases out of the air"" scene. No, that was not Dr. Evil speaking, just the bad guy in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" (hmmm, maybe they are related).<br/><br/>I hope our paisano Alfonso Cuaron does an even better job for 'The Prisoner of Azkaban'. If things keep going this way the ""Harry Potter"" saga will be worth having both in the books and DVD."

I had been informed by friends who had seen both films that it was more entertaining and a more interesting story.  Had I read the books maybe I wouldn't have been surprised, but I was taken aback with Harry being back at his relative's home at the beginning.  This was a very long and tedious introduction that was essentially a rehash of the first movie, and the character of the House Elf was so reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks in his voice and enunciation that I could hardly stand it.  The movie was replete with redundancies from the first movie such as the quillage game, and I found it to be very boring to the point of almost putting me to sleep at times.

","Fans of novelist J.K. Rowling publishing juggernaut will be happy to know that the events from the book are faithfully replicated for the screen,but in my honest opinion perhaps too much so for those who might enjoy a little interpretative license. This is particularly the case with this latest installment which looks like a version of a pre-Spielburg  sequel to can we say here,Harry Potter and the Temple of Doom? For one, director Chris Columbus has channeled into the essence of the books to a tee according to the standards of novelist J.K. Rowling. but unlike the first installment the title character here(played by Daniel Radcliffe) is very dull and boring and loses the audiences attention very quickly. The rest of the actors here are absoultely brilliant as played by Rupert Grint,Emma Watson,Kenneth Branaugh(doing a delicious turn as a pompous celebrity wizard),Jason Issacs(as the evil nemesis Lord Voldemort is wicked),Robbie Coltrane,Alan Rickman,Maggie Smith,and the late Richard Harris as Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore. Elsewhere,Columbus does a nice job at the special effects especially with the Quidditch scene is a marvel to behold and the climactic scenes(who have some darker moments) are frightening and superbly done to a shine. As for the acting here for some,its need a little improvement especially with Radcliffe who was brilliant in the first one,but slack off in this installment. Still needs more work to do,and for one this one runs way too long(at over two hours) and this may bore some children under the age of 12 but still has a ""PG"" rating.<br/><br/>However,the next Harry Potter installment won't be out until the summer of 2004 under the direction of Alfonso Cuaron(in which Columbus wants to do other projects and take a break from the series)."

"SMK-4","8","0","0","3 January 2003"," More coherent than the first
","A clear improvement over the previous film - this is more a story than a sequence of set pieces and the (necessary!) thinning out of the material to reach feature film length was done here much more intelligently.  The first film made the mistake of doing a proportional reduction of the material across the board, leaving too many things in there, and inevitably in a rather underdeveloped state.  This still happens here occasionally, e.g. Harry's trip to Knockturn Alley has been reduced to the point where it contributes so little that it would have been better to cut it altogether, but this is more an exception than the rule.  The final product is still rather long though and thus one might have gone a step further and e.g. ditch the spiders.<br/><br/>There were a few occasions at the beginning of the film when I briefly flinched - some characters and set pieces were too visibly introduced to the audience, for instance Mrs Weasley's first referral to Diagon Alley was a little too exuberant to ring true.  I would have transferred that exuberance to Ginny, after all it could (for all we know) her first time there.<br/><br/>Compared to the book, the film follows more (perceived) American children's taste, e.g. the irony is toned down (I was disappointed about the omission of the Weasley twins' sarcastic exploitation of Harry's suspected Heir of Slytherin status, although this was perhaps an obvious sacrifice to make) and the level of sentimentality increased, especially in the sugar-coated ending."

As the eponymous hero, Daniel Radcliffe is now a rather taller, but more assured, 13 (by a magical coincidence, he shares a birthday - 31 July - with Harry himself and creator J K Rowling). Most of the characters from the first film are back, but new ones include engaging Kenneth Branagh as the charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart and the voice of Toby Jones as the (computer generated) house elf Dobby (who bears more than a passing resemblance to the Gollum in ""Lords Of The Rings 2"" issued about the same time). <br/><br/>Again Rowling has been closely involved with the script and again Chris Columbus is the director, so that the film is a faithful reflection of the book (so I am told), and generally speaking this is a darker world than ""The Philospher's Stone"" with a giant spider, an even huger snake and much scarification and petrification. At 2 hours 41 minutes, it is too long for the young audience at whom it is aimed (at the performance I attended, little ones were constantly running to the toilet), but it is so utterly entertaining that they won't complain. <br/><br/>Footnote: If you wait till the end of the horrendously long credits, you will see a snippet featuring the alleged Professor of The Defence Against The Dark Arts."

"chipe","8","0","0","23 December 2002"," entertaining, recommended, but lots of shortcomings
","I recommend the movie.  I give it 8/10.  However good an entertainment value it is (music, setting, special effects, excellent to adequate acting, etc.), it should not blind us to its shortcomings.<br/><br/>The scenes of any good movie should emphasize the main plot (the detective story - clues, red herrings, etc.) and the background, character and motivations of the characters.  Some occasional comic relief might help.  <br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that it is more like a variety show - a bunch of unrelated acts, acts that don't build on each other, that serve no purpose other than some quick entertainment, or inconsequential scenery (for example, showing what fun the school and magic are). <br/><br/>*****SPOILERS***********<br/><br/>I saw the movie twice.  The second time, I took along a stopwatch and paper for notes.  The movie without the end credits is 2 hours and 30 (or 3l) minutes long.  The end credits are about 10 minutes.  I figure that almost an hour of the movie didn't contribute to the main plot in any significant way.  In the first 28 minutes of the movie (ending with Harry's arrival into the weeping willow tree) the only thing useful to the plot (and was not in the first movie) are two slight and brief scenes that could have (and were) duplicated/ explained later on  --  Lucius' ranting about mudbloods and his putting (rather openly, it seemed to me) the diary into a student's bag.  It took 41 minutes (from the start of the film) for the mystery to begin - Harry's hearing voices in the hallways.. .. The technically wonderful quidditch match was a waste, plot or background-wise; it took up 6 minutes or so.  (A lot of critics have criticized the spider cave incident as a wrong turn that accomplished nothing (about 10 minutes), but every good story can have a red herring.)  The following are some other incidents that did not contribute to character, background or detective plot: time with Harry's muggle family and the Weasleys, Dobby, Dalgon Alley (except for the two things mentioned above regarding Lucius), the missed train and the car rescues and the weeping willow, Gilderoy Lockhart's amusing doings, the wand duel with Draco, the screaming letter, screeching mandrakes, etc. What is ironic to me is that much of the time spent for the above cited unnecessary (though amusing) events could have been better used in elucidating the many puzzling and unexplained rushed aspects of the plot.  How did Ron know Harry had to be rescued from the Dursley's?  How did the car know to rescue Harry twice (from the train station and the spider cave)?   Two unexplained bird rescues too. Why the whomping willow?  What percent of the wizard kids and teachers were full blood wizards? Was Harry?  How did Harry know to spike the diary at the end to defeat the bad guy?  Maybe I was nodding off, but the entire diary thing passed me over - was rushed and unexplained.  I would also like to know what rules Harry broke that such a big deal was made over at the end.  And I don't see how Harry putting his own sock into the diary would free Dobby, especially since Lucius didn't give the diary to Dobby!<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliff's acting was disappointing to me.  Two examples. In one scene (I forget where) when he was in the background and some characters in the foreground were talking, he had a vacant look and was gazing/thinking someplace else.  Near the end when he said something like `Of course, phoenix's have healing powers,' he sounded so flat, as though he was reading the script.<br/><br/>Finally, the `great Harry Potter' didn't seem so great to me.  He seemed clueless and hopeless most of the time.  He had to be rescued by the car, needed Hermione for her spells and diary research, needed the diary to fall into his lap, had to be rescued twice by the birds and cars, and killed the snake without any magic, spells or thoughts, but by an old-fashioned simple sword thrust (And where did the sword come from?  Another mysterious rescue!)!<br/><br/>I'll end with these short comments: (1) best actor and scenes, Kenneth Branagh; (2) cutest scene, Hermione showing disappointment when the exams were cancelled; (3) darkest most ungrateful scene (really), when Dobby and Harry ruined his uncle's important business dinner; (4) scariest moment for little kids - on opening day I was sitting on the aisle.  Across from me I noticed a group of little girls (about 5 years old).  A few rows back was the maid for one of the little girls.  When the snake appeared the girl on the isle quickly shot up and raced to the maid and leapt into her lap.  After the scene was over, she rejoined her friends; and (5) second best scene: Gilderoy, at the very end of the 10- minute end credits.  Stick around."

","The new craze in fantasy movies is to have lovable CG characters such as Jar Jar Binks, Yoda, Gollum and now.......DOBBY.  Yes, Dobby was a highlight of this wonderful adaptation of J.K.'s book.  I finished reading the book this morning at around 9am and swiftly grabbed the news paper to see when the first showing was.  I was not disappointed.  The actors do indeed have lower voices now and they are obviously growing up.  The action is good in this movie also.  I agree with other comments the Draco Malfoy's father is wonderful.  He played a villian in THE PATRIOT and he plays an equally as EVIL person in CHAMBER OF SECRETS.  The movie is long but very good. Hagrid, Dobby, Professor Snape and the gang are in good form in this movie. Quite a performance by the late Sir Richard Harris as well.  I am suprised that the credits didn't mention that this movie was in loving memory of Sir Richard.  Year 2002 will be heralded as the YEAR OF THE FANTASY MOVIES.  I am so thankful that there are two more Harry Potter movies in the COOKER and one more Lord of the Rings.  Thank you Chris Columbus and Peter Jackson."

","MY RATING- 6.3<br/><br/>The mov has just premiered here in Portugal, but I'm not of those maniacs who went in the first day. I simply waited quietly a week til the hyped calmed down. <br/><br/>I heard the cast and Chris Columbus saying this one was better than the first, bla bla but when I went to see it I thought `Are you kidding me?' `D ya think this is better than the first one?' I felt it was similar to what happened with `Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', like trying to be a lot better than the first one. More special effects, more action scenes, and the story was left behind!<br/><br/>Well we still have great acting by the kids (I believe they have a high IQ!) and from the rest of the cast including Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris (God rest his soul), Robbie Coltrane, and also Kenneth Branagh, who is a great add as the narcisist Lockhart.<br/><br/>Yet what is missed? Maybe the magic that the first one had, the sense of discovery of new places. Yeah, I know we have here the chamber of secrets, yet the whole mov is almost like an idiotic cat and mouse thing after the right enemy, much a la Scooby Doo. The question is- does it entertain? Is it interesting? My answer is YES, of course any kid will be pleased, and the fans will be even more happy. Now does it work in cinema? My sincere answer is NOPE. Maybe they were trying to make it similar to the book, but 2  hours and half sitting on theatre is a privilege only some flicks can have. Harry Potter is not that interesting! Maybe movs like `Ben Hur'!--<br/><br/>Finally I'd like to say `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' had some success here in Portugal, we also have a lot of J.K Rowling's readers. I'm not one of them, yet I have to confess this is a good entertainment for kids. It's simply not my style"

It's almost exactly the perfect copy of the novel, everything.      (Could it be this is where the problem is? Movies have their own formula).

"tributarystu","6","0","0","20 December 2002"," Can it get any worse?
","Wizarding is not an easy thing to do, that's for sure. And in a way, film-making is a kind of wizardry, as the director conjures images thought and un-thought of. However, it's not enough to delight on a visual level, the feast must also contain a story well enough patched together (especially considering the long Harry Potter books) and at least decent performances from the actors. Hard thing to do, it seems.<br/><br/>I hoped to see something better than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", judging that people tend to learn from mistakes. Of course, that was naive from me. The action kind of kept jumping from one scene to another, without really much connection between them (not a great screenplay by Kloves). The biggest hole in plotting would be at the end, when Dumbledore says something...rather weird, if you have not read the book. Something like ""No exams will be held"", which the normal movie goer while grasp as natural and had it been our world, I'd have agreed. The natural state of things have to be clearly defined, so as to wholly integrate the world you're trying to pick up from the books in its own universe. Besides Columbus' lack of inspiration, I have to underline the fact that the teens were as bad as in the first. I did not like any of them except, maybe, Rupert Grint and I only liked him in some scenes (like the spiders-scene). The only change at Radcliffe was in his voice, definitely not his acting. Felton wasn't great either, but he's decent enough while playing Malfoy's part. It's also somewhat easier, considering his minutes in the film. The ""big"" actors, on the other hand, are very fine, no complaints against them. Isaacs is good for father Malfoy and Kenneth Branagh portrays Lockhart just perfectly!<br/><br/>What I liked most was Dobby! Though he was not how I imagined him, he was brilliantly animated, and brought with him a bit of fun to the long, sometimes boring portrayal of Harry's second Hogwarts year. Other visual effects? The basilisk was cool enough to satisfy my needs for bloodthirsty creatures. It's really unfortunate that Columbus, a decent guy, couldn't scrap up something better than last time, but I guess it's not only his fault. Working with kids can be quite hard, I imagine and books remain books as movies always try to become...more."

","Not that it's bad, mind you. Quidditch scenes are fascinating, visuals and camerawork are effective as ever. Robbie Coltrane and Dame Maggie Smith are as you've come to expect. Branagh is adequate and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy is definitely an asset.<br/><br/>That said, the second instalment in Harry Potter series is miles weaker than the first, and I mean it. And the weakest part is acting. The director is too busy getting the hell on with his story to pay any attention to how the younger actors are faring. And they are disastrously overacting! Looks like they've forgot what they still remembered a year ago. Not that overacting is exclusively their privilege. Older actors are at it, too. And that makes the Potter world seem very unreal. You are hardly allowed to forget it's the adaptation of a fairytale book you're watching.<br/><br/>Dursleys gathering round Harry to ask him what he'll be doing when the Masons arrive, twins putting on big eyes when their mother threatens Ron, or, God forbid, Seamus Finnigan laughing - scenes like that in any other movie would send director's rating crashing into the white cliffs of Dover. Mr Columbus must be grateful it's HP that he shoots. People'll munch at it anyway.<br/><br/>I understand this is essentially a kids' movie, but one can remember some kids' movies which are good on multiple levels. There is very little in this one for adults. I'll take Oliver Wood's new Quidditch training plan and leave, if you permit. 6/10"

","As an avid Harry Potter-fan, my expectations for this movie were high even though 'Chamber of Secrets' is my least favourite of the four published books. But CoS the movie works very, very well indeed Â a nice step up in quality from 'Philosopher's Stone'. Whereas the first movie Â for all its charm and freshness Â had to cover so many different aspects of Harry Potter's life and his magical world that it sometimes gave the impression of being assembled by a row of different scenes which didn't always fit well together, the structure and overall aim has been greatly improved in CoS. Since this is a sequel, we can disperse with all the explanations and introductions to the magical world and go straight to the plot (which, in fact, strongly resembles the plot of the first book/movie: something evil is going on at Hogwarts, and it is up to our three heroes to figure out what it is and how to stop it). But the story works better in CoS, mainly because the film constantly moves forward Â all the scenes serve a purpose, and they are sowed perfectly together. Sure, there are some omissions, but nothing significant in the overall plot is missing. Add to that some greatly enhanced special effects (mostly noticed in the Quidditch match) and an improved group of child actors, and the result can only be a success.<br/><br/>It falls to the three young protagonists Â Harry, Ron and (partly) Hermione (she is absent from much of the last quarter of the film) Â to carry most of the movie, since they definitely get the most screen time. They do well in my opinion Â my personal favourite is still Ron (Rupert Grint), who shows superb comical timing and has an overflow of facial expressions to match any given situation. Daniel Radcliffe is more convincing as Harry this time around and gives a good performance, while Emma Watson has surprisingly little to do as bossy Hermione takes a back seat to the boys in this movie (but she still sparkles at times). All three seem to have grown more into their roles since the first movie (as well as maturing physically), and it will be interesting to see if they choose to stay on for all seven movies. Tom Felton also gets several chances to show he can be a real menace as Harry's arch-enemy Draco. <br/><br/>The adult cast is flawless as expected, with newcomer Kenneth Branagh as the wonderfully self-centred Gilderoy Lockhart stealing most of the scenes he participates in (interestingly enough, Branagh seems to be down-playing Lockhart a bit, which gives him more credibility and actually seems quite appropriate here). Jason Isaacs as the evil, venom-dripping Lucius Malfoy is another noticeable addition. A haggard Richard Harris portrays headmaster Dumbledore with quiet dignity in what was to be his last movie, and Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are solid as Professors McGonagall and Snape (even though they get far too little screen time). <br/><br/>The special effects in the movie also deserve praise. Having more than a mild case of arachnophobia, I strongly feared the spider scenes in the Forbidden Forest (more so than Harry's final encounter with a giant snake), and the computer generated eight-leggers completely gave me the shivers with their credibility. Equally impressive (if somewhat annoying) is the 100% animated house elf, Dobby. Other treats in the special effects department include the journey to Hogwarts aboard a flying Ford Anglia, the Mandrake plants, the tongue-in-cheek Quidditch match and the huge basilisk in the chamber. All of these Â as well as the scenes involving more 'everyday' magic like staircases changing directions, people in paintings moving around and pots and pans cleaning themselves Â are excellently crafted and executed, and they blend in with the 'real' actors and the 'real' scenery amazingly well, adding an extra dimension to the movie.<br/><br/>So, with a strong plot, convincing actors, a strong musical score by John Williams (very reminiscent of the first HP-movie, but it still works well), excellent special effects and a darker, more 'adult' cinematography and scenery, 'Chamber of Secrets' is a great movie which should entertain almost everyone (but avoid bringing very young children to see this movie, as it is definitely scarier than the first). Almost three hours in front of the silver screen fly by, and I left the cinema wanting more (or at least to see this movie again). I'll rate 'Chamber of Secrets' a strong 5 out of 6 on my dice, and recommend it warmly. Enjoy!"
"Anaisnine","Null","0","0","17 December 2002"," I half of a really great film. *SPOILERS CONTAINED!!!!*
","IF the powers that be for the Harry Potter film franchise had combined the best elements of HP&S's S and HP&CoS, they'd really be onto something. The first HP installment was a charmer, the characters and more importantly, the universe of HP were introduced in an easy going way, but with a great sense of wonderment. The general humor of the first film also was spot on..not too cheesy and overbearing, but not understated either. The drawback of the first film though, I felt, was the general lack of suspense. The build up to the mystery of the S's S was a bit lacking and when time came for the three heroes to search the school cellar, I was a little bit less than riveted. Also, the final showdown between HP and umm.....that guy :) , I felt was a bit anti- climactic and a tad bit nonsensical( why even get within skin to skin contact rage w/ Harry? cast a spell and be done with it!).  But still, the overall mood of the film was so enjoyable I could overlook these things and take it as it as: a serviceable and workmanlike presentation of a novel franchise, no more no less.<br/><br/>With the second installment, the director(and screenwriter) did a much better job in building up the mystery and mainting a sense dread, doom and suspense. Of course, the sadist in me would have loved to have seen or heard more references to student petrifications just to drive the point home..but they make these films mainly for kids so, its understandable. Even so, I felt the drama of the film was much more intense than the first installment which was to the films credit. The letdown was that the drama came at the expense of   the picturesque charm established in the first film. Granted, as the director spent more time on plot than mood, its understandable but I felt it would have been a great balance to the otherwise dark mood of the film. Also, the acting the second go around was a bit dodgy.  Standouts of course were Hermione, Harry, the hilarious Ken Branagaugh, and the actor who played Draco's father....very sexy, in an evil way *G*. But, inexplicably, the child acting, aside from Harry and Hermione, was worse the second go around. It wasnt even so much acting as it was pantomiming, and I grew tired of Ron's wide eyed looks of consternation, Draco's scowling and growling and the opera-chorus like reactions of the student body. Next time, tell the kids to tone it down a bit. Because the acting for many of the students was dumbed down , it made some of the attempts at humor seem more ham fisted than was probably deserved, but this was a minor complaint, because the drama and 'mystery' are what keep the film afloat. Two major gripes I had were the deus ex machina of the film, namely the car in the forest and the Phoenix at the end. Actually, there were more instances , but these were the two most glaring. I dont mind deus ex machina too much so long as a reasonable explanation is given, but none was given for either situation, so to me it deflated what were two of the best sequences of the film. And again, the final battle scene had a bit of the nonsensical present like....why would ole' voldy just stand there and let that Phoenix ruin his snake? Or why not keep that book out of harm's way if it was a danger too him? Ahh well.<br/><br/>AS always in films like this, the heavy handed sentimentalism (i.e. Hagrid's ovation at the end) cant be avoided, just borne, so again,  Its not too major a complaint. But I still say, if the director and scrweenwriter had only been able to incorporate the action, drama, and suspense of film 2, and the charm, wit and personality of film 1  into both films, they really, really would have had a landmark trilogy on their hands. As it is, both films are equally good in their own right, but well short of classics. But, taken as they are, are very much enjoyable.    3.9 stars out of 5,  8 out of 10 on the entertaining and enjoyable scale.  A.N.<br/><br/>BTW- I do think films 2 is better overall, but that for ambience alone, film 1 is more enjoyable."
"taikman","7","0","0","17 December 2002"," Entertaining and sometimes exhilarating film that is slightly superior to its predecessor but still pales when compared to the book..
","Christopher Columbus, the director of the first two Harry Potter movies, has had a heavy burden to bear. He had to recreate on the screen what millions of adults and children imagined when they read J.K Rowling's books, he had to bring the characters and world alive for those who had never read the novels, balance out being exciting enough for the adults with not being too scary for the kids and endure the inevitable, unflattering comparisons with not just the books but Peter Jackson's superb ÂFellowship of the Ring'. Overall he's done a decent job Â the first movie was a good though straight and occasionally flat reproduction of ÂThe Philosopher's Stone' and ÂThe Chamber of Secrets' is an improvement on that, if not a major one.<br/><br/> If you haven't seen or read ÂThe Philosopher's Stone' then don't bother watching this, as it will be very hard to follow what is going on. For those of you who have and want a summary of the plot, Harry again escapes from the Dursleys, his horrible non-magical relatives, and returns to Hogwarts, despite receiving a warning from a house-elf called Dobby that his life will be in danger. And indeed when he gets back there he not only has to worry about his enemies Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy, and the narcissistic new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, he also discovers that there is something monstrous stalking the corridors of Hogwarts, something that only he can hear. <br/><br/> Like the book, the movie ÂThe Chamber of Secrets' is darker than it's predecessor and will be too scary for many young children. This makes it more intense and enjoyable for most of us adults, though there are a couple of moments in the climax where Columbus shies away from fully showing some graphic violence, which reduces the power of the scene. It is a difficult balance that he has to maintain and while he does a great job in an earlier scene with giant spiders, he can't quite pull it off for Rowling's pretty gory finale. Unfortunately again the movie is not as thrilling or satisfying as the book, as Columbus still does not seem to have the pacing and atmosphere quite right for every scene in the film. Some, like those with the Dursleys and the Weasleys at the start, do not seem long enough to fully bring across the flavour of the book. At other times what is happening is not properly explained, which would be confusing for those who have not read the book - parts of the climactic battle especially seem merely convenient rather than miraculous -  while in the middle the movie gets a bit slow. Parts of this are not Columbus' or the screenwriters' fault Â the movie is a long one already and getting across the richness of detail a book has in just a few hours is always difficult. Unlike in the first movie they did feel confident enough to make some sensible changes to the sacred text, such as adding to the book's action scenes and cutting out some minor details, but I do feel things could have been done better, perhaps by dwelling on some things a little more, cutting out some minor plotlines, and adding to the atmosphere of some scenes by using bit more music and some more imaginative camerawork. <br/><br/> However I should not get too negative, as this is an enjoyable and exciting movie. The special effects and sets are marvellous and one of the ways in which it is an improvement on ÂThe Philosopher's Stone' is because of Daniel Radcliffe's performance as Harry. He still does not completely capture what I imagined the young wizard to be like, but he is livelier and more charismatic than he was in the first movie. The rest of the cast are very good, and there are two delicious performances from Kenneth Branagh as Lockhart and Jason Isaacs as the arrogant Lucius Malfoy. Seeing Richard Harris's final appearance is quite poignant too, as there is a quaver in his voice that suggests he was not a well man. Finding a replacement for him will not be easy.<br/><br/> 7/10"

"kevinpicton","6","0","0","16 December 2002"," Very Ordinary Followup
","I was very much looking forward to the new HP movie, but having seen it now, I can only express a rather deep disappointment.  ****some spoilers*****<br/><br/>The worst impression was simply - the magic is gone.  I had no sense of adventure while watching.  The scenes, though mostly well crafted cinematic pieces, were just far too long.  They dragged, and so much so that I often found myself thinking `get on with it'.   The pace of the movie definitely seemed to plod along.  Yes, there were some action sequences, but there are so many character scenes where the dialog is drawn out so much.<br/><br/>As for the plot, well, having not read the book, I was left out of so much of the character motivation, that I just found many of their actions to be confusing.  In fact, the lack of motivation for actions, or actions accompanying motivation had me almost uttering out loud many times `why would they do that?'<br/><br/>For example, the staff at the Wizard School seem ever so concerned about the Chamber of Secrets and the attacks on the students but do nothing at all for the whole movie.  They are completely inert.  They don't even intervene in the Quiddach match where a spell has caused one of the balls to attack Harry, and during the attack, it goes close to destroying the entire field and endangers half the school populous including themselves.  The staff leave it to a young child to save the day, and then take no action afterwards to find the culprit.<br/><br/>There are other examples.  The car just happens to turn up to save heroes when they been backed into an impossible corner.  Yet the car shows no other sign of friendship with our heroes throughout the movie.  Why did it decide to turn up at that moment?<br/><br/>The teachers continuously letting our heroes off when they are seemingly caught red handed, without the slightest hint (mostly) as to what they are thinking when they do so.<br/><br/>Hagrid sending our heroes into the mouth of the spider patrol when he must have known after 30+ years of his relationship with the spiders what would happen.<br/><br/>Harry and Ron leaving the safe areas of the school willy-nilly and yet not a single fellow student warns them of the `danger out there'.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  The movie makers seem to have missed something.  In a book, the author can explain a characters thoughts behind the actions.  On screen, the director has to `show' what the character is thinking and in some cases, has to amend he dialog from the original text to show this.  Otherwise the question of `why' hangs around everything that happens.<br/><br/>So apart from the plodding nature of the story, and the confusing character motivation, what else did I think?<br/><br/>I thought the acting was ordinary.  Come on Ron and Harry.  There are other facial expressions.<br/><br/>The imagery and sound, however, are brilliant.  I was often impressed by the quality of the scenes on display and did think to myself on occasions `wow, that's good'.  The story, this time around, did contain some inventiveness (e.g. the diary) and some excellent new characters (Myrtle).  It was far from all bad.  I just expected better than the original.<br/><br/>And lastly, I'm just not happy with the way our young hero stumbles into success.  He is not a character whom I would like my children to associate with role model material.  Perhaps this is a problem with the book storyline, but I expect a hero to have hero qualities, and not to just get lucky time and time again.  How about some cunning, some fearlessness, some initiative or some moral fibre for our hero.  Anything (except the obvious - that he wins) to separate him from the lesser boys around him."

I must say that this film exceeded every one of my expectations.<br/><br/>All of the performances in the film were top notch, especially Rupert Grint, who played Ron.  He was so much better in this film than in The Sorcerer's Stone.  Some great new casting was done.  Kenneth Branagh was perfectly cast as the inept Gilderoy Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs slid perfectly into the role of the slimy Lucius Malfoy.  And even Dobby the House Elf, who was being touted as the next Jar Jar, was very well done.<br/><br/>The film is much, much darker than the first in every aspect.  And the final fight between Harry and The Basilisk is a sight to behold.  Speaking of The Basilisk, the special effects in this film went well beyond the effects of the first.

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an enormous improvement on the first film, which i must admit i am not a big fan of. Everything is much better the second time around. The 3 actors have settled into their roles (Emily Watson standing out), the visual effects improved (the fantastic Basilisk, Dobby, and Quidditch match), better editing, a more involving musical score, and an overall much funnier screenplay (Kenneth Branagh had me in stitches).<br/><br/>My only real complaint is that the film gets bogged down in the same place as the first film(although not so horribly),when the evil behind the attacks is finally revealed.<br/><br/>I am now eagerly awaiting the next film."

","I think Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets was a very entertaining movie, and i would very much like to see it again...I am sure I will buy the movie when it comes to the store....But the grate thing is that it is kind of a warmup for the Lord of the Rings. It is coming to local movies 18 of December this year.... But about Harry Potter, they have made the movie totally like the book, details are even there too....

","This was one of the best movies ever made. I loved the spiders, Moaning Myrtle, and the special effects. I also loved how most of the actors seemed to slip right into their roles. The only complaint I have is that Daniel Radcliffe had slow reaction time with some of the special effects, but that just seemed to add humor to the movie."

","Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets - the much anticipated sequel to the 2001 blockbuster Harry Potter and the philosophers stone, in my view, is exceptionally better; better in every department, compared to the last one.<br/><br/>I have not read any of the books, so the entire concept of Harry Potter was very new to me.The first instalment of Harry Potter did not impress me a great deal. I had found the screenplay too weak, the characters lacking, and the acting - unprofessional. Most damaging however, was the overall childish feel of it. However the chamber of secrets improves upon each of the aforementioned aspects; quite considerably.<br/><br/>This time around, Harry finds himself at the epicentre of a sinister conspiracy to kill/rid all the non-wizard children. Legend has it, that there is chamber in the building, a chamber that houses a creature of immense evil. Someone has opened the chamber and unleashed the demonic creature behind it. The creature is loose in the school, petrifying non-wizards(that are semi-human) leaving its victims inanimate and frozen. The future of the school is in danger and our young wizard Harry and his friends have to solve the mystery of the chamber of secrets to save the school and put an end to this creature.<br/><br/>The plot unveils like a puzzle that pieces together gradually and slowly, but not without many doses of charm, absolutely outstanding special effects and light and delighting comedy. However, though negligible in the grande scheme of things, the near 3 hour length of the film and the dozens of plot devices can impede on the film sometimes.. Thankfully, the editing is very fluid, so much of the length does not register.<br/><br/>Special effects, as mentioned before, are outstanding and present in abundance throughout the length of the film. There is little footage, where CGI is not implemented. One sequence worth a special mention, is the jaw-dropping game scene, which is quite literally a white knuckle ride.<br/><br/>Technical credits are outstanding. I can predict Harry Potter will garner many technical Oscar nominations this year. Cinematography is awe inducing. The director of photography makes excessive use of aerial cinematography. Frequently The camera gracefully descends from very high into the opening of a window. The lighting, which was also striking in the latter version, is again exceptional. Lighting the interiors and exteriors with a barrage of simulated natural lighting. Set pieces are also excellent. Sound and music are thrilling.<br/><br/>Performances are good. Daniel(Harry Potter) has developed his acting skills considerably - relative to the previous. The supporting cast also show some improvement.<br/><br/>In totality: Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets, is something children all over the world, and us adults, should be proud of.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10(Excellent)<br/><br/>Review By Raj"
"turbo_issa","Null","0","0","12 December 2002"," better than the first, they are fitting into there roles
","I have so much to say. I just saw the movie three hours ago so it's still fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>Okay first up the actor who portrays Harry. In the first movie I did not like him that much, and in my opinion he has improved so much from number one. The resemblance between him and the actual Harry potter [fictional character, the one I see in my mind when I read the books] is uncanny.<br/><br/>Ron- number one I loved him. Actually he was my favourite of the kids, I thought he was adorable. Number two, he acts too scared, seems to be Harry's right hand man, listening to what he says. In the books he is funnier and much feistier. I still thought he was good, in number three i'm sure he will be better. He was soo funny though. i loved how he was the comic relief in the film<br/><br/>hermoine- we did not see much of her [compared to the others], so she did not annoy me. she seemed more serious and seemed to have a bit of an ego in the film, but that's not to say she wasn't good. she was better in this film by far, then again there was not that much of her so I haven't got that much to go on. she seemed to be more dramatic, and more emotional in this film. There are some parts that did annoy me, like in Diagon Ally she comes out of the shop, waits for half an hour runs to harry & hagrid waits another half hour then starts talking. and god forbid this, but are they trying to make hermione out to be sexier?<br/><br/>the other children. all of them seemed more solemn, there was less laughter less smiles, and it seemed to me there was more egotism in the air. it seemed that everyone tried to act more serious and more dramatic than the others that the movie did not have that much of a comedic feel to it. draco in number one was sooooo much better than he is in number two. Oliver wood, we did not see that much of him so I could not judge on him that much.<br/><br/>the young girl who plays guinny was wonderful. the snippets they had of her when tom was talking of how she opened the chamber, flushed the book down the toilet and so on, she was wonderful. her facial expressions were great.<br/><br/>the adults again are a different story. we did not see snape in potions, so again we were deprived of the hatred between Harry and him. I still like mognagal in this film. dumbledoor I thought was wonderful in number one, but this movie he has changed. even hagrid seemed less funnier.<br/><br/>the movie in general lacked consistency. what I mean by that it would jump from one scene to another. it seemed a bit distorted to me.<br/><br/>and what the hell was with the ending. hermoine running to Harry. and then shaking Ron's hands. why? and then the corny mushy scene when hagrid comes, and he tells the three kids that he is very thankful towards them, and then everyone claps.<br/><br/>i loved the part when harry spoke parseltounge, that was so well done. it was one of the highlights. the part when he stabs the snake jaw into the book and the ink spills everywhere was well done."

I'm sure this is good enough for the kids and some parents may get a laugh from the calculated and shallow (read: poor) humor, but for any self respecting filmbuff, this is just a terribly naive ""gobbuldy-goo"". Only things missing are the Disney-logo and a narrator to explain the lesson of the film. Plus, it's a terrible waste of good talent (Isaacs, Rickman, Coltrane), but worst of all, this will remain as the last film of the great Richard Harris. What a shame. Like Raul Julia in Streetfighter. Terrible film, but at least HE got to fly. The child actors deserve a special thumbs-down. Hope I didn't make them cry.<br/><br/>** / *****"
"uds3","Null","0","0","12 December 2002"," ""The Force"" was certainly with Columbus this time around!
","An incredible turnaround from the first outing. Being unshakeably of the opinion that despite so many other shortcomings, Daniel Radcliffe single handedly sank the first movie with his total lack of charisma, acting ability and screen presence, I'm here to tell you that somehow - whether through an intense acting course or by virtue of perhaps, Columbus' positive influence - Radcliffe has come up with a total make-over. He IS Harry Potter now! As well as moving up to warp factor 5 on the acting scale...he is moving and presenting well...dammit, the lad was just plain excellent here!<br/><br/>
Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley however, who was so memorable in the Sorcerer's Stone, totally burying Radcliffe's performance, is cruelly over-shadowed here and several times borders on the irritable! Emma Watson reprises her role as Hermione and mega-cute and intellectually appealing . The introduction of Dobby the house elf simply guaranteed the film's success alone - one of the most endearing and professional looking CGI characters I have yet had the pleasure to see. True, the flying Ford Anglia wasn't so hot....at best, a BOYS OWN tribute with limited realism and that is being overly kind. The other ramped-up stroke of utter genius was Kenneth Branagh's turn as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. At times highly reminiscent of a young Christopher Plummer, he simply walked off with the movie. Every scene he was in was a gem. Can't say that Branagh has ever generated much in the way of appeal for me - too intense and low on interest - charismatically undercooked you might say! This however, is his moment of greatness. Forget Shakespeare Ken this is the real you!<br/><br/>""Tragic,"" is the only word to describe Richard Harris' death so soon after the film's completion. Dumbledore will be hard to replace. Rumor has it that Christopher Lee has been offered the part - one that he could fill in his sleep. He has the age, height, vocal command and physical presence to fill the role - even without fangs! Meanwhile I would simply like to make the comment that Richard Harris contributed greatly to the success of both HARRY POTTER films thus far, by virtue of his remarkable gentility, strength and utterly projected compassion.<br/><br/>Columbus and crew really pulled their combined weight with the latest Quidditch match. That in the original movie was borderline reality and not even especially interesting or adrenaline-fuelled. The game here is thumping good stuff and superbly choreographed and realised.<br/><br/>Columbus keeps THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS moving at a deft pace. The art work and production detail really quite staggering. I would venture to suggest however that the concluding scenes in the Chamber itself, would be quite scary and potentially disturbing to some really young viewers. Parents should be aware of this!<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is everything a film should be. Decent, exciting, principled, colorful, always interesting and at all times entertaining. It blows the first LORD OF THE RINGS out of the water...the first HARRY POTTER too!"

I go to the Chamber of secrets expecting another lackluster,less than state of the art special effects,run of the mill B movie and again I'm wrong. From beginning to end the movie had my full attention. It's one of those flicks that the smell of fresh popcorn,wafting with the fragrance of melted butter won't get me out of my seat because I didn't want to miss a single scene. That's big in my ratings book. The fist Harry Potter I think I went out to blow my nose. I just didn't care what happened next. Watching Secrets I couldn't wait for the next scene. Big difference in how good a movie is. I must tell you that I have never read any of the Potter books so I don't know how true the movies relate. I felt that I didn't waste $8.75. If you have some time on your hands go see this one. It's worth it."

","2001's `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' the first in the series of films based on the J.K Rowling novels, had a strong first half and a weak second.  The follow-up feature, `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' reverses that formula, actually becoming better as the movie goes on.  In this new film, we miss that air of freshness and novelty Â as well as the wit - that came with the getting-to-know-you opening section of `Sorcerer's Stone.'  As compensation, `Chamber of Secrets' offers a better overall storyline and a greater sense of mystery.<br/><br/>Devotees of the novels will require no plot iteration here.  Suffice it to say that, in this installment, Harry becomes involved with unearthing the deep dark secret that has the whole Hogwarts Academy in an uproar - a secret involving a mysterious hidden chamber, the death of a student 50 years previous, and an assortment of creatures and monsters that Harry must battle in order to save the school and everyone in it.  This film appears to be far darker in tone than the original, so much so that one wonders if very young children might not be unduly disturbed by some of the proceedings.  For adults, the darkness may make the whole thing a little less cutesy and a little more palatable than the first time around.  <br/><br/>Once again, director Chris Columbus has gathered a veritable who's-who of wonderful British performers to flesh out his enormous gallery of characters.  Of the seasoned veterans, the late Richard Harris (in what turns out to be his final screen appearance in fact) brings a quiet dignity to the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and Maggie Smith provides just the proper balance of humanity and stiff-upper-lipped starchiness in the part of Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall.  Kenneth Branagh, cut loose from his Shakespearean shackles, seems to be having the time of his life, hamming it up as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a vain charlatan who makes the Wizard of Oz look like the soul of veracity.  Of the neophytes, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint are still wonderful as Harry and his buddy, Ronald, but, alas, Emma Watson's role as the spunky Hermione has been sadly minimized in this story for she seems to be off screen more often than not during much of this movie's action.   That's a real shame.<br/><br/>In the special effects department, `Chamber of Secrets' does a first-rate job bringing much of the story's magic to life on the screen.  The superb art direction and set design help to create an entire world where witchcraft and sorcery are commonplace occurrences.  Cinematographer Roger Platt brings a nice burnished glow to the film's look, particularly in the castle interiors, which always seem to be lit by soft candlelight.   John Williams' musical score never hits the heights of his great works (`The Empire Strikes Back,' `E.T.' etc.), but it is adequate to the task at hand.<br/><br/>`Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' won't exactly carry you away in the way that the great fantasy films invariably do, but it does make for a couple of diverting hours nonetheless.  Considering what else is out there at the moment, that may be the highest praise one can offer."

","First of all, let me say: i gave this 8 over ten. This IS a good movie, just i had my expectations set pretty high after the first, so i was not so much excited. Why? Well, for one the story of the book is a bit weaker (too many ""deus ex machina"", for one). Now that i think of it, it means that probably the movie was so much well set after the book, that it inherited some of the (minor, very minor) flaws of the book itself.

The movie does capture the feeling of Harry Potter even though some parts of the book were omitted. Having read the books and eating them up I can say that the books offer more insight into the larger part of psychology that is developed into the characters.  The movie however does a wonderful job at depicting action sequences that normally are a little harder to imagine that are closer to the authors depiction. The movie was great and entertaining and certainly didn't feel it's length. It moves fast enough to keep the interest quota filled."

Ok, many scenes are missing, which are in the book, but the ones left out this time don't form part of the crucial chain in the story.<br/><br/>CGI, and SFX in general, is much better also than in the first film, although the flying car is a bit like a 1960s kids TV programme.

","Ok, so I figured out why i didn't like the first movie.<br/><br/>In FACT this is the reason that anyone didn't like the first or second movie. Here is the answer: We all go into the film LOOKING for trouble. We all sit and reread the book before going to see the film, and then leave hating the movie because it was so different to the book, or because it left out a tinsy winsy joke or line. This is not fair. Being overly critical will always end in disaster. But this time, I didn't bother rereading CoS (Mainly due to how much i despise Lockheart and Colin Creevy) and I loved the film.<br/><br/>The effects were vastly improved, and Quidditch looked more like people and less like computer graphics. There was a lot more suspense, and the talking in the walls was genuinely creepy. Tom Felton and Jason Isaacs were perfect as Father and son bad guys, and Christian Coulson stole the show with that amazing charm and good looks (and who could forget that cowleck of hair?) and even Alan Rickman looked better as Snape (has he lost weight or is it just me?) The characters are growing up, which is really good to see. Someone told me it was bad, but it shows natural growth. At least these people aren't playing 12 year olds when they are close to 30! Better acting, better graphics, better story (in my opinion) and it flowed pretty well even with the gaps from the book. I suggest that to enjoy this film to its fullest, watch it as a film, not as a book. :) 10/10~"

Although Professor McGonagall is too old, Flitwick doesn't have the same energy as he did in the book, Ron (Rupert Grint) seems somewhat unlike himself and the moving staircases were a kinky touch, Potter fans will appreciate it nonetheless.

Granted sequels are never as good as the original in most cases, but with this film coming under as much fan scrutiny as any film in history has, I would have expected the film to be better.  It was very good, don't get me wrong, maybe some of the magic was taken away because I had read the book first unlike when I had seen the first one in which I had not read the book.<br/><br/>The acting was decent, but I had this recurring image of Richard Harris having died before the release of the film and I was thinking about that during much of the movie.  Watching him onscreen he seemed feeble and ailing even during the movie and it left me wondering if maybe a different actor should have played him considering what ultimately happened.<br/><br/>Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with the film and I can only hope that since there will be a longer time until the third film is made that there will be ample time for the producers of the new film to improve on a series that is of quality but needs some more spicing up to improve on the original film which in and of itself was very entertaining."

The writers and director have had the confidence to stray further from the text of the book, omitting more of the material which works well on the page but slowed the pace of the first movie to a crawl. They have also shown more judgement about the excisions, with none of the omissions from this movie being as vital as the lack of a sense of Harry's alienation in the first movie.<br/><br/>However the child stars still alternate between ""wooden"" and ""ham"". Radcliffe (in the role of Harry) is particularly prone to the former and Grint (Ron Weasley) to the latter.<br/><br/>With the voices of both boys breaking they are starting to seem a little older than the 12 year olds they are playing.<br/><br/>While the pace is definitely better in this movie, I personally found that some of the set pieces were over-extended a little and the final wrap-up could definitely have been accelerated."

","The film, now showing at the Regent Theatre in Te Awamutu, carries a PG certificate and rightfully so as the story features the petrification of countless characters and writing on the wall in blood! These scenes occur following an encounter with the beast let loose from the dreaded Chamber of Secrets. The whole plot revolves around the fact that the millennium-old chamber has been opened in an attempt to rid Hogwarts School of Witchcraft from mud bloods - those students whose ancestry includes non-witches. It's up to the main cast, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), to conduct the investigation into who has let the creature out, breaking all the school rules in the process. Witchcraft is practiced aplenty throughout the film and there are all sorts of nasty consequences, including a scene where a spell backfires consigning Weasley to eat slugs. The chemistry between the trio, directed by Chris Columbus, is believable but all three have visibly grown since last year's film. All three are much taller and the voices of both 13 year-old Radcliffe and 14 year-old Grint are beginning to break. There's even a hint of stubble on Radcliffe's face during one shot and a subtle hint of romance between Weasley and Granger, played by a 12 year-old. The larger cast read like a who's who of the British film industry with the likes of Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh doing a turn as the Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart, Maggie Smith as colleague Minerva McGonagall, the late Richard Harris as head teacher Albus Dumbledore, traditional heavy Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Scots favourite Robbie Coltrane as  Rubeus Hagrid, former Monty Python star John Cleese as the ghost of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as Nearly-Headless Nick, and Educating Rita star Julie Walters as Molly Weasley. No doubt Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will be a hit with fans of the JK Rowlings books."

","Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets. A Review by Joseph Gibson.<br/><br/>The waiting of thousands of frustrated children and adult Harry Potter fans alike is finally over, as the sequel to the biggest grossing box office hit, finally comes to our screens. Many have been waiting in suspense for the past year with just the predictable and familiar hype for company. Yet I have to be honest, this time around, my own expectations were even higher!<br/><br/>Though trying to keep objective about hype which with such a film is an obvious given, it was the self confession of a 'great film' by director Chris Columbus that really got me swept up in the Potter frenzy. So to the point Potter-rites, is this a good film? And the answer to this question (not solely due to my own bias having read and enjoyed the books) is Yes.<br/><br/>However, like all budding critics, one must leave behind that easily satisfied eleven-year-old soul, and show that although it is a well-rounded film, there are still points of criticism, which cannot be ignored. For some, this film has seemed exclusionary, snubbing those people who did not watch its predecessor. Yet the main plot clearly stands separate to Philosopher's stone, and although this film's exposition doesn't deal with Harry's history for newcomers, it is not a totally perplexing experience because of this. Anyhow, why should a sequel accommodate an audience which in such a famous franchise, people know is a sequel?<br/><br/>The story begins when Harry is warned not to go back to Hogwarts School through fear of something taking place that will endanger the life of our hero. In loving Hogwarts so much through hating living with the Dursley's in the summer holiday's, he doesn't heed the advice of house elf Dobby. When he arrives a series of strange and mysterious attacks start taking place, and Harry finds himself at the centre of a conspiracy. This film is far darker then its predecessor, and deals with more adult themes that will captivate an older audience as well as the already enraptured youngsters. However, it is also much funnier by a mile, with every scene containing jokes that are not just pragmatic but structural too, and one cannot help laughing out loud at certain points.  John Williams again, as in the first, accentuates this through a brilliant score, which fluctuates between comical and quirky tunes you will end up humming, to foreboding and menacing moments of music that capture the darkness at the movies heart. In the first movie, his score seemed to dominate the scene, drawing attention away from the film itself, but in the Chamber of Secrets it is not the case; an example of rectifying the mistake of dealing with all of the films elements too separately.<br/><br/>This time around, Christopher Columbus show's a visual flair and a magical creativity that accentuates the backdrop of Hogwarts that the first film sadly lacked. The opening of the film has a sweeping shot over the Muggle County of Surrey, which slowly pans downwards to Privet Drive and onto the protagonist boy wizard himself. This wonderful shot, showing Harry's loneliness and alienation in the Muggle world, is one of many, rich and vivid in symbolism and imagination. It is not just the direction that has greatly improved in this film, but also its visual effects. Due to time restriction in the last movie, Columbus cut corners. This was noticeable, particularly in the Quidditch sequence, where it almost appeared that they had adopted the archaic Superman effect of placing broomsticks in front of a moving background screen. This time however, the graphics of the fast paced Quidditch game were cleaner and more believable, aiding the belief in J.K Rowling's imaginary game. Most impressive of all though, and to the relief of fan's, the C.G.I elf named Dobby looked best of all. He clearly displayed a range of emotions, and was very much an acting character as opposed to a reacting character. This is very befitting sentiments for the human cast also, as this time around, young Daniel Radcliffe, actually acts, giving a more rounded performance, and at certain moments shining as bright as the plethora of older supporting stars, who in the first movie, were his crutch and the movies soul.<br/><br/>Joining the older cast, which is considered the cream of British acting, comes Kenneth Brannaugh as the Dandified Gilderoy Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs as the deliciously evil father to Draco, Lucius Malfoy. Both their performances were particularly great, and it can be said that fans will feel that both give an accurate portrayal of J.K Rowling's wonderful characters.<br/><br/>It cannot be denied that Columbus had a very hard task indeed translating a book larger then the first into the confined length of a film, without omitting a deluge of classic moments and favourite bits from the Harry Potter world. It would be an impossible task to include everyone's favourite bits, what with Columbus having so much to choose from in the book. Yet it can be noted that although his attempts are admirable, there where many moments that were particularly treasured by fans and were felt important to the story, that found their way not into the film, but onto the cutting room floor. Columbus did however make some very wise cutting as well. The exposition of this movie is considerably shorter, steering into the action of the main diegesis straight away. It is fast paced (sometimes a little too fast paced,) but this fluidity does make it a much better film. Action is of course at the foreground of this movie, but it remains un-Hollywood-ised through J.K Rowling's imagination and intelligence, which is what truly carries the movie along. Harry Potter and The Philosophers Stone was a disjointed, incoherent film. Each scene of the movie existed separate to the rest, and usually stood for the soul purpose of 'trying' to amaze its audience with a particular effect or producing a crude and unsatisfactory insight into the Harry Potter world. This time around there is a definite coherency in The Chamber of Secrets, and disjointed scenes have been replaced with ones that do link together, yet you still cannot help but feel you aren't watching a 'real' movie. It is more a film that has tried to follow the conventions and restrictions of narrative upon the page, and has suffered as a consequence, producing something that seems limited and lacking in many filmic qualities.<br/><br/>When we compare this film to other movies in the children's fantasy genre, it still wins first place for creativity, imagination, genius of story telling and of course popularity. Ask yourself, what else is available to children that are as good as these two films to date? Therefore, one cannot deny that as an example of a fantasy film in its genre, it rates highly on the scale of judgement. Those critics and cynics who deem the books better then the films must try to look past the impossible comparison of two separate art forms. The books are of course marvellous and highly detailed, but as an interpretation through film, I cannot help but Feel (leaving minor criticism aside,) that Christopher Columbus has succeeded in directing a much better film then the first. This in itself is a rare site- sequels aren't usually half as good as the original!<br/><br/>It is of course no masterpiece. You're not going to watch Citizen Kane, but dare I say it, the movie is. FUN!!!  It is a great family movie and should interest 'Muggles' of all ages!"

","Better film than the philosphers stone - more polished, and certainly more assured - the darker tone was better judged, though perhaps the next film does indeed need a edgier director - I wonder what an in-form Tim Burton would do to the next two. The acting was more mature from all the cast (except with the exception of Robbie Coltraine (Hagrid) who had little to do, and did even less with it)- as indeed the young stars undoubtedly and clearly evidently are ! The gap year certainly aged them, as they would in the film, and indeed adds to the authenticity. Although  the four main parts (harry, ron, hermione and draco) all put in better displays - Rupert Grints` Ron Weasly performance was very good indeed - is there anyone better, anywhere to vomit slugs with such pathos ! - Excellent, as I, with most of the cinema, was laughing so loud, we were crying. Jason Isaacs` Lucius Malfoy was equally excellent - menace and sneering, disdainful arrogance in spades - stole every scene he was in. Definetly go and see it. If you dont you will miss a treat."

","Yes, it is indeed a very good movie. Both for movies in general and as a Fantazy Saga. But it has something that is missing or feels incomplete. Why didn't I feel as thrilled as when I watched the first movie? I actually felt a little bit disappointed. I think it has some problems. And the most of it has to do with the rythm of the movie. What I really liked with the first movie was rythm in it. The way it was cut and told was in fact - excellent! The way the characters were introduced, the way of telling the story with the camera which sometime really rested on the pictures. If it was a children's movie or not has nothing to do with if it was good or bad. It was indeed a really excellent handicraft. But this movie lacks the balance of the first one. Even if it is long, I actually think the movie would have been better if they made it even longer! Why? - The story and the characters are not introduced properly. The editing is faster then that in the first one and details which could have been exciting or funny gets lost or actually even destroyed because of this. It feels like that they could have done so much more with everything. In this movie I have no feeling for the characters. Not for the new ones nor even the old ones. Only a stupid owl and a Phoenix gets my sympathy. they were indeed the best with this movie!<br/><br/>Another problem is the one of all sequels. This movie rely too much on the first one. Old jokes and ingredients have already past the ""best before date"". Why didn't they concentrate on the original stuff and characters in the second book? Now the result becomes only ""so so"". This means that if you haven't seen the old one, you can not see this one. You are not properly introduced. And if you see the second first, you also destroy the jokes in the first one. If you have seen the first one, you will feel disappointed on this one.<br/><br/>They tried to do an action-sequel. It is still a good movie but it failed in its intentions. Because of the lack of originality and the fact that the team did a better movie before this one, if I had to be the judge, I can only give this movie a 7 out of 10. Sad, yes . . . But you still have to go and see it!"

"ijrichter","Null","0","0","8 December 2002"," Funny, thrilling, exciting- an excellent mix!
","This may not have been my favorite book from the Harry Potter series, but I still enjoyed it, and they made a hell of a movie out of it. It was a lot darker and more thrilling than the first one, and unlike the first movie, some elements are actually scary, like the giant spiders (an animal I hate with all my soul) and the basilisk. All of the characters are well-portrayed, and you can see that the boy's voices have changed quite a bit. You could already notice Daniel Radcliffe's voice changing in the Philosopher's Stone, but here, it is deep all the time. Rupert Grint's voice has also changed quite a bit, a little deeper, and crackling (he's actually 14 years old by the way) and Tom Felton seems a lot taller and meaner than the first one (Tom Felton is 15 by the way). Emma Watson also seems to have grown into a more mature young woman. All of the other characters from the first one were also good (I enjoyed Richard Harris's last performance, I'm really going to miss him), but I was deeply amazed by the new coming actors. Kenneth Branagh is a real scene-stealer as Professor Lockhart, so is Dobby the house-elf, and Moaning Myrtle, but I believe the best performance came from Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. I'm glad they didn't change the score from the first one, and the settings are still amazing. The visual effects are again amazing (although I do wish they had made some scenes shorter). What else can I say, it is an excellent movie. 9.5/10."
"evilasahobby","7","0","0","7 December 2002"," A very literal translation of the book
","_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_ is a very enjoyable film to watch. Each scene moves along smoothly, making the near 3hr running time seem much shorter. Each actor falls solidly into the character they are playing, with Jason Isaacs solidly nailing the villainous Lucias Malfoy - every scene he has is fantastic.<br/><br/>There have been some complaints about the CGI, but it works within the film. Certainly, not all the special effects are photo-realistic, but they are close enough and certainly don't ruin the audience's involvement in the film. The mixture of CGI and animatronics works very well and brings the concept of a ""magic school"" to life.<br/><br/>_Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets_' major failing is that it sticks too closely to the book. This has been a common complaint about the film because it causes what appears to be deus ex machina after deus ex machina to save Harry from the situation he is in. The book may have the room to explain why (for example) the Weasly's flying car suddenly appears out of nowhere to save our heroes, whereas the film ignores the reason. Character motivations are also not examined, an example being Harry having the opportunity several times to unburden his problems to one of his teachers, yet always choosing to go it alone. In ignoring the deeper aspects of the book the movie tends to only reflect the superficial which can be frustrating to the viewer.<br/><br/>Despite this setback, this _Harry Potter_ film is very enjoyable. The ending climatic scenes may not be enjoyed by younger children due to its violence, but this is a small point. Whether it will stand up to the other great fantasy adaption of this period (_The Two Towers_), well, we'll just have to wait and see..."

","Although ""Chamber"" is better than the first Potter movie, I enjoyed the first more. Not to say that this new installment wasn't enjoyable, I just like the plot better in the first.<br/><br/>Now about ""Chamber of Secrets."" The special effects were much better done in this one, and even more important the 3 kids (Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson) turned in much better performances than the last film. However the biggest difference was in Columbus' directing which was almost flawless this time as he crammed in even more detail. I can't wait to see how ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" will turn out since that is more complex, and it has three Quidditch games that are important to the plot."

","The second in the Harry Potter series was described as better than the first. I do not really agree with this. The 'Chamber' is a good movie, but there is no really anything new and the magic of the first film is already too well known and repeated here to be efficient. The only new funny character is the computerized servant, which I really expect to develop in the next series. Otherwise, the film is well done, well acted but too much the same. I really wonder if the young ones who are supposed to be a big percentage of the public can really enjoy the movie - some parts are too scary, and the 161 minutes are a challenge for young ages.<br/><br/>
However, do not miss it. This is certainly one series to follow, and hopefully the next one will have some more original stuff. 8/10 on my personal scale."
"jeev7882","7","0","0","4 December 2002"," As Ron Weasly would say, this movie is ""bloody brilliant""
","As Ron Weasley would say, this movie is ""bloody brilliant."" Of course, this time around he would say it in a much deeper voice. Indeed the children from the first film have matured beyond what anyone could have expected. Even though filming reportedly began shortly after The Sorcerer's Stone opened a year ago, every single child character seems to have gone through the biggest parts of puberty in just a year. Ron's (Rupert Grint) voice is cracklier, Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) is deeper, Malfoy (Tom Felton) seems to have grown feet, not inches, and Granger (Emma Watson) has transformed into an even more mature version of herself.<br/><br/>The magic of our introduction to these characters and to the world of Wizardry is gone and this film is much darker than the first; barely any daylight penetrates the school. Most children will find a few of the scenes much too frightening where as Sorcerer's Stone was a film that everyone could find delightful. The spider sequence in the Forbidden Forest scared me more than anything else since Arachnophobia. Surprise surprise, I'm arachnophobic (mostly due to the aforementioned movie), but the fact remains that this sequence, and many similar ones in the movie, were treated as they would be in any great mainstream thriller. Even though I'm still emotionally shaken from that scene, I respect that Columbus does not sacrifice anything just to make it more acceptable.<br/><br/>I am able to respect this mostly because this movie is an even greater visual treat than the first (as if that were possible). Even though I used to be a huge special effects advocate, after the recent Star Wars disasters and a hoard of other films that have misused special effects, I have gone over to the other side. Then comes along the first two installments of this series, which make better use of special effects than any other movies I have ever seen. In Chamber, there is a Quiddich match between Gryffindor and Slytherin that is even more heart pounding than the one in Sorcerer's Stone (again, as if that were possible). The seeker's, Potter and Malfoy, chase thorough the bowels of the stadium after the Golden Snitch with a rogue bludger trying to take Harry out for good. If the Quiddich matches keep getting better and better, I can't wait to see what they will do for the fourth installment, Goblet of Fire, where our heroes go to the Quiddich World Cup. Even before the Quiddich match we are treated to a Whomping Willow which is grander, more violent, and more visually pleasing than I was prepared for. And then there's good ol' Dobby - the most successful fully animated character in a live action film. While Jar Jar Binks was a technical marvel, I don't know a person on this planet what wouldn't pay to see him killed. Dobby could have been another Jar Jar, but his screen time is kept in check and his humor is just right. There's also a flying car, a huge snake (which may be as frightening to children as the spiders), a duel between Malfoy and Potter, a great hall that is even more gorgeous than before, and a flurry of small but pleasing wizardry special effects.<br/><br/>My biggest reason for liking this movie is that it is the best fusion between an older style of filmmaking and a newer one. It makes use of the grand technology that we have today, but never lets it dominate the incredibly engaging characters, especially the supporting cast, nor does it hinder the progression of the plot one bit. Richard Harris will be sorely missed as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore. He brought such great charisma to the film and his role gets more and more vital as the series continues. I hope that Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, and Felton all decide to stay on for the entire series. Each of them is such a perfect fit for their role that it is hard to imagine anyone else playing Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Draco. Then there's Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and all the other professors at the school - each of which is so different from the other that it is hard to give each of them enough screen time without making the movie even longer.<br/><br/>It is inevitable that every fantasy movie will have a few things that I wish would have been done different. I wanted to spend a little more time with the Weasley family because each one of them is such a delight and their house is a small magical wonderland. But, I understand that it was important for this film to get onto center stage as quickly as possible, and center stage for this film meant Hogwarts. Even though my memory is a little hazy, there were some interesting classroom scenes that were left out (again, understandable because none of them are truly necessary). My biggest regret is that Ron and Hermione, who are constantly at each other's throats in the novel, don't have that same relationship in the movie. There is part in the end where they refrain from hugging to shake hands. My editor, who has not read the novels, was understandably confused as to why they didn't hug.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, Chamber of Secrets is the worst novel in the series. Actually, it's the only one I haven't read twice. Luckily, the plot structure, twists and turns are what Rowling has never failed at. I enjoyed the ways the mystery was revealed piece by piece even though I had previous knowledge of everything. The third act of the movie consists of a long stretch of action (intertwined with all the revelations to bring the story full circle). This is where most movies would screw everything up and settle into a final battle that is pedestrian if even that. Chamber of Secrets builds up to this the entire time so a final battle sequence with Harry, a large snake, and a phoenix is more than welcome. We've waited for it for over two hours, we need the payoff. The hardest part of a movie might be the post climax wrap up. I remember how much I enjoyed Dumbledore's final chat with Harry in the first installment, and the same thing happens here. Additionally, there is a little ""standoff"" between slave Dobby and master Lucius Malfoy that gave everyone a good laugh.<br/><br/>Here are a few quick things I could spend hours more writing about: the humor in this film keeps it alive and energetic in an otherwise dark and frightening setting. Stuart Craig (the production designer) has returned to create an incredible marvelous magical world by expanding the grandeur of Hogwarts. We get to venture into parts of the school that we had no idea existed before with little nooks, crannies, pipes, bathrooms, classrooms, and so much more. Kenneth Branagh (who plays Gilderoy Lockhart) is a wonderful addition to the established cast of teachers and clearly enjoys himself in this role. John Williams again provides a musical score which is so far the best this year. Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy) makes himself contemptible and dark from the very beginning and keeps the evil vibe in every scene he is in. The pacing is incredible, it jumps right into the plotline and into the world of wizardry because all the basic rules have already been established.<br/><br/>I don't know how this second installment will be received, but it is a rare feat in modern cinema: a second installment that is as good as, if not better than, the first. With Columbus no longer opting to direct the third installment (due out in 2004), I hope that the next two movies don't falter because this could easily be the greatest series in film history. Harry Potter has made more than a believer out of me with a world as grand and imaginative as Lucas's original Star Wars trilogy, but with sufficiently more in terms of characters and witty dialogue. And to think, a year ago I would have liked nothing more than to see the Sorcerer's Stone fail. And then I saw the movie. Oh what a difference a year makes."

Also Harry seems to lack a certain emotional death in this movie. He reminds me of a passenger in a car, just sort of doing his thing, not really concerned with what is going on...all the way up through the climactic final scene. He never seems to be truly phased or frightened and we don't either. This series needs to make things more difficult for Harry.

And, I have a little problem with dropping a rating purely based on the fact that it is the second time around, but I did. The first movie was a whole new world that I had never seen or heard of. The second movie wasn't. That isn't the movie's fault. And, if the first movie I had seen was the second one, I would likely have given it a 9 too. But, it wasn't.<br/><br/>I really have no criticisms of Chamber of Secrets. Once again, I was amazed how well it kept my attention for being as long as it was. It is a fascinating world. But, the only reason I didn't rate the first one a 10 is because it isn't a world that I would naturally be drawn into. As good as it is, it isn't necessarily my first choice for a genre. A kid in a magical world only rates so high.<br/><br/>But, if you liked the first one, it would be impossible not to like this one. They are very, very similar - with just a different story line. But, even then, the good guys are the same good guys and bad guys are the same bad guys.<br/><br/>It was poignant to see Richard Harris in his last role. I will miss him. And, did anyone else notice the rock face in the Chamber looked an awful lot like Hulk Hogan. Hum."

","The Movie Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequel of Harry Potter. The second movie is  much better than the first one.

","Wow, I LOVED this movie. I am a 20 year old guy and I have seen this twice in 3 days. Was entertained for each of the 166 minutes. However, the first film now looks very amateur and childish in comparison to this masterful tale. Strange that the worst book makes a far superior movie but *SPOILERS* everything was so vividly imagined - especially the basilisk and the spiders. I have a bit of an issue with the ""Hollywoodised"" ending implying a romance between Ron and Hermione, and as for the Hagrid cheering scene, well....the less said the better.

","I found that Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets was a really amazing film: good actors, excellent visual effects, faith to he book... 5/5 without any hesitation... One only regret anyway: perhaps the script could have mentionned Tom Riddle's past more (the fact he's n orphan, he's been abandoned by his muggle father... His behaviour as Lord Voldemort would become easier to understand)."

","He's no James Bond but I'm sure he'll get the franchise milked out of him until he is petrified like the HalfBlood Wizards in the movie. The movie itself was just like the first, the storyline was just like the first, same spells, same Quidditch, same characters and even the same bad guy. Apart from a house elf, a screaming Mandrake weed, Oh and not to mention the Eight Legged Freaks and a tree cinematically reminiscent of Poltergiest; there were no real exciting moments in the movie to rival the first. I guess that's why there was no sequels to E.T. or Willy Wonka. Of course if you are to create a character for recurring storylines take a leaf out of the Indiana Jones and James Bond movies. Location Location Location. I'm sure Indiana Jones would be just as exciting if all his movies were set in the Temple of Doom. I hope the next instalment sees Harry's adventures locate to London for some Muggledom Antics with the powers that be.<br/><br/>Oh and when I get round to it I will read the novels. In fact I will read the novels before I see the next cinematic version of the literary classic.<br/><br/>And on a personal note, the IMDB should remove the line in the first comment by dsbauer99@yahoo.com Illonois referring to the late, great actor of the 20th Century, Richard Harris as kicking the bucket. A fine human being should be remembered with dignity and his passing was not a matter of kicking the bucket but a great loss to the film industry as well as the Harry Potter Franchise."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the fast paced sequel in the Harry Potter series.  The young actors have matured in more ways than one, the older actors are still amazing, but what else is to be expected when teaming together Richard Harris (Prof. Dumbledore), Dame Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape) and Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid). This movie is slightly darker than the first, but that's to be expected when there are disembodied voices and one gigantic snake.  The film introduced aspects such as new characters with a fluidity that if made like the first movie would have looked choppy and second rate.  This movie is absolutely fantastic and has me counting the days until the release of the third movie which will be the introduction of a new director and many new characters to the world of Harry Potter."

I think the second book is definitly better than the first one but the third and fourth are even better... It could have been a more exciting and thrilling movie if they followed the storyline better. Some crucial parts are left out. You can't feel how agonising life at 4, Privet Drive is.

Although we didn't get to see Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape or Professor Flitwick that much, I'm glad we got to see a lot more of Dumbledore, Richard Harris did a wonderful job in his last role.<br/><br/>I am glad that even though there are special effects in the movie, that they are believable unlike ""Attack of the Clones"".

","Harry Potter 2 was a vast improvement from the first installment from an adult point of view.  The characters were far more entertaining and the humor actually funny. Luckily Ron Wesley wasn't the only interesting character this time although he kept up his usually charms. I particularly enjoyed the character development and humor. The premise is the premise and there's no point in commenting on it since I walked in knowing it was about wizardry. Spoilers. Sadly the movie took a bit of a dive when Harry Potter 2 turned into Arachnophobia 2. I was sure John Goodman was gonna show up any second. To my surprise a flying car came to the rescue saved Ron and Harry. John was a no show and Harry saved the day. What can I say, if I was a kid I would be in heaven.

","Dobby the house elf warns Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) not to return to Hogwarts for his second year of magical lessons soon after the audience receives a taste of Harry's miserable existence with the Dursley family in the opening sequence of director Chris Columbus' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Dobby, a computer generated character and one of the special effects that keeps this film moderately entertaining from start to finish, remains ambiguous in his warning but stresses that `terrible things are about to happen!'  Many audience members exit the theater wondering if Dobby spoke of the dangers awaiting Harry at Hogwarts or the trite and threadbare story awaiting theatergoers for nearly three hours of the film's duration.<br/><br/>Screeching mandrakes, the howler Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) receives from his mother (Bonnie Wright), a conversational diary, the phoenix, the ghostly Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson), and other special effects including a cinematically superior game of Quidditch make the second Harry Potter film better than the first installment and superficially enjoyable, but spectacle alone cannot sustain a film even in this magical world.  Kenneth Branagh wins the hearts of his female students and audience members in the role of Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Jason Isaacs is notably cold and cruel as Lucius Malfoy, and the late Richard Harris as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore creates depth for his character amidst the other one-dimensional characters of the film, but these three veterans along with Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall cannot tap their wands and make magic out of Steve Kloves' lackluster script that includes the most exciting events from J.K. Rowling's novel but fails to support these events with other necessary plot points making much of the film random and nonsensical.<br/><br/>The young actors including Radcliffe, Grint, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy generally showcase improved performances from their first attempts in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but they all lack the versatility and subtlety of accomplished actors.  None of these amateurish actors attempt to find believable persons within their characters, and consequently each character emerges as a dull caricature.  Harry is the unsuspecting hero.  Ron is the pathetically helpless and bewildered sidekick.  Hermione is the brain of the operation. Draco is the representation of evil.  The script provides only one-dimensional characters, and none of these actors has the ability to create something out of nothing as more skilled performers can do, which adds to the banality of the film.<br/><br/>Columbus' first priority for the next film in this series should be to find a screenwriter with a vivid imagination and the creative ability to bring Rowling's world to life.  The cast will miss Harris as Dumbledore and the young actors need a few more lessons in their craft before shooting begins, but with a decent blueprint this cast has the potential to rival anything the imagination could possibly create.  Improvement is a step in the right direction and the film is almost worthy of some acclaim, but as Ron discovered in Professor McGonagall's class, almost is far from perfect and never quite good enough."

","I liked the first Harry Potter. I thought it was a very good children's movie and this one is even better.  Ok, well the first thing is that people shouldn't expect these movies to be like the books, because they aren't.  I think the cast (especially Daniel Radcliffe) finally felt at ease in their roles in this version.  I think the first film, he was a bit nervous and now he's getting into the character more.  Out of the 3 kids, I think that Emma Watson is the best actor. She IS Hermione and she is perfectly cast.  This movie is a Bit long, but it is good. My favorite scene of the entire movie is the WONDERFUL scene at the end involving Fawkes the Phoneix.  The part where he cries is so inspiring and so wonderfully written and with the music, its just fantastic.  The scene is one of the best scene's in the whole entire Potter franchise so far. Overall: I look forward to the next Harry Potter movie and those that follow.  Hopefully the new director (i forgot his name, Sorry) will do as good of a job, IF NOT BETTER than Christopher Columbus.<br/><br/>

","This is what the first movie should have been - the right mix between action and story.  I love the books.  Right away I will tell you that.  I started reading them when the second book was published - and I anxiously await the fifth next year.  I was sadly disappointed . . . or disheartened, rather - by the first HP movie.  I didn't think it captured the engaging magic of Harry Potter and his friends - and his world, and his life.  This movie gets it.  Maybe it is because the foundation was laid with Sorcerer's Stone. Maybe it's because it is a better movie.  This movie gives an excellent story to those who do not read the books, as well as a few winks and smiles to those of us who have read them.<br/><br/>Either way, if you weren't sucked in after seeing the first movie - give this one a chance.  These three kids have such incredible chemistry I am shocked they have not been signed for a 4th movie at this time, because of concerns about their age.  I am much more willing to suspend my disbelief of them being a bit too tall for the role, than I am about seeing three new actors as Harry, Ron and Hermione.<br/><br/>Dobby does not need to warn you - this is a great flick.<br/><br/>And, by all means, give the books a try!"

He said terrible things will happen. Harry being who he was engorged the little creature and went to Hogwarts only to find out that strange things were happening.<br/><br/>What do you get when you add one cup of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets the novel? Half a cup of Chris Columbus, two tea spoons of adventure, one of suspense, two of comedy and a whole lot of good actors and of course a lot of $. Well the answer is very simple: an excellent movie. Chris Columbus succeeded once again in creating a hell of a good movie. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was better then the first film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was great. Daniel Radcliffe who played Harry Potter did a great job once again. The same with Hermoine played by Emma Watson and Ron played by Rupert Grint. The Actor that I loved the most in this movie was Lucius Malfoy played by Jason Isaacs. He did a phenomenal job at playing Lucius they couldn't pick anyone better. The two comic acts of this movie were the funny Gilderoy Lockhart played by Kenneth Branagh and Dobby the house elf.  I couldn't stop laughing when Dobby was hitting his head with the lamp and a number of other house appliances. I couldn't get enough of that.<br/><br/>The Story of the movie was great. J.K Rolling has an incredible imagination. They cut off a number of scenes in the film that were in the book, but if they didn't the movie would be very long and it was already very long. There were some scenes in the film that were quite violent and scary. The second film was much darker, scary, violent and straight to then the first instalment. Mind you the first was introducing to Harry so it did take a little while to get things started up. The Cgi in this movie was almost flawless. Oh and one other thing you will enjoy the movie more if you are a fan of the Harry Potter books. Still my older brother enjoyed the movie just as much as me if not a bit more.<br/><br/>So if you like to catch a good flick once in a while instead of the garbage out there catch Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.

","I quiet enjoyed the second Harry Potter Movie, personally I liked the first one better, but it had to do more with the story than the movie itself. The chamber of secrets was my least favorite Harry Potter book. There were some improvements in the movie itself the acting was better and the visual effects more realistic. My only complaint was not with the film but with the classification it belong to. When I watched the film there were a couple of kids around the age of 7-10 and they were terrified during the movie. Scenes with giant snakes and giant spiders are a little too much for young children. Parent who are not familiar with Harry Potter can bring young children to the movies causing endless weeks of nightmares. I hope that for the next two Harry Potters the movies become PG 13 specially for the Goblet of Fire where one of the students dies. Overall a very nice film 8/10"

","In the sequel that surpasses the original, Daniel Radcliffe again plays our bespecaled hero, Harry Potter. He's now a second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but his aunt and uncle (Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw), with whom he lives with, aren't exactly keen on his ""talents"". Dobby, a house-elf, comes into Harry's room and tells him not to go back to school, because bad things will befall him. Harry, of course, doesn't heed the warning.<br/><br/>His aunt and uncle won't allow him to go back, but his faithful friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) comes to rescue him by a flying car! So Harry goes to school after all. But it looks like Dobby was right, because soon after sessions begin, students are becoming Petrified (why not?). To the common eye, it looks like Harry's arch-enemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).<br/><br/>This Potter out-magics the original one. It doesn't waste time on ""trivial"" aspects such as character developement. To someone who hasn't read the books or seen the first movie, it would be confusing with all the magical lingo and the characters who they do nothing to improve upon. Neville Longbottom gets into more fiascos, Draco becomes more meanicing, but that's about it. No word about Seamus Finnegan. We don't know that Dean Thomas exists, but they can't make a 161-minute much longer, can they?<br/><br/>Radcliffe is OK as Harry, but I don't really understand people saying he's the next Haley Joel Osment. He's fine for these ""physically demanding"" roles but for a serious part? Nuh uh. Grint, as Ron, horribly overacts. We understand that he's Chuckie to Radcliffe's Tommy (a Rugrats analogy), but come on! Grint is just a little too excited to play a part in a movie. Hermione Granger, a know-it-all, is played well by Emma Watson-gotta see some of the school plays she's been in!<br/><br/>Hogwarts has a new teacher for the Defense Against the Dark Arts class-Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), Order of Merlin, Fourth Class, Five-Time Winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming Smile Award. He's egotistical, as I'm sure you couldn't guess. Branagh performs the best acting of the movie, except it would have been better if, like the book, he had had a larger role. He coulda been a contender.<br/><br/>Richard Harris, as aged Headmaster Dumbledore, is pretty good; unfortunately, he sounds more sickly than the first. Maggie Smith, Professor McGonagall, was pretty good for her small role. All of the other teachers, such as cold Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) were acceptable, however small their parts.<br/><br/>Most of my complaints are also complaints for the book, also, such as all the minor characters. However, if Chris Columbus had not tried to be so faithful to the book it would have helped. Obviously it couldn't be perfectly true to the book, but when Justin Flinch-Fletchy got Petrified, for instance, the movie watching audience had no idea who it was. In the book they at least get some more insight. Many of the speeches, such as Dumbledore's at the end, as almost word-for-word from the book (I had just re-read the book before). Not that it isn't inspiriational, but it's perfectly adapted.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is very good. However, the trouble with Harry (sorry...just had to!) is it's too faithful and some poor acting.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for scary moments, some creature violence and mild language."

","I notice that Harry Potter movies are getting ""markdowns"" because they dont totally fufill the book as everyone would like. I am one who agrees but think about it. You have 3 hours to make a movie that takes 2-5 days to read. You have to cut down a few scenes that arnt on plot. Most of the written words are how the characters look. So were getting it without realising it. This movie was funny, dramatic, heartwarming..Everything. It was a great movie. Movies arent ment to be word for word with a book..reading a book is fun..Watching it line for line isnt! Its fun to have changes, it makes the book more surprising to the readers of Harry Potter. Others say that it was ""plotless"". Book 2 is out of the Harry Potter book flow. We all know that. Book 5 is said to be the one that puts book 2 in the circle of books. It was more fast pace cause we know whos who and whats what. Get in the story and foucus most of the time on the big scenes. A childrens movie? Yes. A childrens book..NO! Im 16 and i have read the 4 books numerous times. I know older people who have to. Its more like a adults book that remind us about our childhood. Its on a childs level for them but its also on a higher lever for older people. Everyone of the actors did so well. Harry/Dan was so much more coragous. Hermione/Emma was a lot more forward and emotional. Ron/Rupert was just pure funny! Tom/Draco was much more malevolent and evil. Also with the other children/teen actors they did well. Every single one of them. The adult actors brought the tone and so wonderfully! Alan Rickman, Jason Isaccs, Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, and Kenneth Branagh, Robbie Coltrain, and Shirley Henderson all did outstanding. All of the cast, crew and members of this did so well. I enjoyed the effects. Next time hopfully Quittich will be longer. Sad to see Chris Columbus step down but Im trilled for ""new blood"" to direct and see what will happen. Prisoner of Azkaban is most likely gonna top the first two. I hope so atleast.This is more focused around Hogwarts so thats a good thing. We get more in class and Quittich.

","Having read all four of the Harry Potter Books I looked at this upcoming movie a little more critically. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets did a fantastic job in bring the second year to life.  Chris Columbus the directed has been criticized for his focus on the special effects of the movie rather than the text of the movie overall.  I beg to differ.  Columbus's focus on special effects is one of the important things that brought this movie to life.  Bringing this book to life is no easy task and Chris Columbus has done an excellent job with his intense special effects. Daniel Radcliffe returns to play his famous role yet-Harry Potter. His two sidekicks Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) embark on another adventure where they investigate the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.  Let's face it, these kids are Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  They prove time and again how magical these books and movies are.  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Potter's enemy does an excellent job making the viewer hate him and his family.  A final bravo goes to the rest of the cast: Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape), Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockheart).  The faculty and staff of Hogwarts that keep the students in line and on their toes at all times.  Richard Harris who played Albus Dumbledore.  He did an excellent job portraying the lighthearted but strong Dumbledore.  Harris will forever live on in our hearts as the one and only Dumbledore.  Anyone who takes on this role will have their hands full.  He will forever be remembered and missed.<br/><br/>For an enthusiastic Harry Potter fan like myself, I am glad to see that the magic continues on in the second year and makes me look forward to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."

","This very enjoyable movie is actually even better than the first movie of the series.  All of the actors, especially the three young stars, (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint) at the center of the film are obviously more comfortable in their roles as Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, respectively.  The story adheres as closely as possible to the wonderfully written book by J.K. Rowling.  While some of the details and events in the book were omitted and several separate scenes in the book were combined into one or two scenes, the true heart and hero of this particular story, Harry Potter, was nicely translated to the screen (and excellently played by Daniel Radcliffe, too.) The sets and special effects were well-done and greatly added to the I-so-wish-this-could-be-a-real-world feel and charm of the movie.

","Yes, this movie is all recycled. I mean, the movie starts once again with Harry Potter suffering with his excentric uncle and aunt, then goes to Hogwartz (or however it's spelled) where there are strange things happening, so our 3 heroes break as much school rules as they can to investigate. Both of the plots involve something very secret, and end (SPOILERS) with a climatic battle against Voldemort. Now, this is not to say that the film is not entertaining. It is, but if the third movie turns out to be the same, I won't be thrilled, trust me. I haven't read the books, and I probably won't, but I hope the third installment is more original.

","I was amongst the disappointed crowd after the first Harry Potter film, billed as the greatest film of all time it feel desperately short of the mark. Not a complete failure on all levels, and I did enjoy the first film, it was at best a well-made children's film. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets succeeds where the first did not, a children's movie that works as adult fantasy.<br/><br/>It is very obvious from the very start of Harry Potter that Warner Bros. and director Chris Columbus have both learnt some very valuable lessons from the first film. It is darker, scarier, it contains some real magic and it entertains both adults and children alike, it was not over hyped, it was not overdone and it did justice to the books. I must admit I was a little scared when the film opened and Dobby the house Elf made his appearance, Âmini-Jar Jar Binks' came to mind until the character redeemed himself with the first comic relief of the film. That was basically the entire mood of the film, some scenes made you cringe at first with the stilted book like dialogue but they all tended to redeem themselves very quickly.<br/><br/>Like the books Columbus still takes the time to re-introduce the characters and places ever so briefly, obviously to remind our young attention less audience who is who and what is what. Some questions still remain unanswered, like why is Harry still with his awful muggle aunt and uncle, but in the end these questions are not very important to the plot, so why let little facts like this get in the way of a good story. Still we jump straight into the story of the Chamber of Secrets and the dreadful past of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>At some points, my friends and I looked at each other in wonder, Âis this a kids movie' we asked ourselves as certain events unfolded on screen. Certainly some of the content is of an adult nature (nothing to with sex thank the lord) but some of the scares and some of the more harsh treatment of a few certain characters would make you think this was not intended for kids. Fortunately the children still enjoy it and these adult themes seem to only make the film tangible for adult viewers. So parents can relish in the fact that they won't be bored for the whole two hours of forty minutes.<br/><br/>The child actors too take a step up from the first film, all putting forth a far more mature performance than before. Daniel Radcliffe now seems quote content as Harry Potter and he loses that totally annoying cardboard cut-out style approach of the first film. Rupert Grint shows us he is in puberty with a new tone of voice in every scene os good friend Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson (II) starts to look like a young attractive star in the making as Hermione Granger. Special mention must go to Kenneth Branagh who almost steals the whole show, let alone a few scenes as Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Isaacs and the cunningly evil Lucious Malfoy. The rest all seem to remain same as they did in the first film, with no particular standout. There is a little mellow-drama and some over acting and some would call the final sequence of the film a little over the top, but it still does not distract from an overall wonderful performance. <br/><br/>The special effects also have increased in quality, supposedly they only had three months to do effects on the first film and it showed, this time around they had a lot more time and they have put in a greater effort. Rumour has it that the Fellowship of the Ring served as inspiration for Columbus to become more daring in his approach to the second film and the effects he could create. He succeeds, with scenes such as the Qudditch game and the dark forest look quite impressive and energetic. The action seems to take a more prominent role in the story and the climax resembles any Hollywood action blockbuster, except with a little more intelligence and fantasy to boot. It is not all perfect, with creations such as the Phoenix being totally dissapointing and looking really out of place, but the problems are small enough that they can be overlooked. Overall this film is far more daring then the first and Columbus has visibly matured in his film making skills. <br/><br/>Finaly note as usual goes to the score, which was far too overwhelming in the first film. This time around it takes a back seat to the action and adds to the film instead of over taking it. I caught a glimpse of music from Attack of the Clones in the Quidditch game and if I am not mistaken a number of sequences sounded suspiciously like other John Williams scores from the past. Still it was a far more moody attempt at music, and it worked very well in this film.<br/><br/>In the end you have a rare thing, as sequel that is better than the first! My friends tell me the third will be even better and I am even keen to read the book first. Still this film is a darker, scarier look at the world of Harry Potter, and it should delight all audiences of all ages. 4 out of 5!"
"jdesando","Null","0","0","1 December 2002"," Forget the Freud-this Potter is better than the first and first-rate fantasy.
","When Prof. Dumbledore tells Harry Potter it's not ability that counts but the choices we make, I knew this series had to be more than magical cliffhangers strung together by 3 cute British private school chums.  Then magically appeared other themes to me: the importance of loyalty and family, the wages of evil, disdain of class and hierarchies, and respect for worthy elders, among others.<br/><br/>But Chris Columbus's direction of `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' the sequel to `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' still bothers me, as if he figured only MTV quick transitions could please a young audience, with requisite action and constantly ratcheting up special effects and monsters.<br/><br/>
Yet credit Columbus for featuring Kenneth Branagh as the foppish celebrity academician, Gilderoy Lockhart, whose lack of in-depth knowledge about his field of expertise, defense against dark arts, is a painful experience for the school chums. Branagh, long disliked in the UK, as Orson Welles was in the US, for bold and brash productions and cocky attitude, parodies himself, making me wish he'd do more films and reconcile with Emma Thompson!<br/><br/>Comforting me in my discomfort over this episodic and slavish-to-the-original adaptation is my sense that author Rowling may have slipped the biggest phallic symbol in film history into the Secret Chamber.  Pre-teenage Harry may not be aware he has overcome the monster of puberty, but Rowling and Columbus have a very large serpent slither through tunnels that can only prefigure the maze Harry will encounter when he and Hermione finally get it on. If you don't think she will offer a challenge of monstrous proportions, then you need to return to `Monsters, Inc.' for less Freudian fare.<br/><br/>Dumbledore's phoenix rises from its ashes, as expected; the Harry Potter series will rise also, many times over, until the current youthful generation slithers into senility amused by the warning Harry Potter films gave long ago-beware one-eyed monsters. <br/><br/>Forget the Freud-this Potter is better than the first and first-rate fantasy."

","This movie lasted about half an hour too long, imo. There just wasn't enough content to stay captivated the full 2.5+ hours, especially when you've read the books.  Where the first movie could have used an extra half hours, this one is way too thinly stretched.<br/><br/>Some examples: - The scene with the potion to hear what Malfoy knew about the curse could have been left out entirely. - There was a serious lack of notion that events where taking place during a school year.  Only small reference was made to following classes and stuff, and the ones that were present mainly had to do with a cure for Petrification and the 'marvelous' Lockhart."

No need for all the scene-setting that we had in HP & the Philosopher's Stone; straight into the story, and a very good start. Quite a long film, but never slow or boring.

There are certainly some scenes which would bring on a few nightmares. I'm not ashamed to say I couldn't watch the slugs and my friend couldn't watch the spiders! <br/><br/>Interesting to see the changes in the young actors, and the shifting dynamics in their relationships. The whole Weasley family were great - and really looked like a family! Kenneth Branagh was very funny, and was obviously having a great time! I thought Alan Rickman was under-used, and a bit disappointing. Robbie Coltrane was terrific again!

","This time they got it right, including first rate acting all around. All the returning cast are first rate this time, including Harry himself who was something less than wonderful in the first movie. Kenneth Branagh is a delight as are the Weasleys's parents. Plot and focus are much tighter this time, omitting some of the subplots which are delightful in the book but discursive on film. Major flaw is the overly drawn-out ending. But any movie that finishes by noting that it is not our talent, but the choices we make that determines who we are has got it exactly right. Definitely recommended."

","This movie rocked.  It was your classic, edge-of-your seat excitement with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, and a scene-stealing flying car.  True to the book, this movie gives the vivid details of the dreaded Chamber of Secrets and the story of Moaning Myrtle, the ghost who lives in the girls' bathroom. It also has its share of hilarity as Ron's owl flies into a bowl of chips while delivering a stern message to Ron from his mother.  As a Christian, I also had to examine the morality of the film.  This movie IS NOT and I repeat, IS NOT for children under the age of 10.  The woman sitting next to us had to escort her screaming daughter out of the theater (I estimate she was about 5 or 6 years of age).  There are too many jump scenes that can makes this scary for the younger set.  The violence in this film is on the borderline of PG and PG-13.  There really isn't any ""witchcraft"" in the film.  All it is is fantasy, just like C.S. Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" but if it still bothers you, then don't see the film."

","Mesmerizing... hypnotic... spellbinding.  And I awoke after each episode wanting more... sleep! <br/><br/>Though I am not a Potter fan, I enjoy a good story. Not having read Ms. Rowling's tales, I felt the need for a synopsis or perhaps subtitles. Though the theater was filled with kids, I should have brought one of my own to make this experience meaningful. My son refuses to go for fear of spoiling his image of the books. A good strong cappuccino may have helped but a more engaging script would make that unnecessary. Sophomore syndrome? Perhaps. Or a DVD version that I could rewind after each snooze and employ subtitles.<br/><br/>Memorable scenes? There are a few, like Harry's right arm going flaccid (if you haven't yet seen it, it's not because of that!), the attack of the spiders in which they used a traditional special effect (darkness) and Dobby, a technically captivating elf whose episodes of self-flagellation are overdone. <br/><br/>I'm not wild about Harry as you can tell. They haven't picked up on my ""lack of diversity"" criticism from the 'Sorcerer's Stone' - unless I slept through those segments.

","I thought this was better than the first. I've read all the books and am impatiently waiting for the next. Each book gets darker and darker as Harry gets older. All I have to say to people complaining that this was too much like the first is what did you expect? Just to fill you in the entire series is about Harry Potter, a boy wizard and his adventures at the Hogwarts. Guess what? He's going to interact with the same set of characters and he's going to be battling the same evil threat every time, which is his nemesis Voldemort. Here are some Major Spoilers. In case you missed it....Malfoy plants the diary in the Weasley girl's bag. She starts interacting with it. Volemort's spirit is in the diary and starts to thrive on her energy. She gets scared and tries to throw it away. Potter finds it. Which enlightens him about Hagrid's past at the school. It's more of a mystery than the first one. On a special note..Gilderoy Lockhart was not ""the bad guy"" he was an arrogant, cowardly, blowhard. The continuing theme in the books is that Hogwarts keeps losing their Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. If I sound overly sarcastic and patronizing it's because I am. This movie is way too intense for little kids, but both of them are going to be classics just like Willy Wonka and Wizard of Oz, because they ARE too intense for little kids. We adults may not think of them as classics, but we're not the ones who are currently being mesmerized and captivated. Of course the child in me is completely bewitched by the entire series. This may be why the Xian sects are all up in arms. They want their children fearing hell and damnation, not a wizard who can be defeated by a little boy. I've heard all the arguments of why Harry Potter is luring kids to witchcraft....so what if it is? I say we can use more witches and warlocks in this world and less religious bigotry, repression and ignorant violent behavior ignited over say.... a beauty pageant. It's highly entertaining and original and is classic just like The Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka, The Dark Crystal, Nightmare Before X-mas. <br/><br/>P.S. The Basilisk was incredible!! ;->"

","I really enjoyed this movie. It's not as good as the book, but I think it is much better than the Philosopher Stone. It has more funny moments than the first, and it is much scarier. The special effects are absolutely brilliant. Specially the spider-scene and the scene in the chamber were absolutely stunning. I also loved the scenes with Gilderoy Lockhart. He is my most favourite character of the book and Kenneth Branagh does a wonderful job playing him. Also the acting of our three young hero's has improved. They are all three very good but I specially loved Rupert Grint during the ""Spider-scene"". He is really good in looking en sounding very scared. I didn't like the fact that Alan Rickman hasn't so much to do in this movie. I really enjoy his perfect evilness when he playes Snape. I did love the guy that played Lucius Malvoy (I can't remember his name) and I also loved Dobby. Also the rest of the cast is perfect. I felt really sorry when I heard of the death of Richard Harris. I think it's going to be quite diffecult to cast a prefect Dumbledore (like he was) for the next movies. Also the fact that director Chris Colombus is stepping out, makes me wonder how the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" is going to be. I hope it's going to be just as good, or better (for I think Prisoner of Azkaban"" is the best book of the four) than this one. At last I really like to note than some scenes (especially the spider-scene and the scene in the chamber) are just too scary for small children."

","""Chamber of Secrets"" were much better than the first attempt to portray Harry Potter on the Silver Screen. Mind you, we should expect as much, since the actors have become older, more experienced and even mindful of what they are doing. However, I do miss a wider perspective on who Gilderoy Lockhart is, just like I miss the lack of exposure of Snape in the first movie. These are vital persons that would need a wider exposure in the story. Neither movie would lose in becoming a few minutes (10?) longer. The evil Lucius Malfoy, however, was great! This guy could really give you the creeps! Totally Arian, nazi-like, bad-dude... I look forward to seeing more of him in the movies to come...

","To those who don't enjoy a story, that's full of action, adventure and glory, then don't see this film, and spend your quids, unless you have a bunch of kids. <br/><br/>This is not to say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a children's film, but merely that if it is not your style (fantasy, action, light entertainment), you will most probably not like it.<br/><br/>
I'm an eighteen year old woman (19 in 19 days surprisingly enough) and I enjoy the Harry Potter novels immensely. I'm an escapist, and the novels, and now the films provide me with an exciting and adventurous place to escape to. <br/><br/>I was not disappointed with this film at all. I thought it not only lived up to it's predecessor (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) but surpassed it. <br/><br/>There was more action in this film, but if possible, more character development. As Harry, Ron and Hermione go through the year we see them grow up. <br/><br/>The direction and cinematography were wonderful. The landscapes, no matter how computer generated, were impressive. The action sequences were exciting, the special effects amazing. The acting was superb. All the actors were convincing, including the young main stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and I hazard to say, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy was absolutely brilliantly evil. The words ""nasty piece of work"" spring to mind. <br/><br/>I did not think the film was over long, or too short. The beginning started amusingly. The ending perfectly rounded off the film.<br/><br/>I suggest this film to anyone with a vivid imagination, whether a Harry Potter fan or not.

"germanman","Null","0","0","27 November 2002"," Very good film for fans and readers - may not stand on its own
","I will approach this review in 2 stages: first to address the film and then to address some of the other reviews which I read before and after viewing the film.<br/><br/>For those who love Harry Potter, have read the books and/or like the first film, this is a good film.  It is not as good as the first filme - I suspect, more due to the editing - the scenes sometimes jump in the storyline and missing information (which is in the book and not in the film) does not guide the viewer to full comprehension of the situation. However, it is very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Harry Potter saga or has children of at least age 8.  It is NOT a film for children of ages under 6 - but then in the USA, that makes little difference as I frequently see parents taking thier 10 year olds to see R rated films with violence, rated for 17 year old audiences.<br/><br/>A for the other reviewers - some of those reviewers have no business seeing the film in the first place.  This film is targeted at the audience that the books are targeted at: children aged 7-14 or so.  Do not expect this film to be on par with a 'lord of the rings' - if you are expecting this, well, then you are an idiot, plain and simple; use your brain.  The story follows the books.  The children read the books, then they watch the films and the plot MUST follow that of the books.  The film-makers cannot deviate from the plot lines in the books - so for those who think the plot is not up to their standards - too bad, make your own movie.  If they changed the plot to make it a more 'hollywood' exciting film, then they would seriously dissapoint and offend the primary audience, the children who have read the books. Many things from the books are missing - and those things may help the flow of the plot a bit - but then the film could be 15 minutes longer still. Some complain about the length- the film is NOT too long - in fact, it may be a few minutes short.  It needs to be that long to tell the story.  If you are an adult that went to see the movie for the hell of it - stop going to these films and why did you go in the first place.   I don't go to disney animations for the same reason - I KNOW I will hate them from the outset and save myself the waste of time.  Do not go to a movie that is destined to dissapoint you and then go and complain about the film being crap in some review - your standards are NOT THE TARGET AUDIENCE.  For some reviewers, I think the material of the film offended them - get over it and get off of your high horse; we have no need for narrow minded twits in this world.<br/><br/>The film is an enjoyable adaptation of a fine piece of fantasy fiction from a childrens/young adult author.  That is what one should expect when going to see this film and it delivers.  It does well enough to apeal to this 34 year old adult with several university degrees and it will likewise appeal to an 8 year old.  It is a good story and a step in a sequence of at least 5 films, we hope (to match the 5 books).  This film is NOT a sequel to the first film, it is a film adaptation of the second book, and there is a difference.<br/><br/>All on its own, this film is not as good as the ticket sales will seem to suggest.  However, to those who watch the first film, to those young at heart, or those who have read the books, it is a very good film and worth the price of admission."

","Simply put, Sorcerors Stone was a much more moral movie, yes, but the beauty of Chamber of Secrets is that it tackles issues rather than morals.  It does this in a way that you have to be paying attention to realize.  The strain between the Pure Bloods and the Muggle born children, that's as close as you can get to discussing racism without shoving it down a child's throat.  More people should think to utilize a child's perception of good and evil in order to show how the world can (but does not have to be) a bad place. The Chamber of Secrets can be at times, violent, and I certainly would have had nightmares if I was say, five to ten years old, but truthfully, the movies I remember most fondly as a child scared me, such as The Dark Crystal, or The Goonies.<br/><br/>In general though, it was fun to watch, the acting was very good, and I think it was a very good movie, despite the frightening aspects of it.  I wish they made more movies like this."

Secondly, I thought the Harry Potter film was superb. For those of you who think somewhere along the lines of 'Too much, too soon, too long time, AAAARRGH!!' when referring to the movies, I say that's how they wanted it to be, and if you didn't like this one very much, then don't go see the next one! There, problem solved! Also, if they didn't include everything possible from the book, then many fans (who quite outnumber the 'too much, too soon' people, I'm afraid) would be miffed. I was surprisingly angry when they cut out Hermione's scene from the first movie (any fans out there will know what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>Now, about the actual movie: It rocked! I thought the flying car scene was done superbly, and the scene with Aragog and the giant spiders had me and my brother on the edge of our seats! The Quidditch scene, as promised, was much more exciting than the first one--the characters looked much more connected to their backgrounds--but Moaning Myrtle's voice was IRRITATING!! And Shirley Henderson is, what, 37???? Myrtle can't be older than 17 to have been going to Hogwarts when she was killed by the-- whoop, almost gave out a spoiler there... Anyway, I'm not saying that Ms. Henderson is a bad actor, it's just that the role could have been played a helluvalot better by my nonexistant goldfish, who, needless to say, has had no previous acting experience.<br/><br/>I thought the whole Parseltongue thing was a bit... overblown, I think, but I do wish they would publish learning guides for it... forget Spanish, I wanna learn Parseltongue!!!

"nealklein","8","0","0","25 November 2002"," Goodbye, Friends of Hagrid ...
","SOME SPOILERS BUT NOTHING TERRIBLE<br/><br/>Let us start off with a quick summary of this reviewer: I *am* a Harry Potter fan, and I did have several expectations from this film. I loved having the chance to watch it, but I seriously doubt I will go and see it again until it makes its inevitable migration to DVD.<br/><br/>That is not to say I did not admire everyone involved for their extraordinary efforts in bringing the second HP book to life. The casting, production design, acting and subtle background nuances are part of what makes this film grand. I loved seeing the Weasley home and the Ford Anglia, and I thought the movie did not try to adapt *everything* from the book into the finished film. Jason Isaacs was not my first choice for Lucius Malfoy (I thought that honor should have gone to Charles Dance), nor was Gilderoy Lockhart being portrayed by Kenneth Branaugh (Alan Cummings would have been deliciously narcissistic), but these are nitpicks. Overall, the film wins, and so do we. The Quidditch game alone is intense and exciting.<br/><br/>Incidentally, if you found Dobby and Moaning Myrtle annoying, GOOD. That was definitely intentional. If you think every character is supposed to be lovable or despicable, think again. Rowling did not create such two dimensional contrivances. That is one reason her works are so fascinating to so many of *all* ages.<br/><br/>But CoS has problems that make it less than terrific. For one thing, the pacing is a bit too slow. So faithful an adaptation of the book has given us this overlong, plodding cow instead of a tightly focused bit of storytelling. Some purists will say that the first movie was long, so why shouldn't the second one be equally long? Simply because the first movie was introducing the world of Harry Potter to us. In this film, that world is established. Some parts of the book, while wonderful to read, just lengthen the film unnecessarily. I thought some inclusions (like Mrs. Norris the cat getting petrified) were slavishly unnecessary for those who never read the book. (If you have read CoS, you learn Filch was a ""mudblood"", so the attack on his cat keeps with the entire theme of mudbloods getting attacked.)<br/><br/>Some characterizations were inconsistent for purists of the series. Snape was downright kindly to Lockhart in the Wizard's duel. The Snape of the book looked like he was going to turn Lockhart into a red stain. Fawkes was almost great, but not quite. And Minerva McGonagall was too easily terrified compared to the tough lady from the first film.<br/><br/>Then there's Hagrid. First of all, he barely has any screen time in this movie. To make up for it, he is given this rousing standing ovation at the end of the film that is downright ridiculous. Hagrid's reaction to being imprisoned in Azkaban is that it was inconsequential. In fact, Azkaban is terrifying, but from Hagrid's reaction to being taken there, you would never know it.<br/><br/>I liked CoS, but I could not love it like I did the first film. It get's a mostly positive review, but it's not as great as it could have been."

","Originally, I saw the first film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, expecting nothing but a trailer for the new Star Wars film, and a kids film. It wasn't nearly as bad, I must admit, as I had in preconception. So I was curious to see Chris Columbus pull a ""Home Alone 2"" and ruin the sequel completely... I was dead wrong. This is a very interesting, much more entertaining and much darker film than its predecessor. I would go see it again, as a matter of fact. Now that is terrifying...kids movies are...actually REALLY GOOD movies in their own right? Yikes."

","Just as exciting as the first film this episode adds more humour and darkness to the story.<br/><br/>With most of the same actors as the first film this latest edition of the `Harry Potter' franchise is just as visually exciting -- if not more so.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint reprise their roles as the talented young magicians enrolled at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and David Bradley return as the professors and staff at the school and are just as good as they were in the first -- though more of the focus of this episode is on the characters of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.  <br/><br/>Kenneth Branaugh is a delightful addition to the cast as the egotistical and very inept Gilderoy Lockhart.<br/><br/>The overall look and visual appeal is different -- though just as brilliantly executed as the first film.<br/><br/>Once again the genius of John Williams provides the superb score that underlies the action and mood of the film.<br/><br/>It was nice to see the film open with the very unsympathetic characters of Harry's Uncle, Aunt and cousin -- they added a strong link to the first film that would have been sorely missed were it not there.<br/><br/>Christopher Columbus would seem to be a marvelous director of children's films -- apparently he understands the awe and amazement that a child would have if they were in situations similar to the ones that our heroes are in.<br/><br/>This installment of the franchise is much darker and a great deal scarier than the first -- just as the book was.  I am not sure if it is suitable for all children; but if your children are mature enough to realize that this is just a film and they will not wake up screaming with visions of giant spiders and snakes -- then it will be appropriate for them."

","As a huge fan of the books, it's a delight to see how closely both of the movies have followed them. ""Chamber of Secrets"" was exhilarating and enthralling from beginning to end. In fact, I was so engrossed that I didn't realize until I got out of the film and looked at my watch that it had been close to a three hour movie.<br/><br/>As a reader, I develop a picture in my mind of the world of Hogwarts as the author describes them, and ""Chamber"" managed to live up to my own imagination, which few movies-based-on-books do. The action was fast and well done, not carrying on too long before moving to the next scene, the CGI was believable (although, as much as I loved Dobby in the book, I have to admit that he was a bit annoying in the movie) and those kids are so well casted for their roles it's almost amazing that three so young have truly mastered their characters - Daniel Radcliffe *IS* Harry Potter as I always imagined him to be like.<br/><br/>As a twenty something generation-x'er, I enjoyed it just as much as the younger demographics (incidentally, there seemed to be more people my age than children going to see this movie, but that might be attributed to the 9:55 p.m. time slot in which I saw it), and found myself standing and clapping along with the rest of the theater, as well as the characters in the film in the final sequence. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets truly transcends age to be something everyone can enjoy.<br/><br/>
And enjoy it is exactly what I did. Bring on ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""! :-)"
"stamper","8","0","0","26 November 2002"," Harry Potter and his investigative wizards
","First of all I want to start by saying that I (as a non Rowling reader), do not understand all the commotion about Daniel Radcliffe's (Harry Potter) growing up, which is accompanied with looking older and a breaking voice. What the heck wrong with that? All the other wizards in the film seem to grow older just as ordinary people, so why shouldn't Harry? I for one, don't care if he grows older, because every Harry Potter installment (as far as I know), starts one year later than it's predecessor and I think it is only natural then for Harry (and of course Daniel Radcliffe) to grow up and become more mature. I mean, if it already bothers some people now, I wonder what they'll say in 2004 when The Prisoner of Azkaban will be made! Anyway, I do not mind and that is what counts while I am watching the film.<br/><br/>
Right from the start I felt very at ease with this film, because even for me (a non reader) the film contained a number of people, things and animals that I recalled from The Sorcerer's Stone, for instance the mail owls or Harry's very annoying and rude Âfamily'. This feeling of familiarity increased, reaching it's climax when Harry returned to Hogwarts and was reunited with his friends. Because everything seemed so familiar, it was almost as if I myself was returning to Hogwarts.<br/><br/> The story of the film is quite good, as was the first story, though there were some scenes that were predictable, like the one in which the ceiling of the cave comes down. Also there were some scenes in which I was just a bit ahead of the main characters considering the necessary steps to solve the mystery. Amazingly I did not find my knowledge of things to come annoying, for I realized it was done that way for a reason. Despite those few scenes and events that were predictable, there were also a number of good scenes that truly amazed and astonished me. The unpredictability along with the complex story, which will keep you guessing until the final revelation, shows how inventive Mrs. Rowling's writing is and it once again proves Harry Potter books are not for children only, for even I (21 years old) was not able to see through the story. It was that well constructed! While I'm on the story anyway, I want to say that, although it is obvious that there is a Harry Potter formula (each story covers about a year at Hogwarts; the stories (at least the first two) involve mysteries, which Harry, Ron and Hermione have to solve in a detective sort of way), the first two films have been made in an extremely original way. One thing that I found really Âstrange' about this film, was how I actually came to like Ron Weasley more than Harry Potter. There was much more attention to Ron as a character than there was in The Sorcerer's Stone and Rupert Grint managed to be very funny and likeable as Ron this time. Despite the fact that my increased liking for Ron is strange Âstrange', because Harry Potter is the main character, I think it was a pretty good idea to give Ron more attention. I mean, in order to enjoy all Harry Potter films, one has to be able to identify with all main characters (the three good ones I mean). I therefore think it would be wise, if in an upcoming installment, there would be some extra attention payed to Hermione. Actually I do not need to tell that to Mrs.Rowling, the film-makers or anyone for that matter, because I know (and I think you do too) there will be a more Âspecial' relationship between Hermione and Harry, in which course she will get more attention.<br/><br/>
Commenting on this film, I cannot refrain from comparing it with The Sorcerer's Stone and the things that were better or worse, although there are actually but one items in each category. The thing I liked less in this film, was that it was not as emotional and Âepic' as the first film, dealing with the legend of Harry Potter and the way in which it came to life. The special effects though, were better in this film. The production company had made so much profit with The Sorcerer's Stone that they could afford to put a bit more money into this film and I must say that it really showed.<br/><br/>
In the end I would like to say that I am very sorry to have heard that Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore) has passed away. He was a good actor and he certainly did his job in well in the first two Harry Potter installments. I know that the people of the production company are now seeking a new Dumbledore and I hope for them and us (the viewers) that they find a replacement that is as adequate as Richard Harris himself. Furthermore I would like to ask the production company and all involved in the making of the Harry Potter films, to refrain from making new ones, if Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson or Rupert Grint should decide to stop after three installments. Personally I think, that after making three Potter films you either have the stigma of being Harry, Ron or Hermione or you will never get it. So I see no reason for Daniel, Rupert or Emma to stop, but they just might think otherwise. If they do, I urge the producers, not to replace them, but to stop making Harry Potter films, for replacing the key actors wouldn't be fair to the millions of  children who love Harry (not to mention the adults).<br/><br/>

","The book ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" doesn't have much of a story, but in the movie, even less can be found of it. The plot holes are big enough to run a truck through.

","I didnt feel after watching the first movie that I had to go back, but this one I am itching to see again.  I do not even know what it is exactly, it was just so entertaining and interesting and different.  The 2hours and 40 minutes flew by, when usually I can not take going to long long movies. Also, it was defnitely an adult oriented, whereas I did not even understand a lot of things that happened.  This makes a movie great in the sense that kids can enjoy it even when they dont understand all that is happening, and adults can apprecaite it for this complexity that surrounds the story and its characters. I was very impressd with the screeplay as a result, and highly recommend the movie."

","For me, having read the books, the first part of the first film felt like it was in fast-forward, but this feeling subsided when Harry arrived at Hogwarts for the first time. I got the same feeling with this film, only this time, the feeling did not subside. Lots of great material from the book is missing, and has in some places been replaced by, in my opinion, pointless action scenes. I particularily missed the deathday party, for instance. Let's hope for an extended special edition DVD of this movie because, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, this movie really needs one."
"stevebass14","Null","0","0","24 November 2002"," a repeat?
","i dont know about anyone else who saw Harry Potter, but i thought it was a lot like the other one, all of the same conflicts occurred, through the quittage, malfoy and even valdamort, basically the same conflicts arose only around a much darker story, which is the only thing i did like.  Harry Potter bored me to death, it would not get to the point, there were at least a dozen scenes that were just pointless and were put in just to please those who are sticklers about book movies. It seems to me, that Mr Potter is not a really great wizard, all of the situations that put him in perilous danger he is helped by others or by some odd coincidence. **SPOILERS** My easiest example about this would obviously be the scene with the spiders about to pounce on Harry and his friend, the car just come out of no where and saves them, even after spitting them out in disgust for whatever reason.  Also when hes fighting the snake the phionex comes out of nowhere and gives him this sword that has no explanation of its signifigance, and when he DOES kill the snake its a total luck shot, all he did was hold it up and the thing did the rest for him. But dont get me wrong i did sort of enjoy this movie, when i wasnt bored, pointing out the ridiculusly predictable plot line, or just flat out screaming for it to end."

","This Harry Potter (I won't bother to explain the plot - you all know it) is simply amazing. It surpasses the first one by several wand-lengths. Daniel 'Harry' Radcliffe is his usual brilliant self, but it's obvious that Emma 'Hermione' Watson and Rupert 'Ron' Grint are more used to being on a filmset now. They are both great, but I'll have to admit that I like Rupert the most. The expression on his face when he meets the spiders! Tom 'Draco' Felton is also great, and so are, of course, all the adult actors in CoS too. This time it's scarier (I was dangerously close to wetting my pants a couple of times), darker and SO much better! The difference between the two books aren't nearly as huge as the difference between the two movies. It totally deserves to be the box office block buster it may (and WILL) become!"

First I would like to introduce myself- My name is Dimity Mironin, I am 21 years old student from Finland, also I am studying in Russia. When Harry Potter world came into my life, many things happened. I fallen in love with these books. This world is closer for me than real, at the same time this books showed me that people around me need more attention and love. For sure there were many other books, but may be I am so stupid, but they were just interesting books and never straightly influenced my life. Films created by Warner Brothers are masterpiece just because they dared to recreate this world. This beautiful excursion to that world, and I wish to see a kind of TV series, but it is impossible, because such talented actors will never agree to participate such lon project. I am very grateful to Chris Columbus and all crew for their first and second film. By the way second one seems to me better, more realistic and energetic."

","The second film in this film series has the same general strengths and weaknesses of the original.. The production design and effects are excellent and the cast is uniformaly good. However the storyline and film itself is overly padded and slow paced... a flaw of trying to adapt too much of the book. While this one is less padded than the original, lacking so much of the expositionary stuff, it could still have used some judicial cutting, losing a good half hour of the running time from this 2 hour and 45 minute film would have helped tighten things up enormously. Still, the film does have its entertaining moments and the young cast is getting better with each entry.It's also a hoot to see Kenneth Brannah hamming it up as one of the instructors. GRADE: B"

","This film was a wonderful followup to the first year.  The characters stayed true to the book.  The effects were well integrated.  Most of the characters were well cast.  The only exception would be the choice for Gilderoy Lockhart.  Not that the Kenneth Branagh wasn't great, he just didn't fit the image I had in my head.

"BrazilianFlag","Null","0","0","24 November 2002"," Prepare yourself for a surprise - It's a good movie!
","I'm far from the target audience for HP and the Chamber of Secrets (I'm 21 years old) and I didn't enjoy the first movie of the series as much as I thought I would - having read all the books more than three times each, my hopes were really high and I was disappointed with the whole thing from the first minute.<br/><br/>So you can say I was a bit subdued to face this second installment, but still I faced it bravely. Leave your doubts at the theatre's door - HP and the Chamber of Secrets is a hell of a good movie, better than the first by miles. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are perfect as Harry, Ron and Hermione - way better than the first time around, especially Radcliffe. This time he delivers a slyer, darker Harry Potter, not a read-from-the-cards performance. He's into something good here, mark my words - a very good actor in the making.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the main cast, they delivered a brilliant work. Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart was the best casting they could do after picking Alan Rickman as Severus Snape - I could only wish that Rickman had MORE scenes (maybe on the next movie? One could only hope). Richard Harris as Dumbledore does a most emotional work - a decent farewell for a great actor.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are.well.decent to say the least, but sometimes a bit too fake. I was hoping for something better about Fawkes the Phoenix, but I can't complain about Dobby - hilarious and just like I had imagined him. Great work there.<br/><br/>Sure, some things are missing - but you can't expect them to deliver the whole book in only one movie - and the end could be better edited (and leave behind some silly scenes that didn't have much to do with the story.). Don't fret about it - two hours and forty minutes' worth of great scenes will pass like thirty minutes. I would not recommend it to small kids, or for anyone with arachnophobia. And as for me, I'm already on the line for the third movie."

","I think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is excellent!  Although the first was very good, this one is much better because all the actors are growing both physically and as actors.  I must admit that Dan Radcliff could look a bit more convincing about being in pain...but, all in all, it's a wonderful movie not only for children, but for the rest of the world as well.  If you love the books you will definitely love the movie.  If you haven't read the books, you're missing out but you'll still see a great movie.  It will make you laugh, make you cry, make you scared, and best of all, it'll make you want to tell everyone you know to go see it so they can enjoy it as well."

","This is a beautifully-filmed movie. It matches the first in its quality.  Also, Dobby was one of the most believable CGI characters I've ever seen -- compared to Jar-Jar Binks, Dobby is Olivier. Having said that, HP&COS is a movie for fans of Harry Potter, meaning primarily younger viewers.  My kids argued about the parts that were left out, but my main concern was if I was going to be able to stay awake until the end. SPOILER ALERT: Don't read past this point if you haven't seen the movie. A few things that bothered me:  1) There was no character development. Harry, Ron and Hermione had adventures, but there seemed no movement from the beginning of the story to the end. 2) The villain had no logical reason for the writing on the walls. It seemed to be an excuse for something ominous to happen. 3) It seems to be a common device for there to be a ""mystery"" in which, for misdirection, the wrong person is accused. It's happened in both HP movies. 4) My kids explained that only Harry could understand the ""snake language"" from the walls...but why couldn't anyone else hear it, even as gibberish?  Seems like someone would have called for a plumber because of the noise in the pipes. For parents and those who haven't read the books, it's tempting to start working on a ""to-do"" list about halfway through.  At two hours and forty minutes, the movie is way too long.

","The excitement dripping from my frosty autumn bum as I rushed in to find a seat at the latest Harry Potter installment, I found myself gleefully following along with the whimsical Williams trademark theme that chimed over the sound system as I sat down. I was excited at the possibilities and potentials this movie could deliver, and thirsty for the magic. The movie starts off promising enough, I was glad to be taken a little deeper into the world of magic that everyday wizards and witches use as we hang out with the Weasley's for a spell. But once at school, there is much the movie tries to accomplish, and it begins to crush under the weight of it's own ambitions (or the ambition of  Warner Bros). Kenneth Branaugh gives a delightful performance, as does the other heavy weights (Harris, Smith, Rickman, and the other elders) as usual. But I felt no connection to Harry. No sense of his struggles or his accomplishments. Rather I felt as if Harry was an empty vessel that was only the carrier of a great magic, not a great magician himself. The protagonists (even young Draco Malfoy) were all much more colorful and interesting characters than the fish eyed little good magicians running around with tears in there eyes and ""we shouldn't be doing this Harry"" look on their faces. I think the studios did a good job of casting and directing the villains, but can't we give some more life to the hero(s)? My next gripe is the music. Was John Williams not interested because the caliber of movie was significantly lower than the first? Was he too busy? Could they not afford him because they spent their budget on effects, yet couldn't even afford all the effects they wanted? (i.e- the phoenix reminded me of a stuffed robotic parrot my grandma keeps in the kitchen that repeats what you say while flapping it's wings and moving it's beak). The music that was ""adapted"" was a bit bludgeoning: all I could think of was the original scenes from the first movie they were taken from. The new cues (synth pads and ""spooky"" atmospherics) were a bit lifeless and repetitive. Could we not get anyone to write new music, people? The last half hour all I could think was ""Scooby Doo...Scooby Doo...Scooby Doo"". Now I have to sit here and watch all the loose ends tie up and come together while the evil plot is explained with painstaking detail by the recently exposed villain mastermind. Then the addendum -glee overload- when all at Hogwart's returned back to normal and cries of joyous triumph filled the air, the theater filled me with the stale stench of a sickeningly tidy little perfect package that didn't leave me with much inspiration or magic at all. I can only hope ""Chamber..."" does poorly enough at the box office that the producers learn to take a little more time and care with the next one. Don't rush it too much fellas...you'll go so fast you miss the magic."

I missed a few scenes though...for example the one where Snape turns up behind Harry and Ron from nowhere and forces them to follow him to his office. And the one where Harry, without being seen, throws a firework in Snape's class. The firework explodes in Goyle's potion and half of the students get hit by Swelling Solution.<br/><br/>However, the magic is there, the humour is there, the action is there, and the film is darker - just as the book!<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is without a doubt the best film I've seen so far this year. I wanted more Snape...but I give CoS 10 stars out of 10 anyway!!!"

Leave the really young kids at home, and go see this movie, now!  If you are at all a Harry Potter fan, then this is worth your full price to see.<br/><br/>""Chamber of Secrets"" is an engaging story of magic and heroism.  Steven Kloves' interpretation of Rowling's book translates beautifully to the screen in just under 3 hours, with nary a boring moment.<br/><br/>There is anxiety, suspense, camaraderie, loyalty and decency in this film... all the right ingredients for a made-for-everyone film.  The plot moves at just the right pace, with three 5-minute scenes that rush like rollercoasters to keep action fans happy.  <br/><br/>The characters are endearing.  Ron Weasley, in particular, will steal more than a few scenes with his vulnerability and awkward willfullness.  Doby the elf is an impish addition to the Potter gang. Lord Malfoy is absolutely loathsome, and Hermione is even more likeable in this installment. I particularly appreciated that the three protagonists are all older and more adolescent in this film, with deeper voices and more texture to their faces.<br/><br/>High point for me: the Quidditch match was particularly exciting to watch! I would rank that scene close to the Star Wars 1 speeder race through the Tattoine desert for chills and spills.<br/><br/>Word of warning to parents: Kloves has written in many darker and harsher elements to this story, including bloody animals, vicious reptilian monsters, and pickled heads.  There are some jump-in-your-seat scenes that would not be good for children under 10.  Please read your children carefully before choosing to take them to this exciting film.<br/><br/>Grown-up Potter Fans: you are bound to enjoy this.  Go see it now.<br/><br/>

","DETAIL SPOILERS TO FOLLOW - NO PLOT SPOILERS TO ANY WHO'VE READ THE NOVEL<br/><br/>From the start, it is very difficult to adapt any novel, let alone one of the more intricate and lengthy JK Rowling novels.  Chris Columbus and Stephen Kloves did an excellent job moving the story from literature to the screen.  At times, Columbus' directing left me wanting more, as he tends to focus on the intricate sets (which are amazing) before the actors.  A more talented director would have started each scene right in the action and focused on the characters. The fact that Columbus' methods are not the best does not really hurt the film on the overall.<br/><br/>The stars in this film (Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson) are back and put in even better performances than we saw a year ago in ""The Sorcerer's Stone,"" which really is excellent.  I especially enjoyed Grint's portrayal of Ron Weasley, which is dead on to the novels. Radcliffe grows into his character moreso with this film that the last, and Watson is brilliantly spot on as Hermione, though she isn't given quite enough time on screen. Tom Felton's portrayal of nemesis Draco Malfoy also is as good as before, if not better. Beyond the star child actors, there is less offered from the bigger name, adult stars. This is more attributed to the fact that the novel is focused on the children than anything, though it would've been nice to see more of Maggie Smith as Professor McGonegall or Alan Rickman as Professor Snape (both two of my favorite actors).  Kenneth Brannaugh is excellent as Gilderoy Lockhart and if you're expecting the character from the novels, you will be most pleased.  The casting directors should also take pride in the actors they've chosen for the other newcomers: Arthur Weasley (played my Mark Williams) and Lucious Malfoy (the talented Jason Isaacs). Both are excellent screen versions of the characters you've read about.<br/><br/>You should expect the writers to cut elements from the novels out for the film (it does run a two hours and forty minutes, long already), but certain things will be slightly annoying to readers of the novels expecting the film to perfectly uphold the events of the novel. Arthur Weasley and Lucious Malfoy do not fight in Flourish and Blotts bookstore, and I was waiting on the edge of my seat for that to happen. The poltergeist Peeves is again left out of the film, though clever rewriting made that possible. Another element sorely missing was the Death Day party of Nearly-Headless Nick. It would've been an opportunity to give us more of John Cleese, who is an excellent choice for the character, and it is a shame it was left out.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is that ""Chamber of Secrets"" is an excellent film that features excellent acting and was perfectly cast. It has portions that are indeed scary and features dazzling sets, makeup, costumes, and special effects. ENJOY!"

","I was not a fan of the first film (Philosopher's/ Sorcerer's/ Whoever's Stone), so it was lucky that I did get to see this next instalment. The various magical goings on have been integrated into the story rather than presented as the special effects guy's CV and the performances are good rather than tolerable. The three juvenile leads have really found their roles this time round (Daniel Radcliffe seems to have a particular talent for interacting with CGI) and should be easier for children to identify with while CoS is also a lot funnier than SS, especially the Kenneth Branagh performance as Gilderoy Lockhart. Although in comparison to Lord of the Rings the mysterious, magical world is still a little ""normal"" (and too concerned with presenting sorcerous versions of real world objects and institutions), there's sufficient innovation and genuine darkness to feel you are watching a fantasy film. Well worth seeing; enough spectacle for children and enough interest for adults."
"MercurioKnight","Null","0","0","22 November 2002"," Something missing?
","First, I'd like to say that I am not a major fan of the series, as I have never, nor do I plan to, read the books. But, on that note, I enjoyed the first one... not a great film, but fun and entertaining. I liked the characters, except for the guy with the wrapping on his head... I liked how the ending played out and I liked the focus on the school.<br/><br/>Now, with that said, I was a bit disapointed with Chamber of Secrets. 'Older' people seem to be so obsessed with the fact that it's 'darker', like that really makes a better film. Something similar was said in regards to EP2: AOTC, and I think Chamber suffers some of the same problems that MIB2 and AOTC suffered from. Now, I just want to say that, unlike MIB2, it had something more on its mind and wasn't a merely tremor of a movie (Chamber is 2 hours and 40 minutes, unlike MIB2 which isn't even an hour and a half), but, like it, Chamber felt 'cartoon episodic', like watching a 1-2 parter of an animated series, not like watching an actual film or number in a series of films and lost a lot of the magic, fun, and creativity of the first. It's kind of hard to explain specifics, but I'll try.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how much the problems can be faulted to the writer, JK ROWLING, or the screenwriter, who chose a slightly different focus this time around. I can't critique the book since I haven't read it, so I have to judge the film on its own merits. It isn't a bad film, it's ok, but not one I'd really care to see again.<br/><br/>Beware, spoilers bound to occur ahead... (I'll be careful, though, and try to reveal as little as possible)<br/><br/>The film started off ok, back at the house... in comes Dobby, the house elf, beginning the 'mystery' (I didn't mind Dobby, though I'd recommend a little less time spent on his 'self abuse'). The quest permeates, Why shouldn't Harry go back to school this year? Like the last film, this isn't where the magic of the story really begins (and I don't mean 'magic' as in wizardry, but the charm of what brought me in the first time and sold me the movie as a fun and entertaining film I'd gladly watch whenever I got the craving), things start picking up with a jail break, and then we get to see the Weasley home, meet the family for some small little bits (which, looking back, was kinda nice).<br/><br/>Next, we're carted back off to the shopping place of the first movie, but it kind of lacks the wonder of the first time and we're introduced to 2 new characters. Now, Lucius I liked, I just wish they could have done more with him, but I can sort of understand why they used him like they did, hopefully he'll get more stuff to do in the next movie. The second new character, played by Kennth Branagh, I couldn't care either way about him. They had the chance to introduce Hermoine's parents as well, but instead, we just 'see' them... a subplot is introduced, sort of a reversed 'X-Men' syndrome, but ultimately really isn't all that important in the scope of things (more of a sideissue that 'seems' important but it really isn't, rather an excuse for other things).<br/><br/>Now, the train... Ron and Harry get left behind, and they take the flying car... which makes for a decent action piece, so, ok... no complaints here.<br/><br/>Then, quickly herded off, they could be in trouble, expelled, blah blah blah, but they're not, and so school begins... It sort of blurs at that point, then we're introduced to another new teacher, didn't really care for, and that scene is nerve wracking with the root screamers. I had to close one ear, it was that bad. The pixie sequence was alright, but now they're just going through the motions of setting a couple plot elements up.<br/><br/>The plot, which I will not utter here *Gandaulf voice*, I didn't really care for. It was very cartoonish (which isn't necessarily a complaint), didn't really like how it unfolded (it starts off ok, but as the story progresses, it loses my interest)... I'll get into a little more of that soon.<br/><br/>The Duel scene, probably my favorite scene in the film, I just wish they did something more with it. The Journal, an interesting idea, I wish the introduction of it was better somehow. The next Quidditch match is kind of cool...<br/><br/>Whining Murtle, eck, just eck. What an annoying character. I don't mind the whining aspect so much, it's just the sounds she makes, makes me cringe. Anytime you want to put something to 'annoy', especially a character with such importance to the story, it forces me to give it big strikes against the movie. And the guy with the cat, ack, just cut his part to minimal, no more than he had in the first (afterall, there are far more interesting characters to focus on). Having him go around blaming Harry was pointless and never went anywhere.<br/><br/>The three characters... this is probably my biggest complaint. Unlike the first one, it has become strictly Harry's show. Hermione gets to make a potion, then she's taken out of the game for good. All Ron is good for in this film, is being scared. It wasn't about three friends anymore, just 1 kid dragging along 2 others who aren't really that integral anymore. I thought Ron and Hermione were kind of wasted this time out, like many of the best characters in the film, just too much wasting going on. I would have liked to see a couple more moments between the characters not directly pertaining to the plot (which just about everything seemed to, a little bit too blatant at that)...<br/><br/>There is only 1 real advancement for Harry's character this time around, and it's something we already know, only, this time it's explained. WOW! See how impressed I am? It seems very been there, done that, even with Dumbledore in the end having to sit us down and 'explain' everything. You don't have to take the same approach every movie. Let's see a different way of explaining something, or at least, try to make it interesting.<br/><br/>My second biggest complaint, everything seems to be out to save Harry Potter. While, this was ok in the first, here it becomes kind of redundant. Like, ooh look, the car. Ooh, look, the Pheonix, oh, the phoenix again. I didn't like how it came together at the end, I much rather prefer the ending to the first movie (I thought the challenges were kind of clever and the mirror thing interesting).<br/><br/>I guess, it just lost some of its potency that it had the first time around. Looking back, I guess I didn't mind the plot so much as the elements that went into it. Some interesting ideas that just didn't feel like they were put to good use. Underused characters, and less of the 'school' atmosphere and wonder that made the first one what it was. I'd rather have had more classes, more mischevious behavier dragging Hermione along than bothering with the plot. I find those aspects far more entertaining, I want it to be about the three stars, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and their rivalries against kids like Draco. I want Lucius to have more to do, more sneering, and Snapes to be used more.<br/><br/>I'm wondering to myself, how the hell did this movie last 2 hours and 40 minutes? What the hell was it doing for that long? Cause the scenes that got me back to what I wanted to see certainly didn't take up much of that time. The plot could have been done easily in a 1-2 parter of a 30 (15-20 with commercials) minute animated series, the focus was too much on a plot that just needed to be better constructed, and not enough on the characters I wanted to see more of. Too much time on characters I either didn't care for (Kenneth Branaugh), or were annoyed by (Murtle)... ack... so yeah, I was disapointed. In the end, just too much of stuff I didn't want or care for, and too little of the stuff I did want. Ah, well. :(  ..."

","Its Harry's Second year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, and things are going to get scary. It begins with the mysterious arrival of Dobby, a house elf, in harrys room. He begs harry not to go back to Hogwarts. But, Harry insists he must, and Dobby, gets harry into trouble. Harry is locked in his room by his vicious Aunt petunia, Uncle Vernon and Dudley. Ron, Fred and George weasly take their dads car and break Harry Free..... then, Harry and Ron are unable to get to the Hogwarts express, so they have to fly...crash into a whomping willow........the students are being petrified, and something about the Chamber of secrets being opened........<br/><br/>The second installment in the Harry Potter series is one of the best. The book was fascinating, and the transgression to celluloid has been phenomenal. I watched the film and was totally amazed. The Special effects were so much better. The Basilisk and the Spiders were so believable. I was cringing in my seat. This is much darker than the first film/novel. Some younger children may find some of the film quite scary. This is what makes this film stand out. Its more grown up, so adults will find much to enjoy out of this. Daniel Radcliffe has progressed so well, and has settled into his role, and is totally believeable as Harry, you begin to imagine him as a real character. Emma watson has blossomed wonderfully into a promosing young actress. Her performance as muggle born Hermione Granger was ten times better than is the Philosophers Stone. Rupert Grint is much funnier in The Chamber than the Stone as Ronald 'Ron' Weasly.<br/><br/>The third movie, Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban, is promising. With filming beginning soon, and a release planned for 2004, Time is of the essence to keep harry and his friends looking young!<br/><br/>All in all, Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a roller coaster ride, and is worth Seeing. Me being a huge fan, is, obviously going to give this movie: A* Rating = 10/10"
"Jabbadoor","Null","0","0","21 November 2002"," Kinda like Pizza.
","I guess we all know the feeling. After a successful movie, the sequel always meets very high expectations, and almost never live up to them.<br/><br/>Im afraid ""HP & the COS"" is another sad example of that ""old Truth""<br/><br/>""COS"" as a book is a deeper book than the first one, but much of its depth has been sacrificed, in order to tell the story in the ordained ""Feature Lenght"". Mostly all of the new Characters are treated so shallow, that only the Readers of the books can make ANY sense of them.  I think that when youÂ´re in charge of making a movie based on a book, and insists on cramming as many of the books minor CharÂ´s into the film (Collin, Justin Finch-Fletcley and most serverly Lockhart, who is grieviously underrepresented) you need to add the books depth to their personalities, or they dont make any sense to those who hasnÂ´t read the book. Most of them were better left out in total!!!! An exeption to this is Lucius Malfoy (BRILLIANTLY portrayed by Jason Isaacs *Applause*). Harry, Hermione and Ron are of course still brilliant (and i might add to these 3, Crabbe, Goyle and in particular Draco) and gracefully Maturing! Ron is so funny in the Forbidden forest, that i am still hurting from laughing. Go Ron!! The overall theme of the film was good, Really ""hogwart-like""!! The effects were great, and the Adults also made good of what they had to work with!! (you need to give Erroll the Owl a Raise!!! Brilliant!) All in all, i had the same feeling as when im eating Pizza. Even if it is bad, itÂ´s still kinda good.<br/><br/>Finally a word must go to the Late Richard Harris. You made many a child love you, and will live long in our hearts. Godspeed, and farewell, in the words of Albus Dumbledore."

"Theoriginaltruebrit","Null","0","0","24 November 2002"," It got me to the theatre
","There are not many movies that can get me to the movie theatre, which have become miserable places for me since they banned smoking*S*  (the last movie I went to see in the theatre was The X Files) so it was with delight that after seeing ""Sorcerer's Stone"" on HBO I was chomping at the bit to go and see ""Chamber"" at the theatre this weekend.  I was not disappointed, and despite the length of the film I never once felt the need to sneak out for a quick inhale.  The initial delight was seeing the changes in the young cast, how they had grown and matured between the two films.  How Ron (Rupert) was now slightly taller than Harry, and how his voice is apparently in the throes of breaking (and would ""crack"" occasionally).  Harry (Daniel), slightly taller and a little fuller in the face and also with a voice a few octaves lower.  And Hermione (Emma), I shall quote Roger Ebert on that one ""on the road to babedom"". I will not be at all surprised if in ten years these three (Daniel, Rupert and Emma) are not the new Leonardo, Brad and Jennifer (albeit more than likely much better actors).  The film itself is a joy to behold and I was actually disappointed when it ended.  I genuinely laughed during the funny parts and the scary parts were genuinely scary.  It amazed me when the lights went up that I was in a theatre (it was the 7:15pm showing) that was packed with ""grown ups"" not a child in there, it says something about a ""kids"" movie that can pack a theatre with adults.  My husband and I had a long coversation over dinner afterwards about who they will cast to replace Richard Harris, as it would appear that we have already lost most of the ""elder statesmen"" of English actors, John Hurt could pull it off but he was in #1 as a different character and I think the kids are too savvy these days to let that one by them, Ian McKellen would be ace, but he is too busy being Gandalph and that would be too damn confusing, Anthony Hopkins (IMHO) is too short and stocky, Dumbeldore needs to be tall and willowy.  Perhaps the suggestion of another earlier that Sean Connery is the best choice should be considered.  Personally I would rather roll around in nettles than be the casting director with that thankless task right now.  I have a few minor problems with the movie (and they are minor) I really wish we had seen more of Mrs. Weasley, (I am a huge Julie Walters fan) when I heard that Harry goes to the Weasley's house I was looking forward to seeing much more of her, but just as soon as he was there he was heading up the chimney.  Jason Isaacs performance was, as always, beautiful, but I often wondered why on earth he was there, he appeared to ""appear"" simply for the point of appearing menacing.  Kenneth Branaugh, while (as always) BRILLIANT was to be honest a little too understated, perhaps he was trying hard not to go over the top, whereas I think with the character he played, over the top would have been the way to go.  Finally, the spider, being one of Hagrid's pets, I cannot imagine that he would allow his ""sons and daughters"" to eat a human, so that to me was a little unbelievable (I know its weird calling something in a Harry Potter movie unbelievable!) All in all it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and I cannot wait for it to come out on video so that I can watch it again and again."

","These movies might well be turning me into a Harry Potter fan. I still haven't so much as touched any of the books, but I watched this movie as intensely as I did the previous one.<br/><br/>In the previous movie, all Harry Potter ever DID was be famous because he was the only one to survive an encounter with Voldemort. In this movie, he slowly begins to earn his role as main hero of the story. Still, he has hardly done anything extraordinary yet.<br/><br/>If this movie was something, it certainly was fast-paced. The flying car scenes and the Quidditch match almost made me dizzy. (Having to sit in the front row might have had something to do with it.) I was able to follow most of the plot, but after I got home after the movie, I forgot quite much of what it was all about. All I felt was a feeling of having gone over something fast-paced.<br/><br/>As ever, the special effects were well done, but at this age, they were hardly spectacular. There was ONE exception: the scene in the Forbidden Forest with all the spiders. I, 26 years old as I am, was genuinely scared thinking of what it must be down there.<br/><br/>The plot seemed to be even simpler than that of the previous movie. I was genuinely disappointed to find out who the real villain was this time. Let's hope ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" has a more complicated and twistier plot.<br/><br/>I am at a loss of what to make of this movie. For Potter fans it is a must, but for others it is only worth watching if you really liked the previous movie. For myself, I am still looking forward to the 20th James Bond movie, which I hope will be more exciting than this."

And the spiders... Whhrhrhr-yuck! <br/><br/>The addition of Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart was neat. Not only was he a slimey fraud he actually seemed to enjoy the parody of himself. Also Lucius Malfoy was as well cast as his son was not.<br/><br/>All in all a brilliant movie and true to the book. Perhaps the Quidditch game was a bit too long but hey, you can't have it all.<br/><br/>The art department could, I might add, take a bit more care making the books look old. Two pages shown in the movie had right adjusted margins which is somewhat modern considering they were supposed to look hand written."

The art direction, combined with the neat special effects, and good costume design, makes the movie great-looking. Second, it has a more interesting story that starts right from the very beggining and it doesn't have a BIG introduction, like the first movie. We already know the characters, but we get to know more of them this time. There IS character development, helped by very good acting by all of the cast, including the three kids, who deliver their lines with style and personality. These kids look like they're having fun with their roles. <br/><br/>The story surprisingly kept me interested, and the dialogue was just so full of wit. The movie is also darker and scarier than the first film. It has two quite scary action sequences involving spiders and a pretty ugly monster at the end of the film (a final action sequence that looked and felt as a scary horror film).<br/><br/>This is the kind of film kids will LOVE, and adults can enjoy without being bored.

He said it was a little scary DURING the show, but in a good way. And not at all scary for him afterwards, he said.<br/><br/>Everyone else has probably said all there is to say already. I will add only that the best new casting choice for Dumbledore is probably Sean Connery.

The transition to such a new figure behind the character's mask would be a smooth one in Connery's extremely capable hands.

This film is more action packed, exciting, and funnier then the first film, with the wonderful child stars giving more confident performances. Daniel Radclife, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have really settled into their roles nicely, and the adult cast are too, terrific. Kenneth Brannah almost steals the show as the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. The showdown at the end is tense and exciting, and even though I'd read the book I still gasped in several places. The flying car and Dobby are just some of the brilliant CGI effects, and the Qudditch match is fast and furious. Just beware if you don't like spiders as theres one in there that would make any one with agrophobia faint!<br/><br/>As too all these comparions to LOTR, I liked LOTR's very much, and will be going to see The Two Towers, but the HP films are so much more fun, and magical. They really touch the child in you. OK so LOTR scooped an Oscar or two, but when it comes to public affection, it's Harry whos literally on the money. Harry Potter has smashed it's own record in Britain, and has become the third most sucessful opening in the US behind Spiderman and the original Harry Potter film. It deserves all the success it's getting. Roll on The Prisoner of Azkaban!"

Felton is probably one of the better actors out of the students at Hogwarts, in my opinion, and Jason Isaacs, who is Luscious Malfoy, his Father, gives an Oscar-worthy performance.  You can definitely tell that they're Father and Son in the film.<br/><br/>Harry is accused of killing Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, when he is found at the scene of the crime, along with other victims.<br/><br/>This means the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, unveiling a great new evil.<br/><br/>Cristian Coulson plays the new evil in this film.  <br/><br/>As the plot unravels, the audience will become more and more intrigued and engrossed by what is happening.<br/><br/>If I had a choice out of five stars (the Canadian rating of films; may not be in other countries), I would definitely give it that.  I highly recommend this to those who may, and even who may not have, seen Harry Potter and the Philosopher's (Sorceror's) Stone."

In my opinion, this one was far better than the first. Don't get me wrong, i loved the first, but this one really was a lot better. What made this one better, i thought, were the special effects. In the first, they were good, but now they're amazing. In other movies where computer animation was used, you can tell that it isn't real.  However, in this movie, everything looks realistic. Anyway I truly recommend this movie to everyone. It really doesn't matter what age you are or if you are a Harry Potter fan. Trust me, it's worth the money!!<br/><br/>P.S. Thanks for taking the time to read. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

","Marvelously inventive, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" follows Harry, Hermione, and Ron through their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft<br/><br/>and Wizardry.  The trio has grown up over the summer holiday.  Ron has gotten taller, Hermione has started to lose her baby fat, and Draco Malfoy seems more menacing than ever, with a larger countenance and slightly deeper voice. <br/><br/>
Readers of the books will remember ""TCOS"" is a more serious that ""The<br/><br/>Sorcerer's Stone"", which introduced us to the Hogwarts family.  The story isn't as lighthearted as the first film, which set the tone for the series, It's darker and scarier, with a villain who is unseen for most of the movie, but revealed in a frightening sequence in the Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs, who played the evil Col. Tavington in ""The Patriot"", is creepy as Lucius Malfoy, proving the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Kenneth Branagh is perfectly pompous as Gilderoy Lockhart, and if you stay through the entire credits, you will be treated to a final scene of him.<br/><br/>TCOS is a terrific second film in the series that makes you wish there wasn't going to be 2 years until the next one rather than one."

","I loved this move, it captured all the elements of the book that I was hoping for. I saw it three times already, and it gets better each time I see it. These kids know what they are doing when it comes to acting. I hope that the next one will be as fun and exciting as this one was.<br/><br/>However there was one scene that they didn't put into the film that I was hoping to see, the Garden Gnomes. But it wasn't a total loss. Ron was my favorite in this film, he got older and funnier. I hope to see him as well as Emma and Daniel more in the future. Don't listen to all those Critics who were putting it down, just keep in mind the kind of movies that they like (Scrub ones)."

","I loved Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone. I read the book first of course and when I went to see the movie, I did not expect to see so much of the magical things from the book. I was surprised and pleasantly gratified. Well, moving on, I recently went to observe the new Harry Potter movie The Chamber of Secrets. The movie was wonderful! The loyalty Harry Potter had for Professor Dumbledore, it was heart warming. The Spiders seemed very real and the flying car was something I did not expect would be in the movie.

","To understand the success of the Harry Potter series of books it is important to take a look at the style and layout of the story as it is written JK Rowling.  To quote Ron from the books `Bloody brilliant' is about all I can say.  Each book has one major story arc which is told in series of short stories.  It just so happens that each short story or story arc is a chapter long.  In `Chamber of Secrets' the over all story arc about the Heir of Slytherin is divided into eighteen short arcs with each chapter bringing the reader closer to the climax of the story and the final chapter to tie up all the loose ends. In the first movie Chris Columbus and Steven Kloves follow this successful story telling technique pretty well with the movie divided up into several short stories all tied together by Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts and his first encounter with he-who-shall-not-be-named.  The problem with this kind of story telling is that it does not translate as well from the printed page to the big screen.  (I had hoped the first DVD would have more of the deleted scenes inserted back into the movie)  Well the first movie had several good attributes its over-all story line just wasn't one of them. Only dropping one of the short stories and shortening each short story made the story seem a little jumpy and didn't really allow for the character development that the necessary for anyone who hasn't read the book.   I liked the first movie by the way. In the second movie CC and SK move to a more traditional idea of story telling for movies rather than use the eighteen short stories from the book the movie is divided into about 10 short story arcs in which several elements of two or more chapters are joined together.  The story also elements several little pieces of the story, which while not important seem a little unnerving for them not to be there.  For example when Harry takes a wrong turn with the Floo powder we learn about the Malfoy family, yet the movie skips this part.  Traditional story telling also creates another minor glitch in terms of story telling, the individual story arcs do not seem to flow as well together in CoS as they did in SS.  The transitions are terrible; I hope that the material cut out of the film release is centered around these transitions when the DVD is released.  While the missing scenes would be nice, better transitions would make the movie more enjoyable. In the first movie I was very pleased with the acting and casting of every character except Daniel Radcliffe as Harry.  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint seemed much more comfortable in the first film than Daniel did.  Emma and Rupert plus Tom Felton just were more believable.  In his portrayal of Harry in the Second move Daniel seems more comfortable to say the least.  He generally is not outclassed by the actors around him.  While some might complain about his growth spurt between the movies, it is only natural he is a young man you know and it does occur in the Book series to some extent, just not as noticeable as it is on film.  The casting of the adults (Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltran, Alan Rickman, Richard Branagh, and Jason Isaacs) is too good to believe.  Each one of them fits perfectly into their rolls, as if JK Rowling had them in mind when she wrote the book. The death of Richard Harris will make it hard to fill his role as Dumbledore. However with so many characters in the movie, many characters were not given the screen time they needed to display their talents and develop their characters.  Scenes showing Ginny Weasley and the general dislike of the Malfoy family could have really tied the movie together.  Noticeable missing from the film was Zoe Wanamaker as Madam Hooch who was written out for some reason. CC has done a better job with use of Special Effects and CGI in CoS than in SS.  First each effect is less noticeable on screen (with a few exceptions) and they blend into the background this brings the story and the characters to the forefront.  There are a couple of places I wondered why the effects were not more believable, the scene with the car and the whomping willow for instance.  The tree was just too stiff and the car took too little damage. In the first movie there are only a couple of external scenes that show even parts of the school and yet in the second movie the use of panning shots of Hogwarts also fills out the school and makes it more believable for the audience. Overall the CoS is an above average film.  I still do not understand the fascination with making shorter films.  The change to a more traditional way of telling a story on the big screen helped this movie for adults and may have hurt it from holding the interest of younger children.  The young actors all seemed to have improved their performance from the first move, but I would have like to see more of Rupert Grint not being scared during the movie. For a movie that is already 160 minutes long the CoS needed to be about 18 to 30 minutes longer to fill in the story and improve the transition between the scenes.  Several interesting scenes either were cut out or left out of the script which upset the ten year old next sitting next to me in the theater.  The use of CGI and SFX were much better in CoS than in SS and it really helped bring the actors and the story to the attention of the movie. Out of Ten Stars I would give the movie 8 stars, same rating as SS but for vastly different reasons."

","I had been ignoring the Harry Potter phenomenon that seems to be sweeping the country - both in the child and adult world.  Previous to seeing this second installment I had not seen the first film, nor had I read any of the books.  I must say that after seeing Lord of the Rings on the Big Screen, I go to the cinema not expecting to even come close to having the same cinema experience.  But I have to say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the closest film to it so far.<br/><br/>I was surprised at having the patience to watch a so-called children's film but I was even more surprised to find I was actually engrossed in it.  A good film indication for me is when I don't notice how uncomfortable my seat is at the cinema.  My seat was reasonably comfortable through the whole 3 hours, altho there was a portion of the film in the middle where I was bought back to reality and had to shift positions a few times - the film lost pace slightly.  But it certainly picked up and the ending, even though predictable, topped it off nicely.<br/><br/>I would have reservations about taking young children to see the film as it certainly has a dark, sinister under-tone.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was definitely worth watching.  The visuals were stunning and never got boring - there always seemed to be things happening in the background.  Special effects did not let the film down one bit (unlike Attack of the Clones).  The acting was good, although nobody really stood out.<br/><br/>8.5/10 from me...worth paying the extra money to go to the cinema for!!<br/><br/>Regards<br/><br/>mat"

","I haven't read any of the books, and was surprised to find the first Harry Potter movie quite charming, a real boost of beguiling holiday cheer... and expected the same from this one. Boy was I wrong. This movie was such a chore to get through, and empty parade of dull scenes and charmless special effects.<br/><br/>Another commentator has explained the parts of the book dropped--the character's motivations, for instance--in order to rush from one event to another and cram them all in. It sounds like it might have been an involving story, but my guess is the filmmakers were so desperate to include most memorable parts of the book (and stay under 3 hours) that the glue that connects the scenes together was dropped. I can only imagine how execrable the movies will be as we start getting into the 700+ page books.<br/><br/>What we end up with is a tedious exercise in which 30 seconds doesn't pass by without something appearing, disappearing, flying, melting, bursting into flame... etc. All that is different when you have to imagine it, but when it's just presented on a screen, it quickly becomes, you guessed it, tedious. It got to the point where I was surprised when Harry would turn a corner and something WASN'T waiting to pop out on the other side. Since there's no time left to develop characters, they just appear... minus their charm.<br/><br/>There is also absolutely no tension because every time Harry's in a scrape you know that some flying car or bird or wizard or elf is going to appear just in a nick of time, etc. The finale is just a end to the movie, there is no elevation in the rhythm or sense of accomplishment to what's been done, and certainly no anticipation of the next installment.<br/><br/>There is ONE moment in the film that got the glimmer of a reaction from me, a shot of spiders descending from a ceiling. By the way, this movie can be considered a kind of double feature, as once you've seen this movie you've also seen the only worthwhile aspects of ""Eight-Legged Freaks."" I am sure that we are looking at recycled special effects from that movie.<br/><br/>If Warner Bros was to call me and ask me what to do (it often happens) I would also tell them to go once every TWO years on these things, because already this is tired, and has a ""didn't I just see this?"" feel throughout. I wouldn't even wait for the video, but just skip it entirely. There is no possible way I could sit through this movie again.<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

","In light of all the reviews mooning over how great this movie is I would like to add my two cents.  I think the film is very good, just like the first movie, but it is not the greatest film ever made by any stretch of the imagination.  I realize many people see this as a kid's movie and thus being above criticism, but I actually think these movies were made for adults. How many kids under 10 do you know that can sit through three hours of movie?  It just seems to me, that when you see a film like Toy Story which says more in under 90 minutes then this movie does in three hours, you have to think about how it could have been better.  So much of the Potter films seems to rest on gimmicks: things that look really cool but ultimately serve as just backdrop.  Harry Potter has these amazing adventures without even the slightest amount of self-doubt.  This seems especially impressive when he confronts CG terrors that cause even adults to shiver.  Ultimately though there is no message that Harry Potter also feels fear and is therefore human.  I give this movie an A+ for direction, story, acting, and special effects.  For heart I give it an F."

","Ever been to see Cirque d'Soleil, the magical, mystical circus of the new millenium?  Wonderful performances mixed with stunning visuals all encompassed in a fantasy theme...much like ""Chamber of Secrets"".  The problem with both productions is that, at times, there's just too much to take in.  The audience feels rushed and uprooted out of an interesting scene and dropped into something completely different and maybe less satisfying. Okay, enough rhetoric....I liked but did not love this ""Harry Potter"". Solid performances all around (and yes, Rupert Grint's mugging is starting to annoy me).  Brilliant CGI work on the elf, spiders and giant snake.  The script makes no sense, there's way too many plot points and story gimmicks (like Harry being able to talk snake language because he was scratched by a wizard), but who cares?  Potter is an E-ticket ride that starts out slow but ends with a bang."

However, it is decent film that is fun to watch with Grint again giving the best performance.  Branagh and Coulson close seconds.  Both owned the parts wholly. I am sad that again Columbus missed some of the finer points about the characters, especially the Weasly family and their importance.  Too much effort with the ""action"" rather than the story which is truly unnecessary and often unbelievable, such as the Quiditch match that missed much of the point of it and put the story action out of view of the characters for us the audiences sake. Wonderful art direction and cinematography, but still lacking in the emotion of the books."

","When a special appears on television showcasing the talents of one or more magicians we tend to tune in to see the spectacle unfurl before our eyes, but why do we o it? The answer is very simple, because it is entertaining and within the programming we see things happen that enchant us, almost like for that short while we are swept away into a whole new universe without ever having to move from the comfort or our own homes. So why do people feel the need to condemn instead of embrace Harry Potter? Usually when a sequel is placed upon us we find that there are one of two possibilities. One, it is just a retread of its predecessor or two, it does nothing more than build upon concepts that were already presented in the first. That is why sequels are not usually found as entreating as the original. But by no means is this film even a sequel of any sort, it is merely a continuation of where the first film so gracesly left off, you will even notice that there are no opening credits to be found. We open our film with a scene in which Harry is visited in his new home by an adorable elf named Dobby (voiced beautifully by Toby Jones). Dobby tell Harry not to go back to Hogworth Academy or something bad will happen to him, but despite the warnings Harry returns and the magic unfolds. The film takes on a much more mature tone than the first making it much darker and scarier, especially for the younger children, but even through all that darkness those young children are not forgotten about and are let off with some mild humour during several of the darker scenes to lighten the load. But humour is not just used for that sole purpose. The film is often very funny, hilarious even (mainly thanks to the highlight of the show, Dobby) giving it a very warm and light-hearted feeling as well. the direction from Chris Columbus is extremely fast paced and astounding. The scene in which the children take part in a witches sport features some of the most exhilarating action sequences I have seen since Spider-Man. The special effects are simply jaw-dropping and marvellous in every way imaginable. Everything has such smooth texture and is places so well among the live actors that it is hard to believe that what is happening isn't actually real. I was also able to pick up a few points from the script that were so ironic they almost come off as satirical. For instance there is a line uttered that goes ""funny how a silly book can cause so much damage."" It would seem to me that by saying that the film is trying to touch upon the controversy that the Harry Potter franchise has started by telling the audience that books are merely an outlet for our own personal entertainment and not made to cause trouble or any sort. Much of the original cast has returned with some new faces here and there. I must say, for a film that relies mostly on performances from young actors there was a fairly high degree of talent to be found from the young stars. It is also nice to know that Richard Harris could end his career on a high note as Albus Dumbledore (The veteran actor recently passed away) and Kenneth Branagh also adds a good does of comedy into the fold as a renowned wizard who may not be all that his reputation says he is. You can also catch a glimpse of Monty Python Veteran John Cleese in a small role but delightful role as a ghost who can remove his head. A lot of fuss has been made from select Christian groups over this franchise, they deem that it is wrong to depict a human with Godly powers, and some even go for enough as to call it demonic. But instead of burning the books and starting protests why can't we just concentrate on the positive. This film has very strong morals on friendship and determination. It also shows teenagers as independent human beings who are just as worthy as any grown-up. So why not give it a rest and take Harry Potter for what it really is, good old fashioned adventure that is highly entertaining and dazzling in epic proportions. You may notice that I have yet to say anything bad about this film, but still it has only received four stars. Well if it is bad news you are waiting for you are going to be very disappointed because the truth is there is nothing wrong with this film as far as I can see. But the fact that I am not a hardcore Harry Potter fan, or even a general Harry Potter fan leaves me with a personal bias. This film probably deserves five star, but because of this bias I was probably not able to enjoy this film has much as the fans would have. Nevertheless it is an amazing achievement or a film that older children and open-minded adults will have a field day with."

","I will not repeat the story of this movie.  It follows the book quite closely, though not exactly.<br/><br/>The flavor is much the same as the first movie.  <br/><br/>Somehow, I find the books more magical and dramatic than the movies. <br/><br/>
First, the books give long, leisurely descriptions of everything, while the movie has a much more ""Look quickly at the scenery, because we're on to the action.""  approach.  I guess they feel pressed to cram everything in. Still, I'd love to see more pans around the castle, and more lingering shots of the characters' faces at dramatic moments.<br/><br/>Second, somehow the characters in the book seem more dramatic, more momentous.  <br/><br/>In the books, Snape is sinister, malicious, frightening.  In the movie, he comes off much more as a conscientious and competent teacher with a sour expression on his face.  In the books, it seems much more credible when the kids suspect Snape of nefarious deeds.  In the movies, you wonder what makes them suspicious.<br/><br/>In the books, Dumbledore is good, but intimidating and almost supremely powerful.  He seems less impressive in the movie.<br/><br/>The one stellar exception here is Jason Isaacs.  As Lucius Malfoy, he projects just the sort of drama, power, and charisma that I would hope for. This guy really has talent!  Ooo, and I love that long, shiny white hair!  I hope I'll get to see him in more movies in the future.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint's performance as Ron Weasley is very interesting, and not exactly what I had expected.  He plays more of a comic relief against Harry's straight man.  Somehow I didn't see Ron that way, but I think it's working.  Grint has a remarkably mobile face and produces a marvelous array of expressions.  <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliff is very good as Harry Potter, but not supremely excellent. He does not quite draw me in as I would like to be drawn in.<br/><br/>All, in all, it is a very good movie, and certainly an acceptable way to pass the time while we are waiting for Book Five -- I WANT BOOK FIVE NOW!!!"

","The magic seems to be diluted and the aura of originality not as refreshing, yet'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is just as inventive as ever. Many thanks in part to the insanely creative author J.K. Rowling who writes<br/><br/>wondrously and as a result, Director Chris Columbus has the difficult task of eliminating the minor details and engineering a film just as imaginative as the first. At a running time of 2Hrs. and 40Mins., the children were glued to their seats as Harry and the gang return for a second delightful adventure. This time, we are treated to a minor yet delicious role in Kenneth Branagh as Professor<br/><br/>Gilderoy Lockhart. His comedic and well timed facial mannerisms bring a<br/><br/>sprinkle of comedy as this sequel is much darker and intense than the first. Director Chris Columbus handles the assignment to the sequel in an<br/><br/>excellent manner as he jumps right into the story sweeping the audience right off their feet and into the thick story line. In the first film, Director Columbus took great pride in presenting the major set pieces as spectacles to be awed over. Yet in this film, scenery such as Diagon Alley and Hogwarts Dining Room are<br/><br/>regarded as regular set pieces and Columbus propels us directly into the film. Watch how the Quidditch scene is introduced, it will tell you how quick the movie wants to move.      Daniel Radcliffe returns as Potter in a more of a brutish and aggressive role than that of the first. His tarnished features serve justice to his crusade against a malevolent force basing itself out of Hogwarts. Evil forces lurk in the hallways at Hogwarts resulting in students becoming petrified and as a result becoming<br/><br/>inanimate. Harry refuses to listen to a self-mutilating elf named Doby who<br/><br/>incessantly asks him not to return. Yet, upon his return the action ensues and the magic proceeds as this sequel might not as be refreshing as the first film, but still just as effective.      If we dissect the film, we can see that this is an ambitious film and quite a difficult task piecing together all the perennial elements from the first film. Yet Columbus aggregates all the essential factors necessary for a fantasy film and succeeds at delivering a children's fairy tale with the impeccability of a major motion picture feel. As in the first film, the enchanting element is pervasive as those religiously affixed fans will have plenty to gawk over as this film delivers the goods for a second time. <br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ***"

","Let me say first that I enjoyed this movie immensly, even more than the first.  The acting is better this time, and you can tell that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are much more comfortable in their roles.  The adult actors are excellent as well, and the story flows smoothly enough that those not familiar with the book can still follow it closely enough.  The problem is that the story isn't just told...it's driven down your throat.<br/><br/>There is little to no room for exploration in this movie...the entire thing paces itself on getting the story out, and that's about all.  A good example is the lip service paid to Lockheart;  in the book, he's a constant presence, always annoying the teachers and students with his posturing. In this movie, he's there, and that's just about all.  Oh, some key scenes remain;  the book store, the first class with the pixies, and the disastrous dueling classes.  But it's a half-hearted attempt at these sequences, almost as if the director tossed them in and then checked them off on a list. The extreme distaste of the other teachers for Lockheart is completely missing, and it makes his character weaker than it should be.<br/><br/>The adult actors are excellent as always, though underrepresented.  Alan Rickman makes a few brief appearances, as does Richard Harris and Robbie Coletrane.  Important scenes are there, but underscored in the attempt to get the entire story told.  So, while you get the story, it's much less flavorfull than in the first movie, or in the book.<br/><br/>A few gaffs in the storytelling are evident, as well, with some very key scenes from the book taken out.  One of these, and the most important, is the scene in Knockturn Alley where Harry sees the family Malfoy selling dangerous and illegal magic items to avoid an inquest from the Ministry of Magic.  Without this key sequence, you have no reason to have Harry appear there at all...it's just dead space.  Another is the scene where Uncle Vernon finds that Harry is not allowed to use magic at home, and so traps him there, leading the Weasley's to come get him out.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was great.  A nice return to Hogwarts and Harry's world, but I do wish it had the sarcasm, wit and flavor of the book."

","Yes, the effects and the direction are better, but Chamber of Secrets is not in a different league from the first movie Ãâ it's a pleasant diversion. The best addition to this film is Jason Isaacs as the odious Lucius Malfoy, who out-Rickmans Rickman as an aristocratic villain. He's a formidable presence, with ice-blue eyes matched by ice-blond shoulder-length hair, a man who can ooze disdain, virility and polish with equal aplomp. For the rest: Brannagh is right on the money as Lockhart. Harris, Smith, Rickman and Coltrane are back in good form here, though we see less of latter three, and it's sad to notice how much weaker Richard Harris is. It's fun to watch the young actors growing up -- if Emma Watson continues to grow prettier with each picture, look out! I don't know if Daniel Radcliffe has grown on me, or if he's actually better in this movie. Like others, I found him unexpressive & limited in the earlier picture, which I thought Rupert Grint walked away with. Ron seems a bit goofier this time around, & we sadly see less of Hermione. Overall, Chamber of Secrets isn't more than an entertaining installment, and as that it satisfies."

","After reading many of the comments listed here, It appears that many people loved this movie, wow the people that didn't like it utterly LOATHED it.  I one of the ones who enjoyed this movie, but lets take a look at some of the bad points of it. First off, there's Quidditch.  This game is questionable at best. Basically it's flying soccer on broomsticks, exept the balls fight back. This game would be perfectly logical except for one thing: There's a tiny ball (called the snitch) that flies around, and a special member of the team (called the seeker) has to try and catch it.  When he catches it, his team gets 150 points.  The game ends only when this happens.  So there's really no point to the rest of the game.  It not reasonable to assume that a team could get 160 points higher than the other team before the other team catches the snitch.  I could understand this if the game of Quidditch was used merely to test the students flying ability, but apparently this is not the case.  There's really no logic there at all.  I guess the whole Quidditch thing is aimed at 8 year old kids who can barely read or is not meant to be a logical sport, just something to move the plot forward, or sideways, or whatever.<br/><br/>Another problem is the final showdown with the giant snake. It just wasn't fitting that a giant snake that petrified like 10 people is taken down buy a twelve-year old and his bird.  He stabbed it with a sword.  I mean come on, your a WIZARD!  Use MAGIC to kill the monster. The whole thing where the bird miraculously appeared to help Harry out of the ""loyaltyness"" of Harry was just a bit farfetched.  And if a mythical giant snake that is intelligent enough to follow orders but isn't quick enough to catch a flying red bird than what is?<br/><br/>Was it faithful to the book?  More or less.  The little side stories like Nick's Deathday party that were just plain weirs and stupid and I didn't mind them being taken out.  The movie also shows that the Harry Potter books aren't all that witty or intelligently written.  Example?  How about that hilarious line from Ronald Weasly: ""Follow the spiders?  Why can't it be ""Follow the butterflies?""  In the book? Nope. I will have to agree that some of the more interesting characters (Snape, Malfoy) should have appeared more.  They weren't in the book ALL that much, but there ""scenes"" were all very meaningful. I think everybody played there parts fine.  I had no problem with anybody's performance.  Kenneth Branagh did quite a good job as Gilderoy Lockheart and Alan Rickman was THE man as usual. I think the main reason the movie and the book are so much alike is that in the book, stuff is ALWAYS happening, just like a movie.  The author never takes too much time to elaborate on locations, history or atmosphere. That's probably easy because the whole book and movie take place at the school and everywhere surrounding it.  It's almost in direct antithesis to ""The Lord of the Rings,"" where the books take place across a whole planet.   Some people may not like that kind of style, but I surely do. Despite it's few flaws I enjoyed the movie so much it inspired me to read the first two books after watching it."

","'Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone', being the first in a series, suffered from the problem of exposition: by having to explain the rules and denizens of an all-new world it left its own plots and thrills to be short-changed.  On its own, it just didn't pack enough punch.<br/><br/>The second movie in the series, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', doesn't have that problem.  It can get rolling from the first frames right on through into the thrilling climax sequences, and benefits greatly from the familiarity.  We already know who the characters are, we've already seen most of Hogwart's School, and we have an idea of what to expect.  Director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves, adapting this book as closely and faithfully as they did the first one, don't let us down.  High adventure and high drama unfold on the screen.<br/><br/>There are changes.  First and foremost are the physical changes in the young cast members, most notably in the boys.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Tom Felton (Harry's nemesis Draco) all have grown like weeds and had their voices drop into that grainy in-between range that hits all teenaged boys.  For some, especially Felton, the growth spurts help their performances (Draco Malfoy is now a lot taller and even more sinister.  He's no longer a kid playing at being nasty - he just is.).  Emma Watson (Hermione) doesn't have as drastic a change, but she does seem more comfortable in her role.  Given a part that swings wildly from sedate to obnoxious, she has reined in her extremes far better than she did in 'Sorceror's Stone'.  Radcliffe is also more confident as Harry, though a little uneven in his reactions to his surroundings.  Still, as he's in almost every scene, he handles himself quite well.  Grint, the best comic actor of the three leads, gets a few chances to show his stuff here, but like Watson, is less a part of the story this time around - it's pretty much Harry's movie.<br/><br/>Returning from the first film are the main adult roles, as well.  Alan Rickman (Snape) is as drily dark as ever; Maggie Smith (MacGonagall) and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) return, but have precious little to do in this installment.  The late Richard Harris (Dumbledore) is given more depth and substance here - as he will be throughout the series - and is wonderful with his balance of whimsy and wisdom.  He'll be sorely missed, and terribly difficult to replace.<br/><br/>New additions on the adult side include the arrogant and narcissitic Godefroy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh, delightfully hamming up every single scene), and Draco's father Lucius Malfoy, a malevolent force of darkness (Jason Isaacs, seeming to enjoy himself almost as much as Branagh).  The best thing you can say about the adults is that they all seem to be having a blast doing these pictures, in a way that proves acting is not a chore or a burden - but a ton of fun.<br/><br/>The events in 'Chamber of Secrets' are darker and more dangerous than the first film, as Harry discovers deeper plots than before.  There are some scenes that probably aren't appropriate for the really young children in the audience, but most of the older kids have seen much worse in lesser pictures.  The event pieces are good thrills and well-executed:  best are the flying car hurtling towards Hogwart's; the spider encounter in the Dark Forest, and the penultimate battle with the serpentine basilisk inside the Chamber itself.  <br/><br/>It's a fun ride, more focused on the plots and twists than the first film was, though still prone to drawing out the action in the same style as the book.  There's not much reason to mess with a good thing, but Columbus will probably take some hits for a lack of originality in his direction.  So what?  It's still a very enjoyable film, and should satisfy Harry Potter fans quite nicely."

","As an avid fan of the Harry Potter series of books and of the first installment in the film series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" I give ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" a 9/10.<br/><br/>First, a general overview.  This is a good movie.  But it is very, very different from the 1st installment.  It is interesting that most movie critics did not like Sorcerer's Stone but they do like Chamber of Secrets. Likewise, it is interesting to note that most kids seem to like Chamber of Secrets better than Sorcerer's Stone.  (Maybe movie critics all have adolescent minds?).  However, most adults I have talked to have said that they like the original movie better because it is more ""magical"".  I would tend to agree.  The first movie was truly amazing as one watches for the first time a movie depiction of Hogwarts, the great hall, wizards chess, and of course Quidditch.  It was pure magic from beginning to end.  The second movie, of necessity, was less expository and jumps right into the plot.  As a result, a lot of the magic is lost.  The trade off is that there is much better character development.  The only characters developed in depth in the first movie were Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid.  In the second movie there was much better development of the Dursleys, Draco Malfoy, Dumbledore, and others.  Despite its pluses and minuses, it is definitely worth seeing and was very well done. A few specific comments:  Special effects (notably CGI) were much, much improved.  There was only one scene where I said, ""Oh, that was CGI"" and that was not for bad reasons.  It was because it was a particularly good CGI scene.  The rest of the CGI just blended in, which is what you want. The 3 young actors:  Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, pulled off far superior acting in Chamber of Secrets with much more emotion.  Other highlights were Dobby (sheer genius, they could not have done better), Fawkes the phoenix (beautifully done), and Moaning Myrtle (who provided some brilliant comic relief).  Acting from return actors Harris, Smith, and Rickman was also superb. <br/><br/>The movie also sports some great effects:  Parseltongue, for instance.  I was critical that they would not be able to pull this off, but they did a great job.  It is impossible to describe.  You have to see it.<br/><br/>Visual effects were also well used, not only to contribute to the world of magic, but to add humor to the story.  The Cornish pixies and the mandrakes were an example of this.  <br/><br/>Notable characters are Draco and Lucius Malfoy who are truly mean in this episode.  Kenneth Branagh's part as Lockhart is a bit reduced from the book. However, he nails this roll brilliantly giving it the right amount of flamboyance mixed with hidden incompetence.  Professor Sprout was cute.  And Errol, the owl, was absolutely hilarious.  And I can't forget Collin Creevey who was also very well cast.<br/><br/>In general the movie is more intense, but then again, so was the book. Finally, the movie sports a truly wonderful ending.  I would be willing to bet that this ending was spontaneous, not scripted.  It was a moving and appropriate ending for a largely dark movie.  <br/><br/>Harry Potter fans, enjoy!  This film is great for the family, however, some of the scenes may be too intense for kids 8 and younger."
"Gambitt","6","0","0","19 November 2002"," Some of the magic is gone
","All in all, I enjoyed HP and the CoS less than the first.<br/><br/>Just like the first one, Emma Watson's and Rupert Grint's performances stood out over the rest of cast.  Ron Weasely's role seems to be increasingly slapstick.  A lot of scenes depend on his facial expressions.  He's very good at expressions, but this could get annoying in future movies. <br/><br/>
What bothered me the most was the pacing of the movie and the sloppy transitions.  I was downright bored at some points, and this was in spite of the fact that the movie seemed to be rushing along.  Scenes would cut abruptly and the new scene would begin with no intro or build up. Particularly noticeable were the quidditch matches.  Harry et al would be walking down the hall, and suddenly BANG! CUT SCENE ENTER QUIDDITCH MATCH. It would have been so easy to simply slip a line like, "" and during the quidditch game tomorrow..."" into the previous scene.<br/><br/>The plot in general meanders along somewhat aimlessly and HP and gang spend most of the time investigating false leads.  I know this is how the book proceeded as well, but for some reason it didn't seem to drag and wander so much when I read the book.  Perhaps Rowling is just a better writer than Columbus a director.<br/><br/>**** Spoiler ahead but not a major one ****<br/><br/>I didn't like the excessively emotional scenes, which seemed forced and contrived.  Of course the ending is going to be cheesey, but come on!  It's been a while since I read the book, but I don't remember every single sentence in the last chapter reading, ""and his/her eyes were filled with tears...""<br/><br/>On another note, I noticed that there are already action-figure toys of Hermione in cat-form, a rather shameless milking of a scene that lasted what... 3 seconds??"
"CareALotsClouds","10","0","0","18 November 2002"," Better than the first, but it loses its touch half way through
","Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is my favourite book, and it has transferred to the big screen, and what fun it was! From the word go, you do not stop smiling until the scene where Harry is doing Lockharts fanmail.  Such jokes will not be forgotten: 'I didn't know you could read.'  Eroll flying splat into the Window, and Harry's face when he realises he has to travel through Floo Powder. So many funny moments, however, when the plot takes over it can start to drag and get a bit boring, for those who have read the books anyway. Dobby, Fawkes and the Basilisk were absolutely brilliant and the adult cast are again the perfect cast. Daniel Radcliffe, although a better performance than the first movie (which isn't hard), was still making me and other adults around me let out a snigger when he delivers a bad line 'Of course, Phoenix's have healing powers'.  I don't know how anyone can say he can act. Emma Watson was brilliant, as she was in the first movie, and the Mudblood scene was most touching because of her performance and Robbie Coltranes. Rupert Grint and his annoying but brilliant facial expressions are back, he takes the show away from Danial Radcliffe which isn't hard.  He is so much more believable than he was in the first movie. Kenneth Brannagh was absolutely perfect as Gilderoy Lockhart!  That's all I have to say about that! The performance I was most disappointed with, which was Daniel in the first movie, was this time round Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy.  Maybe it was his voice that let him down or the way he looked frightenly like Eminem at one point before delivering a terrible line 'Good one Goyle'.  Whatever it was, he was terrible this time round and was much better as the puberty-less Draco in the first film. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape was underused as well as Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall.  Shame.<br/><br/>The adaption from the book was done brilliantly.  There was no particular thing I missed from being put into the big screen such as Nick's Death day Party.  This time round, Steve Kloves took the right things out and put the right things in.  I actually enjoyed the extra things that was put in such as Cobby jumping around on the bed and Jason Issacs (who also played his part perfectly) contribution of 'Well lets hope that Mr. Harry Potter will always be around to save the day'.<br/><br/>After such a great movie, I don't know whos idea it was, they absolutely ruined the ending.  The cheese was melting of the screen as I was melting into my seat.  Somehow, Hagrid turned into the hero, don't ask me, I don't know how it happened.<br/><br/>Over all, a 8 out of 10 and a great farewell performance from the Late Richard Harris.  Congratulations the crew and cast, much better than their first offering."

"scoob-","Null","0","0","17 November 2002"," The Harry Potter phenomenon: money thrown at a tepid screenplay
","The Harry Potter phenomenon, I admit, it is one thing I do not quite understand. Neither groundbreaking or unique, the stories have struck a cord with a large audience and this is translated from the books to the screen. The canon is, for want of a better word, 'nice'. It's quite under-whelming, forgetful nonsense that would be an attractive notion to gather round the hearth of a nice fire on a Sunday eve and watch as a handsomely produced television series.<br/><br/>But it's a phenomenon, so once Warner's paid through the nose for this series, that was never going to happen. There are first-rate production values right across the board. The film has most certainly been elevated above its source material. Most of the time, throwing money at an idea, a script, simply results in a disaster. Here, it's been lovely applied to all facets of the production: special effects, the score, the production design, the impressive English cast -- all are well-above par and it makes for an experience that elevates above the tepid storyline.<br/><br/>The 161-minute running time on one hand makes me pleased that the film-makers are not afraid to produce a feature that strays above the standard 88-minute running length that plagues most 'family' fare. But on the other, I'm wondering where that script doctor went and why the pruning process was not applied. The first half-hour of the film is essentially a rehash of the first: evil foster parents make Harry's life hell and the mandatory escape, enter London magical netherworld, meet up with the Beasley's, from Paddington we again get another magical portal routine and onto Hogwarts. While it's all a rather pleasant, joyful if you will, return to character's we only saw one year ago, we've seen it before; it's not necessary.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs makes a welcome entry as Lucuis Malfoy, the father of Christopher Walken Jr. Also putting in a nice turn, and a move that may help to resurrect his faltering career, is Kenneth Branagh as the fraud Lockhart. Indeed, while the adult parts are chock-full of England's finest talent from film and television, the film lives and dies by its young trio of Radcliffe, Watson and Grint. Radcliffe continues to hold the film with his spirited performance as Potter, and while Grint (Ron Weasley) seems to exist solely to pull faces on que, Watson's Hermonie adds spunk to her role.<br/><br/>
Chris Columbus has to be commended with what he has achieved with the first two films in this series: they're much better then they deserve to be. Gather together a first-rate cast, a director that understands the genre, and a crew that has had no money spared in its assembly and you can succeed in turning a B-rate fantasy into an event. A fun watch - I can't help but think of the family and the hearth of the fire; as a television Christmas film, this will last the ages -, but it is ultimately throwaway entertainment."

","What can I say, other than I'm appalled that this film was ever released. Is it just a licence to print money for Warner Bros.? The film follows the same ""predictable"" format as the first one. Let me explain:-<br/><br/>1. Harry is shown at home with his evil aunt, uncle and cousin.  They are rather horrible to him, again!! 2. Harry goes to school, again! 3. Someone reveals an evil plot is afoot in the school.  Is this Deja Vu or did this happen in the first film? 4. Harry finds the evil mastermind, has a fight with a monster, kills it. 5. Lots of annoying kids sit at a dinner table, looking cheesy, the End.<br/><br/>Now you may think the above is rather harsh, but if you are honest with yourselves you will see how un-imaginitive the whole film is.  Nothing new, just a film which does well because of the Child/Parent pressure of ""my friends are going to see it"".  Much in the same way as Pokemon cards not so long ago.<br/><br/>As a film on it's own, reasonable. As a second offering from the Potter camp, very poor.<br/><br/>Do not go and watch if you have seen the first one, you may find yourself thinking you are watching the same film."

","First I would like to say that I felt the ""Chamber of Secrets"" was so much better than I had expected it to be.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, be warned.  There are going to be some spoilers.<br/><br/>I thought the opening was good.  It allowed one to see a little of Harry's life with the pics of his mom and dad, and his friends, Ron and Hermione. It just shows one how much Harry misses his friends at Hogwarts.  Then Dobby warns us about some ""great danger.""  After about an hour of exploration and detective work, we are taken the the Chamber of Secrets.  Tom Riddle is revealed as the 16 year-old Lord Voldomort, sends a Basilisk to kill Harry, but his bravery defeats his soon to be enemy.  The day is saved, and we once again wait in agony until the ""Prisonor of Azkaban"" comes out in 2004.<br/><br/>Now for my thoughts on the direction of the film.  I felt Daniel, Rupert, and Emma did an absolute terrific job as Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  Kenneth Branagh was the only man I know who could have played Gilderoy Lockhart as I saw him. Jason Isaacs also did a wonderful job playing the always pleasant (wink, wink) Lucious Malfoy. I had watched The Patriot, and thought that he did a really good job playing a bad guy, and when I came to this website to see who else was added to the cast, I saw his name and was delighted with joy.<br/><br/>Everything was as I had imagined it from the book.  I was a little dissapointed that we weren't directly introduced to Professor Dippet, and the fact that we never got a chance to know that Ginny Weasley, but that's just me. I really didn't think about those parts of the book until I started thinking back on the book and the film.<br/><br/>As I said, it'll be a long, rough two years until we can see the next book in live action, but I think that watching the DVD's and reading the books might keep me occupied until then."

","As an older Harry Potter fan who has read the books, i found ""The Chamber of Secrets"" to be enjoyable, but a bit of a let-down after the ""The Sorcerer's Stone."" I understand that the story is far more complicated than the first book, but i do not believe that an appropriate compromise was reached between the mystery and the details of Harry's childhood. It seems as though, not only were the details of the mystery insufficient, but that Harry's coming-of-age has been almost completely ignored. However, in spite of some very bad acting from Draco Malfoy, there are plenty of exciting moments and the movie is fun throughout. They should look into replacing Malfoy as the new Dumbledore is chosen. It would be an added incentive to see the third movie. 7 out of 10 (for a potter fan)"

We have read all the books and await the next book with eager anticipation. I went to the local Cinema (sorry - Movie Theatre) and it was packed with mostly young teens and pre-teenagers. They all sat still and maintained their interest for 2 hours 41 minutes (was it really that long?). Many jumped at the frightening parts and many laughed at the funny parts (me loudest of all). There just wasn't enough of Hagrid and poor old Albus (Richard Harris)was showing that his illness was more serious than the last film - but we all loved the film and were talking about the good bits as we left the theatre. Some achievement! To translate the books and to keep the magic must be difficult but it succeeds. The film was slightly over-long and we were suffering from some discomfort because our seats weren't the best, and the ending was a bit of an anti-climax (should have had more humour, I think) - but - whatever.

Probably the best part of the film.<br/><br/>Even more so than the first one, this film had the feel of plot gears grinding away, each scene happening because the book dictated it that way.

","*May contain spoilers*<br/><br/>Wow! That's all I can say, wow! Much better than I had expected it to be and much better than the first movie! Although, to me it seemed as if the movie went by too fast. I have read the books over and over again and I am able to notice what they have forgotten!<br/><br/>I love this movie and would watch it over and over again, but what bothered me was that they didn't have the death day party. That's where they were supposed to be before they found Mrs. Norris petrified and before they saw the writing on the wall.<br/><br/>I also found the way they did Hermione's (Emma Watson) hair very irritating. It is supposed to be poofy and curly, not just curly!!<br/><br/>I wish they would have said what Ron's (Rupert Grint) detention was. It was a little important to the plot. It would have kind of explained a little bit about Tom Riddle (Christian Coulson). For those of you who don't know, he was helping Mr. Filch clean out all the awards and trophies and stuff. He was still coughing up those slugs, and coughed a whole bunch of slugs on to a certain award, which was Tom Riddle's special award for ""catching the heir of Slytherin"". When Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) found Tom's diary, he told Ron about it and told Harry about it. (Sorry to those reading this, I just wanted to type some more things 'cause I'm bored out of my mind)<br/><br/>Colin Creevey (Hugh Mitchell) was a lot more annoying in the book, as well as Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branaugh). I hoped that they would have shown how they really bothered Harry as he was trying to get on through his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br/><br/>Ohh my gosh, don't get me wrong, I loved this film to death!! Those are just some things that irritated me during those 2 hours and 41 minutes.<br/><br/>This movie gets a 10/10, EXCELLENT!!! Watch this movie, it IS worth it!"

","When Harry Potter first hit the big time, I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about. When the first film came out, I hid. After a while, I got curious, and bought the books. In about twenty minutes, I knew what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/> Of the four books, Philosopher's Stone is my least favourite, so although I was intrigued to see the first film, I wasn't that shocked when I thought it wasn't handled as well as it could have been - aside from some really choice casting (Alan Rickman, Julie Walters, and Tom Felton stand out) it was decidedly average. However, Chamber of Secrets is my favourite (alongside Prisoner of Azkaban) and so I was very interested to see this film. I re-read the book in preparation, I surfed around reading reviews.<br/><br/> Was I impressed? You betcha.<br/><br/>From the first moment of Harry studying his parent's old photos, to the final scenes of the Hogwarts Great Hall, the film is funny, honest, and entertaining. More importantly, it's a cracking adaptation to boot. All the unimportant parts are cut to get straight to heart of the action (for example, Harry and Ron follow the spiders directly from Hagrid's hut, rather than going back to the castle, seeing them in Herbology etc, which makes a good text, but not a very interesting scene, especially when we want to get them into the Forbidden Forest asap) and ILM do a fantastic job on the special effects - unlike Fluffy from HPATPS, the beastie in CoS is really life-like. (Unlike Fawkes, but nobody's perfect)<br/><br/> Speaking of life-like, unlike poor old Radcliffe who still has his moments of stiffness, Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) is coming along in leaps and bounds. He and Emma Watson (Hermione) are brilliant, and Rupert Grint (Ron) plays the funny man to Harry's straight man very well - I loved the line ""Follow the spiders. Why an't it be follow the butterflies?"" Mark Williams is spot on as Arthur Weasley, and Julie Walters was every bit as wonderful as I'd been anticipating from PS. Whoever cast her deserves a medal - I can't imagine a better Mrs Weasley if I tried! I was quite perturbed when I found out Bridget Jones' best mate would be taking up the robes of Moaning Myrtle, but Henderson did a great job - you wouldn't guess her true age for a minute. Versatile or what?!<br/><br/> All in all, apart from a VERY cheesy moment at the end with Hagrid, see this movie. If you like the book, you'll LOVE it. If you've never even heard of JK Rowling - dude, you gotta get out more - you'll still think it's brilliant. You don't even need to have seen the first one to understand it (although obviously it helps). Columbus, I salute you. Roll on Azkaban! (Now if only they take my suggestion of Jude Law for Sirius Black...)"

","The acting is somewhat better this time around, but the direction is a little off at times, not as punchy as I would have liked. Sometimes I still have the feeling that there's a whole lot of exposition going on, setting things up for something to come later, but this feeling extends all the way through the end of the movie, which, by the way, I don't remember it being anything like that in the book. Speaking of which, if these movies weren't so slowly paced, maybe they could get more of the books into them!<br/><br/>
Anyway, the movie is alright, but it isn't great, and in retrospect, I'm beginning to feel the same about the books."

","Warning: Minor Spoilers<br/><br/>This movie rocked!  I knew that it had to be better than the first one, but this totally blew me away!  The script was great, and the acting from the children and adults alike was so much better than it was last time.  Not to mention the cool spiders, mandrakes, phoenix and the basilisk.  My friends and I were screaming during the scene when Harry and Ron wander into the Dark Forest to meet with Aragog.  That was truly scary.  Knockturn Alley was just as creepy as I imagined it from the book. The new characters were just hysterical and frightening.  Kenneth Branagh definitely Gilderoy Lockhart beyond well, and you could see how much fun he must have had playing that part.  Same goes for Lucius.  Gees Jason Isaacs was scary.  Even I, being a villain freak that I am, cringed when he started beating Dobby with his cane.  Dobby was, by the way, not as annoying as one might have pictured him to be.  I guess the director was really trying to not make him that way after seeing what happened to George Lucas' reputation with Jar Jar Binks.  And Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle did the best by portraying a sixteen-year-old as evil. However, there were a few things that the movie should have included: the scene where the Malfoys are selling things to Mr. Borgin and the Valentine's Day celebration.  Those would have been icing on the cake.  But when Lucius and Arthur are at Flourish and Blott's, they did not fight!  My friends and I were literally yelling FIGHT FIGHT, but they did not!  The movie also made Draco Malfoy seem more pitiful than bratty.  Not only is he treated rotten by his dad, but Snape isn't that nice to him either. All in all, it was excellent.  I give it 9.5/10.  Cannot wait until Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire."

","""Dobby has come to warn you sir.""-A quote from this story which I found very suitable for this movie and something I say to you now as a fellow moviegoer. I found this movie to be utterly boring myself. I found too many transactions that could have had different connotations, most of which only adults would understand. This in itself was the only entertainment i got from this picture. Maybe i was looking for something other than a reproduction of a childrens story. Not having read any of the books in this series, I can only imagine that the people who have critiqued this film found excitement from finding if the director had different interpretations than themselves. One thing I did not like was the fact that the only bloodshed occured during the conclusion of this movie. I found it to be a rude awakening from the childish jokes. I thought it was humorous how all of the children thought it funny when Dobby started inflicting pain upon himself and I wondered what this was teaching them. I don't want to spend all night talking about this movie and I know one critical review wont stop you from seeing the movie, but if you decide to see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I recommend you pay the matinee price."
"williamrharvey","6","0","0","17 November 2002"," Wanted: A Director
","I didn't much like the second Harry Potter movie. I think the blame lies squarely with Chris Columbus; Alfonso Cuaron should do a much better job with the next movie. Columbus never builds tension into his shots by holding them longer than necessary to communicate a plot point. His camera angles never seem to do more than tell a direct narrative. Unlike plays, movies can force the audience to view the actors according to the very specific intentions of the director, accomplished by the angle, the lens, lighting, etc. Columbus does this somewhat, but not enough.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent and the sets and effects were spectacular as expected. But the series deserves a director with imagination, a director who is willing to be more than Rowling's lapdog, a director who will make a movie instead of an adaptation. Hopefully Cuaron will be that director.<br/><br/>One might make the argument that the audience should not expect a fantasy to hold up to the standards of Citizen Kane. But Lord of the Rings is a fantasy, and Peter Jackson is just as aware of what a camera is capable of as Orson Welles was. Both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings feature enthralling magical worlds, brilliant British acting, fantastically detailed sets, costumes, and effects, and a wonderful score. The main difference is that Lord of the Rings has a director."
"rab62442","6","0","0","17 November 2002"," Here's my opinion.
","I'm sorry if this gets lengthy.<br/><br/>I read quite a few of these reviews before I went to see it opening night in the states, Friday the 15th. This is my first comment since I've joined IMDB, and I figured I'd make my first comment one for the Harry Potter movie.<br/><br/>I personally am a huge fan of the books. I think they're brilliantly written and are great books for children and adults. Although there are quite a few people who would disagree with me and say that they are bad for children and so on, I feel that it is better to have children reading than being on computers, playing video games and watching t.v. The books, in my opinion are all about imagination and letting yourself get lost in a magical world. Having an imagination is one of the best gifts one can have.<br/><br/>I'll start with the Harry Potter movie by mentioning the first one. I read all of the books before the first one, so of course I was really excited. When I saw the first one, I was very pleased to see all of the things I had read about be put into a Hollywood film.  To my surprise, a lot of the things matched what I was seeing as I was reading the book, and that made the movie even better. I think the cast is amazing and unbelievable considering their age.  Also, the children are fans, so it was cool to see them put into their acting what they thought their characters should be like.  I'm sure we'll see a lot out of them in the future.<br/><br/>Obviously, as I've said above, I loved the first movie.  Now I will state what I thought about the second movie. As soon as I walked out of the theater for the first movie, I said to my one friend that I couldn't wait for the second movie. I made my friend a fan of Harry Potter due to dragging her to the movie and lending her my books.  Due to me looking forward to the 5th book and the second movie to come out, at times that's all I could think about because there were some things that I was eager to see and read.<br/><br/>As I walked into the theater for the second movie, I was really energetic and hyper because it was finally time to see this movie.  I was so happy as the movie went on.  Of course I noticed a few of the things that were different from the book, but when making a movie from a book, you HAVE to expect that.  I loved the movie. It was awesome to me. The basilisk was one of the things that I was most anticipating.    Continuing on, when I walked out of the theater, I almost thought that it was a movie that someone might not enjoy as much if they didn't read the book.  There were some things in there that I could imagine someone being confused about, but that still doesn't mean the movie was bad.<br/><br/>So all in all, I loved the movie, and i think everyone should go see it. Can't wait for the third movie!!! Concluding this, I would like to say R.I.P. Richard Harris."
"Aeris4ever","10","0","0","17 November 2002"," ""Harry Potter"" is the ""Star Wars"" of the new generation
","I just came back from seeing ""Chamber of Secrets"" and I thought it was excellent.  Most of the flaws from ""Sorceror's Stone"" have been fixed, particularly in the special effects dept.  The story is brilliant and it stays true to the book, yet works wonderfully on screen.  I believe that Harry Potter is THE fantasy series of the Millenial generation (kids under 20), the same way the Star Wars trilogy was for Gen X-ers.  That's not to say adults won't enjoy the film, because as a young 20-something, I am both a huge ""Star Wars"" and Harry Potter fan.<br/><br/>The ""Chamber of Secrets"" is a much darker story that requires the viewer to pay attention to every detail.  Older kids and adults will most likely enjoy this film.  Reading the books isn't a requirement, so don't let that stop you from seeing the film if you aren't already a fan.  Since I read the book 3 years ago and forgot many details, I think I enjoyed the film more. Purists may be disappointed at certain omissions, but casual fans and newcomers with open minds should be very entertained.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend seeing the first movie before this one, especially if you're new to the series.  Otherwise, you might have lots of ""what the heck?"" moments.  This film delves deeper into the wizard world, with even stranger creatures and sinister plots involving elite wizards.  The first film was basically an introduction to the wizard world, following a very straight path through one school year.  The second is more story-oriented, jumping from event to event without a real sense of time.  We do get to see Christmas again, as a sort of benchmark.  This movie flows so well, that you won't believe you've been sitting in a seat for almost 3 hours; the time really flies.<br/><br/>I won't go into story details, since you can read those anywhere, but I'll just make a few comments.  ""Chamber of Secrets"" is very Harry-centric, meaning the Harry, Ron and Hermione team of the first film is rather weak. Both kids take a backseat to Harry in this one.  It was comforting to see the old sub-characters again, especially the Gryffindor kids, but none of them contribute much.  Of the new characters, I thought Tom Riddle was the most fascinating.  Gilderoy Lockhart was a hit amongst both adults and kids in the audience.  I felt Ginny Weasley and Colin Creevey were the most neglected of the new cast, but that doesn't affect the film itself. Moaning Myrtle is annoying, but well played.  Dobby the elf was adorable, not looks-wise, but I couldn't help falling for the poor, little thing.<br/><br/>As for scary content, there are a couple ""jump out of your seat"" moments and a few tense moments that are amplified with very loud sound effects.  Like the first film (flying keys scene), the noise level is irritating at times, as I saw a few people put their hands over their ears.  The spider sequence isn't so bad, but younger kids might want to shield their eyes.  The battle with the chamber's monster at the end is probably the scariest scene for kids, it's reminiscent of any ""Jurassic Park"" confrontation.  There were dozens of kids as young as 3 in the theater, and none of them seemed to have a problem.  From an adult's POV, I thought the baby mandrake scene was the most disturbing, if only a bit.<br/><br/>A few more tiny things I'd like to mention:  The music is excellent, an overall better soundtrack than the first one.  The special effects were much improved, the only real hokey-looking one involved the flying car over the countryside.  The sets are gorgeous, I just loved seeing the Weasley house and the Chamber.  The best part of Harry Potter is that it's an enchanting, intelligent experience for people of all ages to enjoy.  I'd give the film a pretty solid 10/10."

","This movie is the perfect follow-up to ""Sorcerer's Stone.""  The students continue to be charmingly engaging and the special effects are great! Both movies are faithful to the books, which is very satisfying to all of us who love the HP series, but the movies hold together on their own quite well. Kenneth Branagh is a hoot as the ridiculously pompous teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.  And, if you're a credits fan like I am, stick around until the very end when there's a little extra treat in store.<br/><br/>One personal comment about a pet peeve:  many folks compare the ""Harry Potter"" and the ""Lord of the Ring"" movies.  I don't believe they should be compared.  Yes, they are both fantasy series which happen to be released within a month of each other, but otherwise they are completely different. I happen to enjoy both series (yes, I've read and own them all) and am thrilled that the film industry is doing justice to both.  ""Harry Potter"" may be aimed more towards kids, but plenty adults are buying tickets and loving the show."

Especially seeing more of Hogwarts. Now I know what the school looks like a little bit more. Was it just me or did any of you other people notice how the actors kept changing the way that Ginny Weasley's name was pronounced. It went from (phonetically) Guinea to Gin-knee depending on which actor said it and when they said it. I thought that was hilarious.

"sparklechick88","9","0","0","17 November 2002"," Beautiful effects and a great plot add up to make a wonderful movie
","Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"" the second movie out of a possible seven absolutely delighted the audience. I've only been to a few movies that earned applause at the end, and this was one of them.<br/><br/>After being sorely disappointed in the first Harry Potter movie, the second, ""Chamber of Secrets,"" was a wonderful surprise. First of all, the graphics and special effects were great. Hogwarts Castle no longer looked like an obvious computer generated image and the Quidditch Match was very believable. Add the dozens of other effects, and ""Chamber of Secrets"" really came to life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the first movie sorely lacked in acting talent in the students, with the exception of Hermione. Although her character is much more of a prat than a caring friend in the movies, Emma Watson does a wonderful job with it. Grint greatly improved from the ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" and absolutely lighted up the screen in his few moments, especially the Aragog scene. The only problem here was the small amount of time we really got to see him in the movie. Radcliffe also improved A LOT from the first movie, in which he seemed more like a wooden board. Harry had emotion in this movie, which made an obvious change. Kenneth Branagh as Professor Lockhart was perfect. I can't even find anything wrong here.<br/><br/>Dobby seems to be taking a lot of undeserved bashing. I don't know how people expected him to appear, but he was exactly what I imagined a house-elf to look like. ""Annoying?"" Yes, he is quote annoying. He is SUPPOSED to be annoying. It is how Rowling meant for him to be. But looking beyond that, you really have to love him. Everyone in the theater I was in laughed at his antics. He is a very important part of the story, and brings more mystery into it. What it would be without him, I can't even imagine.<br/><br/>One thing I was upset about was the basilisk. The snake wasn't supposed to physically look like a monster; its terror was in its size and power. The basilisk in the movie looked like a relation of Godzilla.<br/><br/>The second most common complaint is how closely if follows the book. Hmm, well, now that I think about it, the movie is supposed to follow the book. Could that possibly have anything to do with it? If any of the major events were changed it wouldn't be predictable, but it wouldn't be how Rowling meant it to be. As a big fan of Harry Potter, I would be outraged if the movie DIDN'T follow the book. The movie is just meant to give the reader a clearer view of characters, which it successfully does. And it was far from unexciting. As a high school student, I can say that I not only laughed during the movie, but I also screamed (really) and jumped many times. The Aragog scene was absolutely terrifying, as were many scenes in the chamber.<br/><br/>When you look at negative reviews, they are obviously biased- most say it straight out. I admit it is no ""Lord of the Rings,"" but ""Harry Potter"" has its own wonderful aspects. The two shouldn't even be compared as they are meant for different audiences.<br/><br/>Overall, even though I wasn't expecting very much, I was pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to go see it again.<br/><br/>4 1/2 stars out of 5. Wonderful plot, special effects, music, and improved acting."

Thats what makes a book/ movie brilliant. The special effects have upgraded from the lousy Troll in the first one to an absolutely spectacular Basilisk at the end of the movie. The humour was ten times better than the first and the acting was absolutely extrordinary. Chris Columbus did a marvelous job and I for one think he shouldn't resign.

","I don't go to films often, I wait for the video to come out but ""Harry Potter"" is an exception.  I have read all the books multiple times.  I saw the first movie twice and will see this one a second time too.  Daniel and Rupert have deeper voices and are as charming as ever.  Hermione is also looking more grown up and seems more friendly and relaxed.  I got tears in my eyes every time Dumbledore was there (Goodbye Richard Harris we will miss you so much). I rate this film a 10 because the minor changes and skips are bearable (the film is just the right length) but, don't drink to much soda early on or you'll be in the restroom when the chamber sequence is on. I like the way they did the chamber sequence, the sound, music and visuals were superior.<br/><br/>!!SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I wish they had spent more time at the Weasley's, the house was so cute and fascinating.  I wanted to see the garden de-gnomed and hear the attic ghost shouting.  I loved the actor's voices in their new deeper tones and their maturing just as Harry and Ron would have between years in the book.  I hope the trio can stick it out for all the movies and the production can continue to enchant us with making visual representation of Ms. Rowlings fantastic tales.  Dobby is most enchanting I can't wait to see his friend Winky. I was impressed with the car/train sequence - very thrilling. I am not into sports much but ""Quiditch"" is fun and the bludger chase is super.  I am not afraid of spiders and I loved them and their effect on Ron.  The wizard dueling was done very well and I held my breath during the chamber sequence when the basilisk was chasing Harry through the huge tunnels.  I noticed the changes made but they were acceptable. I could go on and on."

","Well, my previous review for SS was over-excitedly done. I wrote it about an hour after seeing the movie and I really should have allowed for some recovery time. In this instance, I watched CoS YESTERDAY (which was, for future reference, the following day of its theatrical release) as opposed to letting the hyper activity rush to my mind and just come home directly afterward scribbling something incoherent. SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>I was amazed how fast they jumped into everything. It was like, BAM BOOM BANG--you're there. Chris Columbus really sped it up and for the better. It was good for ducking out of times that could quickly become awkward, with a some sharp humor and wit, J.K. Rowling's characters came to light. From the moment Harry is rescued in the Ford Anglia to the time when he and Ron decide to fly their way to Hogwarts, I noticed that many key elements are touched on but not explored the way they are in the book itself. Ordinarily this would be very bad for a movie of this scale but somehow it made it feel all the more adventurous and real to me. The special effects were well done. I was disappointed with Dobby though. I mean, it was SO obvious he was computer generated (he's ugly to boot). The Aragog scene had everyone in the theater cringing--I felt for Ron. I really did. And the basilisk eerily reminded me of that weird squid creature from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The detail oriented Potterheads should be warned. THE FOLLOWING WAS NOT IN THE MOVIE: Nick's deathday party, Percy & Penelope's little romance, some funny exchanges between Fred & George and de-gnoming the garden. (You will not believe HOW MUCH I was seriously looking forward to that last one!) Alright, so this might seem like a bit much. Don't worry. Even without these scenes the plot is left in tact, mandrakes and all! Speaking of herbology, I thought the casting of Prof. Sprout was right on target. Let me tell you another thing--KENNETH BRANAGH IS GILDEROY LOCKHART! I sorely wish he got more screen time. Probably one of the most hilarious scenes has him walking down a staircase pompously saying, ""Let me introduce your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher--ME!"" At the same time there is an image of himself in a painting, striking debonair poses, and drawing self-portraits! His inflated ego was captured PERFECTLY and I was pleased to see that many of his lines were right from the novel! Daniel Radcliffe's acting has visibly improved. I felt that things were happening TO HIM not AROUND HIM. Emma was OK, although she is in my opinion nothing to crow about. Rupert does need to practice some differing facial expressions. Anyway, Chamber of Secrets was not only funnier, it was scarier. The petrified people look dead and Mrs. Norris' hanging is rather disgusting. Christian Coulson (who is handsome), Jason Isaacs and Tom Felton were delightfully evil villains. (I got a kick out of how they made Draco and Lucius look so alike, i.e. the blonde manes.) The plot is more involved, the actors more relaxed and everything is generally loads better."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets provided a very enjoyable movie-going experience.  It moved at a quicker pace than the last Harry Potter film, and kept its audience on their toes throughout the film. However, as I looked around the packed theatre and noticed several little kids, I began to wonder how this movie could be aimed at such young children.  Scenes with giant snakes and spiders, messages written with blood, and ghosts will certainly be the cause of countless nightmares. What good can come of showing little children a graphic portrayal of someone slaying a giant serpent?  Or of a floor littered with bones?  Harry Potter kept the audience entertained, but at the expense of the kids that it was supposed to be for.  Hopefully, in the next installment of this series, the producers will be reminded who their audience is - the kids - and aim the movie more towards them."

","This was the first movie I ever watched on the actual premiere date, and I loved every second of it. I became an instant Harry Potter fan after reading The Chamber of Secrets a year ago, it became my absolute favorite book, but watching the movie last wednesday, it was even larger than life!!<br/><br/>Of course, Daniel Radcliffe is the focus but Rupert Grint was still the scene stealer, still being the funniest and the greatest actor among the three. Even so, I still liked Dan the best of all. I could think of him more as a Harry Potter than the actual illustration on the book cover. And how he's grown! From his 1999 production  as a young david copperfield to the tailor of panama(2001) to the sorcerer's stone(late 2001), where he was, I believe, 10, 11(going on 12) & 12, respectively, to his recent movie, The Chamber of Secrets, where he is 13 but looks 15! He still looked like a kid in his past productions but not in this one! He must have had some kind of sudden growth boost or must have jumped really high on New Year. In this movie, you could actually see Harry, or rather Daniel, develop into a man, and he sure looks the part. This is really freaky considering he was born in the same year that I was(yup, I'm 13). His face has developed from that of a kid's to that of a young adult's. His new face is quite manly and much more mature, something older fans can appreciate. And I like his new look better.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie. Another well done, Chris Columbus. The movie is so well directed. And unlike other book-turned-movie movies, where they leave out a huge amount of the original storyline, I was very satisfied. They cut out a lot of parts but still kept the story really intact, and kept only the significant parts. And I wasn't dissatisfied one bit. I just don't know where to stop! I have to stop now while I still have the self-control.<br/><br/>So even if you're not an H.P. fanatic, you will definitely love this movie. Too bad I have to wait until 2004 to see Daniel Radcliffe again in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Arrgghhhhh!!!"

","With all the build up I was anxious to see this film. I read the book and loved it at 64 years old. So I had to drive 40 miles to get to the nearest theater which is a old one totally renovated in Houlton Maine.It was a 1:00 PM Saturday matinee sold out of course, with hundreds - or so it seemed -of children. I wondered if I was going to see any of the Movie. I was shocked to see how quiet everyone was with gasps and sighs where they should be. The movie is simply great. The cast is simply superb. What a shame that we will not be able to enjoy Mr.Harris again. He was simply marvelous.When it ended I was surprised and actually disappointed it did not run longer.

","Being a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, it's so great to be able to see them come to life on the screen. And although I did think at first that my own image of the books might be destroyed by an unworthy actor's portrayal, the movies made so far have been alarmingly close to what I'd imagined the books to be like. So, it was great when I went to the theater with the expectations of the first movie, only to be shocked that the second movie has out done my expectations. We can only hope that when the reins are handed over to another director that the finished product will live up to its predecessors. Although I am over twenty, I must admit to being an unabashed reader of the Harry Potter books. I really hope that the next five movies to be made will be as true to J.K.

","I was very anxious to see the second movie, so naturally I was also afraid of being disappointed. I absolutely love the books and just the whole world of Harry Potter and I'd hate for it to have anything that I don't like. CoS the movie, however, didn't let me down. I admit I am slightly sad that the development of the story needed so much time that there was almost none left for secondary things ilke classes, quidditch matches, things like that. However, I think Chrish Columbus and the crew did a great job adapting the book into a movie and certainly it couldn't have been expected to be word for word.<br/><br/>The main plus of this movie, in my opinion, are the new ""secondary"" actors. Namely, Kenneth Brannagh and Jason Isaacs, Shirley Henderson and Julie Walters. They did a fantastic job bringing their respective characters to life! I also had quite a few laughs induced by Rupert Grint's great acting. Not a waste of time, not a waste of money and very much worth to wait. Now I'm waiting for the DVD with its extra, deleted scenes."

"pythianreynolds","Null","0","0","16 November 2002"," Myrtle misplayed... Direction distracted
","***SPOILER ALERT: some scenes are breifly summarized below***<br/><br/>I just came from viewing this most eagerly anticipated film.  I have three principal criticisms; but they in no way diminish the essential quality of the story that I believe to be J.K. Rowling's best yet.<br/><br/>The story was told accurately, but not as well as it could have been if Chris Columbus had been hitting his stride, as he so admirably demonstrated he was capable of doing with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's [""Sorceror's"" for the Yankees] Stone.  The direction was uninspired and lingered too long on features added to the screenplay that were not in the story:  Harry almost falling out of the flying car after the train catches it; the StarWars-esque ""pod-race"" chase for the Golden Snitch during the Quidditch match; the second attack of the spiders on the way out of the Dark Forest; and the blind Basilisk sewer run... none of which were described by Rowling's narrative.  I would have much preferred to see the de-Gnoming of the garden at The Weasley's Burrow; Harry's eavesdropping on the Malfoys in Knockturn Alley; Nearly-Headless-Nick's Death-day Party with John Cleese and the comical hijinks of the captain of the Headless Hunt; the scene where Lockhart is easily hoodwinked into granting Hermione access to the potions book in the restricted section of the library; and the discovery of the notice that the Dueling club was going to be opened!<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh undoubtedly has the ability to portray the foppish flamboyant bumbling fraud that is the character of Gilderoy Lockhart; but his performance seemed to have been stoppered in a bottle by inadequate costuming and over-direction.  Most obviously, Lockhart's character should have had a different costume for every scene he appeared in, and they should have been garishly coloured.  Having remedied that would have greatly supported the characterization that was due by cuing Branagh to go over top---he's supposed to be comic relief!---and to remind Columbus not to hold him back.  The duality of the character as a pansy and a poser was almost invisible with the exception of the late scene where he's prodded into taking on the Chamber's Monster.<br/><br/>The character of Moaning Myrtle, the ghost of the girl's lavatory, was mis-performed by Shirley Henderson; but I'm confident she's not entirely to blame.  She either didn't read the book in favour of emulating Helena Bonham Carter's performance as Morgan Le Fey in Merlin (1998); she was incapable to portraying the deceased frustrated outcast schoolgirl; or, more likely in my opinion, simply suffered from the director's apathetic attention to what should have been more deeply layered scenes.<br/><br/>It's no secret that Chris Columbus was weary of being away from his own children, who had initially convinced him to take charge of the first Harry Potter movie---I had no idea how disaffected he was until I saw the second finished product.  Several scenes struck me as particularly flat, e.g., the scene where Harry and Ron pose as Crabbe and Goyle in the Slytherin common room; and, others were unnecessarily simplified or melodramatic, e.g., every one of Rupert Grint's scenes had him displaying much more extreme emotions than were warranted---it cheapened the character of Ron Weasley as the enthusiastic side-kick, and made him more like a sissy hanger-on (which was due to be Colin Creevey's lot).  Likewise the editing seemed to lack a concerned director's influence---it was too choppy---most likely due to over-indulgence of the screenwriter's desire to showcase gratuitous special effects (q.v., over-extended scenes noted earlier).<br/><br/>The pace was good, but it lacked the polish of the original feature. Nonetheless, the movie was enjoyable. My rating: ***1/2"
"the5thmarauder","Null","0","0","16 November 2002"," The Chamber of Secrets has been open. Enemy of the Heir beware...
","From one who has read the novels several times, I can easily say that ""Chamber of Secrets"" was my least favorite novel of the four.  However, as movies go ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" has much more for the eye and the ear.<br/><br/>With astounding visual effects, which easily out do it's predecessor ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" and thrill rides with the flying Ford Anglia, Aragog and his family and the Basilik itself are all worth seeing in this blockbuster film.  And did I mention the Quidditch?  Well, let's just say that if the movie makers keep on this path, ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" will rock the world.<br/><br/>Though many scenes from the book were disregarded in the movie, it is well worth the wait in line to see.  The De-gnoming of the garden, the Death Day Party, Ginny's Valentine to Harry, and any mention of ""Percy's Girlfriend"" are forgotten; the film makes up for it with the two new characters who lit up the screen: Gilderoy Lockhart and Lucious Malfoy.<br/><br/>You would have thought that Joanne Rowling had written Lockhart with the idea of Kenneth Branagh.  He took the egocentric maniac and took it to a whole new level.  Though he acted as Hamlet, and in ""Much ado about nothing,"" this is the funniest role he will ever play.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs as Lucious Malfoy was an excellent choice.  He is both sinister and seductive to the camera.  Now that I have seen this movie, which I will see again, I will not be able to read the books without imagining Jason Isaacs as Lucious Malfoy.  He was nothing short of superb.<br/><br/>And what of the other characters?  The original three sure have grown into their roles.  Emma Watson (Hermione) is getting to be quite pretty, and is becoming very dramatic and talented.  Rupert Grint (Ron) was much funnier this time around, even with his voice cracking.  Daniel Radcilffe, however, was by far the best.  You could clearly tell that he was much more comfortable with the role of Harry Potter, and he fit it perfectly.  He is Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Do I have any complaints?  Not really.  Sure there are some things I wished they had heeded to, but it's not a huge loss.  The movie followed the story of the heir of Slytherin perfectly, though there were minor changes.  I guess my biggest complaint is that the digital effects, though spectacular, didn't go to something terribly important: Harry's eyes.<br/><br/>As any ""Potterite"" would know, Harry looks just like his father but ""you have your mother's eyes.""  Well, they are supposed to be bright green like Lily Potter, but they movie makers have decided to ignore that detail, which is sloppy.  Though Radcilffe's eyes are a lovely shade of blue, Harry has green, and the future importance of those eyes is unknown, but we know they are important.  I guess we'll have to add that to the small things that the movie makers wanted to ignore which include Sirius Black not being mentioned in the first movie, and Dumbledore not telling Harry why Snape hates him so much.<br/><br/>But the movie was spectacular.  I give it two thumbs up."

I was thinking these thoughts as the credits started to roll..... and then I realised that we will no longer see Richard Harris in any film or on stage again. I stayed until all the credits had gone, but no dedication (the final reel had proberly already been produced, I normally like most people stand up and walk away when the credits start, but this time I sat there till the very end, much to the annoyance of my friends, but I think we owe it to Richard Harris who disliked Harry Potter but did it wondefully none the less.

Only Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle gave good, solid performances. The worst performance of all was Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle. I've seen her do better and this was just awful.<br/><br/>There was far too much dead air between lines and the pacing was much slower than need be. On top of that, a lot of great scenes were cut, and I'm assuming it was for time, but they could have found that time in the dead air spaces. Or taken out the unnecessary part in the flying car scene where Harry almost falls out, which was not in the book.<br/><br/>On top of all this, there wasn't nearly enough music to keep the scenes going. . .

","Chris Columbus has managed a feat rarely acheived by others - he has made a sequel that is better than the original.  ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" flies out of the starting gate (in a Ford Anglia, no less!) and doesn't stop for its 2 hr 42 minute running time (Peter Jackson, take notes!).  From the opening moments of Harry and the Weasleys in the flying car, to Harry and Malfoy battling in the dueling club (did they make parcel-tongue sound cool or what?!), to Harry's confrontation with Lucious Malfoy (which had the audience I watched the film with cheering!), ""Chamber"" is thrilling, magical, and quite funny - the latter due largely in part to Rupert Grint's comic portrayal of Ron Weasley. In fact, all the kids are great in their roles; Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry with much more bravo and daring than in ""Sorceror's Stone"", and as a result, makes a quite a good action hero.  Emma Watson's character of Hermione Granger is more laid-back this time (though she doesn't really have a whole lot to do - the boys get all the great action scenes!).  And it's quite touching to see the special relationship that exists between Harry, Ron, and Hermione as played by these actors; the characters genuinely care about each other and acknowledge each others strengths.  The only flaw - which existed in the first film too - is that the more humorous scenes in the book are not in the movie (i.e, the scenes at the Borrough, and A LOT of Gildaroy Lockhart's scenes - which leaves Kenneth Branaugh with not much to do either).  But still, the film is a great ride from start to finish - a great job done by all those involved. Kudos!"

"TarasY","9","0","0","16 November 2002"," More than adequate sequel
","""Chamber Of Secrets"" continues pretty much where ""Philosopher's Stone"" left off. Hence we don't get the long character introductions, and are thrown straight into the action. Although not perfectly true to the book in every respect (key lines are transposed from one character to another; key events are lost or misplaced), it's a pretty faithful representation.<br/><br/>The first half an hour is perhaps the least interesting; it seems too fast-paced and action packed, and the story only ""starts"" properly the first morning when Harry is at the Weasleys' house. After this, however, the plot unfolds at a good speed and the magical touches which director Chris Columbus brought to the first episode are still there. Kenneth Brannagh is perhaps the brightest star of this movie, putting many of the other performances to shame with his witty rendition of Gilderoy Lockhart.<br/><br/>Ron is funnier than before, Hermione is bossy as ever and the actors all seem to have grown up and into their roles well. We get a glimpse into the harsh relationship between Draco Malfoy and Lucius Malfoy, his father - a possible hint that Draco's bully attitude stems from his own father's evil. Perhaps the only major let-downs are the parts where the script strays from the book, and some of Daniel Radcliffe's acting appears a bit forced during the final 'Chamber' scene. However, this is what makes films such as ""Harry Potter"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Back To The Future"" etc so watchable and memorable. People don't go to the cinema to watch real life, they go to escape it.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good sequel in a series which looks to be turning darker and asks more fundamental questions with every film.

","May Spoil Somethings, You've Been Warned:<br/><br/>I like most movies I see.  If I don't like them entirely, I can pick out good parts, & I focus on the good stuff, rarely the bad. Book-turned-movies are the major exception.  LOTR wasn't bad, I think it was as good as it could be.  But Harry Potter... I start to question the ability of Chris Columbus to direct when I see this movie.<br/><br/>I went on premiere night (Nov. 15th) and knew in my heart, of course it wouldn't be perfect, but I prayed it'd be significantly better than the horrifyingly disappointing first.  The acting scenes while Harry's at home are sad, even as movies go (not to mention the inaccuracies from the book)... Most lines were completely recited.<br/><br/>Not only do I question Chris Columbus' (director) directing skills, I also notice that I begin to question the actors' as well.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) was reciting his lines.  I understand, he's only 12, I don't expect him to give an Oscar-worthy performance (Though Haley Joel Osment of The 6th Sense happened to at that age..) But Radcliffe doesn't seem to be able to give a heart-felt performance.  He's not the character.  He looks like him, he talks like him, but there's a missing piece which seems to be his lack of acting ability.  He had sparks of genius, where I said ""Yes, he IS Harry Potter.""  But they were little second increments, which made the rest of his acting look worse.<br/><br/>Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) was adorable as always.  She's a great Hermione & she does feel her part, but I think she over-exaggerated most of her lines to the point where she's just annoying.  There was a spark of a true actress in one scene, though the awful directing of Chris Columbus made her movements look overly rehearsed, but she did a relatively good job comparatively.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) was funnier than his first performance.  He kept comic relief, but his acting still was rather amateur.  I've seen school plays with more convincing acting!  His lines & movements were overly rehearsed, and though I hate to admit it, the comical parts where he's ""scared to death"" still seem to be a bit spoken rather than felt, no matter how funny they may have been.<br/><br/>Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) & Richard Harris (R.I.P.) (Headmaster Dumbledore) are both extraordinary actors, but neither of them gave this movie even a fraction of their talent.  Smith recited the majority of her lines & Harris (he was ill during the filming as well, I presume) didn't seem to be in good health throughout the movie, which took away from his character's personality.<br/><br/>Not everything in this movie was bad though, the performances by Jason Issacs (Lucius Malfoy) and Christian Coulson (Tom Riddle) were very felt & never had a disappointing moment.  Even Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) was good, though there was one moment which was rather disappointing.  All three of those actors stayed completely true to their character's personality...<br/><br/>
Mark Williams & Julie Walters (Mr. & Mrs. Weasley) were very good for the parts they played, though Williams wasn't quite what I had imagined for his character (being the obsessed fan of the books that I am)... they both gave convincing performances and kept the ""magic"" alive.<br/><br/>Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) was great in this movie, as he was in the first. He wasn't perfect, but he was one of the acting highlights in this production, that's for sure.    Shirley Henderson (Moaning Myrtle) was perfect as her character, though I can see people who are not familiar with the books taking a dislike to her personality.<br/><br/>The movies lack the magic that the books had, that's for sure.  When I read the books, my imagination would soar to new heights, I'd be dreaming of the future installments, & imagining the characters & scenes with no hesitation or doubt.  The movies came along & sort of destroyed the magical element. I apologize,  but this movie isn't worth seeing more than twice in the cinema. For sure, I'm not paying to see it again until it's out on video/DVD.<br/><br/>As movies go, this was alright, 3 out of 5 stars.  As a book-turned-movie, it's an insult to the writing ability of JK Rowling & I give it 1 star out of 5.  No wait, HALF a star out of five, & I hope that the next one isn't quite as disappointing, since it's got my favourite character in it.<br/><br/>

In all four books Rowling gives sublte hints about what is really going on. Unfortunately some of these subtle hints were cut out.  I'd mentions them, but that would be a spoiler.  However the acting was brilliant.  Daniel Radcliff was born to play Harry.  He has a wonderful, quirky smile. Ruprit Grint was brilliant as Ron.  He had me rolling on the floor.  And Emma Watson is perfect as Hermione.  She is great at keeping the boys in line.

","As a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books I do not feel that this movie did the book justice.  I took my husband to see it, and spent the entire car ride home filling in all of the blanks for him. Once again, Hollywood has taken over and left the story by the wayside.  The exclusion of many characters left the story empty and undeveloped.  Taking away the History of Magic professor, who unwillingly told the story of the Chamber to the students in the book, left that task to Professor McGonagall.  This was totally out of character for her, as she would not want to frighten the students.  By lessening the part of Colin Creevy, and removing the girl who is later found to be Percey's girlfriend in the book, the film leaves out the feeling of the panic felt by the students in the book.  You don't feel their fear and uncertainty.  The film also leaves out Harry's isolation. The majority of the book is Harry's struggle with the whole school that had turned on him, which drives his desperation to find the real heir of Slytherin.  It also shrinks Ginny's part, as well as her crush on Harry. Without including how she was gushing about how wonderful Harry was in the journal, the film offers no explanation of how Tom Riddle grew to hate Harry and want him dead.  In the movie, Tom Riddle says that he took the name Voldermort because he would not keep his Muggle father's name.  That leaves the audience wondering how he could then be the heir of Slytherin.  It leaves out that Slytherin was from his mother's side and that his father left her when he found out that she was a witch.  But I must say the absolute most annoying part of the movie was the final scene, which had no part in the book where Hagrid returned and the entire room applauded.  It might have had more meaning had they bothered to include how half the school thought he was guilty, but either was it was pure Hollywood.  I do realize that in any film adaptation of a book things need to be left out, and I was even glad that many of the Lockhart scenes were excluded.  I just think that the overall story needs to be upheld so that the film can at least be understood for those who haven't read the book. All that aside, I still enjoyed watching the movie simply because I enjoy the characters so much.  For those of you who have not read the books, please to not judge them based on these movies.  Justice was not served."

","I saw this film at the first available public filming this morning at 10:00 am. I just had to be the first one there because I was so excited. I knew it was going to be awesome. Well, it lived up to my expectations. It was defiantly my favorite movie. And not just of the two, but of all of the movies I have seen. And I have seen a lot of movies. I think that the special effects were better, as everyone has said. And I think that the characters were more intense, as well as the scenes. As was the dialogue. It follows along with the book very well. It doesn't actually change anything, it just leaves some things out. I thought it was scarier and it made me cringe, you'll see when you see it. If your are a Danny fan, as I am you will love it, although, he does rub hermione's hand and hermione gives him a hug anyway, it's great I love it, you should see it , take you friends and you family, gosh it's great!"
"MoonRaven","Null","0","0","15 November 2002"," Okay...nothing great...
","This makes me wonder what all the fuss is about, I have only read the first book, the first movie was less then steller. Okay, what Rowling did to create Harry Potter, take Scooby Doo or Nacy Drew for that matter, some bad guys from Mythology and other creatures that have been done a million times before and plug it into a semi-gothic wizard school and you have Harry Potter. The storyline is beyond predictable, well it is ment for children. The first 30 minutes are great, but then after that it drags, on and on and on and on and on. Seemingly for no real reason, this is the type of stuff that would work as a saturday morning cartoon. Harry is a BORING main character, Ron is okay, Hermonie (or however you spell her name) is just down right annoying. But there is not one orignal idea in this movie, not one, yah see most fantasy novels have at least one thing unique to it, (LOTR has Hobbits, InuYasha has well InuYasha , and Spirited Away had Aku and a Spirit Bath house with many crazy looking creatures) What does Harry Potter have? A bunch of characters you have seen time and time again in hundreds of other things. Although cute, cut it down about one hour and it might be worth watching. The storyline is empty without depth or a focused end, it just plods along. The storyline is also WAY to dark for some younger children and to plotless for many adults.<br/><br/>Bottomline: Wait for $1 seat or better video, it's not worth it."

","COS is definitely a better (slight) improvement over Sorcerer's stone, with more action, magic and spells. It is uniformly entertaining but the tension (if any) is monotonous all throughout. With a film this long, we expect a rewarding climax, although such is not a requisite for a good movie. Fast-paced, so almost boredom-free. Wisley's expressions are sometimes over-acting already. Some lines are unnecessary and felt stupid. Still largely a kiddy movie. The CGI are hi-tech (but not flawless) but they feel forced, exagerrated, amplified, worst, done without passion. Overall still, this is a must-see movie. There is still heartful magic that's why. My score: 3/4 stars (good)"
"tomcon22","Null","0","0","15 November 2002"," Slitherndiesldorfer baloney
","I must be one of the few people left who cannot (and will not at this point) swallow this Harry Potter nonsense. Both the first movie and the sequel are boring, uninteresting drivel. What eats away at me is the whole style and lingo surrounding this blockbuster baloney:<br/><br/>The goofy names (dorferwhositsslitherner) of everyone and everything are repeated over and over throughout the movie, but mean absolutely nothing to me. Most of these words have little to do with the actual plot (plot, you say?) of the film, but are thrown in the audience's face time after time, as though doing this may trick viewers into thinking this garbage has some degree of creativity or sophistication. Not so.<br/><br/>Also, the overall goofiness of characters (adults, children, and the like) really made me want to lose my popcorn all over the giddy adult men in front of me. The Weasley character constantly has that goofy, ""duh"" look on his face that made me want to throw random objects at the screen. In general, the characters are paper-thin, 2 dimensional plot-forwarding (there's that word again) vehicles. In conclusion, plot and characters were just a weak excuse for some elaborate visual effects and scenery, which were impressive at times.<br/><br/>When I share this viewpoint with others, they reply, ""Well, you really should read the books...."" A movie should stand on its own as a well-made, effective work whether or not it is based on a book. I'm sure the film company intends this film to reach even a larger audience than fans of the books. Didn't reach this viewer."

When I went to see ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", I was wondering if it was going to be as good.<br/><br/>If any of you havn't seen this movie yet and you liked the first one, you won't be dissapointed.  This is just as good, if not better, than the first. Just like the first, it was pretty faithful to the book (it can't be exact because then it would be 4 hours long, which I wouldn't mind).  Infact, it was probably more faithful.  The special effects are awsome and of course, the quidditch (spelling?) is the best part of the movie.  Yes, it is darker and a little scarier than the first (especially if you have archnophobia), but Ron (Rupert Grint) always comes through with the best lines.  And the actor who played professor Lockhart (can't remember the name at the moment) was brilliant.  Nobody could have played him better.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, the acting was good (you could tell that the kids had improved from the first movie), the story was good, it was funny and a little scary (the spiders are freaky in this movie), but in the end, this has got to be one of the best movies i've ever seen.  I gotta go see it again."

"divaclv","Null","0","0","15 November 2002"," Second time's a charm
","Yes, Virginia, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a better film than its predecessor, even if it still isn't perfect.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the second book in JK Rowling's modern mythology is sometimes considered the least (one hesitates to use the word ""worst"" in reference to the author's work) of the series, yet it makes for a more satisfying film. Perhaps this is because all the introductions are now out of the way--we know who the players are, we know the backstory, we know how Quidditch works. All we have to do is sit back and enjoy the show. The story--centering around an evil presence that's literally freezing students in their tracks--you either already know, don't care to know, or don't want me to spoil it for you. So let's get on with the assessment.<br/><br/>The two things ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" excelled at were the cast and the visual style, and the sequel follows suit. The triumvirate of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continue to embody Harry, Ron, and Hermione wonderfully and without some of their previous awkwardness. The returning adults--especially regal Maggie Smith, perpetually sinister Alan Rickman, and the sagacious Richard Harris in his final bow--repeat their excellent performances, and are joined by a host of new talent. Kenneth Branagh is dead-on as the vain and perpetually poncy Gilderoy Lockheart. Jason Isaacs, with a mane of Aryan-blonde hair, snake's-head cane, and a wellspring of casual cruelty, seethes malice as the father of Harry's schoolyard rival. Miriam Margolyes and Gemma Jones have nice cameos as Hogwarts' eccentric-looking Herbology teacher and no-nonsense nurse, respectively. Shirley Henderson, in a foray outside her natural age range, has some excellent moments as Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who haunts the girl's restroom, trapped perpetually in adolescent awkwardness (no wonder she's miserable). Mark Williams and Julie Walters are good in too-brief roles as Ron's parents. Hogwarts itself retains the marvelously rich look of a book illustration brought to vivid life, captivating to the eyes and imagination. Key among the new sights are a garden of squalling mandrake plants and Dumbledore's pet, a phoenix that might have stepped out of a Brian Froud collection.<br/><br/>The keystone sequences and effects, on the whole, exceed the first film in terms of power and energy. The Quidditch match is ramped to fever pitch, with a chase that recalls ""Star Wars'"" dogfight through the Death Star's trenches. A scene in the Forbidden Forest will be sure to have arachnaphobes cringing in their seats. A journey to Hogwarts' past, shot in atmospheric sepia tones, is carried off highly effectively, and the climax works well on the whole.<br/><br/>With a plot containing strong currents of prejudice, genocide, suspicion, and self-doubt, as well as some subtle character moments, Steven Kloves and Christopher Columbus have come much closer in ""Chamber of Secrets"" to catching the nuances of Rowling's writing. Yet that ultimate goal, like Quidditch's Golden Snitch, continues to dart out of their grasp. Despite the two-and-a-half-hour-plus length, it feels like we never have enough time to enjoy all the marvelous sights and characters this movie provides. The opening and a sequence at Ron's home feel rushed, and some elements to the central mystery are glossed over. But if this film can enchant--and it does--with only a fraction of the source material's strength, it only goes to show how potent Harry Potter's magic really is.<br/><br/>PS--Stay through the credits. Trust me."

","The film was fantastic!  The kids have really come into their own and are truly actors.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) give us a blockbuster performance.  They are not just good because they are kids, but they give true performances.  This film has much more special effects, done extremely well compared to the first film. This makes the Quidditch match even more entertaining and realistic.  It takes the film to an entirely different level. The film once again is 2:30, however, it felt MUCH MUCH shorter than that.  If you have not read the second book, please be aware that the storyline does become darker, scarier if you wish.  If you have never read or seen the first movie/book, I highly recommend that you do so, as this film jumps right into the action, and you have very little history of the characters.

","Well with all of the positive reviews of this film abound, it's nice to see that I'm not alone in thinking this movie is weak, lame and predictable. Sure, I haven't read any of the books. And now that I have watched both of the Potter films, I can be absolutely sure that I will not waste any more time on such a crap series. Really people, does this movie need to be 2 hours and 40 minutes? I think not.... I'd rather do my laundry by hand...<br/><br/>Once again, the desire to make $$$ results in a sequel that needs to rehash all of the same boring details from the first movie.... As if we're all to dumb to remember what happened a year ago, this is one of those sequels that has to ask us, ""Hey, remember this from the first movie? Well here it is again."" Instead of trying to entice us with new cool ideas, the CHAMBER OF SECRETS treats the audience like a bunch of cucumber-brained dolts who can't handle a developed story with interesting characters... Is there one character from either of these flicks that is remotely likeable? Surely not the stupid troll Dobie or whatever it's name is, introduced to make audiences cringe like the horror of another CGI annoyance Jar Jar Binks. Kenneth Branagh is also added to the mix as a vain professor with no brass, and that should have been enough to keep me away, but for some reason I kept watching. And Robbie Coltrane should not have been given another job after making that POPE MUST DIE movie in the mid 90s... Poor Richard Harris though. It's a shame that such an accomplished actor had to die with this film being his last effort. I would have much rather seen him as English Bob again in an UNFORGIVEN sequel.<br/><br/>Sure this is ultimately a kids movie. I understand that, but why treat today's kids like dingbats? Why can the two BABE films be enjoyable for adults and kids, but these POTTER flicks stink like yesterday's diapers...  And talk about unnecessarily long... The two movies together add up to be slightly over 5 hours.... Now wouldn't one think that within 5 hours of footage, some of it would be entertaining? Just like the new STAR WARS prequels, it's all about lame effects and bad acting.... Why get good actors when the SPFX are of low caliber as well? I guess I miss the good old days when monsters and creatures were made of latex & makeup, and obviously in the scene being shot. Whereas nowadays, actors are required to react to a blue screen or a piece of cardboard.<br/><br/>Well I guess I got what I deserve. It's a good thing that well-crafted films are still in the theaters now, like PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, RULES OF ATTRACTION, ROGER DODGER and AUTO FOCUS, otherwise we'd be in a sad state of affairs.... I mean c'mon, the only good film Chris Columbus has been associated with was GOONIES, and that was about 18 years ago....<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you want to be aggravated by bad acting, lame story developments and half-a**ed SPFX, see this movie. If you want to watch a film with some heart, go rent the DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS. I'm outta here..."

Rupert Grint's (ron) voice what changing through the film and I can tell he had quite a bit of trouble with some lines (especially where asked to show fear).  Emma Watson's (hermione) hair has turned back to her natural dirty blonde state...with more of a perm than before.  Her acting skills have greatly increased, but I think she overdid it a lot.  In several scenes there were tears in her eyes...some where they would be unexpected. Richard Harris did an EXCELLENT job in his last performance as Albus Dumbledore (Rest his soul).<br/><br/>Alan Rickman(Prof. Severus Snape), however, was less scary and poised and more freaking out, unorganized and less certain with himself.

","As a true fan of all of the Harry Potter novels I must admit CoS was my least favorite novel. But as the director Chris Columbus said in an article earlier( cant rememeber which one) this movie was a lot better than the first. And i must completely agree with him. It had it all comedy, drama, even a foreshadow of Romance ( you'll see what i mean) and a lot of Action. In some ways it was better than the book because annoying characters were very humoruosly shown and in a lot of ways that helped the movie. The only problem i had with it is the same problem i had with the first one, the storyline is a little choppy. Nonetheless Chris Columbus makes up for it by stretching his wings and adding to the movie a bit of his own flair, which it did need some of. My only caution is that parents when you take your kids to see it be VERY careful. It was given a PG rating but there were a few scenes that definently qualify in the PG-13 category.  Still the movie was very cool. And a lot more believable i mean the special affects were so much better in this one. I would totally recommend it. it was much better than the first one i know that i am definently buying this DVD."

I'm just chucking it out as a warning.<br/><br/>The acting was a lot less wooden this time around, not that the first movie was really that bad.<br/><br/>Everyone was a lot more relaxed.  And it paid off.  Especially in the copious amounts of physical comedy.<br/><br/>The scenes within the Chamber of Secrets had everyone, myself included, jumping up out of their seats.  So it might be just a little intense for younger viewers.  However, in no way was even mild gore in evidence during the movie.<br/><br/>As I noted, there's a lot more physical comedy this time around.  Lots of sight gags, falls, and a fairly wide range of fearful expressions on Rupert (Ron) Grint's face keep the film a lot lighter, even during some fairly tense scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film.  I paid full price to get in and consider every penny well spent.  I'd even pay full price to go see it again.<br/><br/>One note to parents: Take the kids to the bathroom right before the film starts.  At nearly 3 hours long, it's a long sit.

"Brogan","10","0","0","15 November 2002"," Again, there's magic in this film.
","Geeze, it was just last year I was raving about the most hyped film of last year, HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERERS STONE.  I loved how well done it was protrayed from the J.K. Rowling best seller, the actors, sets, costumes, etc.  I thought Daniel Radcliffe, was excellent as Harry Potter, as well as Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermoine Granger.  Now, 364 days later, I experience more magic again in the follow-up sequel, HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS. This time, unlike the original, the film begins right into the plot. Where the original introduced viewers to characters, locations, magic items and history.  Think of it like, uh... LETHAL WEAPON 2, it begins right into the action, which CHAMBER OF SECRETS does as well. It's been three months since Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) left Hogwarts for summer vacation, and it hasn't been a fun summer since Harry is living at Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and rude cousin Dudley (Harry Melling).  But Harry wonders why haven't any of his friends from Hogwarts (particulary Ron and Hermoine) haven't written to him.  Then Harry meets Dobby, a house elf who warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts.  Harry ignores Dobby, since Hogwarts is a million times nicer than his realitives. But this year attending at Hogwarts there are some faces introduced. First is Lucius Malfoy (that wonderful character actor Jason Isaacs) the cruel and vicious father of Harry's rival Draco Malfoy.  Then there's Professor Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) who smiles proudly and is the most vain person you could ever see.  But this year at Hogwarts (and why does this happen when Harry attends school there?) there is evil lurking about that turns some students petrified and messages written in blood on the wall warning about ""the Chamber of Secrets."" Like I said, I highly loved the orignal film, THE SORCERER'S STONE, and how does this one come up to par?  This is another winner!  I enjoyed this film just as much, if not more than the original.  But then again, I've read the first two books of Harry Potter, and I enjoyed CHAMBER OF SECRETS more than SORCERER'S STONE. Why is this film better? First, the film goes right into the action, I understand the original had to introduce the world to the story, and that was fine.  Yet this film goes right into the action and begins telling us what is going on.  Like the STAR WARS, GODFATHER, and BACK TO THE FUTURE films, it assumes that we did see the first film (and who didn't?).  Second, I always thought the action was more exciting and intense in CHAMBER OF SECRETS, and in this film it shows.  Third, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson all fit into their character roles so fine and well, that we are now acceppting them as Harry, Ron, and Harmione, just like we accept Harrison Ford as Han Solo, or Al Pacino as Michael Corlone.  It's just that this time around, all three young actors seem more relaxed and calm about playing their roles, and I don't blame them.  Plus the same goes for the other actors who are returning to this film.  Finally, it's more darker, complex, and exciting than the original. With HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, the Potter films are becomming to be a series worthy of being placed with other great series like STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES.  This film running about twenty minutes longer than the original, goes just as fast, if not faster than the original. Proof:  I didn't have to go to the bathroom, I stuck it out through out all of the film. Sadly, this film isn't getting the hype like the original.  I'm guessing that the press is tired of hyping up the Potter films and figures that it's going to be a hit. Then there are those people who feel like STAR WARS, ""you've seen one, you've seen them all.""  Well, I'm hoping that word gets around and people realize that like the books, the Potter films are getting better as Harry gets older.  I guess you can say that Harry Potter is indeed like fine wine and ages well with it.  This film should do more business than the original, but not even the superior EMPIRE STRIKES BACK couldn't make more money than STAR WARS (A NEW HOPE to the Jedi fanatics).<br/><br/>All I can say is that the later part of 2001 is returning again with the success of another HARRY POTTER film.  And I know it will return next month with LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS.  It's a pity that we are going to have to wait for two years for HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONERS OF AZKABAN. It's also a pity that we won't experience the wonderful Richard Harris playing Professor Albus Dumbledore again.  But hopefully the wait will pay off since I thought PRISONERS OF AZKABAN was much better than CHAMBER OF SECRETS (here's wishing Alfonso Cuaron the best of luck!)<br/><br/>But as for the films out right now, CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a excellent film.  Is it for the entire family?  Maybe, it depends.  If the kids didn't get scared from the first one, or from reading or listening to the book, then it would be a great film for them.  It helps build the imagination. If the kids might get scared, then SANTA CLAUSE 2 is a very nice alternate, NOT 8 MILE, which some parents seem to think it is. All in all, Harry's second year at Hogwarts is a successful one.  And hopefully it proves that the Harry Potter films aren't going to be a overrun franchise like the BATMAN or STAR TREK films.  Harry Potter now belongs in the dignified series.  Don't miss it!  ***** (out of five)"

","I am a harry potter fan, but I prefer Lord of the Rings. I found this movie was far better then the first. While still dry, and boring during a few parts, it was no wear as bad as the first, which had me wondering when it was going to end.<br/><br/>The Acting was very well done, and Rupert Gint as Ron did one of the best acting jobs all year. I'm still waiting for Radcliffe to get a bit more livelier though. Hopefully for PoA he'll realize how he's supposed to act. Watson did a superb job, and this time around she didn't look like she was waiting to say her lines.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give it a 9/10. It had a few ""boring"" parts, and Radcliffe brought down the acting quality. Still waiting for the two towers though. Like bluesbro, that is the real fantasy movie of the year."
"MySilentReverie","10","0","0","17 November 2002"," One of the Best Book/ Movie Series(My Second Review)
","I know that I have already done a review of this film but I just can't say enough good things about it.  Usually sequels are not as good as the first movie but Chamber of Secrets went beyond the magic of the first film.  When the Harry Potter books first came out I didn't even know anything about them.  I finally started reading them last Thanksgiving and I was immediately hooked.  They are so great and J. K. Rowling has such a great imagination.  I think that my favorite scene from the movie was the one in the forest with Aragog and Lockhart was so funny but really cheesy also.  I think that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have all grown in their acting abilities and they were fantastic, especially when Emma Watson had to act very emotional after she had been called a mudblood by Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton).  I must say that the 2 hour and 41 minutes length scared me a bit, I thought for sure I would have to get up in the middle to use the restroom.  But it seemed to go by so fast.  I was just sitting there watching it and my mom says we only have 40 more minutes to watch and it was such a surprise to me because I thought for sure we had a longer time than that.  It was like going to see a movie that was 2 hours and 41 minutes long but it only seemed like it was a hour and a  half.  That's just my opinion though.  What really surprised me was the amount of adults that were there, I thought for sure that I would be the only 18 year old there but there were a lot of teenagers and a lot of older people also.  Now that I have seen Chamber of Secrets I am really anticipating the release of The Prisoner of Azkaban.  This is my favorite book from the series right now and even though Chris Columbus isn't going to be a director I still think that it will be a great movie.  I hope that the actors stay on for the films because I don't believe that it will be the same without Emma, Daniel, and Rupert.  Well I hope that you all loved the movie as much as me. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 10.  Perfect, A++++++."

","Having recently re-read the book prior to viewing the film, I won't bore anyone with listing the changes or omissions, most of them made sense and worked with the flow of the story. I enjoyed the book version of ""Chamber of Secrets"" more than the book version of the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" so I went to the theater expecting quite a bit. The first film exceeded my expectations and, again, this raised my level of expectations for the second film. Richard Harris, Kenneth Branagh, and Daniel Radcliffe are all quite good and although the direction is brisk and involving some of the editing is not quite as crisp as ""Sorcerer's Stone"". The Quidittch match is great and there are no distractions in the form of obvious computer generated characters. Doby, the house elf, is one of the better CGI characters I have yet seen. Is it perfect? I think the story is just too involved for a 2 hour kids film. There are a few layers of complexity and depth that simply work as literature and don't quite translate to the medium. !SPOILER!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
It is nice to see Hagrid get some accolades since he is never publicly recognized in the book."

","The craziest s--t happened when I went to see Harry Potter!<br/><br/>After an hour or so of enjoying the movie the power went out in the entire theater. We were left in complete darkness! Well, EVERYONE in the entire theater obviously went to get their refund. So the lines were huge and it took me 40 minutes to get my refund and after I got my money back I went to McDonalds and with the same money I had to pay for the movie I used it on the McDonalds. So in conclusion with the same 20 dollar bill I not only saw 1 hour of the Harry Potter movie but I bought McDonalds as well!<br/><br/>
Crazy I tell ya! And I'm sure that Doody is behind all this!<br/><br/>Anyway, from my one hour observation I must say Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a lot better then the original because unlike the original it doesn't spend too much time explaining stuff and it gets right to the adventure."

","A flawless translation of terrific source material to the big screen -- a joy to watch. Just enough better than the first movie to seem just as good.<br/><br/>It is almost as faithful to the book as the first movie, but adds a few bits of cinematographic magic, because it can. The actors are all terrific -- especially the one who is no longer on this world to complete the series. However, the show must go on. This movie made me look forward to the next five movies (and three upcoming books).<br/><br/>If you liked the first movie, or the second book, go see this film. If you like beautifully crafted, visually appealing family fun with a great musical score, go see this film. If you want a film that will entertain both you and your children for more than two and a half hours, you're kidding yourself if you think they're going to sit through ""Lord of the Rings."" See this instead. Again and again. They'll probably even ask for it.<br/><br/>Not recommended for Muggles who refuse to be absorbed in the Harry Potter universe of magic. If you didn't like the first film, then you probably won't like this one either. If you're anti-Harry-Potter phenomenon, you've already made up your mind to dislike this film, so don't waste your $10. Go see ""Jackass"" instead. Might be on your level.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a great family movie that deserves to be on the shelf right next to ""E.T."" and ""Mary Poppins,"" just like its predecessor."

","While I liked the first Harry Potter movie OK, I didn't love it, mostly due to the slow pacing.  This movie kept all the charm from the first one, but stepped up the action and suspense considerably.  <br/><br/>The faster pace kept me involved from start to finish, and there was more than one moment where I found myself cringing (think hundreds of giant spiders and one bigass snake).<br/><br/>While I'd leave the under-5 crowd at home (the guy next to us brought his kiddie and blabbed the whole time to keep the little guy from getting too scared), this movie lived up to its hype, so gets my recommendation."

This is probably the last of the Harry Potter films I will personally see, because there is tremendous pressure on Chris Columbus and the rest of the team to continually outdo the previous films.

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a competent piece of diversion for adults and children alike, but it fails to transcend the medium.  While slick and well-made, there is still something forced about the whole endeavor, in terms of the acting, pacing and some of the visual effects. Daniel Radcliffe is noticeably more comfortable with his role than he was in the first film, which does aid in connecting with the character, but I still find it difficult to be transported into the events of the movie.  In other words, the performances failed to engage me.  However, I was impressed that the film reflected the dark tone of the book, which could have been very easily glossed over by the studio who hopes to profit.  The action sequences are appropriately intense, and the portion in the Dark Forest admittedly scared me to death.  The effectiveness of this and other portions of the film made it a more enjoyable experience than the first.  Despite all that, many of the problems in the Philosopher's Stone persist, holding what could have been an amazing adventure film back, and simply making it a decent piece of entertainment."
"Spellvexit","8","0","0","17 November 2002"," Chamber of Secrets should disappoint only the purists
","The Harry Potter movie franchise, in my opinion, still remains dedicatedly true to the vision of the books.  There were omissions and a few plot points felt a bit rushed, but as the books get larger and larger, it will be all but impossible to retain every detail of the original.  That said, I think the second installment of Harry Potter was just as fun as the first.<br/><br/>Although I am irritated by Kenneth Branaugh as an actor in serious movies, he always does a fantastic job in films that require over-the-top acting, like Much Ado About Nothing, and this movie was no exception.  He was hilarious as the pretty boy of wizardry, and it was almost impossible for me not to chuckle whenever he appeared onscreen.  He was a brilliant choice!<br/><br/>Like many have said, the movie is darker than the first, and it's only going to get darker: books 3 and 4 get scarier and closer to death than the first two ever did.  It's not a fault of the movie that it was darker, but the ending was an odd contrast to the lighthearted beginning, and to be honest, I enjoyed the first half of the movie a bit more because of its innocence (not to mention the clumsy owl!).<br/><br/>The movie didn't seem to focus much on the characters as much as the first, but that's because it expected its audience to have seen the first; not to mention the fact that it just didn't have the time to develop them.  I missed the snapshots of daily school life that are often provided in loving detail in the book.<br/><br/>The quidditch scenes were really cool this time around!  The transitions between the CGI and the real actors were much better this time around, and I can't remember a single scene from it that was blatantly computer-generated. The animatronic phoenix was a bit cheezy, though. <br/><br/>All in all, I think the second Harry Potter is just as good as the first. Unless you're fastidiously zealous about the details, you're 99% guaranteed to like this one if you liked the book."
"prezike","6","0","0","16 November 2002"," Mediocre showing that won't deter its popularity
","The Harry Potter book series is clearly a pop culture phenomenon, as Ms. Rawling's novels strike at the heart of every child's dream both young and old.  But also a crowning example of popular cultural is Hollywood's effort to bring films to the silver screen, where quality becomes practically irrelevant, due to the powerful force of consumerism in today's society.<br/><br/>'The Chamber of Secrets"" isn't a terrible film by an means, but director, Chris Columbus, in classic big budget Hollywood fashion, is catering to the lowest common denomenator far too often.  Being a fan of the books, I was more excited about the second film because I thought 'Chamber of Secrets' was a far more thrilling and dark novel compared to the carefree 'Sorcerer's Stone.'  But the producers and Mr. Columbus decided to overemphasize everything to the point of ruining the very thrill I recieved from the novel.<br/><br/>The most obvious flaw was several instances of over-acting on the parts of many characters, which seemed forced and unceessary.  But, we are all so stupid, I suppose, that the film makers had to outline every single moment where something dramatic was happening so obvious that only completely mind dead individuals would not get what the intended mood was to be.<br/><br/>There were moments, I admit, where the film had some pizzaz and a few of the actors were either defying Mr. Columbus' apparent request to over act, or were the few characters who he wanted to come across as a bit more subtle. The effects were pretty good as well, but sometimes also too over the top. My real problem was that the book was very thrilling and this movie only had moments where you felt that way.  <br/><br/>But, as I noted earlier, if you read the book or somehow think you ""have to see it"" for whatever reason, you will go, and no one can stop you.  Go.  Try and enjoy it...I wish you much luck.  Maybe keeping your expecations lower will help....may be."

","Released November 15th, 2002<br/><br/>Director: Chris Columbus<br/><br/>Starring: Daniel Radcliffe, Sean Biggerstaff, David Bradley, Kenneth Branagh, Alfred Burke, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Alfie Enoch, Tom Felton, Julian Glover, Rupert Grint, Richard Griffiths, Richard Harris, Shirley Henderson, Joshua Herdman, Jason Isaacs, Gemma Jones, Toby Jones, Matt Lewis, Miriam Margolyes, Rik Mayall, Hugh Mitchell, Sally Mortemore, Devon Murray, Katharine Nicholson, Edward Randell, Chris Rankin, Alan Rickman, Fiona Shaw, Maggie Smith, Ed Tudor-Pole, Julie Walters, Emma Watson, Jamie Waylett, Mark Williams<br/><br/>Premise: Harry Potter (Radcliffe) has not had a good summer. Not only has he had to put up with his overbearing Aunt Petunia (Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Griffiths) and their dread of his magical abilities, but it seems as if Harry's best friends Ron Weasley (Grint) and Hermione Granger (Watson) have forgotten him Â as they haven't replied to a single one of his letters. Then, suddenly and mysteriously, house-elf Dobby appears in Harry's bedroom and warns of great danger if the aspiring wizard should attempt to return to Hogwarts. But Harry is not about to let his friends down and, with or without the support of Gilderoy Lockhart, he will confront the dark force lurking in his beloved school.   The magical world of Harry Potter and his friends is revisited with the second film in the series. The original film, Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone, was met with a huge response. The film broke every record the box office held. Those record have since been broken by the release of Spider-Man but The Chamber of Secrets could offer a threat to the famous web slinger. The Chamber of Secrets is much different in that it is much darker then original which could alienate some of the key audience for the film. Will Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets follow in the steps of its predecessor or will it show that the original was just a mere fluke and change is not good for the series?<br/><br/>The story goes that Harry Potter has finally returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after the long break, though not without much difficulty. Apparently a house elf named Dobby has reason to belive that great danger will fall upon Mr. Potter if he returns. When Harry does return, many strange things begin to happen. Harry hears voices in the halls, people are found petrafied and the rumored Chamber of Secrets has apparently been opened. This means big trouble for the children of mudbloods or those who have no parents of wizard/witch blood. It is up to Harry and his group of friends to protect Hogwarts from impending danger within the school itself. The story of The Chamber of Secrets is the best that has been presented in a film intended for children in quite awhile. The plot keeps the audience interested in every aspect of the movie and keeps them guessing at what is to come next.<br/><br/>The acting within the film was much better then in Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone. Those actors and actresses are much comfortable with their characters and that is quite evident within the film. Daniel Radcliffe is once again great as the lead character, Harry Potter. He showcases a broad range of emotions within the film which is rarely seen in a film intended for children. Richard Harris is fabulous in his last starring role as Professor Dumbledore. This is the perfect role for a legendary actor to go off on and Richard Harris does so with great flare and style. The only problem was the character of Rondald Weasley. There was no problem with the one who played him but the character itself. In the original film he was sort of mixed character but he has now been reduced to a comedic character, which is quite disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best films of the year. The magical world of Harry Potter is brought back better then ever. Though the film was filled with much darker moments then the original, those moments made the film altogether better, They brought much more excitement to the film and made the audience feel more connected with characters and what happened to them. The story keeps the audience guessing at what is going to happen next though there were thought to be too many scares for the younger audience. Though the film is near perfection, there are flaws to it. The running time of the film which was two hours and forty minutes long seemed much too long for a film intended for children though it did help better tell the story. And the CGI character to add on the most annoying list is Dobby the house elf. He seemed fine for the plot of the film but for the most part, he was too annoying and distracting for the purpose of the story. Other then those small squabbles, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best films of the year and raises the bar for films intended for children. The film is fabulous for all ages and is a must for those who don't visit the movie theater often. One of the few films out there that actually rises above that of the original film.<br/><br/>My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5"

","It's back to school for students of Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and that means more mystery, more danger, and more adventures for our magical trio; Hermione Granger, Ron Weasly, and of course the famous Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The first movie in this series, Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone (or Sorcerer's Stone, depending on where you lived) had to meet the expectation of millions of fans (children and adults alike) of the J.K. Rowling's books. And live up to them it did. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets now has even more to live up to based on the success of the first movie, as well as the book it is based upon.  And it delivers, just as much, if not more than the first.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets begins in much the same place we originally found HarryÂ at the Dursley's residence, just before Harry's birthday.  Without surprise, the Dursley's have no sympathy -- nor respect for Harry.  He has, however, upgraded from the cupboard under the stairs to his own bedroom (formerly Dudley's 2nd bedroom), and is anxiously awaiting his return to Hogwart's.  <br/><br/>However, someone is trying to prevent him from going backÂ that someone is Dobby the House Elf (who serves another wizardry-family, and who by now you've seen in the trailer for the film).  Regardless, a Harry Potter story just wouldn't be the same without a trip to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>You may remember that last semester saw the leave of the Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell.  This year a rather conceited Kenneth Branagh (as Gilderoy Lockhart) has replaced him.  And we have the pleasure (and I use the term loosely) to meet Lucius Malfoy, the father of the Slitherin nemesis of Harry, Draco Malfoy.  There are a few more additions to the cast, as well the rest of the students and staff of Hogwarts are all present and account for this year.<br/><br/>Like any good sequel, certain events should remind us of the first story, when it is necessary, and without running into a constant re-telling of the previous story.  It accomplishes this feat VERY well, and tells it's own unique story with absolute perfection.  We also get to learn a little bit more about the history of the wizardry community, a little more about Hagrid's past, and a little bit about Hogwarts past.  <br/><br/>Joanne Rowling has a knack for writing a compelling story full of wonder, adventure and mysteryÂ and it's one thing to be able to inspire a thought or idea and create imaginationsÂ but for Chris Columbus to be able to feed the scribe new life and create a living, breathing image, is exceptional. <br/><br/>
When I saw the first film last year, I immediately was compelled to read the book, and see how accurate the conversion to film really was.  I found it to be quite accurateÂ perhaps the most accurate book to film conversion I have seen.  (I was sorely disappointed when it wasn't even NOMINATED for the adapted screenplay Oscar.)<br/><br/>I have yet to complete Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in book form, but I am mostly expecting a good translation from book to film yet again, based on the content and imagery I saw on screen, and comparing it to the experience I had with the first film.<br/><br/>[Aside: Keep in mind, that my first love is film.  More times than not, my reading of the book before seeing the film has left me hating an otherwise good film.  I'd prefer to enjoy the film and it's instant satisfactions, and THEN enhance that experience by reading the book.]<br/><br/>I had, however, read about a quarter of The Chamber of Secrets before going to see the film, and what I read was VERY accurate on-screen.<br/><br/>The visual effects are very well done, including the completely computer-generated character, Dobby the house Elf.  As well as all the mystical and magical creatures that one might expect to find at a school like Hogwarts. The completeness of this environment and the detailing are incredible.  Nothing in this world seems out of place.  Everything fits perfectly, and lends the realism and authenticity that is missing from many films.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a truly immersing experience, even more so, I found, than the first film.  There is a sensation that you are right there at Hogwarts with Harry, discovering the clues, uncovering the mysteries, and experiencing all the magic that is to be found in a Harry Potter story.<br/><br/>This only being the second in the series (that promises to be seven in all) it is clear to see that this film franchise promises big things in its future.  The stories are full of wonder, wit, charm, and gripping plot lines that certainly deliver, will keep you satisfied, and leave you eagerly anticipating the next installment.  <br/><br/>I'm likely going to take a lot of flack for this next comment, but I dare say that this collection of films promises to be bigger and more successful than the Star Wars franchise.  Not that I don't love the Star Wars films, but the Harry Potter films are truly sensational and pure genius story telling and movie making.<br/><br/>If you saw the first film and loved it (and why wouldn't you?) Â I highly recommend seeing Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.  If you haven't see the first filmÂ then by all means, rent it, and then go see this one.

","Like all HP fans, Ive been waiting for a year for the second live version of 7 set movies. I liked it, and yet, I didnt find it as appealing as the first. To me they seemed to rush through it, to try to finish it in time for a 2002 release. The film quality seemed different as well. The teachers didnt seem to have many scenes either. Snape, for example was not seen as nearly as enough as the last time, on the other hand Argus Filch had a little more airtime than in the last movie, however certain facts about him from the book was left out entirely.<br/><br/>And once again, in the so called wisdom of Chris Columbus, Peeves the poltergeist was left out again. He was even listed in the credits as played by an actual actor.  As was the librarian Irma Pince, also credited as an actress.<br/><br/>Richard Harris, as Dumbledore was noticeably ill, from the second half on. Im glad he had the courage to finish the movie. I hope they find a suitable replacement for the third movie, though no one can ever replace such a perfect model for Dumbledore.<br/><br/>As for Lucius Malfoy, I liked the character. They picked a good actor for the part. It will be interesting who will play the ultimate villain in movie number 4."
"frodofan00","10","0","0","15 November 2002"," My uneducated and dreadfully dull take on this wonderful film...
","Wow...all I can say is: totally worth the two hour wait. I compared this to ""The Lord of the Rings"" (aka. The Lord of the Films). There are very much alike in the sense that the first film is much, much lighter, but not without peril and exitement. The next film is darker (As will be ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers""), creepier, and scarier. In COS, the school's future is basically resting on Harry's shoulders. If he fails: the school is doomed. However, if he succeeds: Well, the school is saved.<br/><br/> The special FX were awesome, though I thought some of the images would have been extremely frightening to some of the younger viewers (how wrong I was). The casting was great, and the overall message throughout the film was crystal clear. I rated this an 8, but I think I'd bump it up to a 9.<br/><br/> What a great film, and God bless Richard Harris. I hope he's gazing down at all the people lined up a mile and a half from the theatre right now, with that wonderful smile stretched from ear to ear."

","This review might have a few spoilers, but I'll try not to honest! :) I saw this movie at 11:40 November 15th, a day to mark in history in my opinion, I skipped school and found my seat and sat from the beginning until after the last credit rolled away completely spellbound. I was absolutely amazed, Chamber of Secrets went along well with the story based on the novel by J.K. Rowling, and CoS as it's informally known in the muggle world, was an incredible movie, the actors portrayed an indescribable talent boost, Daniel Radcliffe makes Harry come alive once again. Sean Biggerstaff was in more scenes, even if they were just slight glimpses of the cute Scottish keeper Oliver Wood. Rupert Grint played Ron amazingly well, his faces and his voice went from high pitched frightened to a growing boy deep. Tom Felton who played our Slytherin bad boy Draco Malfoy was much meaner and nastier, all the more lovable if you ask me. All in all, the movie was incredible, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is more than a continuation on a familiar theme, its an improvement and a redefinition of that theme. Like the Wizard of Oz's follow ups, I was worried this one could not live up to its magnificent predecessor. Luckily, I erred. This film is truly great. It has all the fun of the first and more. The story has Harry returning to Hogwarts, older, smarter, and edgier, and thus the film is darker and more gritty, as Harry faces the fact that he might yet have no small amount of darkness in him. Though this is lamentably Harris' last film, his Dumbledore is remarkable and is one of his finer works (and that is no small task in and of itself). Though it is not without flaws (Where did Branagh go? Rickman as Snape occurred all too little in this one, though his screen time was remarkably well spent). This film is fun, smart, and actually heartening... Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and a well placed phoenix truly touched the audience I saw this film with. It looks like the Potter franchise is here to stay... and that looks to be a good thing."

","I am a huge fan of the books, as is my older daughter, and we both enjoyed the movie extremely much. I believe it captured the book even closer than the first movie, and all the actors have really fallen into their roles perfectly. Columbus does an admirable job pruning the book into the time alloted, and I did not walk away feeling anything was missing, as the few small omissions were not essential to the plot. Branagh was great, and I was hoping he would retain more of the great dialogue he had in the book. I hope that Prisoner of Azkaban, which is probably my favorite of the first four books, is accomplished as well as the this one."

","Let me warn everyone of this first:  I am a Harry Potter, so my expectations were high.  Also note that this is my least favorite Harry Potter story.<br/><br/>All right, now that that's out of the way, let's begin.  First of all, a warning to parents: there are some grotesque scenes in the film.  At one point, Ron vomits slugs (for a bit too long, in my opinion) and in another scene a ""snake's"" eyes are pecked out and bloody sockets are left. <br/><br/>
Last year's film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's/Sorceror's Stone, followed the book rather closely.  This one rearranged scenes, completely omitted two major scenes (The Deathday Party, Lucius Malfoy selling illegal wizard goods in Knockturn Alley).  If this made the action more effective, I would have been all for it.  But the editing did not help the story at all. In fact, it hindered it.<br/><br/>Another criticism:  Hollywoodization.  Scenes were overdone and pushed far beyond their needed limits.  The first film had some of this, especially in this Quidditch scene, but this one went too far.   Be warned.<br/><br/>However, there were great moments of humor.  Though I didn't approve of Dobby's design, he was used effectively.  Kenneth Branaugh was brilliant as Gilderoy Lockhart.  But the stand-out of the class was Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy.  You could see the evil in his eyes.  His portrayal was nothing short of astounding.  <br/><br/>Additionally, the cinematography was excellent.  The CGI was a big overplayed, especially when the Chamber of Secrets was opened.  And was it just me, or did the Basilisk look like Godzilla?<br/><br/>I think ..Prisoner of Azkaban will be interesting in the arms of a less Hollywood-ized director.<br/><br/>Rating:  8.5 / 10"
"Justin Chan","Null","0","0","15 November 2002"," Much better paced than the first film, a must see!
","No matter what anyone says about this movie, we all know it is not going to stop the hordes of Harry Potter fans from rushing out to see this film. The director of the second installment, Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone) promised more action and improved special effects in the second Harry Potter installment, and he definitely came through!    <br/><br/>
The movie starts us off at the end of Harry's horrible summer vacation with his comically terrible aunt and uncle, and leads us right into his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He has been warned, however, that he should not return by a little `house-elf' named Dobby. It turns out that someone has been terrorizing the school, and petrifying students (literally turning them into stone). In Harry's attempt to find out what's going on, he becomes the prime suspect that leads us on a very fast paced and exciting adventure for the rest of the film. Daniel Radcliffe seems much more at ease with the leading role this time around; in the first film he seemed a bit awkward.     This movie was definitely better paced than the first, there was a lot more action, and some pretty scary scenes that might upset some of the younger set. I am a little surprised it got away with the `PG' rating. If you are afraid of spiders, or snakes you may not like a few of the more scary scenes in this film. The climax of this movie was much more action intensive than the first, but it still turns out the same: Harry having to fend off evil on his own after his friends have become otherwise indisposed.      <br/><br/>The second installment was much more humorous than the first. This is thanks in part to two new characters: Dobby the computer generated elf, and Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense against the dark arts teacher comically played by Kenneth Branagh. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) also added to the comic relief during the more frightening scenes with his expressions of utter terror and panic that Harry never seemed to show in any situation. Be sure to stick around through the end of the credits for a brief humorous scene with Lockhart.     <br/><br/>The cinematography and computer special effects were just as good as the first, but this time they were not stressed as much making the movie flow much better. For example, there were fewer long pans of the great hall, or of the changing stare cases. Although these elements were in the movie, they were not the focus of an entire segment like in the first film where more explanation was necessary. The flying car in the opening scenes, and the improved version of the broomstick sport Quiddditch were excellent. The faster paced game of Quidditch in this film was definitely much better than the first.      <br/><br/>Another thing that impressed me with this movie was that I went the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes without looking at my watch! I was not able to do that in the first movie that clocked in at 2 hours and 30 minutes. If you didn't enjoy the first film, I would definitely suggest that you give this film a try because it is a real improvement.     <br/><br/>My final noteÂthe late Richard Harris did another superb job as Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore. As the film ended and the camera backed away from the great hall, I couldn't help but feel a little sadness knowing that this would be the last time I would see Harris on the screen. Some people in the theater with me were reading the credits, looking for a dedication or memorial to the actor who passed away just a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, this film was surely printed long before that, and the distributors would not have had the chance to add such a dedication. Even with out the dedication, I think his work speaks for itself. Thanks to film his legacy will live on, and we will never forget his great gift for acting."
"daisy0178","Null","0","0","15 November 2002"," Much better than the first film!
","I've been eagerly anticipating opening day for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  I saw it today and found it to be a much better film than the Sorceror's Stone.  However, it would seem to me that the director and/or screenwriter have tried to pack way too much into this film, which leaves it feeling just a little bit empty.  Too much time being spent on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's ""adventures"" and virtually ignoring daily life for the three Gryffindors. I thought the casting of Kenneth Brannagh as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart was inspired, but I was disappointed with his underuse in this film.  Yet again Alan Rickman (as Severus Snape) needs to be given more to do than glare at Harry and friends.  A quick note about Dobby the house-elf as well, though nowhere near as annoying as the infamous Jar-Jar Binks, I myself pictured Dobby to be a little less creepy and a little more goofy (for lack of a better word). The performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson were much improved as they seem to be growing into these characters.  The film's effects were much improved in the second film as well.  I would love to see more of the Weasley twins as they add a lot of comic relief to the books and it would be nice to see them do so in the films as well. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good addition to the Harry Potter movie series and while a little long it's still a lot of fun to watch.  I will be most interested in how the next film turns out with it's new director as the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite book in the series so far.  However, I would definitely recommend the Chamber of Secrets as it is a much better movie than the first, not perfect but still a fun movie for all ages."

","HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS hits theaters this week-end and, as the devoted Potter-er that I am, I was determined to see it as soon as possible.<br/><br/>My opinion?<br/><br/>Well....<br/><br/>The child acting has matured-most particularly that of Daniel Radcliffe who, reprising his role as the title protagonist, appears more at ease in front of the camera the second time round.  His timing periodically staggers slightly, but in general his portrayal of Harry has improved (the viewer should realize that due to his abusive past, Harry isn't SUPPOSED to be unduly expressive).  Emma Watson is appropriately sprightly as pal Hermione; however, Rupert Grint-so memorable in the previous film-has lost some of his snarky wit and charisma inherent in the first movie.  The fault partially falls upon the actor (one can only stand so many terrified expressions) but also onto the script, which seems to highlight Ron as a perpetual coward.<br/><br/>The adult cast can sport some of cinema's greats, including the late Richard Harris, Dame Maggie Smith, Robbie ColtraneÂ.but, sadly, they were mostly underused.  A special mention must be conferred upon Kenneth Branaugh's narcissistic Lockhart and to Jason Isaac's deliciously malicious Lucius Malfoy.  Alan Rickman, who proved to be such a superb addition to the cast, was heinously underused as Snape and is especially missed, being one of the most fascinating characters of the series.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, the film succeeds splendidly.  Especially the set designs were spectacular-from the castle, to the forest, to the chamber of secrets itself.  But without a solid base, the movie cannot remain steady.<br/><br/>The pacing is where the film truly stumbles.  The first movie was apt at slowing down its brisk pace at the suitable moments, at once giving the audience a chance to breath and, more importantly, adding a touch of human element where it was needed, an element sorely lacking the second movie.<br/><br/>The second movie tends to over-emphasize the action sequences and replace character development and plot progression with more unnecessary action (the car's aerobatics with the train).<br/><br/>The so-called `plot' in the movie simply plods from one action sequence to the next-most of which have little to do with the actual plot itself.  I felt little continuity in the plot.  The series of events only drag us through the movie's two-hour, forty-five minute time until we suddenly find ourselves at the rushed climax, which-lo and behold-seems to serve only as another excuse to stick in some more action.<br/><br/>Rather than leaving the theater happy, the movie left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and left me thinking, `What happened to the story?'<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the upcoming movie, though.  I'm definitely keen to see how another director will handle the books.  Columbus' clumsy directing coupled with Steve Kloves' jerky, bungling script seriously detract from the film.<br/><br/>It's an entertaining little film.  Your kids will love it.  But if you're looking for something with plot and character development, look elsewhere. You might find greater enchantment in the books themselves."

Unlike most sequals I guess you could say aren't that great this one does continue the story line well but doesn't get boring or anything like that. But for those of you that have young children and are planning on taking them to this movie be warned that there are some parts that are pretty scary for a youngster.

","Yes yes harry potter is back in town with the latest installment in the series of books. Though the books were absolutely delightful, the film does not live up to the high standards that are expected.<br/><br/>The first film was a pleasant surprise as the special effects were fresh and the cast likeable. However, come the second one.. the same is done all over again! You might argue that the special effects have been souped up e.g. Basilisk Fight but since most people have read the book the film becomes too predictable and the effects aren't fresh enough to let us know the outcome of what is to happen. On the other hand, people who have NOT read the book will find it hard to follow the story because the movie jumps from one incomprehensible scene to another without time for digestion.<br/><br/>However, the film is enjoyable enough if you do not mind the staleness. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson put in great performances, portraying their characters accurately. Apart from a good strong cast, there is action , hate, anger and even some humour which does brighten up the film.<br/><br/>On the whole it is a rather enjoyable ride, but it fails to match the first film overall and i give it ***1/2 out of *****."

","I will spare you the boring tedium of me rehashing the cast and basic plotline of HP:CoS becaue far more able reviewers have done so already. What I shall say is this--HP:CoS is basically a darker, more forward version of the first installment. Which is a pretty good thing because I found this film to be fairly intricate and twisting (FYI, I have NEVER read the novels)--far moreso than Sorceror's Stone.<br/><br/>A couple things that I would change would first to feature Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) in more scenes--I don't know why, but he adds so much to the table and creates an excellent foil for he other actors.<br/><br/>I would also cut back on that 2002 version of Jar-Jar Binks, Dobby the House elf--not entirely, because its role is rather important but by a bit so that it remains a novelty of S&M rather than a drain on the senses. I'd say a decent ratiing of 8/10 would suffice."

","Wow what a relief. As an avid reader of the books I was disappointed in the first film. However, Chamber of Secrets surpasses Philosophers Stone by miles, largely due to huge increase in acting ability and confidence shown by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and co. The screenplay is also more accomplished and funnier with less cliqued lines (although some still remain!). Kenneth Branagh is a superb Gilderoy Lockhart, oozing smarminess and vanity. Chris Columbus engineers some amazing shots in this film. The very first and the last especially stand out. Critics of the last movie said the film wasn't magical to watch, but Columbus has restored the magic in this movie. The special effects are slicker and more believable while Dobby, although not quite how I imagined him, grew on me. All in all a great cinematic experience."
"KAOsinsk","Null","0","0","11 November 2002"," Delicious acting, and big action scenes.
","Warning: From programme start to end credits, this is 3 hours long, check last train times before going to the Sunday night performance.<br/><br/>That said, you don't notice how long the film actually is. It buzzes along at a cracking pace. There is a lot of book to fit in, and time is very compressed and apart from 5 seconds of snow and a Christmas cake, there is no appreciation of the passage of a year. There is also little character development, we had that last time, but a lot more action.<br/><br/>The big action scenes, which have been beefed up for the film, are, naturally, the flying car, the Quidditch match, the Dark Forest, and the Chamber of Secrets itself. Steven Kloves, the screen writer, has managed to keep very well to the book, and where he has changed dialogue, it has not been as much of a caricature as in the first film.<br/><br/>The production designer is another credit to be mentioned. The attention to detail is phenomenal, from dozens of moving mandrakes (watch out for the one that bites Draco) to hundreds of books, each with their own dust jackets and in a number of cases content as well. Hagrid's hut and the Weasleys' home are both stuffed full of details: the self-washing up, the kitchen clock (remember it?) and all the other paraphernalia of an untidy home.<br/><br/>For the next instalment we get a new director (as well as a new Dumbledore), this may be a good thing. I noticed that in one or two places, Dan Radcliffe's timing was a bit off. He is the least accomplished of the three main actors and a new director may bring out a better performance.<br/><br/>Acting honours amongst the children once again goes to Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), it's a pity he only has one good scene. The polyjuice section in the Slytherin common room also gives an opportunity for the actors playing Crabbe and Goyle to do some acting rather than menacing. Tom, however, completely outclasses all the other kids. He's older and more experienced than the others and it shows. He has, played Jodi Foster's son in 'Anna and the King' (1999), and Peagreen Clock in 'Borrowers' (1997), which also features Mark Williams (Mr Weasley) in a reversal of good guy-bad guy roles.<br/><br/>Amongst the adults, acting credit goes to Kenneth Branagh (Gilderoy Lockhart) and Jason Isaacs (Mr Malfoy) the two new boys. At first it is something of a shock to see Branagh, he is not at all how I imagined Lockhart to look like, but this is soon forgotten through a consummate acting performance. He has got a smile (Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile) that makes women swoon, and men's fists itch. Every twinkle, every gesture, every cringe is Lockhart to a twitch. Watch the duelling scene closely - Branagh and Rickman  facing off against each other. These two brilliant performers can act even with their backs, without saying a word, they are Lockhart and Snape.<br/><br/>Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy (I must admit a certain prejudice here) is delicious. He plays the role very cool and calm - here a pleasant word, there a fleeting smile - but watch out for that cane of his. Despite this affected air of civilization, beneath it simmers pure evil. It is amazing how much malevolence he can put into: 'Now, now, Draco, play nicely'. At the end he says to Dumbledore: 'Let us hope Mr Potter will always be around to save the day', but though the words may be conciliatory, every one of them drips hatred. Watch out too for the interaction between Isaacs and Felton, they work well together and their screen time is unfortunately limited (the Borgin and Burkes scene has been dropped, pity). Pay close attention to the Quidditch match where Draco falls off his broom, there is a fleeting, glimpse of Mr Malfoy (an addition to the book but worth it). Watch Malfoy's expression, it goes a long way to explaining why Draco is such an obnoxious git.<br/><br/>One final comment. There has been much talk about Dobby, the CG elf. Is he another Jar Jar Binks? No. Dobby is not trying to be a major character, he is played strictly for laughs and apart from anything else, the quality of the animation is much, much better, facial expressions and gestures create a believable character, rather than a plastic puppet.<br/><br/>Watch the film if you've read the book a long time ago, then re-read the book to remind yourself of the bits they left out. Don't watch the film if you have neither seen the first film, nor read any of the books."

Aesthetically, the film is quite stunning and succeeds in convincing me that some love has been poured into the movie. Nontheless, a film can not shine without a tight script and decent performances. The main problem however, lies with the direction of Mr Columbus who only seems to be regurgitating the 'winning' formula of the first. In it's faithfulness to the novel, the plot somehow transposes poorly on celluloid, meandering around for a good two hours. Indeed, I was left wondering - what is the Chamber of Secrets??? I don't think Columbus knew either.<br/><br/>The three child leads are becoming more gangly as adolescence runs its course, and their performances did little to take my eyes from their elongated faces. Kenneth Branagh steals the show as the vain Lockhart, but is cancelled out by the incredibly irritating Dobie. This computer generated misfit takes up far too much screen time with his rambling and masochistic tendencies. The script itself does little to rectify the vague plot and save the movie. On the contrary, its hokey sentiment detracts from Rowling's creation and leaves an excessively saccharine taste.<br/><br/>At times it was fun, and I dont want to be condemned as a cynic. It is a kid's film after all, and I was certainly not expecting a masterpiece of modern cinema. Nontheless, for all that it tries to be, i could not help feeling unattached to the characters and wishing it had ended a good half hour before. Good luck to the next film, and let's hope Harry isn't six foot tall and hairy."

","I was persuaded to go to see this movie last night. Have you ever thought ""Life is too short""? If so go to this movie as it will make the 2 hours 40 minutes of it's runtime seem like ten hours therefore extending the apparent span of your life. Of course another way to look at it would be that it's a waste of 160 already scarce minutes. And it's just eaten another 10 of my valuable minutes writing this!! In summary, go to see it under one of two conditions. A) you are 10 years old B) you have extreme insomnia."

","Last year amid the hoopla of the release of Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's<br/><br/>Stone, movie goers forgot what made the books wonderful and clamored for a<br/><br/>visual representation of a book they had grew to love.  What they got was a fun movie, but one that had the emotion and spirit of the book sucked away by a<br/><br/>page-by-page direct translation to the screen.  <br/><br/>In Chamber Of Secrets it is very apparent that Chris Columbus and company<br/><br/>have learned from their first experience and have produced a superior product. The spirit is intact this time around with Harry having a much darker and more intense adventure.  In fact, it may be too intense for some kids.  There are some legitimately scary areas of the film including a harrowing escape from giant<br/><br/>spiders and a fight to the death with the monster that is petrifying the students at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>At the other end of the wand though is a great mystery adventure that is in-line with the great Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew stories that non-readers of the<br/><br/>series can follow.  Plus it helps that the cast is so terrific.  Daniel Radcliffe improves himself and expands the character of Harry Potter.  Emma Watson is<br/><br/>superb as Hermione and Rupert Grint is just hilarious as Ron Weasley.  The rest of the original cast is back as well with another quirky yet humorous portrayal of Snape.<br/><br/>But since this is a new book there are bound to be new characters including the animated Doby the house elf and some other teachers who appear in the book,<br/><br/>but we haven't seen until now.  The stand out is the new Defense Against The<br/><br/>Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is played to pompous perfection by<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh.  In fact, it is almost worth the price of the movie just to see him flitter around like the peacockish fop that he is.  Just brilliant.<br/><br/>There is a major problem with the film though: the ending.  It is immensely corny and hackneyed and takes you right out of the story.  It just doesn't belong. It's almost as if Columbus, having already resigned as director, just gave up and<br/><br/>came back home to America.  The events that happen are not worthy of J.K.<br/><br/>Rowling's books or of this fun and entertaining film."

","The magic is back!  Harry, Hermione, and Ron Weasley return to the screen with yet another adventure, bigger and better than ever, as they begin their second year at Hogwarts.  With a veritable flick of his magic wand, director Chris Columbus offers up `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' the second chapter in the on-going saga of everybody's favorite young wizard, who is joined this time around by a new instructor (teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts), as well as some formidable new opponents.  There's also a couple of surprises along the way as Harry encounters a rather singular character in his bedroom, and another deep in the Forbidden Forest.  And, yes, there IS a Quidditch match. <br/><br/>Harry's second year at Hogwarts begins inauspiciously with a warning to stay away; someone-- or some'thing'-- doesn't want him there.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is undeterred, of course, and is soon back in Gryffindor House along with his friends and fellow students.  But the warnings persist, now written in blood on the walls, and they portend an ominous fate for Harry, as well as many of the other students of witchcraft and wizardry.  The messages indicate that the `Chamber of Secrets' has been opened, and that dire consequences (for some unknown reason) are about to befall many of those in attendance at the school.  And this is serious business; enough to make Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) fear that Hogwarts may have to be closed indefinitely.<br/><br/>So it's up to Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) to get to the bottom of the mystery.  And they don't have much time; already one of the students has been found literally `petrified' in the hall, and the perpetrator is still unknown and at large.  Harry knows the answers can be found in the Chamber of Secrets, but the questions persist:  `What' is it, exactly, and `where' can it be found?<br/><br/>As if channeling the spirit and imagination of author J.K. Rowling (in whose heart Harry Potter was born), director Columbus brings this film vividly to life in a swirl of excitement and colorful characters.  He sets a perfect pace that will keep even the youngest members of the audience enthralled, and his transitions are impeccable, always moving the story forward with nary a single lull or hesitation.  It's a film that will grab you in the opening frames and sweep! you along to the finish. <br/><br/>Written for the screen by Steven Kloves (adapted from the novel by Rowling), the story is compelling, the dialogue is fresh and crisp and, as expected, the special F/X are the absolute best.  And Columbus uses it all to great effect, aided in no small part by the exemplary work of film editor Peter Honess, the original score by William Ross and John Williams, Roger Pratt's brilliant cinematography, and last, but certainly not least, the engaging performances turned in by his young stars and veteran performers alike.<br/><br/>Young Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry is so complete and natural that, simply put, he IS, and will forever be, `Harry Potter.'  It's the kind of definitive performance that will always, without question, be a part of Radcliff's life, putting him in such dignified company as Sean Connery (James Bond), Leonard Nimoy (Spock) and Basil Rathbone (Sherlock Holmes). And, for better or worse, that's not such a bad place to be.  He has a gift, and if he uses it wisely, he has a long and successful career ahead of him.<br/><br/>The characters of Hermione and Ron Weasley are definitive, as well, but not in the way that Radcliffe's Harry is, but inasmuch as it would be impossible hereafter to accept anyone else but Watson and Grint as, respectively, Hermione and Ron.  Their portrayals are solid, endearing and entirely convincing; who will ever forget Hermione's adamant stare, or Ron's bemused expression of befuddlement?  Though without a doubt they will always be associated with these characters, they have the kind of talent that should take them successfully beyond their `Potter' personas.  And hopefully they will make choices in the future conducive to their auspicious `star-making' turns in these films.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh gives a delightful performance as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new instructor at Hogwarts, whose self-importance has made him a legend in his own mind.  He is pompous and self-serving, but in a fun kind of way that allows you to see immediately beneath the mask of his vanity and his puffed up ego; he's the Wizard of Oz revealed as the man behind the curtain.  And Branagh plays him perfectly.<br/><br/>In this chapter we're also introduced to Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius Malfoy, played with deliciously restrained malevolence by Jason Isaacs. After meeting Lucius, it's easy to see that Draco (Tom Felton) is an apple that didn't fall far from the tree.  <br/><br/>Also turning in a memorable performance is Shirley Henderson, as the empathetic, disenfranchised ghost, Moaning Myrtle, doomed to forever roam the lavatory in which she met her untimely and premature demise.  With very little screen time, she manages to make a decided connection with the audience, which makes her an effective and integral part of the story.<br/><br/>Reprising the roles they established and made their own in `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' are Richard Harris (Dumbledore); Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid); Alan Rickman (Professor Severus Snape); Bonnie Wright (in an expanded role this time, as Ginny Weasley); Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley); John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick); Richard Griffiths (Uncle Vernon); Fiona Shaw (Aunt Petunia); and Harry Melling (Dudley).<br/><br/>The additional supporting cast includes Toby Jones (extremely effective as the voice of Dobby, the House Elf), Christian Coulson (Tom Marvolo Riddle), Miriam Margolyes (Professor Sprout) and Sally Mortemore (Madam Pince).  Be forewarned, there's a scene in the Forbidden Forest that will absolutely make your skin crawl; but it's all a part of the fun, and by the final scene of `Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,' you WILL, without a doubt, believe in magic."
"kraley","Null","0","0","11 November 2002"," A fantastic sequel in all meanings of the word
","As with it's predecessor, this film is fantastic (in all meanings of the word). This is one of those rare films where a sequel meets or exceeds the film it succeeds.<br/><br/>The cast (as with the last film) are truly outstanding in their roles. The casting director really deserves a LOT of the credit for the success of these films. Even the bit actors and actresses are exceptional. One sad note is that this will be the last Harry Potter Film with the current cast. Richard Harris (who played Albus Dumbledore) passed away recently, Chris Columbus (the director) has decided to withdraw from the series and the 'in crowd' buzz is that the trio of child-stars who starred in the first two films have reached puberty and will be too old to maintain the believability of the character ages for the third and remaining novels and will be replaced in the remaining films. If this is true, I would be reluctant to see the remaining films as I've become so enamored of the current cast and cannot imagine enjoying a ""Bewitched Darren moment"" when cast members suddenly change without in-plot reason and the audience is asked to pretend it hasn't happened in a film series as good as this one has proven to be.<br/><br/>The CGI is again outstanding. The effects vary from the utterly blatant (giant spiders, ghosts, magic, and a frightening basilisk) to the subtle (moving pictures on the wall, tattered owls, and a red-eyed cat) and convey just what they are supposed to without overwhelming one with the ""HEY! LOOK AT THIS!"" presentation of most big budget special effects.<br/><br/>This movie runs 2 hrs and 50 min. so don't drink the kidney-buster soda before the film begins. There is no nudity, and no conventional American profanity, but there are some pretty frightening scenes with the giant spiders and the basilisk and some creepy corridor scenes that might frighten younger viewers. It might be a good idea to leave the pre-schoolers home if they are easily scared or prone to nightmares.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a great sequel and should not be missed by fans of the first film. While seeing the first film is not absolutely necessary to enjoy the second, it does add a LOT of information that the second film takes for granted the audience is already familiar with. If you have not seen the first film, it would be well worth your time (and a lot of fun regardless) to watch the first film before going to see the second.<br/><br/>Go see Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It's as good or better than the original film and it picks up right where the last one left off in fun, quality and enjoyability."
"mllea","10","0","0","10 November 2002"," Potter Fans Will Be Pleased: for the most part it's better than the first
","Note: I tried hard to not include any spoilers in this post so if you haven't seen the movie yet I think you'll be ok reading this message, although if you want to know absolutely nothing about the movie before you see it maybe it's best that you don't read this post! Thanks!<br/><br/>
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second movie in the series of at least three to be made based on the books by JK Rowling, is for the most part far better than the first film, ""Harry Potter and the Philosophers/Sorcerers Stone."" <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) have become more comfortable in their roles. They are obviously starting to relate to their characters more easily. This definitely makes the film more enjoyable and more enthralling. Rupert (Ron) is definitely the best of the 3 at playing his part. He certainly has become Ron. Several new characters were added, including Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), who is incredibly convincing at his part, Dobby the House-Elf, who was CG'd so well that he really came alive on screen, there really was no way that I could tell he was computer animated, and also Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson), the ghost of the girl's bathroom who was EXACTLY as I imagined her in the book.<br/><br/>
The story was much more exciting because hardly any time was wasted on explaining who the characters were, etc. It moved at a very, very rapid pace- the 2 1/2 hours went by quickly! I think most of the people in the theatre also got really into the movie- hardly anyone got up, moved around, etc., even though the theatre was mostly full of young children. It was also much funnier than the first film... although I do have a few critiques. There was a lot more drama and violence and the ""scary"" parts, such as the spiders in the Forbidden Forest and the basilisk in the Chamber, were almost overkill. I thought maybe these ""scary"" scenes were a little too violent, a little too dragged out, and made the film seem even a bit darker than the book. It was, however, very powerful and got the message across that as cute and as happy as Hogwarts is there is definitely a dark side. And maybe I have really underestimated how ""dark"" the books actually were intended to be. <br/><br/>Anyways, I am very pleased... it was kind of disappointing that my favourite parts of the book- the Deathday party and Valentines Day weren't included- but I understand that the movie would have likely been 5-10 hours if they had included everything from the book! Although I definitely wouldn't complain if the film had been a bit longer. 3 hours would have been ok with me! <br/><br/>I think my favourite part was the Burrow (the Weasley's home)- definitely very, very cute and whimsical and homey. The Weasley family were very well portrayed in the movie. I had been looking forward to seeing the filmmakers' interpretation of their residence. Unfortunately Oliver and James (Fred and George) didn't have very big roles. Neither did Mark Williams (Arthur Weasley) which was unfortunate because he was brilliant as Mr. Weasley. Of course everyone except for the ""trio"" had rather small roles in this movie because as I said the story was definitely rushed along a bit and therefore a lot of the wonderful dialogue from the books was lost, even more so than in the previous film. <br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets will please all of those who are die-hard Harry Potter fans. Of course, you cannot expect the film to live up to the novels by JK Rowling- they are what hold the true magic of Harry Potter. Both this film and the first are just a means of interpreting the books, not to replace them altogether. Do not go to this movie if you have not yet read the book- trust me, you will probably not enjoy it or appreciate it. Also, do not go to this movie and expect it to take the next Best Picture Oscar award home. However, just like the books audiences of all ages will be able to appreciate this film. Parents who have read and enjoyed the books with their kids should really have a great time watching the movie. In fact, it was the adults who were laughing and really immersing themselves in the show, while the children in the theatre were mostly just sitting in their seats, quietly spellbound. Pre-teen girls seemed to enjoy Dan and Rupert. All in all, considering the fact that I don't think it would really be possible for anyone to do a better interpretation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on the silver screen, I give it a 9.5/10."

It was fine if you have never read the books, and were just watching a film, however it left many gaps that I am not sure how they will be recovered in the 3rd movie.<br/><br/>The omission of the detail in Knockturn alley, the change of the events in the ending scenes were key scenes, that were frankly written perfect by J.K., why would there be a need to change them.<br/><br/>On a positive note, the casting was perfect!

I liked it, it was really long though and by about 2/3s of the way through i was squirming in my seat, waiting for the end and I can imagine kids aged 5-8 would get bored half way through, not because of the storyline, but purely because of the length. I like Ron, both the character and the actor.  Rupert Grint is the best child actor in the film series so far.  He's funny, has the best lines and generally is the most believeable which is the point of a good actor. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) is just OK, and infact in my opinion slides down to pretty bad in some parts.  His reactions aren't sharp enough and you get the feeling that Chris Columbus is just out of shot telling him when to deliver his line.  As for Emma Watson (Hermione) is good, but is slightly too polished > sigh, there's no pleasing me is there!?< Kenneth Branagh is perfectly cast as Lockheart, as is Rickman as Snape and the sorely missed Harris as Dumbledore.<br/><br/>I do like this film, and it's going to be a huge hit, obviously.

This movie is certainly not suitable for 6 years old children and frankly I wouldn't let my 10 years old children watch this pile of brutal and morbid trash. It's too loud, too fast and too brutal and morbid. Some scenes are really frightening and seem to be lifted directly from horror movies like the scene with the giant spiders. And such scenes where the ghost of this girl is asked ""How was dying?"" are quite sick, especially in a movie for children. Add some blood on the walls etc. and you have this movie. But from a director like Chris Columbus what else was to expect? I don't know the book and I really don't care about it and its writer who seems to be only interested in making money. Also this movie has no meaning, no message and is therefore as a movie for children a real waste of time (and money). But it was great to see such great actors as Maggie Smith and Richard Harris again. But I hated this little girl Hermine, she was such a know-it-all!

Both Harry Potter and The Fellowship of the Ring were big hits at the box office, but Lord of the Rings managed to win just about every kind of award conceivable while, (Four Oscar wins) Potter was recognized for what it is, a children's movie with NO Oscars!<br/><br/>In contrast, The Lord of the Rings films (also based on books) are Peter Jackson's own vision of the series, rather than just a routine retelling of what happens in the novels. He managed to incorporate the entire LOTR phenomenon into the films, not just the books themselves, and as a result, the world of Middle-Earth is a living, breathing tangible entity. Plus he didn't feel the need to stage things exactly the way they happened in the novels. A good example of this is his use of elements mentioned only in the appendices of the last book, most notably the scene in the first film between Aragorn and Arwen. Arwen was barely mentioned in the first novel, but Jackson manages to make you care about this little known character who's willing to give up an immortal existence to spend a mortal life with the man she loves. It's these reasons I feel LOTR is the far better series, and I have complete confidence that The Two Towers will knock everyone's socks off just as The Fellowship of the Ring did!<br/><br/>An average 4 on a scale of 1-10 for Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!<br/><br/>GET READY FOR THE TWO TOWERS OPENING ON DECEMBER 18TH, 2002 ORDER YOUR TICKETS EARLY!!!"

","I went into the cinema having not seen the first Potter film but after about 5 minutes, I realised that it made absolutely no difference because even a brain-dead neanderthal would find it easy to understand.<br/><br/>The film, in my view took a while to get started and the introduction was far toooooooo loooong. Then it got to the middle part of the film, which is usually the juicy bit. It turned out to be just as bland and pointless as the first part. After about and hour i started getting very restless and soon after that i started dozing off.<br/><br/>The film was in a word... well there are no words which aren't x-rated to describe the film.<br/><br/>Please please please do not go to see this film, it'll only encourage them to keep on making more and more and more.<br/><br/>Marks out of 10? well I'll give it 0.5/10 as a sympathy vote for being so pathetic."

","A couple of minor spoilers are ahead:<br/><br/>Working for the film industry, I, along with my young nephew, were among the first people in the world to catch an advanced screening of the new Harry Potter movie. Now I'm not a Harry Potter fan in the least, (Sorry, but I prefer the Lord of the Rings books) and, while this IS a better movie than the first Harry Potter, I didn't think it was THAT spectacular.<br/><br/>
Once again, in the beginning, Harry is picked on by his aunt and uncle until a small elf like creature named Dobby warns him against going back to wizard school at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Sure, the three kids are a likable trio of magicians, but, it seems that Ron, the redheaded fellow, has little to do in this film until the end. And, I also found Kenneth Branagh's professor character to be quite silly, not to mention that there is this REALLY annoying computer generated character in the movie, named Dobby which is nothing but a huge pest, always warning Harry about bad things to come at Hogwarts complaining to him about bad things that happen to his fellow students, after a few of them have turned to stone.<br/><br/>While the film has some great effects, (The flying car ride to Hogwarts, the kenetic Quidditch match which is done better than in the first film, a wizards duel between Harry and this blond headed bully, I can't remember his name, and the ending within the Chamber of Secrets,) I still havn't been able to discover what so many  children and teenagers find so fascinating about these books. And, like the first film, it's too long.<br/><br/>These films seem to follow the books too closely, and while children may love the idea of how the films match the books neatly, it gives filmgoers no surprises in seeing them. <br/><br/>To be fair, my nephew who is 9, loved the film, even more than the first, and he says he will see it again on opening weekend.<br/><br/>As for me, I'll be waiting until December 18th, the day that Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers hits theaters, THAT'S the film real fantasy purists REALLY want to see this holiday season! (Maybe it's a generational thing, with younger people prefering Harry Potter, and young adults prefering The Lord of the Rings.) However, as I stated earlier it is a better film than the first one although barely.<br/><br/>Sure, this film will make LOTS of money, but The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring proved that it can also make lots of money, AND earning numerous film awards while being a great book AND a great movie at the same time.

"gollumsmeagolrocks","8","1","2","22 May 2016"," The real first movie, in many ways
","The Chamber Of Secrets is significantly better with each viewing. The film greatly improves upon the first installment's flaws, which those who read my first review will remember I said had too minor a focus on the main plot of the Stone and more focus on the world-building and exposition. This film's main narrative of the Chamber being opened again is much more present, Steven Klove finally finding a perfect balance between the bits of them interacting with the Wizarding World, and the bits of the main driving narrative. <br/><br/>Not only is the main narrative strongly written with great dialogue and a real sense of unraveling to an ultimate moment and climax, but its actually far more interesting when you view it again after seeing the later films and know the hidden information of the good guys' and bad guys' secrets. All of the plot threads that will last through the series are brilliantly put in place here so subtly but without distracting from the central narrative, such as the real reason Snape is so hard on Harry and Ron's poverty and Voldemort's prejudice against Muggle-Borns and the secret to his survival, etc. Heck, even the word Expelliarmus isn't said until this movie! In a way, since the essential tropes and aesthetic for the whole series aren't put in place until this installment, this almost feels like the real first film!<br/><br/>This film has aged very well, and I can honestly say that it gets miles better with each viewing. The secrets to this franchises' success have finally been opened!"
"lesleyharris30","8","1","2","29 November 2015"," Magical Fun, though lacking the same Energy of its Predecessor,
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast. It's a magical adventure that takes us back to Hogwarts with Harry in his second year, with darker elements being explored, the history and landscape of the school is expanded from our very own eyes, we discover in this movie just how large and innovative this universe truly is. It's certainly not as enjoyable as its predecessor, the Philospher's Stone, was, though I like the darker themes, I felt as if it didn't gradually become more bleak, we went from the fun laid back atmosphere of the first movie, to a much more severe and complicated one here, I was disappointed with the lack of development from Hermione in this film, though Harry and Ron's character arch is further established fantastically here, Hermione isn't in it enough and her character is basically the exact same at the end of this as she was in the previous movie. There are plenty of great new characters here as well that further shows us what this universe is capable of, Dobby the House Elf, Lucius Malfoy and Gilderoy Lockhart, among many others, and terrific characters that are superbly portrayed by their actors, and they all add more depth to this amazing universe. Though it may be too dark at times and not quite as fun as its predecessor, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is still a great ride and fun for the whole family. <br/><br/>Strange events start to occur around Hogwarts and a mysterious voice haunt Harry's head, he must investigate these occurrences while in his second year of Hogwarts. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe"
"filipemanuelneto","8","1","2","5 September 2015"," An excellent sequel.
","This film is the adaptation of the second book in the Harry Potter's saga, written by J.K. Rowling. As in the first film, also this one was directed by Chris Columbus, keeping almost the same team and cast that worked in the first one. So, it's not surprising that Columbus has repeated here the success of the first movie of the franchise. It's also not surprising that there are obvious similarities between the two films, which ultimately distinguish them from the other films that would follow after Columbus departure. Another name that will disappear from the franchise after this film is Richard Harris, who played the role of Albus Dumbledore, one of the most important in the saga, as Harris dies that same year. Like the first film, this one remained true to the original book, a feature that will come gradually to mitigate on the following films. However, this film no longer has the lightness of the first film, perhaps it was just the magic of being the first..."
"barbagvido","10","1","2","31 August 2015"," The most underrated movie in the series
","I don't know if it's because I watched this one first when I was 7 and it's the reason I fell in love with the series or because this one was the most faithful adaptation, not only in the series, probably one of the most faithful adaptations ever. Child actors are a little older (and better) in this movie, the atmosphere is really magical and adult actors as great as always and I don't even have to say anything about the score. This one is probably my 2nd favorite movie in the series. Effects look a bit fake at some parts but aside from that, everything was perfect. When I saw the first movie after reading a book, I liked it, but it felt kinda rushed. In this one, everything was great. It had all plot elements from the book (I think), it was darker, more thrilling but this one may scare the children a little (boo, spiders!). From new actors in the series, I was overwhelmed by Kenneth Branagh as a new arrogant professor Gilderoy Lockhart and some of his scenes still make me laugh out load. Not only him, but Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle too. All in all, this is a really enjoyable fantasy and one of the most faithful adaptations ever."
"schroeder-gustavo","10","1","2","30 July 2015"," Deeper and darker
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets takes us deeper into the magical world of Hogwarts and lets us explore more of its dark secrets.<br/><br/>This is the last Harry Potter film directed by Chris Columbus and it still has that magical feeling, filled with wonder and imagination. But this is a much darker movie than the first one, digging deeper into the universe that J.J. Rowling so masterfully created. There's a very creepy atmosphere throughout this film and it certainly is, at times, even scary.<br/><br/>Chamber does everything the first Harry Potter did well, and improves upon it. The special effects in this one don't look nearly as dated as the effects in Sorcerer's Stone, the CGI still holds up surprisingly well. The performances are even better than in the first film, which is I believe saying something. And although I gave them both 10/10, I do believe Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superior to Sorcerer's Stone for the pace is faster, the characters and the universe are expanded and the effects are much better. Also, it has a much darker and more serious tone, and a sense of urgency throughout."
"axel-koch","4","1","2","25 December 2013"," Contender for the worst film sequel ever, I'd say?
","It's startling how such a marvellous movie series can have on such an aberration, especially considering how it comes from the same director that made Philosopher's Stone such a wonderful and rewatchable family film. Chamber of Secrets in contrast won't please either of the family members: the kids are only going to be disturbed by the violence and intensity in it, while the adults are likely to laugh at how ridiculous these particular scenes are made. Why not pursue the darker, grittier style the way every sequel after this one did, especially when the subject has moments as terrifying for young children as Chamber of Secrets has. But enough of that because the false approach and the shocking PG rating (both in the UK and the US) aren't the reason this film has disappointed me as heavily as it did. Maybe it was the missing break between shooting the first and the second film of the Harry Potter series that made Chris Columbus and his crew lose most about what was so great about Philosopher's Stone and replace with silly physical humour and sloppy screen writing. What has to be said out of fairness as well is that the novel it is based on is as well the weakest in the series, with the introduction of the three most annoying characters in the Harry Potter universe: Dobby, Colin Creevey and Gilderoy Lockhart. Miraculously, as the cast chiefly stayed the same, all the actors gave a worse performance in Chamber of Secrets, most of all the child actors that now simply must have felt overstrained. Additionally, the CGI was lousy and everything entertaining about it has been there in Philosopher's Stone already. Granted, I still enjoyed the cinematography, set design, and score, and Hogwarts hasn't lost its magical atmosphere in Chamber of Secrets, but the fact that this isn't a good film is defined by just one simply statement: there was not one scene in the film that I really enjoyed. And that says an awful lot about what is actually my favourite film series."
"RyanEberhart","10","1","2","8 October 2013"," Perfect!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second installment of J.K. Rawlings phenomenally great series that has been adapted into a movie. The series is so great in my opinion that I will go ahead and post right now that all of them get a score of 10 stars out of 10. Don't worry, I'll remind you of the scores for each of the next 6 movies.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets builds on the first movie. After all, the movies are supposed to follow Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) as they attend school at Hogwarts. In this movie we meet Guilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Lockhart is full of himself and is an inept wizard; it's amazing he has made it as far as he has in life and being so inept.<br/><br/>As I did for Sorcerer's Stone in giving my favorite scene I won't describe the big scenes, though they are some of my favorites. However, I have other scenes that I like that will be listed below.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked was when Ron and his twin brothers, Fred (James Phelps) and George (Oliver Phelps), come to Surrey, England to rescue Harry. Harry has been put on lock down in the Dursley house because of something he didn't do. Dobby (Toby Jones) the House Elf has taken it upon himself to save Harry Potter from a plot against him. Dobby drops a cake on Uncle Vernon's boss's wife's head. When Ron, Fred and George come to rescue Harry they do so in a flying car. When they get to the Weasley home we meet Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) and Molly Weasley (Julie Walters), parents to Ron, Fred and George. We also meet Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright).<br/><br/>The second scene I like was the dueling scene between Harry and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). They are supposed to only disarm each other, but Malfoy cheats (shocker!). Harry retaliates, but Malfoy comes back with a spell that produces a snake. Harry talks to the snake trying to convince it to not attack another student, this shocks everyone because talking to snakes is not a common gift.<br/><br/>The next scene is one of the funniest scenes. It's when Harry and Ron ""accompany"" Lockhart into the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. They see a snake skin on the ground and Lockhart faints. However, this is a ploy in order to steal Ron's wand. Lockhart attempts to erase Harry's memories, but Ron's wand was broken near the beginning of the movie and he never replaced it. The spell Lockhart tries to use backfires and causes a cave-in, it also causes Lockhart to lose all of his memories.<br/><br/>I already scored this movie, how would you score it?"
"rhett_black","8","1","2","3 March 2010"," Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets Film Review
","The second installment of the franchise unfortunately was Richard Harris' last before his death. In this film we see a development of two major characters in Dumbeldore & Tom Riddle(Voldemort). Dumbledore is magnificently played by Harris as a warm & enchanting character with a big heart & soft spot for Harry. Harry starts to face his true demon in this film with Voldemort playing even more powerful mind games. We still do not see Voldemort in the flesh however his presence as the character is widely seen through Harry's character. Watch for the wand duel between Malfoy & Harry when Harry speaks parcel tongue, this scene is very intriguing & an interesting part of the story. More gruesome than the first film & possibly better, this Potter sequel is brilliant. Kenneth Branagh steals the show as the new professor & is very funny however Jason Issacs is ideal as the evil yet prestigious Luscious Malfoy."
"Sirus_the_Virus","8","1","2","3 August 2009"," Better than the original... They grew up after a year.
","I had one problem with the first film, The Sorcerer's stone. The three main characters, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, were irritating.Why would they care about all of this stuff? The kids were only supposed to be eleven in the movie. Why would they care if Snape was a bad guy or that stuff about the Sorcerer's stone? You don't see any other eleven year old playing real life chess. You know why? Because the Potter films are fictional. The sequel to the original, The Chamber of Secrets, is a lot better. Here are the reason why it's better: It's creepier, it's darker, it's funnier, and... the three stars grew up. Daniel Radcliffe definitely did. So did Rupert Grint and Emma Watson and they weren't as irritating. They really don't grow up until The Prisoner of Azkaban. The Chamber of Secrets is actually a disturbing film. There are large spiders, a basilisk, and blood. I won't go into the plot outline for The Chamber of secrets, but I thought I would let you know. This is an improvement on the original film. Like every Potter film, they keep getting better and better. They continue to get darker and darker. Here is my entire theory on the Potter films. The Darker, the better. That's what makes this film better than The Sorcerer's stone."

","Year two at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums. When some pupils start to turn up in a petrified state, suspicion starts to fall on Harry himself, but along with his pals Hermione and Ron, he hopes to uncover the mystery of The Chamber Of Secrets.<br/><br/>Chamber Of Secrets is my favourite Potter film, tho as an adult of some years, I do like the darker tone that the series would take after this instalment. But this remains my favourite because it is the one where the children are still just that, children. Harry and his buddies still have the innocence about them to fully realise the fantastical elements to J.K. Rowling's fabulous writing, witchcraft and wizardry has in short, never been so charming.<br/><br/>Following on from the excellent character introduction of Philosopher's Stone, Chamber Of Secrets retains the whodunit heartbeat and ups the action and hilarity quotient, whilst simultaneously adding some scary flourishes into the bargain. Here we get a quite brilliant Quidittch match, and newer interesting characters entertain without diverting attention from the important children themselves, tho Kenneth Branagh's Gilderoy Lockhart joyously lights up the screen at frequent intervals. Chris Columbus directs again and quite clearly has honed some things from the first picture, the effects are a great improvement on Philosopher's Stone and Columbus here perfectly utilises the lush sweeping location to benefit the story.<br/><br/>A touch too long at 160 minutes, Chamber Of Secrets never in fact outstays its welcome, and come the fabulous face off finale (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry very impressive) I personally feel well and truly rewarded for my time spent at Hogwarts for year two. 8.5/10"
"Coventry","8","1","2","31 December 2008"," Child-friendly but definitely not childish!
","Nearly 8 years and 6 films later, this was only my very first acquaintance with the Harry Potter franchise. I obnoxiously considered myself not to be a part of the target audience (too old and anti-computer generated effects), even though the copious fantasy & horror ingredients always somewhat triggered my curiosity. I literally waited until this second installment in the series was programmed on national television and I was too lazy to switch the channel. It didn't take too long before I regretted having waited this long, as ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a vastly entertaining and impressively accomplished blockbuster. Obviously I can't compare it to anything else, as I haven't seen any of the other films and never even held one of J.K. Rowling's books in my hands, but you don't need comparison in order to know this is excellent fun to enjoy with a big pack of popcorn. According to most reviewing people around here, this second film is already a lot darker and more sinister than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and apparently the series gradually grew more mature. Me, I was already quite astounded with the amount and types of morbidity featuring in this. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" is child-friendly, but definitely not childish. Of course there aren't any explicit death sequences shown on screen, but there's loads of creepy stuff (giant spiders, snake-monsters, spontaneously combusting birds, Â) that I imagine can be quite nightmarish. <br/><br/>Following a successful rescue operation executed by his gingered best friend Weasley, Harry Potter escapes from his insufferable distant relatives and heads back for Hogwarts to attend his second year of wizardry. Even during the journey already and especially upon their arrival, it becomes obvious there's something strange going on. Perhaps Dobby, the overly humble and nervous little elf who came to warn Harry about not returning to school, was right. The rumors about the Chamber of Secrets reopening itself are getting louder and louder. This never before found chamber allegedly homes a hideous monster that destroys all the students whose blood isn't 100% pure wizard blood. Yeah okay, the plot is *slightly* more convoluted that this, but obviously I can't summarize 161 minutes of film and 360 pages of book in just a couple of sentences. The important thing to know is that ""Chamber of Secrets"" is a spectacularly fast-paced and non-stop adventurous film full of visual gimmicks and widely versatile fantasy elements. The cast choices are excellent. The child actors do terrific jobs and particularly the teachers at Hogwarts are stupendously cast. Richard Harris (who passed away before the theatrical release), Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane are great as the 'Good Samaritan' teachers, but my preference obviously goes out to the more malignant and eccentric characters. Alan Rickman as the uncanny Professor Snape and especially Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy provide an additional eerie atmosphere with their presence and Kenneth Branagh shines as the hoax magician and wannabe media superstar Gilderoy Lockhart."

","amended: 30 July 07 and 2 Aug 07 and 6 Aug 07 and 5 Nov 2007 etc <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>This contains SPOILERS of the musing about plot elements type. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>This and Philosopher's Stone are special to me. <br/><br/>Part of that comes from the length of the novels allowing these to follow the books more closely. The special magic that Columbus was allowed to breath and form life to. <br/><br/>Even more relevant is that here The One True Princess, Hermione The Great, is not fully at big girl level. To many it would not be obvious at all that this makes these two to be very special indeed. How could anyone with clean and pure sense find big girls to be almost as daunting as women? <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Ginny: <br/><br/>One detail that stands out for me is the look of Ginny. The background notes show her, in real life, to be a classically beautiful female. I assume that is just her being herself, yet through all the features I have seen so far she mostly looks like Harry's mum, and not such a pretty imitation. <br/><br/>The novels that I have so far do not show them to be obviously related. <br/><br/>For me, Harry 5 will be special because it is the last before she is what I think of as a young woman, no longer a girl. A need to go myopic and ignore that she is a big girl in HP5. I have not noticed any mention of her in the 40 IMDb comments that I browsed re HP5, but I would expect her to again be looking like Harry's mum. Hope that the background videos continue to be different. <br/><br/>That is how I experienced Ginny before I wrote this comment. Magic. Now her reality has changed for me and Harry Potter is no longer the same. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Hermione and the torn page: <br/><br/>I note that the novel has this too, and JK makes a mention of library defence spells in the introduction of Quidditch Through The Ages, useful for considering the storyline of HP2. Yet I cannot envisage Hermione as being able to deface a book in this way. Maybe Imperious might be powerful and devious enough to over-ride her feelings. Whatever, the fictional event did take place. I consider JK to typically have an unusually good grounding in common sense so there is always a chance that I misunderstand. <br/><br/>Theft of potions ingredients? Bulstrode Â pussy Â Crookshanks? More hangmen? <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Ron's wand: <br/><br/>Flying into Hogwarts at the start of the year broke one or two rules of the school, also of the state, also of Ron's family, also of etc. The extenuating circumstances feel rather weak if Dobby's influence is not taken into account. <br/><br/>The car developed engine and steering trouble as soon as it got close to the school. They headed straight into the most obvious tree to avoid. Ron's wand somehow got broken during some rather inept attempts to find a use for it. They then had to face Filch and then Snape. <br/><br/>Could be that there is still hope for Ron. Hagrid's wand was supposed to have been broken after a court upheld Voldemorte's allegations, but Ron's wand says that Hagrid's wand does not show symptoms that might be expected. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Slytherin and his heir, Voldemorte: <br/><br/>Both of these had no qualms about using a girl's toilet, to the extent that something important, the gateway, could be hidden there to eventually be found by the heir, it not considered as an obvious locale by most anyone else. <br/><br/>As a male to female I have a problem re this. I find it normal for me to be put to the test until I eventually fail the test re most everything, considered to have a special odour as a result, sometimes the odour even being real. Strong pressures that can easily corrupt us, gargoyle formation, that and natural accounting giving the impression that we are pure evil type corrupt. <br/><br/>Motivation to effectively corrupt us further, two biblical tombs, curse or blessing. Invasion of our being and of our being space, a theft deeper than the theft of potions. Compare with Fame 1980. This aspect strongly hints that these two are secret girls and the secret and not so secret do have a bad enough press-press already. Englander humour: Brownsea Island nature reserve. Still, Hitler was a vegetarian and no one messes up veggies because of that. <br/><br/>Eye of newt and wing of bat. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>This links with my comments on All American Girl of 1994 and Fame 1980.<br/><br/>My comment in this re Slytherin and his heir, Voldemorte, had an overflow comment at the Harry Potter 2 message board re The Chamber's Location Question?, except it has disappeared. But HP7 novel makes it not relevant anyhow. <br/><br/>For further aspects I used the message board under the same heading as this, 'Hitler was a vegetarian', just that disappeared too. Again, it is stuff that is no longer relevant apart from an attempt at listing such as scarf colours and proper spelling of key names. I do need a pointer to a fan site that has a collection of stuff like that."

The director showed his ability most in this movie. It is good trying to make some scenes which it is not appeared in the original novel. These new scenes gave people more funny and fascinated this movie. The greatest part of the movie was magic fighting scene. The scene that people want to see more than other scenes gave a fantastical movements and great CG. Besides, the slave elf 'Dobby' was fit with people's expecting even though it was too big I expected. These was pretty enough to satisfy people. But the movie was not as pretty satisfy as I expected. I think the director pretended to make the movie only for children. The monster snake looked like just a big Anaconda and some children's acting was not good enough to cover the movie. The only one thing I was surprised was Albus Dumbledore. He was gone after he had filmed this movie. I bow to him for his last play."
"lilyblue79pr","Null","1","2","11 August 2006"," Question about Salazar Slytherin and Voldemort
","I don't know if this was posted before, but in this movie we learn that Salazar Slytherin was very particular about the students that he wanted ""only pure bloods in Hogwarts"", but when Harry enters the chamber of secrets and finds Tom Riddle and he describes himself as Lord Voldemort he specifically said ""Surely I wasn't going to keep my filthy muggle mother's name"" so that means that Lord Voldemort is not a pure blood, that he is a muggle himself, maybe he really wasn't the true heir of Salazar Slytherin, maybe he performs a spell or a curse on the basilisk so that he can controlled it. So who really was the true heir of Salazar Slytherin I just hope that since harry can speak parcel tong that he isn't the heir of Slytherin and that is what Harry Potter is. Also in the book of JK Rolling they talk about the prophecy of a boy or something like that maybe the prophecy talks about that Harry Potter is the heir of Salazar Slytherin and is related to Lord Voldemort I just hope that is not true. What do you all think?"
"rebeljenn","6","1","2","29 December 2005"," a good adaption
","'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is a pretty good adaption of the second book in the Potter series. In this book, Harry is warned by a house elf not to go back to Hogwarts school. Strange things start to happen, and a new portal is opened up, and this forces Harry to meet and to learn more about his enemy. It is up to Harry to become the hero again while trying to fit in.<br/><br/>The film introduces more special effects and action than the first film, but I thought it was a weaker story than the first book. (That, of course, is my personal preference.) The giant spiders and giant snake are pretty realistic (spider-phobes and snake-phobes beware).<br/><br/>This film is another success for the Harry Potter story, and I think that fans are overall pleased. It's got the innocent and fun-loving characters that the original had, which is why the story is so popular, and combine this with the action and you get a successful film. My only problem is that I did not find this story as interesting as the other Potter books, and I felt that some of the acting was not the best...still, I don't think it distracted from the story. Overall, job well done and a good adaption."

","""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" has better special effects than the first one. <br/><br/>I lost count at six teams of special effect companies, including Industrial Light and Magic, but doubtless each one had different responsibilities, whether the wonderful Hogwart's Hall, or the spiders, or the flue powder travel, or the flying car, etc.<br/><br/>Even at three hours not all the story details can be told, so the actors have to quickly mouth a lot of exposition.<br/><br/>Too bad the excellent Brit actors are reined in, even Kenneth Branaugh.<br/><br/>Only the red-haired kid emotes much.<br/><br/>At least the music is less bombastically intrusive than the last one.<br/><br/>So even with all the whiz bang it still isn't as magical as The Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>(originally written 12/24/2002)"
"miss_niss","5","1","2","4 December 2005"," Too slow to get going, skip it and watch the third movie!
","I really didn't like this movie. For many people, this is their least favourite book in the Harry Potter series, but I don't think that's why the movie is so painful. It is unfortunate in having a a really poor director. <br/><br/>Dobby is the CGI Potter equivalent of Jar Jar Binks, I thought he was terrible. It's ironic that I imagined Dobby very much as a gremlin type of creature in my head, and Chris Columbus was actually a writer for Gremlins! If he'd made Dobby into a Gremlin, I think I would have liked him much more. <br/><br/>As a small but annoying detail, someone should tell Rupert Grint that acting consists of more than a breaking voice and raised eyebrows. That boy's range consists of confused and scared, which coincidentally involves the same movements of his furrowed brow.<br/><br/>Now there are obvious, practical reasons why screenplays differ from novels, you are working with a much smaller time-frame, some scenes are difficult to translate to a visual medium, sometimes a scene will have to be changed or represented differently to create the same tension or dramatic effect. It's understandable.<br/><br/>What's not understandable is the writing and directorial decisions for most of Chamber of Secrets. Many of the scenes are ponderous and slow, the dialogue is forced and perfunctory, there is no sense of tension or building mood. I'm so glad Chris Columbus was replaced as director, he just doesn't seem to be able to get any sparks out of the story or his cast. It might look good but it's just so slow paced, I just can't get over it! There are too many times when Rowling's original dialogue is ignored and the scenes changed for no apparent reason at all. When real lines are included, they are taken out of context or not used properly at all. It makes me wonder if the actors read the book at all. Mrs Weasly is just a caricature, when she tells Mr Weasly that Fred, George and Ron rescued Harry, her acting makes me cringe, its such a pantomime performance when she is supposed to be really mad!<br/><br/>But perhaps the best example of how the movie completely fails to represent any spirit or essence of the novel is when Malfoy is revealed as the new Seeker for Slytherin and insults Hermione. He calls her a mud-blood, one of the worst and most insulting names for a muggle-born, and yet in the movie it barely gets a reaction. There's no outcry from anyone but Ron, who after a good two seconds of awkward silence says, ""You'll pay for that one Malfoy, east slugs!"" (almost lazily and with very little rage or indignation!). The idea of 'bood purity' is the central concern of the novel, but it's just not explored well at all in the movie. There' barely any passion in the performances, and it makes for a painfully boring and watered down version of the novel.<br/><br/>This is the worst Harry Potter movie out of the four so far made. That said, it does have some redeeming features. I cannot fault the final dramatic sequence within the Chamber of Secrets itself, it's a place not graphically described by Rowling but one which comes to life in the movie, the pipes, the caves and the dramatic entrance door for example. It was sufficiently scary, Harry being chased through the pipes was one of the few really tense scenes of the movie! I thought the diary sequence was done very well, the boy playing Tom Riddle, Christian Coulson was fantastic, brimming with power, arrogance and complexity, easily the best performance of the lot."

","It's Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry despite the pleadings of an imp named Dobby, whom ends up making Harry's foster family hate him more (if such a thing is possible). He has to traverse the Chamber of Secrets to find out who's writing mysterious messages on the school hallways and why people have been petrified. It's up to Harry who has the ability to speak and understand snake talk to save the day. This sequel to an enjoyable little film is better because it can do away with the exposition that the first had to show, and concentrate more on the story, which is deeper and a tad darker than before. I even enjoyed Hermione more in this film, but as is true with the ying and yang, so is true with a hatred of a character in the film, and it's been transfered from Hermione to the awful character of Moaning Myrtle, yea I know she plays an integral part in the plot line of the film, but I still couldn't help but detest her.

"TheArgentWolf","10","1","2","17 May 2005"," Pretty good
","I loved the first movie, and thought that there was no way it could be improved on - but how wrong I was.<br/><br/>It was brilliant, and a great portrayal of the book. Chris Columbus is a brilliant director, and it's a shame he didn't direct Prisoner Of Azkaban.<br/><br/>Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe's acting just gets better and better, and I can't imagine anyone else playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione, because it just wouldn't work. And Kenneth Branagh is SO funny, he's a definite highlight. I think the lack of Sean Biggerstaff wasn't good though, because he's a brilliant actor, and Wood appears in the book a lot more than he appeared in the movie.<br/><br/>I think the way Dobby was made to seem was a bit weedy though....He's supposed to be, but I don't think the design of him was very good, and I don't want to see what house elves in the other movies will look like if this is anything to go by.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked everything, except the scenes in the forest - but that's just my arachnophobia."
"Levitica","Null","1","2","9 November 2004"," If in doubt: Avoid this film.
","If, like me, you found the first film no more than okay-ish, then you will fine The Chamber of Secrets suicide inducing. The acting is no better, perhaps even worse, than it was in the original film, any magical feeling has been lost, and JK Rowling replaced the original villain, Snape, with a scary voice and a big spider, who are most definitely not fit to shine Alan Rickman's cool capey thing.<br/><br/>Every aspect of this story is easily predictable. The film even resorts to word puns that are actually worse than 'What's brown and sticky?' <br/><br/>If you are looking for a fantasy epic, or something to treat your children, do not see this film. If you are looking for something simple to mildly entertain you, save your cash by collecting some annoying stage school children and telling them to harass a spider for a few hours while you go and watch another film."

I find myself saying the same thing about this movie that I said about the last.  It's just way too Disney for me.  I am not saying I am not looking forward to the next movie, because I am.  My feeling is the context of the film seems to drag on, and instead of being really excited of what might happen next, I find myself not being surprised at what happens at all.  I still like the overall look of the film, the actors are good, the direction and the special effects are good, but, I am only just okay with this whole genre of films.  I give it a 5 out of 10.  Maybe renting it would be an even better idea."

The acting was better all round and I can now no longer read the books without thinking of Dan as Harry, Rupert as Ron and Emma as Hermoine. I cant forget the lovely Julie Walters and Mark Williams as the every loveable Weasley parents nor Tom Felton as the nasty Draco Malfoy!! If the rumours are true that J K Rowling based Snape on Alan Rickman, then Im not surprised. He is perfect for the part and Maggie Smith is brill as Professor McGonagall. Its nice to know that Richard Harris died in a blaze of glory by being perfect as Professor Dumbledore. Kenneth Brahangh (sp?) is fantastic as the egotistical Professor Lockhart.<br/><br/>
The effects were out of this world, with the Polyjuice potion and with the Basilik battle at the end. Ive had problems imaging this scene from the books but now Ive seen the film, the scene is clear in my mind!!<br/><br/>
This film is a pure delight to watch and if you were, like me disappointed with the first film, then you will definetly enjoy this one!!! 100% guaranteed!  <br/><br/>Bring on PRIOSNER OF ASKABAN!!!

","I thought the second Potter movie would be much better because I liked the second book a lot more. The book was very funny. I laughed out loud reading the Gilderoy Lockhart parts. But, the movie never made me laugh out. They tried to put some of the funny moments in the book in the movie, but they just didn't seem  very funny in the movie.  The best part about the movie was Dobby. Dobby looked very real, and he was just like what was described in the book.  But, I guess the books just don't make great movies because there are so many great characters and side plots in the books that you can't put in a movie because of time restraints.  The movie is nearly 3 hours, but it just seems rather boring because they try to include as much from the book as they can, so it feels like a lot of scenes are cut short. Plus all the books take place over the course of the entire school year. And it is very hard to make a movie feel like that much time has passed.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Young kids will love the movies. But, for adults, reading the books are much better."

","When I first read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I was blown away by it.  Even better than the first book, it showed all the signs of a classic children's novel.<br/><br/>Therefore, I am quite amazed how someone can transform such an amazing story, into such a dreadful movie.<br/><br/>First of all, lets deal with the acting.  While most adult characters were portrayed admirably, especially Gildroy Lockhard (Kenneth Branagh) and Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), every single kid in this movie was pathetic. Their performances showed the all the professionalism of a bad children's TV program.  Most of the conversation was stiff, and unemotional.<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot.  Whilst I see the difficulty in transfering a book to the cinema, due to sheer length, they really have left out most of the parts which made the book good.  Characters come to conclusions so quickly that you could be left wondering what was going on.<br/><br/>Lastly, the tragedy of hollywood on the film.  The book was filled with classic British homour, and to see the film be such cheesy nausiating hollywood pap, really annoys me.<br/><br/>I'll leave it there because just writing about the film depresses me.<br/><br/>2 out of 10"

","Unlike my earlier comments, the second installment of Harry Potter is surprisingly decent.  Consider each reason that I type here is worth a dollar. (1) The adapted screenplay of Steven Kloves.  The adaptation stayed faithful to JK Rowling's novel. (2) The rather skin-crawling performance of Jason Isaacs.  I think this was his best role since ""The Patriot"" and the best supporting role in the film. (3) The film had excellent plotting.  I was in awe at several unexpected twists the film took. (4) England's A-List reappeared again.  Kenneth Branagh did really well as the self-centered Gilderoy Lockhart. (5) The art direction is still some of the best out there. (6) Daniel Radcliffe will be forever remembered as Harry Potter. (7) The special effects are noteworthy again.<br/><br/>The downsides are...(1) the length, (2) the marketing to those younger than myself, (3) the book will always have the upper hand.<br/><br/>Seven reasons make this movie worth the seven dollars.

","Not a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, I really did not want to see this film.  My boyfriend on the other hand was itching to see it.  Being the generous hearted person that I am, I bought two tickets for him as a present and accompanied him to the cinema.<br/><br/>My feeling is that if you enjoy the books, you'll enjoy the films which are basically an on-screen illustration of the book.  The success of the film depends on the viewer having seen the original or at least be familiar with the story so far from reading the ÂPhilosopher's Stone'.<br/><br/>
ÂThe Chamber of Secrets' has its moments with some memorable scenes (Ron Weasley vomiting slugs; the flying car scene and another Quidditch chase). The special effects are also good; Dobby the house elf is an impressive creation whose computer-generated animation integrates convincingly with the live action.  Julie Walters as Ron Weasley's mother and Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart  are perfectly cast and provide a lot of the fun in the film.  To me, where the film is lacking is in the child leads ÂI just cannot bring myself to care about what happens to them.<br/><br/>So, having watched two of the Harry Potter films, I'm afraid to say that I'm still not a converted fan of the series.  I fail to see the charm of the stories that seems to captivate readers and viewers in the thousands and actually find the whole Harry Potter concept boring.  This feeling is accentuated by the fact that the film is over two hours long which in my opinion is way too long for a kids film."

","Few book-to-film adaptations retain the original gusto of the novel, but this is one of the rare exceptions that proves it can be done. The Chamber of Secrets manages to hit all the high points that made the novel a bestseller. Die-hard fans will delight in the fact that their favorite book passages are almost all accounted for, from the Polyjuice Potion to the famous Wizard's Duel (a personal favorite scene of mine).<br/><br/>The storyline is fairly easy to follow, and the visual dynamics much improved over ""The Sorcerer's Stone."" It's an excellent adaptation and an exciting adventure that pits good against evil in a powerful showdown.Â All of our favorite characters are back again for a second term at Hogwarts.Â Daniel Radcliffe and Tom Felton have beautifully conformed to their roles as Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. It's fantastic to see how these kids have grown, both physically and talent-wise. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are both memorable as Ron and Hermione. Grint in particular has some of the best lines in the film. Some of the best delights, however, come from the adult cast. Alan Rickman, while seriously underused, is deliciously sinister as the infamous Professor Snape, Kenneth Branagh makes a believable and over-the-top Professor Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs is ideal for the villainous Lucius Malfoy.<br/><br/>There's also a delightfully creepy house-elf named Dobby, a few befuddled owls, and a tree with a bad temper. It's a wonderful, swift-moving, imaginative film with a lot of wonderful lessons for children to take heed of -- including prejudice, and choosing between right and wrong. If you have a Potter fan in the household, you'll enjoy the movie for its faithfulness to the book. ""The Chamber of Secrets"" has indeed been opened..."

"E-lentari","6","1","2","7 December 2002"," Watchable, but not great.
","I didn't think ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was an improvement over the first Harry Potter movie.  The special effects were better for the most part, but this time I didn't walk out of the theater with the feeling of having seen something reasonably exciting, magical, well-scripted and entertaining, as I did last time.  The movie looked like a montage of disjointed episodes, each of which was there mainly for the purpose of showing off its special effects.  It had valuable moments (both visually and conceptually, and more of the former), but those were few.<br/><br/>Now, this film is considered by many to be much ""darker"".  I agree: the overwhelming quantity and frequency of various monsters are enough to inflict nightmares on younger children.  Still, the danger almost never feels real, its emotional and visual level remaining at that of a video game.<br/><br/>Of the Harry Potter series, I only read the first book, and although I found it well-written, it was nothing my imagination hadn't been challenged with before.  Knowing that the second film sticks pretty closely to the original, I would say my criticism is directed in equal measure towards the books: despite some entertaining, perhaps even original moments along the way, there is just not enough substance to either the plot or the underlying ideas.  The film medium has a chance to bring out the best in Rowling's writings, which is why in this rare case I prefer Harry Potter movies over Harry Potter books, but these movies inevitably inherit the books' fundamental flaws.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Chamber of Secrets"" wasn't a waste of my time, but it lacked coherence and, more importantly, sincerity and confidence in the messages it was trying to get across, and as a result, it had little impact."

","I too was among the millions of people throughout the world that was looking forward to this movie. I have never even read the books but I still enjoyed the first movie nonetheless. My sister told she that she felt ""The Chamber of Secrets"" was the most boring book out of all the Harry Potter books so I was a little skeptical about this movie. The movie started off with repetitive elements from the first one such as Harry not being able to go to the school etc. It had some humorous moments in the beginning, but I found the flying car to be very cheesy. The imagery in the movie was top notch, sporting some of the best eye candy I've ever seen. Ah, the glory of technology. The cast was very strong because one of the most important elements in sequels is to bring back the same actors that played the characters. History has shown the failure of many sequels because of different actors replacing the originals, it makes a huge difference. Signing these kids to a 3 year movie contract was a brilliant move.<br/><br/>
The movie definitely shines when it comes to the effects and cast, but I feel it didn't deliver in the most crucial step of all, the story. I found the movie to be very slow moving and at times had to stop myself from falling asleep. As far as action goes, it failed to impress me. I wasn't even drawn to the screen until the end of the movie. Harry Potter fanatics will love this movie but regular movie enthusiasts with little interest in the series that have seen the the 1st one shouldn't go in expecting this one to blow the 1st one away. I still feel the first one delivered in all 3 areas: cast, special effects, AND story line.

","This is definetly a children's movie. For children i think this movie deserves an solid ""7"". But as an ""adult"" movie, it is totally boring. The reason that it appeals to such a broad audience, including many adults is the fact that our society is getting very technological in nature. People are overwhelmed by everyday technology and scientific theories so that they are over ""rationalised"". Movies like The Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter present a world that is very opposite : Elves , Ghosts , witches , etc... It allows them to escape into a world where anything is possible , where everything is felt and nothing is rational. In a world where god is replaced by a theory , this is a human phenomenom.

"griffin84","8","1","2","17 November 2002"," A major fan is sadly disappointed
","*For all of you who haven't read the book, I suggest you stop reading now. Spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>For starters, let me say that I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and have been for quite some time.  The books are wonderful, and I was very impressed with the first movie.  However, I have to say that I was expecting more out of Chamber of Secrets than this.<br/><br/>Just like The Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets follows the book extensively well; a person can almost recite the lines from the book directly onto the movie screen.  However, the second Harry Potter movie does not move the audience as the first one did.  Perhaps it is because the first movie did so much introduction, or maybe it is because I've read Chamber of Secrets one too many times (a side effect of waiting for both the movie and the fifth book to come out), but this one seemed to be lacking a lot of what the first movie dished up.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie seems to be centered entirely on Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  OK, they are the main characters, but this does not mean that we have to focus on them and them alone.  Many other major characters are not given a fair time on the screen, namely the professors and other students. Here is the first part of where the movie leaves the book: Chamber of Secrets gave a lot of attention not only to the main crisis (students being petrified), but also to Harry's classes (which, I might add, needs to cut Draco Malfoy and the other Slytherins from it, because all of us who follow the book know that for the first two books, Slytherins only had Potions class with Gryffindors).  The book pays attention only to Herbology because of the significant use of the mandrakes.  Transfiguration is the only other class seen in the movie, and that is barely given any notice at all.  Even though the movie gives more notice to Malfoy (a complaint made by many who saw Sorcerer's Stone), he is cut dramatically from the story, only seen in the sections where he is needed for further plot development; it would have been better if he and the other characters were given more time to be seen, and not as a background.<br/><br/>My other problem, though this one I can let go, is the cutting of my two favorite sections of the chapters: the Deathday party and the Valentine's Day celebration.  John Cleese, reprising his role as Nearly Headless Nick, is given just enough time to be seen before he finds himself petrified, and this is given only a few lines following it near the end.  Anyone who knows the book will know that Nick was a central part of the story and deserves more screen time.  The Valentine's Day section was important because it gave Harry more of a reason to be curious about Riddle's diary, but the movie has it look like he just found out how it worked by pure dumb luck.  Yes, Chamber of Secrets does seem to exist decently without these two sections (more than likely cut out because of lack of time), but I would have preferred to have them in it.<br/><br/>Of course, the acting in the movie is wonderful, just as it was in Sorcerer's Stone.  Kenneth Branagh gives a wonderful performance as Gilderoy Lockhart, but, as stated previously, it would have been better if he were given more time on screen.  All of the returning characters once again play their roles to a `T', with Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermione), Richard Harris (Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Snape), Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), and even all of the returning students performing magnificently.   The special effects are wonderful as well, with eye-popping scenes with Harry fighting the basilisk, the flying car, and the giant spiders, all keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, acting and special effects are not enough to keep this movie afloat.  The movie itself is great, but it is not enough to please die-hard fans of Harry Potter (and believe me, there are plenty out there).  Sorry, but it is this reviewer's opinion that Chamber of Secrets does not live up to its prequel, and it is my hope that Prisoner of Azkaban will save the series."

","I commented on the first HP movie ages ago, without having read the books. Now that I've become totally addicted to them, I just have a little to say about this.<br/><br/>As my summary says, it's not as good as the first, but it's still good. The story is exciting and the special effects are great. Rowling's world is beautifully recreated and the story is enjoyable.<br/><br/>I spoke about the actors in my other review, but, being now familiar with the characters from the books, I can offer a more rounded view.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter. There's no doubt in my mind. The producer who discovered him for the role said he felt as though Radcliffe had a very old soul, and I agree. Harry seems to me to have the same trait. I'm glad Daniel will play Harry in the Goblet of Fire. I'm quite enjoying watching him grow up actually.<br/><br/>I was disappointed to hear that Tom Felton won't play Draco in film 4. The scene in the Slytherin common room was just great. He was so icy and menacing in the way he said ""As for me, I hope it's Granger"".<br/><br/>And again, Richard Harris will be missed. I really hope Michael Gambon (another Irishman, you may not have known) does a good job in The Prisoner of Azkaban, which I'm really looking forward to. Book 3 is my favourite, so I hope they did it justice.<br/><br/>And it's nice to see that the title wasn't changed to suit certain audiences this time around. Let's keep it that way, shall we?"

Kenneth Brannagh was able to perform as himself, playing a character whose reputation far exceeds their actual talent!!<br/><br/>As for the kids - Daniel Radcliffe is very good as Harry a vast improvement on last year, but Rupert Grint & Emma Watson were wooden, ironic in the latter's case when she was petrified!<br/><br/>This film, like the last one, is simply and solely a kid's film and makes NO ATTEMPT to cater for the millions of adults dragged along, as such it doesn't deserve to go into anyone's books as a classic.<br/><br/>All in all Columbus' films and Rowling's books show a great ability to take cliched ingredients from many years of children's books and then cook them into something highly unoriginal, but that kids THINK is original.<br/><br/>Lets hope a new director for the third film employs a better film editor and makes a faster paced and less meandering film in 2004."

","The next installment in the Harry Potter series finds young wizard Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger facing new challenges during their second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as they try to uncover a dark force that is terrorizing the school in this movie entitled,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.This fantasy film is based on the novel of the same title by J. K. Rowling. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. It is the second installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris Columbus. The story follows Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts as the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a deadly monster that petrifies the school's pupils.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger return for a second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Headmaster Dumbledore, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, and Hagrid the Giant are joined by new faculty members Gilderoy Lockhart, a self- centered expert in Defense against the Dark Arts, and Sprout,who teaches Herbology. However, it isn't long before Harry and company discover something is amiss at Hogwarts: Students are petrified like statues, threats are written in blood on the walls, and a deadly monster is on the loose. It seems that someone has opened the mysterious Chamber of Secrets, letting loose the monster and all its calamitous powers. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to find the secret chamber and slay the beast, speculation is rife that one of the heirs of Salazar Slytherin, the co-founder of the school, opened the chamber as a warning against the presence of ""mudbloods"" at the school and that the culprit may be fellow student Draco Malfoy.<br/><br/>First sequels are the true test of an enduring movie franchise, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets passes with flying colors. Expanding upon the lavish sets, special effects, and grand adventure of this Harry Potter film involves a darker, more malevolent tale beginning with the petrified bodies of several Hogwarts students and magical clues leading Harry and his friends to a 50-year-old mystery in the monster-laden Chamber of Secrets.Darker and livelier than the first Harry Potter, but much of what's wrong with the first movie is also present here.Added to that,house elves, squealing mandrakes, giant spiders, and venomous serpents populate this loyal adaptation and Kenneth Branagh delightfully tops the supreme supporting cast as the vainglorious charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart. At 161 minutes, the film suffers from lack of depth and uneven pacing, and John Williams' score mostly reprises established themes. The young, fast-growing cast offers ample compensation and so does the supporting cast. Brimming with cleverness, wonderment, and big-budget splendor, Chamber honors the legacy of J.K. Rowling's novels."

(I really disliked the obvious computer effects in the first part.) And the story was explained better and had a less cheesy end. I am really happy that the Harry Potter movies went into that direction.<br/><br/>The sequel is better than the part before. Maybe this is what shows, that this ""series of movies"" is actually good. Just as it has been with for example Star Wars. The first movie that has been created, is not yet as good as the two following parts. (I am talking about the old Star was movies from the 80's here.) Maybe that is a sing, that the Harry Potter movies will become classics as well? Maybe it will need time for people to realize how great this movies actually are. I personally have to say, that I found the movies better the 2nd time I watched them. There is so much to discover - so much creativity, beauty and fun.

Sometimes it's number 1, but I always juggle it along with Jurassic Park and Empire Strikes Back. To put it simply, everything is right with this movie.<br/><br/>Unlike the first film that made a failthful adabtation, but wasn't dark enough. COS gave us one of the best book to film adabtations, along with making it just as dark as the movies that followed. The acting is much better this time around, and the special effects are incredibly well done. Some may say they look dated, I don't think so, they look just as real to me now as back when I first saw it in 2002, (well OK, maybe that snake during Dueling club looked kind of cheap, but still.) The book isn't my favorite of the series, but the movie gets all the good stuff, while taking out a few things I don't like, such as that Valentines Day thing, and not wasting time when Hagrid is taken to Azkaban and going straight into the forrest.

"rufname-familienname","5","1","3","19 November 2006"," Not bad, if you don't forget that it's for kids
","I actually love fantasy. Well, it doesn't go as far as loving every bad movie if it's only about swords and magic ('Dungeons and Dragons' sucked, for instance), but it's one of my favorite genres. I'm also reading quite some fantasy books, but after having read few sentences of Harry Potter, I decided that it was too much a book for children and thus stopped reading on. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (by the way, the German title would be translated ""..and the Chamber of Scare"") thus is my first deeper insight in Rowlings fantasy world. And the fantasy part of it actually isn't all too convincing. Dumbledore is probably the mightiest magician around, right? So what's he doing instead of saving his school of magical arts? Letting a little boy do the job? Imagine Gandalf not caring all too much about the ring and all that, or imagine Ogion from the (not bad) TV fantasy ""Earthsea"" die from a throwing dagger.. Fantasy movies are all about the magic, and thus the greatest spell-caster should maybe be somehow involved in and capable of saving his world. But then, let me think about it...it's more a movie for kids, right? So the hero must be a kid, even if he seems to be quite uninvolved in the whole plot. And if you try to see it through a kid's eyes, with all those nice effects, everybody flying around, the action scenes and some more or less scary creatures, it's fun to watch. I could even imagine that Harry's two best friends weren't pains in the neck in my point of view if I was ten or eleven years old. 5 out of 10."
"dy158","8","1","3","18 June 2006"," Second instalment works out well too.
","Prejudice starts to become the dominant theme in the second of the Potter series and it certainly does. Who is a pure blood, half-blood, or just Muggle-born? Coincidentally, Ron, Harry and Hermione come under each category respectively.<br/><br/>Our three friends have returned for this second instalment of the popular series only to find themselves in their second year, that something really bad is going to happen in the school they all attend. With even this time Ron's youngest sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) able to attend Hogwarts now, and even a maybe over-zealous Harry fan in the form of Ginny's classmate Colin Creevey (Hugh Mitchell), things are getting more complicated.<br/><br/>Harry realised he can actually speak snake language, something only the descendants of one of Hogwarts' founders, Slytherin, can only achieve. Soon all the accusations that he is the Slyerin's heir (given he is in Gryffindor actually) started to come out. But his two friends and those who believed he is not the Slyterin's heir all stood by him.<br/><br/>Things only get worse when students in the school are getting Petrified, and Hermione is one of them. Soon, Harry and Ron found out all the reasons behind all the sinister actions that has been going on in the school. And it's all up to Harry to save the day.<br/><br/>Finally one can know how the young Tom Riddle (aka Lord Voldermort) looks like, from his memory. As he said that to Harry when they were in the Chamber of Secrets. Well, those who are aware of the instalment will know what happened in the end.<br/><br/>Saw this on DVD as well actually and it once aired on the television here like days after the fourth movie came out in the cinemas. A nice time to refresh the memory and revisiting the old days. The second one does live up to the hype too."
"uknortherner2000","9","1","3","14 February 2006"," A strong sequel, but elements get lost in transition from book to film...
","Chamber of Secrets is the sequel to the widely received Philospher's Stone and a marked improvement over it's prequel in terms of plot and character depth and acting skill by the film's young actors. A lot of this is down to the fact that the book itself is very well written though sadly some elements of it aren't portrayed quite as well in the film.<br/><br/>Like Philosopher's Stone, the line-up is strong, with many well-known names here in the UK (Robbie Coltraine, Alan Rickman to name a couple) that gives this film an air of greatness, and even the film's young stars - Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) exude far greater confidence in their roles this time around and appear to be more at home with their surroundings. Some of this is down to better scripting, some to better acting ability (or training) but a lot of it is simply down to the actors returning to familiar territory.<br/><br/>Many book-to-film transfers usually end up omitting large parts of the plot, or lend themselves to grandiose special effects designed to prop up a weak, or butchered plot. Chamber of Secrets manages not to fall into either trap, although sacrifices were made to the plot to keep everything together in a short time frame.<br/><br/>For instance, seasons pass incredibly quickly in the film. So quickly, in fact that if you blinked, you've probably just skipped a couple of months. This isn't an exaggeration: The book manages to cover several main festivals and holidays that the film simply omits - i.e. Halloween. Moaning Myrtle is introduced in the film for the first time in a girls' toilet. In the book, she is actually introduced to Harry, Ron and Hermione during a Deathday Party hosted by Nearly-Headless Nick on Halloween. Incidentally, the girls toilets are 'out of order' in the book.<br/><br/>Another change between book and film is the introduction of the wizardry version of racism. Although it was a theme touched upon in the first book, here it is the main undercurrent and sits well at home with Harry's arch-nemesis, Draco Malfoy. He almost looks like an advert for the Hitler Youth in the film, and the comments about ""Mudbloods"" - a phrase to describe, in derogatory terms a witch or wizard born from non-magical parents, certainly sit at home with his appearance... Had it been explored further. In the film however, it seems to be reserved for just a couple of scenes, and one of those - the scene following Malfoy's verbal assault on Hermione in the schoolyard, had been re-written so that it seemed Hermione herself took personal offence (being almost reduced to tears), rather than Ron and Harry (and just about everyone else on the Gryffindor Quidditch team).<br/><br/>A few new characters are introduced into the film too, including Ron's sister Ginny, and my personal favourite, Dobby - a house elf, not too dissimilar in appearance to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. He became my personal favourite character simply because of the way he's in constant conflict with himself - ironing his hands or smashing his head against a wall when he lets secrets slip. He provides a lot of laughs in the short time he appears in the film.<br/><br/>An ominous new character is Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father and a holder of many dark secrets, some exposed in the film, but many more left behind in the book. In the book, he shares the same ""racist"" attitude as his son Draco, but is more aware of who he can share this view with, and when it's best to keep his mouth closed. Again, only a part of this is carried into the film. It's not essential, but it certainly adds an extremely dark element to the Harry Potter universe.<br/><br/>Finally, there is Gilderoy Lockhart, an opportunistic fraud whose character carries extremely well from book to the big screen. In the book, Hermione (along with all the other girls) is besotted with him, whilst Harry and Ron quickly see through his paper-thin veneer. This, sadly isn't apparent in the film, which is a shame because it provides for many hilarious moments when he's running scared, with Ron and Harry seeing him for what he is, but Hermione, with having a massive crush on him, seeing something completely different - Bravery, when he was incapable of showing it! One thing that becomes apparent is that Hogwarts seems to go through a lot of Defence Against The Dark Arts teachers...<br/><br/>As a standalone film, it fares pretty well. The characters are strong, and the acting somewhat more believable this time around. The humour's there, and the Harry Potter universe is faithfully recreated, but darker elements have been watered down, possibly to make the film more accessible to children (though it's a children's book in the first place?), or possibly because it was felt that certain elements just weren't needed.<br/><br/>I feel that if you have read the book first, you will be disappointed with the big screen equivalent. I discovered that although I read the book long after seeing the film, it wasn't difficult to see what had been omitted, and I would've felt disappointed with the end result had I know beforehand. But I didn't, and as a standalone film, it's very good.<br/><br/>What does become apparent however, is that as the books continue to grow bigger and bigger, a lot more sacrifices will have to be made in future to try and squeeze a 700-page book (like Half Blood Prince) down to a three-hour film, and I wouldn't envy the person who ends up with the task of doing it! Apparently, Goblet of Fire makes some major omissions (I've not seen it, or read the book yet to draw a comparison, but the book is only a fraction of the size of Half Blood Prince, though it is double that of Chamber of Secrets."

"TxMike","Null","1","3","19 April 2003"," Good second installment in the Harry Potter series.
","Interestingly, most professional critics and many ""users"" say this second Harry Potter movie is better than the first. However, as of this date both of them have identical IMDb ratings of 7.3.  I actually like the first one more, maybe because in it everything is new, and I especially enjoyed seeing how Harry began to recognize his powers, and the introductions of all the main characters and Hogwarts.  Secondly, each character, and actor, is a year older which doesn't always improve them. Like Hermoine, I thought she was much cuter when she was a year younger. Ditto with Harry.<br/><br/>Inspite of all that, I enjoyed the film, and my 8-year-old granddaughter especially liked it, so much in fact that she wanted to watch it again right away.  I resisted, maybe we will watch it again tonight.  A bright spot in all this, the studio made a great decision to avoid over-pricing the DVD. I bought it for $15, now I own the first two, and I expect to buy each of the next as they come out.  Although I'm not really a collector at heart, I figure my grandchildren would appreciate having the full set eventually.<br/><br/>As one would expect, the DVD is very sharp, and the 5.1 surround sound is used very well. Although I have not watched any extras yet, the listing appears interesting and the menu is much more easy to use than was the first one. Overall a clear winner for Harry Potter fans. <br/><br/>(Additional thoughts. Thinking back to various action/fantasy movies which resulted in a series of films, e.g. Back To The Future, Superman, Batman, Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Romancing the Stone, are examples that immediately come to mind, I always found the first one to be the best. Is that because the first movie reveals most of the new secrets of the story, and we find that most interesting? The second, third, etc. in many cases just continue various stories around what we discovered in the first movie? Or do we just quickly become bored with a concept?  Several sequels of superb movies are currently in the make, The Matrix, X-Men, Spiderman, Charlie's Angels come to mind. It will be interesting to see how they do. ""Mission Impossible 2"" is one that I actually like a lot better than the first one.)"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","4","21 April 2009"," Somehow manages to be funnier than the first!
","I really liked the first movie, and I think I like this one more. It's certainly both darker and funnier than the first. This time though, Ron gets the most laughs(""OK can we panic now?""). Here we get introduced to new characters, the standout being Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare veteran, who stole every scene as Gildaroy Lockhart. I loved it when he said ""It's filthy down here,"" the whole cinema were in hysterics at that. Jason Isaacs was menacing too, and Dobby was hilarious with his constant head-banging. Daniel Radcliffe is audibly older here and it does work at its advantage. I thought 23 year old Christian Coulson as Riddle was very good indeed, though Riddle was much scarier in the book. Other scenes of comic relief were provided by Ron's parents, played respectably by Julie Walters and Mark Williams. However, there were still some frightening scenes, and the plot at times seemed to be convoluted. Richard Harris was surprisingly good, considering he was ailing quite visibly, and some months later he sadly died. This movie is fairly faithful to the source material, and manages to have a bit of humour too. All in all, a dark and funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"g-bodyl","10","1","4","26 June 2008"," Even Better than Sorcerer's Stone!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantastic sequel to the first one. In this film, Harry and his friends must unfoil a plot in which the plan is to petrify and possibly kill non-magic students of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The acting is pretty good. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are entering puberty, so their voices are different. Only Grint as Ron was a bit annoying. The supporting cast is great. It's sad that this is Richard Harris's last film. Like most films, the special effects are great. The action scenes in the Chamber of Secrets is fantastic. Quidditch in this film is even better than the first because the Slytherins have a new Seeker that will surprise most people. John William's score is just as good of a masterpiece. This film might be a bit scary for younger children. I rate this film a 10/10."

"uckpshh","1","1","6","23 July 2005"," Likely the worst of the entire anthology.
","This was not only the worst of the books, but is so far the worst of the movies, and because no one can do a worse job than Chris Columbus, it is likely the worst of the seven part anthology. Despite the obvious aging and cracking voices of Ron and Harry, the acting has not improved the slightest bit. Neither has anything really, which is quite pathetic because the point of a sequel is to improve. I just didn't but any of it. The CGI car was the dumbest thing to do, even when it was still the car didn't look real. The adult performances are uninspired and ripoffs of past performances in children's movies. The plot suffers because it does not really move us any farther in the story, instead when we're finished we're pretty much back where we started, Ginnie is back to normal, no one really seems to think anything of the fact that she was the heir of Slytherin, and Harry fights a ""copy"" of Voldemort. I can't really see why Harry returned after his last ordeal in the first one, and the fact that he's returning the third year proves his I.Q. and shoe size are the same. Has he not caught on by now that every year he goes there, someone tries to kill him? And later on in the series people actually die! Lucius Malfoy ran at Mr. Potter with a drawn sword and a house elf managed to stop him?!?! Can anyone explain the logic behind this? Malfoy was a death eater, do you mean to tell me any one of these guys can be put on their backs by an insecure, masochist little elf? Not to mention I think Harry would tell someone that Luscious Malfoy just attempted to murder him. Don't waste your money on this movie, read the book if you insist on knowing what happens in Harry Potter, but as I said before the plot doesn't do anything to move you forward so you may as well skip it altogether. Don't see the first two movies, if you HAVE to see ONE, see the third, which still isn't very good, but it's better than this."
"bryanbezter","5","0","1","21 May 2020"," The movie is too long, and the complicated story is not really convincing
","It is a great story for a novel, but for the movie, it is a bit complicated, which caused the movie to be so long. The cast did okay job. The flying car and ghost effects, costumes, production designs, and properties are well-done.<br/><br/>The visual effects for Dobby and basilisk among others need improvements. Hermione as the only student who knows everything is too much. Harry and friends do all the work, no senior students, teachers or staff did anything to help or could figure it out at all. The main characters are always so lucky and everything always happens at the right time and at the right moment for the sake of the plot.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1) When using the Floo powder, what would happen if there are two places with the same name? If there are multiple fireplaces at the destination, which one will be used?
2) Hagrid found Harry at Knockturn Alley at the exact moment he needed help.
3) How would someone know that there is someone at the other side of Platform Nine and Three-Quarters?
4) How could Ron have the car key?
5) How could Harry and Ron arrive at Hogwarts using the flying car? Is it connected to London King's Cross railway station?
6) How could Dobby put a spell at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters just in time? Was he around there at that time? How could he catch up?
7) When a teacher gives a house points, who writes it down? How does the teacher know about the student's house? Do they remember every student?
8) If a student could get point just by simply answering a question, then it should apply to all actions taken by the students.
9) How could Gilderoy Lockhart the new teacher know the students' name?
10) If the professor could easily lose his wand from Cornish Pixies, how could he become a teacher in the first place? Hogwarts as the best magical school should be questioned.
11) Why were all classes at Hogwarts so dangerous and destructive? Did they not have teaching methodology, system, and curriculum?
12) Why did all students except Harry, Hermione, Ron and Nevile, left the class when the Cornish Pixies were causing trouble?
13) When Harry and friends found Argus Filch's cat, why did Argus, and then the students, and then Dumbledore and other teachers come together just in time?
14) For this movie, only teachers relevant for the movie showed up, just like in the first movie. Except during dinner, of course.
15) It is unfair for heads of houses to be able to give or take points.
16) Audiences and players could die from playing Quidditch.
17) They should have stopped the Quidditch game when the ball was out of control. They did not do anything when it destroyed the stadium. They did not even do anything when it almost killed Harry.
18) Dobby almost killed Harry few times.
19) How could they blame Harry Potter just because he was at the crime scene? Hogwarts is an educational institution, not a drama club.
20) What is required to cast a spell, exactly? Does someone should think about the spell in its mind? Say it out loud? Sustain eye-contact with the object? Need a wand or just hand wave? How could magical object be sentient? How could magical spell be active all the time without eye-contact from the one who makes it? How is someone chosen to be able to perform magic?
21) What does being a member of a house actually mean? Does it teach or give something to its members? If a certain house is bad or good, why is the system still applied? No other houses have been highlighted so far except Gryffindor and Slytherin
22) How could Crabbe and Goyle be stupid enough to eat a flying cake? If it was flying, then of course it was spelled. They should have known it, except those 2 characters were more stupid than Dobby.
23) How did Harry and Ron know that Crabbe and Goyle, and only the two of them, would come out of the room, see and eat the cake without thinking with no witnesses? How did they hide the bodies?
24) Hermione did not lock the bathroom door when she was turning into a cat.
25) Hagrid suddenly found Harry and friends when they were talking about him.
26) Dumbledore and Fudge came just in time before Harry and Ron. They did not see them at all. What made the problem so important that the minister himself have to come to Hagrid's house without assistance?
27) When Harry and Ron came out from Hagrid's house, no one saw them.
28) Why did recovering the petrified students take so long?
29) If the problem could cause someone to die, or even cause Hogwarts to shut down, why did the teachers not form an investigation committee and do something? The senior students could have done something too.
30) How could Gilderoy Lockhart be a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher? Was he not tested and selected?
31) How could Harry easily open the paths to the Chamber of Secrets? How did he know about what to say? Could someone with no ability to speak to snakes open the chamber?
32) Before Harry, Ron, and Lockhart entered the chamber, they should have called the teachers. No one even realized that they found the chamber.
33) The cave-in surprisingly separated Harry and Ron, with Harry on the side leading to the chamber.
34) How could a memory have a body and be tangible?
35) How could Tom manipulate Ginny?
36) If Tom was just a memory, how could he know about recent events?
37) How could Fawkes come just in time to save Harry? How did it know the location?
38) The basilisk should have easily caught or defeated Harry.
39) A piercing sword should have not easily killed the basilisk.
40) Could Tom perform a magic spell? He could write his name using the wand.
41) What proof did they have that Hagrid was sent to Azkaban?
42) Once again, Hogwarts, the best magical school could not even stop another Voldemort-level threat, but 3 young students could. In fact, the teachers were in their way and people were accusing them of terrible acts.
43) What was Tom's intention after realizing the basilisk?
44) Lucius should have been sent to Azkaban instead, because he was the real culprit. There were witnesses that he put the diary at Ginny's basket: Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys.
45) How could the basilisk survive for so long? What did it eat? The chamber's exit was not only the entry way.
46) How did Dobby know that Harry was in danger?
47) What danger could possibly harm Harry, as mentioned by Dobby?"

","Chamber of Secrets captures the best aspects of the Harry Potter series. It's quirky, fun, filled with childlike wonder. Honestly, this was my favorite of the series.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the 2nd of the 8 Harry Potter films. It's a classic gem that holds up well even by today's standards. The jokes are funny, comedy is slapstick, and the plot leaves the audience at the edge of their seat. This is definitely an improvement on the first film IMHO.<br/><br/>Action scenes are great and genuinely tense. The story is great even for someone who wasn't raised in the Potter fandom like myself.<br/><br/>Amazing movie.<br/><br/>4.5/5."

"MGPT80","3","0","3","14 April 2020"," The worst of the series
","Just like its predecessor, Chamber of Secrets is an incoherent mess of a story, loosely woven together with implausible plot leaps. Rowling relies heavily on magic to cover her up her incredibly flimsy writing, randomly inserting illogical events to patch up the jumbled storyline.<br/><br/>It didn't seem possible, but Daniel Radcliffe actually manages to produce an even worse display of acting this time round. His performance is so incredibly wooden it's genuinely difficult to watch the scenes he's involved in. Rupert Grint's pantomime acting is equally painful, but it's Christian Coulsen who manages to scoop the accolade for absolute worst actor in this particular movie, with a truly atrocious portrayal of 'Tom Riddle'. Rowling also takes the cake when it comes to atrocious use of cryptology in a novel; the revealing of the Riddle's identity is so laughable it feels like satire.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the ridiculous runtime. How are children supposed to stay with this film? So much extraneous drivel that could have been excluded, so many pointless scenes. Thankfully, the series pick up from this point on but I can understand why many people would give up on the Harry Potter franchise after the first two offerings. Both the books and films are extremely weak."

"ThomasDrufke","9","0","1","31 October 2016"," Nostalgia
","I love Chamber of Secrets. To me, it's the last Potter film to make me feel nostalgic towards the series. Don't get me wrong, I love all 8 films, but there's something about the campy and all around goofiness to Chamber of Secrets that makes it all the more endearing.<br/><br/>Even though it was filmed merely months after the first film was released; Harry, Ron, and Hermione feel like they have grown so much since their first outing at Hogwarts. I guess that's the feeling you get when you watch the films within days of each other. With that said, we are jumped right back into the fold as Harry is back with his muggle family in England when a house elf, named Dobby, appears and warns him to never return back to Hogwarts. Being that it's the confident and curious Harry Potter we're talking about, of course he makes his way back to the school within a few scenes.<br/><br/>Much like the first film, we have plenty of entertaining side missions for the trio to go on which included; a flying car, taking a potion to disguise themselves as Slytherin, following spiders into the dark forest, and of course some Quidditch. All of this makes for a brisk 2 hours and 40 minutes of wizard fun. But the film isn't short on its eerie reveals, adventurous thrills, and dark storytelling.<br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets brilliantly balances all of that though. Seeing Harry venture into the secrets of Tom Riddle's diary is some terrifying stuff to see as a kid, as is seeing various victims picked off in Hogwarts due to the Chamber being open. And to me, it holds up to this day. There's definitely a more childish tone to it all, but these are 12-year-olds after all.<br/><br/>This film was also a test for Harry, and particularly Daniel Radcliffe, to show if he can truly carry a film or not. Hermione is sidelined for the last 40 minutes or so and Ron is just about scared of anything they come across. If there was ever a question to that proposal, Chamber of Secrets definitely put that to rest. The first film is great, but this was Harry and Radcliffe coming into their own as character and actor respectively. From here on out it's a much darker and relentlessly thrilling take on the character, so I'll always be partial to the lighter tone Chamber of Secrets presented.<br/><br/>+Balances goofy and gripping scenes well<br/><br/>+Chamber fight<br/><br/>+Unsettling reveals<br/><br/>+Plenty of entertaining missions for the trio<br/><br/>9.0/10"

So much going on here: The Weasley's flying British Ford with an attitude, the Whomping Willow Tree, ominous messages written in blood, Moaning Myrtle, a pompous professor, a wand duel between Draco and Harry. R.K. Rowling wisely ""allows"" Ginny to only petrify and not kill Hogwart students. The ""Riddle"" of Tom Riddle. The amazing and funny Mandrake potting class. The monster that gives me chills even on the small(er) TV screen: The ancient giant Parsal-snake, with the Medusea-like power to kill on direct sight, and huge appetite! Stunningly complex backgrounds and sets.

The story is very imaginable and wittily funny, with Kenneth Branagh as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart.

"Leofwine_draca","8","0","1","3 August 2016"," Fantastically old-fashioned magical adventure
","A superior sequel and a bonafide winner, this epic children's movie builds on last year's successful formula to offer a film that is even more satisfying than before. Boasting a bigger cast â by retaining the same principal characters and introducing a handful of new ones â better special effects and an intriguing storyline with just the right combination of humour, death, mystery and puzzles, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a delight to watch. Sure, there are problems too numerous to mention. The plot holes and events occurring which are inexplicable to those who haven't read the books are too numerous to mention. Still, at the end of the day, the primary market for this book is the child audience and almost every child should be enchanted by this film. After all, it's a make-believe fantasy in which good always triumphs over evil and the virtues of friendship, kindness, and nobility are promoted over all else, so what is there to complain about? <br/><br/>Those adults watching the film with their children â or those few watching it on their own â will also find much to delight in. The special effects have improved dramatically and the film is a visual feast. Not only are the sets and locations wonderful â from the stunning exterior of Hogwarts to the numerous creepy passageways beneath it â but the costumes and props are also spot on. Scenes involving the flying car are very well handled and the slimy basilisk â making an appearance at the finale â is an extremely well realised creation, and pretty damned scary if I dare say it. The highlight, however, is the encounter with an army of overgrown spiders, which easily outranks the works of the effects guys who did EIGHT-LEGGED FREAKS, despite the now-familiarity of the menace. Expect the usual myriad of weird creatures and beasties, from Dobby the house elf (with the body of Gollum, the mannerisms of Jar-Jar Binks and the speech pattern of Yoda) to the flying pixies and my favourite, the screaming mandrake babies.<br/><br/>The central trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint return in the leading roles. Grint is as good as last year, although his character is turning into something of a sissy and his repeated screaming and shouting is getting a little overused. Watson is delightful as the know-it-all Hermione whilst Radcliffe has developed his acting skills as Harry â I still think he's pretty colourless but at least has improved somewhat since his last attempt. Expect to see plenty of returning faces (aside from Zoe Wanamaker) all going through the motions with their usual charm â Maggie Smith, the late Richard Harris (his last role), Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, Warwick Davies sadly underused. The new faces also spice up the action, from Miriam Margoyles as the amusingly-named Professor Sprout to Jason Isaacs as a hissable old-school villain. Best of all is Kenneth Branagh who puts in a spot-on hilarious turn as the vain and pompous Gilderoy Lockhart, effectively stealing the show from his fellow cast members. At the end of the day it's just nice to totally immerse yourself in a good, old-fashioned world of magic and wonder and forget about the mundane hassles of everyday life. Now at last modern cinema has the technology to realise such dreams and HARRY POTTER provides such a retreat, for three special hours."

","Continuing my task of watching the harry potter films I have now watched the second film the chamber of secrets. The premise of the film sees harry potter return to Hogwarts where bad things start to happen that seem to involve harry. Daniel Radcliffe plays harry again and he does a great job, this is a more personal story for harry and he does a great job selling the emotional journey harry goes through in the film. Rupert grint is back as Ron weasley and he is good in this film you see his relationship with harry develop as they go through the film and you believe him as the lovable friend. Emma Watson plays hermione and she isn't in the film a huge amount but she does a good job and the trio together are fun to watch. Robbie Coltrane plays hagrid and he does a good job even though he isn't in this film as much as the previous he is an important part. Richard Harris gives his final performance as professor Dumbledore and he does a great job in this film as the mentor to harry that he lacked in the first film. Tom felton as Draco malfoy is more important in this film and he is a good antagonist for harry in this film. The story in this film is much darker and more intriguing then the previous. It is sort of a murder mystery that involves the history of magic and I found it pretty fun and interesting to watch. The script has some decent drama in it especially as the film progresses. However, the humour doesn't really feel natural in this film and I didn't find much of it charming or funny. The style has much better cgi in this film and the action scenes are much more fun. However, like the previous film the pacing of this film is pretty slow and it takes it's time to become interesting. Overall this is an improvement on the previous film and is a great fantasy film."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second novel in the Harry Potter series, written by J. K. Rowling. The plot follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been opened and that the ""heir of Slytherin"" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families. These threats are found after attacks which leave residents of the school ""petrified"" (frozen like stone). Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger investigate the attacks.<br/><br/>The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character is the result of the person's choices.<br/><br/>The film adaptation of the novel, released in 2002, became (at that time) the seventh highest grossing film ever and received generally favorable reviews. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favorable reviews.<br/><br/>The film gives hints which are to be developed later, so we should watch the film carefully."

It doesn't take long after being back that Harry realizes that there are some dark forces at play.<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a good film that manages to have all the strengths as the first film. As with the first movie, this one here is quite strong in regards to its technical achievements. Once again the CGI is quite good and this here is coming from someone who usually doesn't like it. So many movies use CGI so poorly that it takes the viewer out of the story but that doesn't happen here. Instead the CGI perfectly creates this world of magic and it really comes across perfectly.<br/><br/>As I said in my first review, I'm not familiar with the books so I'm pretty much viewing these films blind so I can't compare them to the books or know how much justice this does the book. I think the best thing the film has going for it are the young cast members who are wonderful in their parts. Radcliffe is really believable in the role of the brilliant wizard and I think as the subject got darker here the actor managed to raise his performance level. Watson and Grint aren't as heavily used here but they too are good. Kenneth Branagh joins the cast and delivers some fresh fun. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Richard Harris are all on hand and delivering fine work as well.<br/><br/>I must admit that once again the biggest issue I had with this second film is the rather extremely long running time. Clocking in at 160 minutes the film does manage to move at a nice pace and the magic and excitement are still on hand but at the same time I can't see why the film needed to run this long."

","Still under the helm of Columbus, the franchise thus far maintains its light and child-friendly atmosphere for the most part. Nonetheless, in spite of Columbus' tendency towards the childish and twee, we can see the yummy darkness begin to cast its shadow over Hogwarts.<br/><br/>In some ways, it surpasses the first chapter. The visuals are more convincing; the acting, particularly from the children, is starting to improve; and it's a scarier ride overall. However, as of yet, Harry's story lacks emotional depth, which Radcliffe at this age isn't quite ready to let us explore, and doesn't quite live up to its strong visual effects and wondrous ensemble cast.

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Kenneth Branaugh, Richard Harris: Every bit as enchanting and visually breathtaking as The Sorcerer's Stone. Filled with spectacular detail of massive serpents, gigantic spiders, humungous trees, a flying car, and a bright orange bird of great significance. The Chamber of Secrets is somewhat a reference to Harry who inhabits an ability to understand a language spoken by snakes. Tragedy strikes when bodies are found frozen in shock. Witchcraft is not for children, but Harry conquers a massive foe using practical means. Solid plotting filled with wonder and surprise with director Chris Columbus returning to deliver greater magic. Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry whom must face this disturbing new ability plus face a greater monster. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson return as Ron and Hermione whom assist Harry in his quests. Kenneth Branaugh is a splendid new addition as a flamboyant teacher who presents magic from a situational standpoint but by and large he provides comic relief and a cowardly disposition. Richard Harris returns for the final time as Dumbledore, who is the most power wizard and heads the school. While better than the first film, it is still pointless fun but discernment advised before children view its secrets. Score: 8 / 10"

","Continuing with my annual Harry Potter binge watch, it was time to watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets over the weekend; one of the personal favourites out of the whole franchise. The second instalment picks up a couple of months after the first ends: it's the summer holidays prior to Harrys second year at Hogwarts and he is miserably living back at his Aunt and Uncles house. Harry is visited by a house elf named Dobby who tries to warn him that for his own safety he shouldn't return to school for the following year. The start of this movie also shows us our first glimpse of the Weasley household, Ron's Parents and Draco Malfoys father. Once Harry arrives at Hogwarts, the movie has a very similar feel to the first one; We are taken through the school year at a nice pace with plenty of things happening and several instances where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves in the wrong place at wrong time. The chemistry and on screen friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione grows during this movie and makes for a much better experience as you start to see their personalities much more. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets contains all the values you expect from a Harry Potter movie. Friendship, loyalty and courage are the base of the movies messages and it does a fantastic job of appealing to children and adults alike. Near enough all the cast return from the previous movie and we also get to see several extra characters who slot right into the movie effortlessly. The final scene of this movie is more effective and better made than the first movie and for the first time we get a glimpse of what's to come from Lord Voldermort. We also get some back story through a series of flashbacks which help us gain a better understanding of Lord voldermort and leave us with questions which will be answered in the later movies! I find it hard to write reviews for movies which are in a series as I don't like to give anything away, I won't say anymore now other than, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very well made movie with a long run time which doesn't drag at all. I personally prefer this one to the first and out of all 8 movies its certainly one of my favourites. 9/10"

","This one was wonderfully done!!! WELL, WELL DONE!!!<br/><br/>It's just as if you watched the book, really. They gave everything in the movie what was mentioned in the book and more!<br/><br/>It is:<br/><br/>1.FUNNY thanks to the newcomer Gilderoy Lockhart, who is GENIALLY portrayed by Kenneth Branagh. There has never been an actor except for Alan Rickman who portrayed a book character half so well. Gilderoy must be Kenneth's alter ego, Gilderoy, who is so funny, big headed, incapable and treacherous.<br/><br/>2.SCARY when Harry starts to hear the voice that no one else hears. If you were spooked while reading the book, you will be double spooked when hearing it within the movie with your own ears. It will make you feel as if only Harry and YOU were hearing that voice.<br/><br/>3.INTERESTING while watching the main trio shedding light up on the mystery of petrified scholars. As Harry speaks Parsel tongue, as everything is HOW it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a mixture of the best ingredients a movie can have - fun, fear, mystery, great animation, keeping absolutely to the book, eerie villains... Just immerse yourself!<br/><br/>BRAVO Chris Columbus!!!"

","Not as good as 'The Stoned Sorcerer' â but 'The Chamber of Dirty Little Secrets' is quite entertaining. Ha! I downplayed my opinion way too much. This movie is actually the second best of all the H.P. flicks (yes â I am using some snobby fan-speak for ""Harry Potter""). In the 'Stoner Sorcerer', I was so amazed at the magnificent panorama of Hogs-worthless School and its magical grounds. I was equally intrigued by the cute little cloaked preteens scampering about to and fro. Each of these bewitching little post-toddlers squeaked jolly incantations while idiotically waving about twig-like 'wands?' Can I have a 'sheesh and a wow? By the time 'Chamber-Pot' made its way to the big screen, all the old flash, quickly became old-hat. Don't get me wrong, it was great to see that the main characters, Scary Harry, Ron ""The Weasel"" Weasley and Her-Very-Very-Winey Granger all put some needed distance between the ground and the tops of their heads - alas if only that was enough. It was apparent that this cuddly clan of magical snot-slingers; while growing into a cool trio of thaumaturgy; were not that interesting. These guys were in dire need of back-up. Spoiler Alert â Spoiler Alert â OMG!!! We are first introduced to Dribbly the House Smurf. This little guy is overly clingy and whines way more than Her-Very-Very-Winey - he is such an irritating little toad. How can that be you ask? Please, watch the movie and then you tell me. What is the reason for this thing's existence? Create a massive audience-gag reflex? I have no clue. Oh yeah â he is also supposed be there to suck-up-to Scary Harry (now that is new...so is everyone else.) The next interesting character added is the Queen of the Throne Room â Groaning Girdle. Now she is really a cool character. And what makes her so cool? Well, not only is she a ghost (ooh yes â boo âvery scary)Âand she lives in the toilet (If I were the author, I would have named her, 'Tinkles')Âguess what else she is very good at? Give up? She is ALSO fantastic at whining. If you haven't filled your popcorn bag with vomit yetÂwe are watching different movies. OK â OKÂit may not sound like it, but I did enjoy this movie very much. I did not read the H.P. Library of books, so I am no H.P. aficionado â I just enjoy good entertainment. This is some pretty great stuff and I highly recommend you watchÂwith a bag of popcorn of course."

","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second of the Harry Potter film franchise and again directed by Christopher Columbus. Now the film is the kind of movie that feels like it is made for kids but in truth, is very entertaining for all. I liked the film, and even though I have seen this many many times, I still thoroughly enjoyed the plot and given the massive running time, it is hard to enjoy a movie that is this long after so many viewings.<br/><br/>Now the plot is different from the first movie, it is much darker, much more sinister and could be said to be ever so slightly more violent. Now it isn't so much a scary film, but some kids may not like it so much in areas and very little one's could be frightened so heads up. But anyway back to the plot and it's interesting, yet again mysterious and if you have never seen this before, it is one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>The young characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione come back same as ever, although I did feel this movie explores them a bit more and establishes there personalities even more so than the first. Richard Harris is pretty memorable as Dumbledore, he just becomes the most majestic of all actors here and any scene with him in is engaging and thoughtful at times. Steve Kloves who adapts the books for the big screen for me is one person to mention, he makes the film exciting and although still faithful, adds bits here and there to make it more exciting.<br/><br/>Now Columbus directs this in a way that makes it still faithful to the written material, but brings it into a new cinematic era of fantasy movies and this makes it different from others. Columbus also works well with the actors too, all the cast seem to work well and despite the odd parts of bad acting(to be fair they are young) Columbus uses a steady hand. With the writing and directing comes the absolutely wonderful and beautiful score by John Williams who yet again smashes it and creates some of the best work of his career. <br/><br/>One thing that makes this a step forward in the film series is the humour, now the first movie is pretty funny but this really gets it right and the script is mixed well with drama and comedy. Kenneth Branagh is a great addition as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart who is as vain as he is stupid, and also one of the funniest but kind of silliest things about this movie. Some of the one two's between Branagh and not only Radcliffe, but also Alan Rickman etc, are just fantastic. <br/><br/>I felt the main negatives I see in this are that it is too long, there isn't really a lot wrong with this but the length can really drag this out and although this movie has substance throughout, the repetitive tone can get a little dull. I think of the biggest improvements on the other hand are the special effects which show that not only having a massive budget can help, but also that the film series is so big it can now get that kind of fantastic work done on it. <br/><br/>Overall I felt it to be a good movie and very little has changed in my mind since seeing it last. It is the kind of movie though where you can just see it over and over and still not get too bored, just great fun for all the family and probably the last Harry Potter movie that contains that really sweet feeling the youngsters create."

"msloane1","10","0","1","9 November 2014"," Potter Perfection.
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is n absolutely fantastic movie in every facet. The main movie is very faithful to the book and the extended version is extremely faithful to the book. The main movie covers everything of importance to the plot in pretty much the same order as the book and the extended versions keeps even more elements, some of which improve how well the extended version captures the emotional depth of Harry's story. Daniel and Emma have shaken off their noviceness and show great acting improvement in their portrayals of the main roles as compared to Sorcerer's Stone. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltraine are still fantastic as Snape and Hagrid. Sadly, this is our last of Richard Harris as Dumbledore as he died before this film was even released. Harris was clearly the better Dumbledore and captured the wisdom and grandfatherly mentor of the Dumbledore from the books so well. Then the new cast members are fantastic. In particular, Jason Issacs was PERFECT in the role of Lucius and brought out the ruthlessness and self supposed superiority. The pacing is good. While there are some ""slow"" parts, this is a story that some parts need to be slow in. This movie does a fantastic job of being slow in parts in which the story calls for it, such as when Professor McGonagall is explaining the legend of the Chamber of secrets to the class, and faster paced in parts that call for it, such as the Flying Car scene. The special effects/visuals are massively improved over Sorcerer's Stone. This is particularly obvious in creatures. As opposed to the cartoonish Fluffy and comical troll seen in SS, Aragog is truly scary, Fawkes is truly awe striking, and Dobby feels like a real character. And the set of the Chamber of Secrets itself is much more well done than the chess set and dungeons seen at the climax of SS. Another major plus is that this story, both book and movie, though it retains a strong child appeal element with things like Howlers and Flying Cars it is far less childish than SS and has more emotional depth. The story of people like Hermione, who are looked down upon because of their parentage/background adds more of an emotional twist to the story, as does the danger they face. This leads to another point: There is real danger and real tension in this movie. The tension between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle is palpable and becomes even more palpable when Tom reveals that he is Lord Voldemort. And whereas in SS it really felt all along as though everything would be okay and Harry would triumph, in COS there is a real feeling of danger and a real feeling of doubt as to whether Harry will be able to save Ginny, whether Harry will defeat Tom Riddle, and even whether Harry will survive the adventure in the Chamber of Secrets. A final point is that John Williams fantastic music. The awesomeness of this speaks for itself. I really enjoyed the piece on the DVD where they showed the scene of Hermione's return with the music removed. The scene feels far less fulfilling without music and it was interesting to hear Williams himself talk about this. This movie should not be viewed by preschoolers or kindergarteners because of emotional intensity (Hermione's petrification, the message on the wall about Ginny.) as well scary moments, such as the Aragog scene and the battle in the Chamber of Secrets itself. This movie is perfectly fine for kids in 3rd grade and older. For kids in grades 1-2 in depends on the individual. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an outstanding movie that earns its 10 out of 10. Make sure to see the extended version at least a few times."

","Many people say that Chris Columbus's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) is much better than it's predecessor due to the more, action, entertainment, and thrills, but not with me what I look for in a Harry Potter movie is good action, entertainment, humor,acting, effects (now I do because e I didn't expect these types of effects to be used in Sorcerer's Stone.), and many more. The movie tells the story of while Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe) is back in his Uncle Vernon's (played by Richard Griffiths) and his Aunt Petunia's (played by Fiona Shaw) home with Potter being tortured starved and neglected just like he was in the very first Harry Potter movie, meanwhile while Vernon has guests over and gets distracted talking a little house elf by the name of Dobby (voiced by Toby Jones) comes along to tell Harry not to return to Hogwarts because something very serious that he for some reason doesn't mention because maybe that is all he knows what happened, or whether none of the professors told him that the chamber of secrets had been opened. And of course Potter thinks that Dobby is bluffing because from what I believe he doesn't think that it was possible for someone to get it to open.After the short/rackety and over-dramatic visit that Dobby gave to Harry, then all of the sudden Harry gets rescued by his old friend Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint). One thing that I have noticed while watching the first two Harry Potter movies I noticed that they both reminded me of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy of which I saw earlier this year. There is a lot of things I do love about this movie, of which I love the characters, casting choices, costumes, the magnificent score by John Williams, direction by Columbus, the screenplay, and the visual effects to this movie. This movie is one of the best fantasy movies that i have seen in a very long time, and I hope that I do enjoy the rest of the Harry Potter movies which includes Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Goblet of Fire (2005), Order of the Phoenix (2007), Half Blood Prince (2009), and Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2 (2010 and 2011)."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is by far my favorite Harry Potter movie. In my opinion, it is the only one that follows the entire plot line except a few minor details. The deleted scenes add even more delicious detailing. If these scenes had been in the theatrical release the movie would have been that much better. Perhaps a reasoning behind cutting these is the movie would have been over 3 hours. Chamber of Secrets is already the longest movie in the series and to have a movie over 3 hours could make audience members' attention drift away (unless of course we're discussing Lord of the Rings or something like that). All in all, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the closest movie to the plot and while many fans don't find this to be their favorite movie I deviate from the majority of the fandom."

","Now this is where things get interesting as the series begins it's darker, more interesting traits. Certain elements would follow on as childhood would end, new characters, new creatures and overall some very impressive stuff was being developed. This is what Chris Columbus should have done with the first movie, darken Hogwarts's candle lit rooms, gain more from it's rich characters and enchanted objects. Finally, Hogwarts begins to feel more down to earth, rather than a child-friendly utopia.<br/><br/>""The Chamber of Secrets have been opened, Enemies of the heir beware!"", written in blood as students and teachers flood the corridor. Harry and his friends must discover the mystery, before everybody is doomed to the mysterious fate.<br/><br/>Introducing Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) to the movie. Isaacs is brilliant and arrogant as hell, whereas Branagh is incredibly slimy (Ron's expressions pretty much sum up how the audience should feel towards the character). But aside from that, everything still has its flaws, yet it remains more engaging that the last in both style and substance. Harry and all his friends are given more screen time, and the paranoia between everybody feels like something the series would later greatly benefit from.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Better than the first one in almost every way. But now we lay these chapters to rest, and venture to maturity and the darker tones to which the series is best known for. 7/10."

","Well what could I expect back in 2002. When the second movie came out I was already a fan and I was just a kid so I just wanted to see it and everything was just great and amazing. As long as I saw Hogwarts I was happy. But of course when you get older you start to have an opinion about things. <br/><br/>That Chris Columbus came back for the second movie was a very good thing. Because he already did the first one and the start of the series is especially a children's storybook. And Chris is amazing with that kind of stuff. With films as Home Alone and Gremlins he has proved that he is really good with family movies. So his coming back was just a really good choice and I'm glad he wanted to go on. The second film have added some cast members with actors as Kenneth Branagh and Mark Williams. <br/><br/>A lot of people don't like this film because it is so different from the book but that can be explained. I don't agree that it was such a bad movie. It was November 4th Friday when the world premiere of the first film took place in London. On November 7th that Monday they already started filming the second movie. Warner Brothers had already a release date ready so there was really tight schedule. And the whole filming process had to be done really fast with quite inexperienced actors in the lead role. When I look at the movie Chris did a really great job shooting this movie with these problems. To me Lord Voldemort looked really dangerous in this movie. And really scary at times. I think Christian Coulson did an ingenious job playing the part of Tom Riddle. He played it with moments of so much anger but sometimes also with moments of arrogance and pride. This w movie was also the last movie of Richard Harris- at least his last big role. And when re-watching this film sometimes I really look very closely at him. He played the role even better than the first. And it was so sad Richard passed away. It was real loss; We actually lost our Dumbledore that's how it felt. And I knew that there would never be a good Dumbledore after this movie. You also can see that Daniel, Rupert en Emma get better with every new Harry movie. It is fun to see them grow as actors and they really get better with every movie. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the special effects in this movie. Stuart Craig did such an amazing job throughout the entire series. And I dare to say that he was one of the most important people who worked on Harry Potter. I respect this man very much, because he did very great things to the look of the castle. It is nice to see that Hogwarts changes every year. But the effects in this movie were really great because Stuart doesn't use so much CGI. And I love that. The basilisk for example wasn't CGI. Even Dobby wasn't CGI. It was just a Computer animation just as the Pixies. I think this fit really well for the films and it never looks fake. Even after 12 years it doesn't look fake and it never will. Just because this is the right way to create this things. <br/><br/>Something I want to add in this review is the role of Ginny. I think Steve Kloves did not a very good job with her and Ron. In the Books Ginny is a really cool and interesting character, but in the films poor Bonnie Wright doesn't even have the chance to prove herself as a good Ginny. They could have done a much more better job by just giving Ginny more a character. It is nice to see her more develop in the series but it just could have been done better. But Bonnie Wright tried in did a good job as far she could do it. It give this film 10 out 10 because I still really enjoy this film. Amazing performed by all the actors, amazing storyline. Because with Harry Potter you need to listen to the book really good. The music in this film is also amazing and epic. I am satisfied. R.I.P.Richard Harris still you are dearly missed today. Our Perfect Dumbledore."

","The first sequel to ""Harry Potter"" is absolutely fantastic, far better than the original one. Or, I should say, despite some uneven pace and tone of the film, it is much more three- dimensional and complex, giving us what we want: theills of fantasy. Harry Potter is in the second year at Hogwarts, and now is ready to go back to the school, in spite of the advice given by strange creature called Dobby, who shows up before him to warn that very bad things would happen if Harry goes back. But Harry ignores his warnings anyway, and starts his new year at the school, only to find weird occasions that remind him of Dobby's words. And finally, he is to know that ""The Chamber of Secrets,"" about which no one (including the teachers) knows -- its existence, its location, and its terrifying secrets -- is opened by someone inside of the place, and students start to fall victims to it. Can Harry stop the danger, and regain the peace for the school? The premise seems similar to that of the original film, but the overall tone of the film gets darker and more sinister. It is possible that some of the pre-teen kids might find the film too scary at some time (especially they don't like slugs, spiders and snakes), and perhaps adults find it the same way. Don't underestimate the film's dark elements any more. But the most remarkable thing about ""Chamber of Secrets"" is its hugely improved CGIs, reflecting the filmmaker's confidence coming from the commercial success of the previous one. The match of Quiddich is again used as one of the highlights, and the newer game scene is simply great, much better than the first one. With enhanced sound effects, the fight between Harry and Malfoy looks more realistic, even frightening, flying all over the ground and stands (and unbelievably, under them). The only weak point is its new character Dobby, created all by CGIs, which still looks unnatural sometimes. Moreover, in the opening sequence, the film attempts to get laughs using Dobby not so effectively, making him a bit irritating creature like Jar-Jar Binks or Scooby-Doo. But wait a while, and see Ron's family is introduced, including ever delightful Julie Walters (""Billy Elliot"") as Ron's mother. Another new character is given by Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, a new teacher (and a celebrity) at Hogwarts. Obviously he is a comic relief, and Branagh is surprisingly good, this time not resorting to his overacting tendency that destroyed Woody Allen's ""Celebrity."" And don't miss the brief scene after the end credit roll. Daniel Radcliffe is as good as before, and so is Rupert Grint (in fact, they are giving the best acting in the film), but most regrettable is Emma Watson's Hermione, who is given much shorter time on the screen. All the actors are good, but their presence seems to be rather sacrificed to establish darker images of the school. So, John Cleese is allowed to speak very briefly only twice, and even Maggie Smith and Allen Rickman are not allotted enough time to impress us. You brink your eye, and you will miss Fiona Shaw! It is, however, undeniable that the film went through great improvement, and it explores much darker side of magic, which gives more thrills to adults and children alike. But how will they keep this pace in the future? Is it possible to combine evil elements with the concept of family picture? That is my only concern, and the second sequel would show the answer."

","The on-screen adaptation of the sequel to Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone takes us on yet another whimsical journey of magic & wonders and covers Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry. Also, although it is a pretty faithful adaptation of its source material, it doesn't add anything new at all to the world we already witnessed in its predecessor and simply moves the story forward without providing any improved feeling of freshness or excitement.<br/><br/>Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets begins with Harry Potter being warned by a house-elf against returning to Hogwarts which, as obvious, he ignores. With friendship getting stronger & rivalries becoming more intense, the second year is full of surprises for our young wizard but Hogwarts soon turns from Harry's safe haven into a gravely dangerous place when the Chamber of Secrets is mysteriously opened & more people end up getting petrified by a curse. And once again, it all comes down to Harry Potter to save the day.<br/><br/>Directed by Chris Columbus, this sequel comes from the same cannon Harry Potter & the Philosopher's Stone came from, considering that there isn't any noticeable change in the film's outlook or feel. The screenplay follows J.K. Rowling's novel closely for the most part but it's a little tiresome affair this time & runs a little longer than it should have. Rest of the filmmaking aspects are mere re-enactment of the previous chapter although John Williams offers a more evolved score to go with the film's events.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the child actors exhibit a little improvement in their given roles but there are moments featuring them that are still silly & annoying. Visual effects are a bit dated just like its predecessor and it just doesn't have the tension despite being a fairly grim story. Also, the climax is a bit too predictable, even for those who haven't read the book. Fortunately, not everything is bad here as the humour is wonderfully timed, the set pieces still hold up well & it boasts few impressive sequences.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets can be argued as a better or weaker sequel to the first chapter but for me, this was simply an exercise in monotony that could've benefited from a slightly enhanced presentation. Alas, it still manages to keep the magic alive although the effect of the spell wearing off can clearly be noticed. Neither better nor worse but very much on the same scale as its predecessor in my opinion, Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is worth a watch, at least once."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) suffers from many of the same flaws as the first movie: it's trying so hard to be faithful to every detail that it slows down the pacing, the child actors are awkward and stiff, and the direction is overall uninspired.<br/><br/>However, this is undoubtedly more watchable than Sorcerer's Stone. For one thing, it has more atmosphere. Like the novel, it's Gothic and mysterious. Details such as the echo of the basilisk slithering throughout the castle, the ominous Chamber of Secrets, and the enigmatic depiction of Tom Riddle are all well-realized. The climactic battle between Harry and the basilisk still gives me chills after all this time.<br/><br/>Luckily, Chris Columbus was outed once the producers got to the next film. They put in an accomplished director, Alfonso Cuaron, and the movie franchise was all the better for it."
"OllieSuave-007","8","0","1","4 March 2014"," Magical sequel.
","Based on the book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, this is the second film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story about Harry Potter who is rescued from the clutches of his neglectful aunt and uncle and a bratty cousin from his Hogwarts friend, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and taken back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in a flying car. From this scene on, you will know this will be an magical and adventurous movie filled with surprises and spells. Harry ends up back at the school, despite warnings not to return, and hears mysterious voices from inside the school's walls. He also learns that muggle-born students (students born from humans, not witches) are being attacked and soon everybody discovers that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. What follows is a daring mission to discover the Chamber and to solve the ongoing crises. <br/><br/>Witches Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and the school's all-powerful headmaster, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris), return in this sequel, providing another mystical performance. <br/><br/>Like the first film, I think this movie followed J.K. Rowling's novel very well, including in it most details that capture the imagination, magic, adventure and drama of the story. Director Chris Columbus and the team of writers and special effects people gave again a pretty entertaining and believable movie, with some more heart-pounding action than the previous film. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a good sequel and I think is one of the best in the series altogether.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

"grantss","6","0","1","26 January 2014"," OK, but not great
","The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was due to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to the characters and concepts of the series.<br/><br/>This, the second, uses that template and provides another plot. The plot is fairly mundane and overwrought. At nearly three hours it is ridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.<br/><br/>This is all said, there is a momentum that keeps it going. There are some new concepts and characters. All this is enough to make it marginally likable (hence the 3/5).<br/><br/>High points for me are the acting of Kenneth Branagh and Alan Rickman, and their characters' rivalry.<br/><br/>The worry is that if the Harry Potter series has run out of steam this much since the first movie, what will the eighth movie be like?"
"purplelua","8","0","1","23 December 2013"," A Great Sequel, but Not as Good as the First Film
","After the success of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, it was a very hard film to beat. I was worried Chamber of Secrets wouldn't live up to my expectations. It seems I was right.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong here. This film matches the standard of magic, sets, action and acting. It is simply amazing, no doubt about it. I wanted something more, however, something mind-blowing. That spark just wasn't there.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the addition of other stars made this film more sinister and, in some cases, funny. Jason Isaacs as Draco Malfoy (the awesome Tom Felton)'s Father was ideally cast. He had the image and the villainous voice that just made me want to punch him. Kenneth Branagh very nearly steals the film as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, a cocky teacher who is revealed to be a fraud and a faker.<br/><br/>Once again, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter played his part very well, better than he did in Philosopher's Stone. Rupert Grint again plays his comedy role of Ron Weasley brilliantly. Emma Watson reprises her role as smart Hermione Granger, clearly enjoying herself. Bonnie Wright as Ron's younger sister Ginny Weasley deserves a mention, too, even though she had so little screen time, she still played an important role in the film, which saw her being revealed as the person who opened the Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, everything is all bright and chirpy, but towards the end it gets darker. The showdown between Harry and a big Basilisk snake will leave you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is brilliant, but just didn't top the first Harry Potter film."
"SnoopyStyle","7","0","2","21 December 2013"," Good continuation but Chris can't quite deliver the knock out punch
","The franchise continues in the second movie in the series. There is a good step upwards in the quality of FX, CGI, and sets. We get introduced to Dobby, the house elf. He's a good CGI character. More importantly, he's a likable character which is so different from a certain Star Wars character who shall not be named. It's a big relief that Dobby is a good success.<br/><br/>If there is something missing, it's a darker and scarier Chamber of Secrets. With so much built up, the final section should be a more thrilling and scary ride. It's like a horror movie that doesn't deliver in the end. I think Chris Columbus has reached his limits. It's just not in him to deliver the mood, the thrills, or the scary moments."

"mrrockey","7","0","1","15 September 2013"," A Fun Ride for the Entire Family
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second installment in the long-running Harry Potter series. It's usually ranked as one of the lower films in the series but does that mean it's a bad film? Well, let's take a look and find out, shall we?<br/><br/>The story here is actually an improvement over The Philosopher's Stone. In that film, we spend a lot of time sucking up the magic and wonderment of Hogwarts but we don't get a whole lot of story. Chamber of Secrets on the other hand, is a lot more plot-driven. Almost every scene in this film has a plot point in it and this is a good thing because it makes the film feel a lot more brisk in its pace despite the runtime.<br/><br/>The story here is also much more compelling than The Philosopher's Stone. This film builds a lot of mystery with the voice Harry keeps hearing, Harry speaking Parstletongue, Tom Riddle's diary etc. If you haven't read the book, you most likely won't be able to see where this is all going and it keeps the audience engaged to the very end.<br/><br/>This film also has a more ominous tone to it. In the first film, there's a few dark moments here and there such as Voldemort drinking unicorn blood or Quirrel getting his face melted off but overall, it's a very safe, family-friendly picture. While this film is still family-friendly, it has a lot more darker implications. We have implications in here of racism, murder, death, and even slavery. These are certainly dark themes to put in a children's movie but Columbus manages to strive a good balance between the darker themes and the whimsical tone. There's still a lot of humor and whimsic to this film and it helps appeal to the kids but it doesn't feel too childish for adults either.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are also a step up from the first film. In the first film, Radcliffe was a little wooden at times and so was the rest of the trio. You can definitely tell that they were inexperienced but they still did alright jobs. In this film, the trio seem to be much more comfortable in their roles. Radcliffe is capable of much more complex emotions this time around and he carries the film well. Rupert Grint's acting is a little exaggerated at times but he does so in an entertaining way and he provides good comic relief for the film. Watson seems to be much more relaxed this time. In the first film, she looks like she tried really hard to act smart but in this film, she seems to not need to try as hard which shows that she matured as an actress. And of course, the adult actors are great, particularly Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart who makes you both love to hate him and laugh it him.<br/><br/>However, I do have some issues with this film. I feel that some of the plotting is a little ridiculous. For example, it's revealed that the basilisk kills people by looking at them in the eye but the reason that no one's died is that they only accidentally looked at him, not directly. That has got to be one of the biggest coincidences in the history of film! There's way more ridiculous plot points than that but I suggest you to watch ""Everything Wrong with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" on Youtube to get everything else.<br/><br/>I also feel that a lot of the CGI in this film has become dated. I think the basilisk and the spiders look good but most of everything else is kinda dated.<br/><br/>Overall, while it does have some stupid plot conveniences, it's a fun, engaging, and well-made mystery-fantasy film that should please the entire family. I'm gonna give it a 7/10."
"KaDaWe","9","0","1","18 August 2013"," Great Adaptation By Columbus, Sadly Weakest Potter Story
","Watching all ""Harry Potter"" movies I have to say that there was one weak director (Yates), two good one's, but one who really stood out - and it's Chris Columbus. Nobody of the other three guys got it done so beautifully to make a film out of this amazing story of the wizard world around Harry Potter. <br/><br/>The great thing in Columbus's Potter's is that nearly everything is like it's described in the books, and it should be the case. He didn't change many things, the important scenes are all included and there are no new story lines like in the last movies.<br/><br/>So, why ""just"" nine points? The reason is that in my opinion ""The Chamber of Secrets"" has the weakest narrative of all seven books (or movies). Don't get me wrong, it's still unbelievably good and exciting, but for me, it's just the least great.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Awesome movie, nine out of ten points, and sadly the last Potter with Chris Columbus as director and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore (RIP Richard Harris, the greatest Dumbledore the world could imagine)."
"user-543-975655","7","0","1","26 July 2013"," Very Good Movie
","I have just watched the second Harry Potter movie again and I thought I should review it this time. First off, I would like to say that this was one of my favorites of the series, because it is not all happy sunshine and roses, and yet not super dark and sometimes frightening Deathly Hallows type of a movie. I like that. I will start with the acting. Fantastic by all, and great in special effects scenes. The best acting job for a woman was by Maggie Smith, or Minerva McGonagall, in my opinion. She had a straight face and never broke character at all in the entire movie. The best acting job for a man was by Richard Harris, or Albus Dumbledore, also in my opinion. All of the other acting was still good. To the dialogue. It was also great. Not cheesy, but still good enough to have a little bit of humor here and there around the film. Now the characters. J.K Rowling was very creative writing this book. She actually came up with the names for the characters from constellations and mythology, like Draco Malfoy, from the Draco constellation, and Remus and his brother Romulus Lupin, first names coming from two children in Greek mythology who were raised by wolves, and Lupin means wolf in Latin, I think, but I'm not sure. And of course, the special effects. They were awesome! A break from the completely CG world of movies today. It had some CG, but only when it was necessary. When it was not, they had extremely realistic huge figures, that at times, looked like they were real. Good job special effects guys! Lastly, the only reason I give this a 70% is because it is a little bit too long (I would have given it an 8).<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 70% because it has awesome special effects, good dialogue, and great acting, but it is a little too long. Thanks for reading!"

","'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' follows a similar tale of events to the 'Philosopher's Stone' movie however is superior in almost every aspect.<br/><br/>Darker in ambiance, larger in scale, more daring, more interesting and an awesome climax. These are the ways in which the 'Chamber of Secrets' improves on its predecessor; this is largely due to the stimulus from Rowling although credit to Columbus for anchoring a darkened atmosphere and marking the whole package an intriguing piece.<br/><br/>With Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in preparation for his second year at Hogwarts, Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) refuse to allow him to go following Dobby the house elf's (Toby Jones) antics at a family meeting. Knowing magic was used, they believe Harry to be the culprit. When, Ron (Rupert Grint) and his family rescue him though, he and Ron are unable to make it to Gate 8 3/4 when someone has tampered with its wall portal. As they make it to Hogwarts later than expected, dark forces return to Hogwarts once more. Once more, Harry looks to save the day and believes using Tom Riddle's diary, he can get to the bottom of the sinister goings-on. <br/><br/>The films ambiance is - like I've already stated - rather dark, in comparison to its predecessor and parent may want to consider whether any young children should be given the freedom to watch it.<br/><br/>Other than the above, this film will suit the majority of audiences as Columbus once more succeeds in completing another successful installment of Rowling's Potter novels, before distributing it on film."
"Dannov747","6","0","2","5 December 2012"," Underrated
","In Harry Potter: The Chamber of Secrets, the writers and director again stick faithfully to the book, capturing almost every detail and in the process, make another brilliant movie. The criticism this movie receives has some truth though. At 2 and a half hours long, Chamber of Secrets is one of the longest Harry Potter movies, strange considering it is one of the shortest books. Some scenes could and should have been left out, and others did not have the greatest writing. Also, the soundtrack is for the most part a repeat of the first movie (although for me, that isn't a bad thing, later movies did not match the soundtracks of the first two.) Despite all the faults, Chamber of Secrets does a superb job of capturing the adventure and mystery of the books, perhaps better than any other Harry Potter movie does. <br/><br/>While the length and many details could leave some slightly bored or confused, if you approach this movie with enough patience you will have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>8/10"
"parallel_projection","8","0","1","17 August 2012"," Solid adaptation of the novel
","This movie is just as good as the first, and although it is definitely a bit longer, it has much more action and mystery. It also tended to stay rather true to the book, although many scenes did have to be deleted in order to cut down on the running time, but that is understandable. <br/><br/>Chris Columbus does a great job again--there are some wonderful sweeping shots and some beautifully filmed scenes, especially towards the end when they are in the Chamber. This film is also a bit darker than the first one, so the lighting is toned down a bit, and many scenes occur during the night. Additionally, and interesting choice was made during a flashback in which everything is very dull--almost black and white--except Harry, who is in full color.<br/><br/>The acting from the younger cast is definitely improved from the last time, namely Daniel Radcliffe, who seems a lot more comfortable as Harry. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do fantastic jobs again, and seem to have improved even further. I would also point out Bonnie Wright, who actually had a decent role in this film, and does a good job when it counts. The more experienced cast of course is amazing, especially the new additions, Kenneth Branagh, who is simply hysterical in his self-centered role, and Jason Isaacs, who plays Malfoy's sinister father. Richard Harris is also wonderful in what turned out sadly to be one of his last films.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is entertaining an has action, mystery, rivalry, and even the very beginnings of a love story, so you really can't go wrong."
"classicsoncall","9","0","1","22 April 2012"," ""It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices.""
","'Chamber of Secrets' builds on the intrigue and excitement of the first film in the Harry Potter series - 'The Sorceror's Stone'. It's cool to see the main characters grow and develop in their roles, now in their second year at the Hogwarts School. If anything, this film has even more action and adventure than the first, though for youngsters it might require a bit of caution. There are some unusually harsh and brutal scenes here, like that aggressive tree the boys land in with the magical Weasley car, and the monstrous basilisk that Harry battles near the finale. At nearly three hours, the film doesn't seem to have many slow spots, although the repeat of a quidditch match from the first picture seemed unnecessary for me.<br/><br/>New characters added to the mix include Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), father of Harry's student nemesis Draco (Tom Fenton), Kenneth Brannagh as the scurrilous Defender Against the Dark Arts, Bonnie Wright as Ron Weasley's sister Ginny, and the computer generated elf Dobby, reminding me somewhat of the Gollum character in the Lord of the Rings series. Principal players from the first picture seem to have been underused, like Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman, but not having read the books, I'm sure their characters have larger roles to play in the films I haven't seen yet.<br/><br/>It probably seems odd that I'm reviewing the films in this series so late in the game, but I'm not really a fan of the Harry Potter books or their transition to film. However now that they've all been released to the big screen I can watch them in order without having to wait a year or two between pictures. I found the first two to be entertaining enough with the type of whimsy and magical elements I enjoy in a well done film, so I look forward to the rest in due course."

","Harry is back in the second installment of Harry Potter, also directed by Christopher Columbus. Puberty is beginning to start for both the fictional characters and real kids, and they will be forced to be even more daring than before.<br/><br/>Harry is anxiously awaiting his return to Hogwarts, desperate to get away from the Dursleys. He is more than surprised when a strange looking creature (a house elf) named Dobby appears in his room to tell him he must not go back to school. Dobby warns that Harry's life will be in danger if he returns, and gets him in enough trouble so that the Dursleys lock him in his bedroom. Luckily Ron and his twin brothers Fred and George (James & Oliver Phelps) rescue Harry in a flying car to take him to their home. Harry feels much more at home in the Weasley house with the warm parents (Julie Walters & Mark Williams) and slew of kids. There are some new faces at Hogwarts this year, including Ron's little sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright), the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), who talks more about himself than the defensive spells, and Draco's equally arrogant father Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs). Harry, Ron and Hermione are still happy to be back in school until some strange things begin to happen, and several residents of the castle become petrified. The explanation is that the legendary ""Chamber of Secrets"" is opening again. The Chamber is a hidden tunnel in the castle where one of the four founders of the school, Salazar SlytherinÃ¢â¬âa known muggle-hater, is said to have hidden a monster that would kill all muggle-born students. The Chamber can only be opened by the heir of Slytherin, and everyone has their own ideas about who that might be. Dumbledore and the other professors are concerned for the safety of their students, and Hogwarts is in danger of being closed. That is of course unless Harry, Ron and Hermione find the Chamber of Secrets, the monster, and the heir who opened it.<br/><br/>This is a decent film, and matches well with The Sorcerer's Stone. It is the longest of all eight films at nearly three hours, and can sometimes be hard to sit through all the way. However, the length allows it to be quite loyal to the book which is a definite positive. The acting has clearly improved, especially for Daniel Radcliffe. The audience gets a good establishment for Harry's relationship with the Weasleys and Dumbledore, as well as Ginny's crush on Harry. This is, in my opinion, the only film where Bonnie Wright acts sufficiently. Lucky for the viewers too, because this is probably the film she has the most to do with the plot. Kenneth Branagh is hilarious as Professor Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs also does a good job of playing Lucius Malfoy. Sadly, this is also the last film that Richard Harris is able to play Dumbledore. For many fans, Harris is the superior Dumbledore and I would have to agree. His whimsy, expressions and subtle humor are done so naturally it's almost like the role was written for him. The set and wardrobe are the same from the year before, and still fantastic. The plot is carried over well, the new characters fit in great, and the kids are truly becoming Harry, Ron and Hermione. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good follow up to the first film."
"leplatypus","10","0","1","12 March 2012"," there isn't secrets: it's Colombus + Williams + Harris
","This is for me the best of the series and it goes as well for the book, the game and the movie. It's the quintessential Potter spirit because it has all the goof things I look for: the school year, the wizardry, the friendship and the mystery. I remember the first time I saw it: it was during a Wednesday baby-sitting of the son of a good friend: He was 6 then and we kept playing the scene when the Spider comes up at the car's window. It's true that the production is less baroque (cheaper?) than the later movies but at last, the young trio is still well coached and the visual stays very realistic even if it's about an imaginary universe. If Hermione takes a health leave, Ginny makes a brilliant substitute and it's funny to see that she has always been this same quiet, shy girl. But this movie counts for me because it's the last of the real Dumbledore. Richard Harris was the perfect choice: his weary voice (a bit like Pacino) and his aura makes him a very warm grandfather and a respected headmaster. Gambon never gets into the robe and it's a pity that Mr. Harris couldn't follow the adventure."

But a few days before he is supposed to attend school, he meets Dobby, an house-elf. Dobby warns him not to go back to Hogwarts for strange and terrible things are going to happen. Harry doesn't heed Dobby's warning. He continues with his original plan- attend school in Hogwarts. But maybe he should have listened to Dobby, for strange and terrible things did indeed happen- things that involve the mysterious Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>I don't know what it was about this film that made me remember it the most from all the others I watched when I was younger. Maybe it was because of the mystery that it gave. (SPOILERS:) I remember being really scared of the basilisk scene. (/SPOILERS) It's a wonder that I didn't feel scared while going watching it. I guess things do change.<br/><br/>In this film, I enjoyed practically everything. I enjoyed the mystery that it gave. I enjoyed the school work that it showed- simple things like Professor Sprout's class, the Quidditch match (of course), and even Gilderoy Lockhart's class. (SPOILERS:) In the succeeding films, that's one factor that I miss the most. The simple school work that this film (and the previous one) showed. It just made Hogwarts seem like an actual school. (/SPOILERS) And most of all, I enjoyed the satire and humor. Rupert Grint was hilarious, without even trying. Props to you, Rupert!<br/><br/>This film has a long run time- 160 minutes. However, I must give props because it certainly didn't feel that long. I didn't feel bored while watching it in 2002 and I certainly didn't feel bored while I watched it again today.

","It's interesting to watch a sequel to a movie. Sometimes the sequels are well made, sometimes, if not most times, they aren't as good. But I noticed that if a movie is based off of a book series... then it tends to be well done, even if the books may have not been the greatest, or if the movie wasn't completely true to the book. However, with Harry Potter, it seems as though the first two movies are well done. The second being better than the first, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I noticed the characters that we met are now being developed more, which is good. I noticed a bit of confusion as far as who was the badguy and what was he doing. However, all in all I was quite impressed with the special effects of course, as well as just the way the story continued.<br/><br/>Rated 8/10."

","The Harry Potter film series is an interesting exception to the oft-quoted ""rule"" that sequels are never as good as the original films and that the more sequels a franchise spawns the worse they become. Most film sequels are ad hoc affairs; a film does well, so a team of scriptwriters are hired to cobble together another screenplay based around further adventures involving the same characters. The Potter series, however, is different; it is based upon a series of novels which were in themselves conceived not as isolated stories but as episodes in one greater story. It is, therefore, not surprising that the series has not succumbed to the sort of slapdash writing and money-grubbing cynicism which mark the later episodes of certain film franchises.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was the second instalment in the series and appeared in 2002, a year after the first, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"". It follows the adventures of Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger through their second year at Hogwarts School. The plot is too complex to set out here, but it revolves around a mysterious ""Chamber of Secrets"" which is said to exist somewhere within the school and to contain a monster. The Chamber can only be opened by the ""heir of Slytherin"" (one of the four wizards who founded the school), leading to much speculation as to who this might be. Memorable scenes in the film include Harry and Ron's journey to school by flying car and Harry's final confrontation with the basilisk.<br/><br/>This is the first film in the series to explore one of J. K. Rowling's main themes in her novels, the conflict between those wizards, like the Malfoy family, who regard themselves as ""pure-born"" and those, known by the derogatory term ""mudblood"", who have some Muggle (i.e. non-magical) ancestry. (Rowling uses this conflict as an allegory for real-world racism). Mysterious messages appear proclaiming that the ""heir"" will kill all ""mudbloods"", and it is revealed that Hermione herself is a ""mudblood"".<br/><br/>This was the last film of Richard Harris, who died not long after completing shooting and before it actually opened in the cinemas. Harris knew that he did not have long to live while making the film, and this is evident in his moving portrayal of the headmaster Albus Dumbledore, wise and benevolent but ageing and conscious of his fading powers. Kenneth Branagh makes his only appearance in a Potter film as the vain, self-obsessed celebrity wizard and best-selling author Gilderoy Lockhart who is appointed Professor of Defence against the Dark Arts; he perhaps represents Rowling's comment on modern celebrity culture. (Or perhaps on some of her fellow-authors). Other notable performances come from John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, one of the school's many ghosts, Jason Isaacs as the villainous Lucius Malfoy (father of Harry's enemy Draco) and Julie Walters as Ron's mother Molly. One character I could have done with less of was Dobby the House Elf, who with his irritatingly whiny voice threatened to become to the Potter series what Jar Jar Binks was to the ""Star Wars"" franchise.<br/><br/>Another criticism I would have was that the film was perhaps too long; it was criticised for sticking too faithfully to the plot of Rowling's novel- an ironic criticism, given that some of the later films were criticised by Potter devotees for precisely the opposite reason. Nevertheless, this is overall an excellent film, and a worthy successor to ""Philosopher's Stone"". Both these films were directed by Chris Columbus, and they tend to be lighter in tone than many of the later episodes in the franchise. Despite this lightness in tone, however, Harry and his friends must frequently come face-to-face with danger, and as in any good adventure story the excitement and the satisfaction we derive from the film lies in seeing how they use their courage and resourcefulness to overcome the forces of evil. 8/10"

","Coming in with slightly less hype if no smaller set of expectations, ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", the second book in Rowling's series now being adapted to screen, is truly a sequel to the first film: almost identical in shape and style, though a few darker shades have been welcomely added. <br/><br/>The movie stills follows the book extremely faithfully: Harry is back for his second year at Hogwarts, though instead of finding a sorcerer's stone he and his pals Ron and Hermoine have to discover a far more sinister secret: the school's storied Chamber of Secrets, which may be the key to explaining why so many students have been petrified (and since they we're all muggle-born, there's a distinct Slythern connection). With a couple small exceptions, nearly every scene in the book is in the movie, so no need to worry about your favorites not being here, but that in turn makes for an overlong, often sluggish movie. Even in it's strict adherence to it's source, Chris Colombus and Steve Kloves don't seem able to convey the appeal of the books on the screen; the often swift pacing and quick-witted attention to detail that make Rowling's books such a delight are instead turned into a bit of a lumpy, routine cinematic journey, more like they're trying to outline each of the book's major plot points rather than translating their appeal to the much tighter confines of a film. It's more like a power-point presentation than a real movie <br/><br/>That being said, this second go-around is a modest improvement over the original, even with most of the same flaws. If Colombus and co. haven't quite been able to convey a sense of cinematic dread and foreboding, they at least make this installment a bit darker and more colorful than the original. Scenes involving a gang of angry spiders and a wild, uncompromising giant willow are nicely creepy and even have a sense of dark whimsy. Quidditch feels less like Nintendo pinball and more like a real-yet-otherworldly death match, thanks to much improved, more nimble special effects. <br/><br/>And nearly all the cast returns, which is more than welcome. Although there's unfortunately less of Alan Rickman's Snape and Emma Watson's Hermonine, the original's primary scene-stealer's, there are some welcome new additions. Kenneth Branagh gives one of his broadest, loosest performances ever as the fatuous rock-star new professor Gilderoy Lockheart, who can't even seem to wave his wand correctly, and Jason Isaacs gives a memorable sneer to his brief role as the debonair, possibly evil Luscious Malfoy, father of Harry's nemesis Draco. While the larger role Daniel Radcliffe takes on as Harry in this installment does show him under a bit of strain (especially since until now he could get along entirely on wide-eyed reaction shots), he does everything necessary to carry the movie, if not memorably. And there's perhaps an unintentional but welcome sense of Pathos to Richard Harris in his final screen performance as Dumbledore, especially with his characters frequent musings on mortality and death. <br/><br/>And unfortunately this film, although a bit better, is no more memorable than it's predecessor. It feels too undistinguished from many other big-budget Hollywood kids movie, especially with Colombus's penchant for cloying shots of constantly smiling children and an all-too-arch score. It's certainly welcome that he passes the reins for the next installment (to ""Y tu Mama Tambien"" director Alfonsou Cauron!), for which hopefully we'll see a more inspired makeover. For now, this will suffice (and it's creators will surely be well-compensated), but not for much longer."

Although doesn't have has much of a strong feeling as the first, it still holds out as a worthy sequel.<br/><br/>After an incident with a house elf in his bedroom, causing Harry to get into trouble by his step parents, Harry escapes with Ron and his brothers in their flying car. He then lands into more trouble when the gateway to the Hogwarts express is blocked off, forcing them to take the flying car. As Harry continues his life in Hogwarts, attacks of people start happening, leading them to suspect that a hidden chamber in the castle may be the cause of it.<br/><br/>Filled with different subplots, but after awhile, they'll conjoin into one. The casting is still great, with all the same actors still portraying their characters well. Once again, brilliantly covers the main topics of the book, and still manages to get its own material. The thing that made the first better is how clever the story begins. Regardless, this one greatly continues the series, with references to the first, as well as finding ways for things from last year to change.<br/><br/>Also becomes a little more modern, and less fashionable with everything. Suspense is very clever, with one thing to another, leading you to curiosity beyond everything. It becomes well explained about everything. Once again, you will enjoy it even if you haven't read the book, but for those who did will pretty much know everything.<br/><br/>An excellent sequel, though doesn't surpass the first, not by its flaws, but by the strength that the first gave.

","All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens."
"callanvass","9","0","1","19 April 2010"," Chamber of Secrets is darker and more magical then the original was!
","The Chamber of Secrets goes to even more lengths, and more tight and sticky situations to please fans of the series, and new viewers themselves. I really thought the Tom Riddle storyline was ingenious and even quite chilling at times, they went to great lengths to keep things unpredictable to viewers who hadn't read the books before like me. I also sensed a lot of maturity into the actors this time, all of them seemed comfortable and were able to be into their roles more this time. The special effects once again blew me away, especially Aragog the spider and all the little ones, it was quite the effective scene. The movie's humor is better done then the 1st as well, any scene with Dobby whacking his head in frustration or his mischievous antics, I ended up cracking up. The twist at the end is wonderfully captivating, the only problem I had with it, and the movie itself was it was a bit too long in the tooth for my liking.<br/><br/>Performances. Daniel Radcliffe is much stronger this time around, even though I genuinely enjoyed his performance in The Sorcerer's Stone. He's more mature, he has more to play with, and he showed off a certain sense of charisma as well. Rupert Grint is funny once more as Ron Weasley. His weird facial quirks when he was frightened or nervous, made a lot of the movie for me. Emma Watson is sassy and witty, per usual here, she makes Hermoine lovable. Tom Felton is even more nastier as Draco then he was prior to this, you'll dislike him with a passion. Jason Isaacs is absolutely chilling as Lucuius. He was so devious, so cunning and unpredictable!. Robbie Coltrane is very charming and funny as Hagrid once more, I just wish he had more time. Kenneth Branagh is a hoot as the lying Lockhart who pretends to be a masterful Magician. Alan Rickman, Richard Harris, John Cleese and Maggie Smith all do well as the respective 4, though I do wish Rickman had more time as Snape. Shirley Henderson seems to be enjoying chewing up the scenery as Moaning Myrtle, I dug her.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Chamber of Secrets definitely equals Sorcerer'stone, and quite possibly surpasses it too. At around 160 minutes it's a lot to bare, but there's so much going on you won't even care|Hey that rhymed, yeah I'm weird, lol|. A Must see for Potter fans.<br/><br/>9/10"

"hte-trasme","7","0","1","22 January 2010"," Need not be kept a secret
","I'm watching the movies of Harry Potter without read the books, unusual as it might sound to be in a position of never having read the Harry Potter books. I enjoyed the first one, and I think the second slightly has the edge over it for a number of reasons. ""Chamber of Secrets"" with the same director and almost the same cast, retains very much the same feel as ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" presenting a lengthy, expansive, and beautifully imagined world at the end of Harry Potter train (or in the case stolen hovercar) journey.<br/><br/>This time, however, the basic characters and situations have been introduced, so more time can be spent developing the interesting characters that inhabit the school, and exploring its history. When an interesting world as detailed as this has been created it is natural that there should be room for curiosity about its history and lore, and this movie takes advantage of that. We meet parents, and learn history. In addition, the cast of child actors from the previous film have now grown somewhat and accordingly are given some slightly weightier scenes to handle, which they can do. This gives us a little more hint at character in our protagonists and allows a greater sense of attachment.<br/><br/>In addition, while it is still there, any self-reverential tone to the original has been toned down a bit â as if once over the hump of making a satisfactory adaptation of a series of books with so many fans, the filmmakers feel they can let loose just a bit more. There's more humor, with very funny scenes especially early on in Harry Potter's uncle's house with Richard Griffiths. There's the addition too of Kenneth Branagh as a not-very-nice but still somehow likable and highly enjoyable character. Dobby is a delightful computer-generated character. Moaning Myrtle too is very funny.<br/><br/>It's a complex operation to adapt such long books to the screen, I'm sure, and as such some of the niceties of the plot can get hard to pick out for non-readers, and some problems are solved by the magic-fantasy equivalent of technobabble, but that doesn't stop of from being fun adventure. It could be possible to say that the second Harry Potter film was just more of the same â but it's more of the same of something very fun, and a noticeably better version of more of the same."

","In both the book and film universes of Harry Potter, Chamber of Secrets is the weakest, having the weakest story and the one which doesn't seem to fit in with the wider arc. But as a film Chamber of Secrets still works as an entertaining family film.<br/><br/>After a summer of no contact with any of his friends from Hogwarts Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) ends up finding a strange creature in his bedroom, a House-elf called Dobby (Toby Jones). Dobby warns Harry that he is in danger if he returns to Hogwarts. He ensure Harry is trapped, but is saved by his friends Ron (Rupert Grint), Fred and George Weasley (James and Oliver Phelps). Harry and his friends soon return to the school, hoping to continue his education. But strange things start to happen, with students end up getting petrified, and a warning written in blood, suggesting that all students from muggle families. There is a major threat to the students and to the school, with suggestions that it would be closed down. Harry starts to even doubt himself, with many of the students suspecting him because he has the ability to talk to snakes. Harry, Ron and Hermione (Emma Watson) set out to investigate and stop whoever or whatever before someone is killed.<br/><br/>Everyone returns to the film, with Kenneth Branagh joining as the publicity hungry wizard Gilderoy Lockhart who becomes the new defence against the dark arts teachers, and Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father. Jason Issacs is excellent as the horrible wizard and ex-follower of Voldermort. With the younger actors they all improve, with Daniel Radcliffe improving the most. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do still suffer a little from their inexperience. The adult actors are really good, but Richard Harris does seem ill, and he sadly dies after finishing this film.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus is a decent director, he has a workmanlike approach. He tires to play to his strength, family friendly comedy. They are some good jokes, some verbal, mostly visual and physical. He also show more confident involving CGI and special effects. The final third has an very good climax, but the ending itself does drag. But Columbus doesn't know how to shorten the film. Despite Chamber of Secrets being one of the shorter books, he makes the longest film. He needed to cut off some of the fat for the film. Just because something works in the book, it doesn't mean that they would work in the film. Columbus may be good at dealing with light subject matter, but he is not so good at handling darker elements of the story. He took the right step to let Alfonso Cuaron direct the third film as the stories get darker. Columbus often skips over dark elements or doesn't know what to do with it. A good example would be the idea of prejudice and a type of racism in wizarding world, an interesting idea, or Dobby's self-harming.<br/><br/>As already mentioned the book was also the weakest out of all of J.K. Rowling's series. It has the weakest story, offering nothing new. It was filler until the next book which is one of my favourites in the series.<br/><br/>Good fun for families and Potter fans, but wouldn't convert anything who isn't a fan."

"raptorclaw","6","0","1","24 July 2009"," Overall a better film than its predecessor, 'Chamber of Secrets' suffers the same way by trying too hard
","Watching the 'Harry Potter' film series over again after all these years, in the lead-up to the new installment, I am once again struck by what excellent cinema these stories ought to have made. Movie history is littered with incredible movies made from less-than-stellar source material - 'The Godfather', 'Jaws', 'Psycho', 'The Silence of the Lambs' - none would be considered better than low-brow bestsellers, but the movies that were based on them have become unqualified classics. Maybe because a lot of pulp novels were influenced by cinema, and thus, while short on literary quality, serve quite well as screenplays. Or maybe it's because there is no real pressure on the filmmakers to be true to the source material - changing and 'improving' 'The Godfather' would hardly cause the kind of outrage that mangling Salman Rushdie would.<br/><br/>You see what I'm getting at. I don't think J.K. Rowling is a great author, and I don't think she writes great books. I first started reading the Potter books in 2000, as an 8-year-old; and, while I enjoyed them heaps, I wasn't in awe of them, having already read Tolkien and been awed by him instead. But I always thought that the fantastical world of Harry Potter, with its weird creatures and solid, archetypal characters, could be a roaring success on the screen after the manner of Star Wars. And while I didn't know it at the time, in retrospect, I can see why Chris Columbus started off directing the Potter movies - the choice fits with my vision of the series' film fortunes.<br/><br/>Except they didn't do it right. Or, rather, they tried to do it too well. The Columbus Potter movies are lamed by a crippling fear of ostracizing Potter aficionados or offending parental sensibilities - they don't dare depict anything other than the most vanilla view of Harry's world. Therefore, for all that the special effects are dazzling, the actors convincing, the story well told, a certain sense of wonder evoked, the lack of panache and palpable self-consciousness of the movies keep them from being a modern Star Wars. They are, to put it bluntly, a bit flat. Which is a real pity, because 'Chamber of Secrets' is the last Potter book with a relatively simple plot that translates easily to screen.<br/><br/>The movie takes its time in relating Harry's experiences during his second year at Hogwarts (unlike the first film, however, 'Chamber' doesn't give the viewer much sense of the passage of time; you'd have to read the book to know that the climax takes place at the end of the year), with Quidditch and an underdeveloped house-elf subplot having space to stretch a bit. If 'Chamber' had been directed by Alfonso Cuaron it could have been a magnificent film, as the simplicity of the story that allows Columbus to include little details would have allowed Cuaron to bring his inimitable style to bear upon the picture. As it is, Cuaron directed the next installment, 'Prisoner of Azkaban', which has a labyrinthine plot that becomes muddled rather than amplified by Cuaron's imagination - 'Chamber' would not have suffered in this way.<br/><br/>I think it's time I better mention the fact that I still found the movie enjoyable. While overlong and emotionally heavy-handed, it has just the right amount of humor and sinister spookiness to be good fun for all in the mood for well-made frivolity. As is custom with the Potter adaptations, production values and professionalism are never in doubt; the best possible crew has been hired and they do their job well.<br/><br/>The casting is, as always, excellent. Along with the returning who's who of British legends from the first movie (the late, great Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, etc.), there are new arrivals in Fiona Shaw and the magnificent Kenneth Branagh - who shamelessly steals every single scene he appears in, even ones with the peerless Alan Rickman. Rickman, of course, is the perfect Snape, exaggerating his stylish wickedness but keeping just enough on this side of pantomime to avoid being ridiculous. I cannot imagine other people find him menacing in the first two movies. He is just great fun.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, the child actors are actually not as good in this second movie as their younger selves were in the first. Perhaps they're trying to 'act' too much. Rupert Grint, who was the best of the lot in the first movie, here begins his slide into relative mediocrity - his role consists of making the same horrified nauseous face over and over while rasping in a very high, fearful voice. Watson's Hermione and Radcliffe's Harry improved massively after this movie, which, thankfully, seems no more than a sophomore slump for their acting careers.<br/><br/>'Chamber' does have a different tone as compared to 'Stone'. The palette is darker, with Slytherin green (for obvious story reasons) dominating the screen. It is also much scarier than the first, while still retaining the whimsicality - and the innumerable reaction shots of children grinning delightedly that have become Columbus' dubious trademark - that the first film possessed and that made up much of its charm. With no more magical explaining to do the plot is given top priority, and a sinister one it is, too.<br/><br/>The world seems to want Harry never to go back to Hogwarts. Mysterious warnings be damned, Harry lands up controversially at school, where cats, ghosts and students alike are being Petrified by an unseen agent - only, Harry is hearing voices. And his strange talents - strange, even for wizards - are becoming public. The heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts - but who could it be? And how can we make the audience get that we hate racial discrimination? Oops. Not quite sure about the last line there.<br/><br/>A fun movie, not a masterpiece. Guardedly recommended, if you have three hours to pass."

","The first Harry Potter movie was kind of like a freak-out test for its creators: how much material do we use from the book? How loyal do we stay to it? How do we make this all come to life? ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,"" the film version of the second book in the fantasy series by J.K Rowling, shows less concern with these questions. Director Chris Columbus and his crew operate much more like a team that's been here before, that knows the fantasy world it has created and how to make it better. Not to mention the material is a shade darker, the kids another year older (which at 12-13 makes a big difference) and the special effects light years better in comparison to the last years' ""Sorcerer's Stone.""<br/><br/>""Sorcerer's Stone"" was sort of a childish family film, one worried about being too scary, whose major merits came merely from book-lovers' excitement to see what was stuck in their heads come to life on the big screen -- something its creators could bank on. Now that the Harry Potter world has been imagined once before, the trial period is over and Columbus and adapter Steve Kloves must really put themselves to the test. They definitely succeed: ""Chamber of Secrets"" is much more thrilling and visually complex, enough so to steal our minds from some of the story flaws that bled over from the first film (something all future Potter films will endure).<br/><br/>""Chamber of Secrets"" is inherently a richer story -- a mystery where death lurks at every turn and Hogwarts school, the wizarding school which Harry attends, is in imminent danger. When Harry arrives at school for his second year, students begin turning up petrified as word gets out that the legendary chamber of secrets, said to contain a monster, has been opened. It's still a fantasy side venture that avoids the looming conflict between Harry and the great evil wizard who killed his parents, Lord Voldemort, but there's a lot more at stake than the first story. Maybe it was unavoidable for Columbus to respond with a film more capable of frightening young children, but whereas a silly troll that might as well have been Shrek attacked Hogwarts last time, ""Chamber of Secrets"" loads up on creepy giant spiders that attack Harry and Ron, and Columbus doesn't hold back. Thank goodness.<br/><br/>More UK all-stars join the cast this time around such as Kenneth Branagh as the new -- and foolishly egotistical -- defense against the dark arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Isaacs plays a sinister looking Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco, Harry's arch schoolyard nemesis. More notably are the improvements in the nucleus trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Watson sheds some touching tears as Hermione, but the most improved award goes to Grint. He was adorable in ""Socerer's Stone,"" but now he's progressed to being a goofy, klutzy character that commands much more of the screen.<br/><br/>A much more exciting story awaits those who haven't read the books or were not so impressed by ""Sorcerer's Stone."" Kloves' script still crams a bit too much, but nothing goes in that doesn't progress the mystery plot or deliver some sort of imaginative CGI sequence from flying cars to magical creatures. That's at least an improvement over the last film. We also have a clearly defined lesson for Harry to learn as he begins his maturing process. There's a definite sense of his growth.<br/><br/>A tip of the hat goes to a crew that learned enough the first time around to make great improvements to the second edition. This is more the young adult demographic that these movies need to hit on."
"anifanmc","8","0","1","27 April 2009"," An improvement - but still made for small children
","On a purely technical basis, the first Harry Potter movie was horrid. It was awful. But as an origin story, I let it slide with the expectation that it would be somewhat awkward because the first novel isn't all that good either. Working with whatever material they had, they managed to churn *something* out that wasn't completely embarrassing.<br/><br/>The second film is, overall, pretty good, but suffers from trying-to-please-every-fan-too-much-itis in a manner similar to the fourth film. There's some reference to every major scene in the book, some things are truncated, and a few of the ""expected"" scenes and/or lines are included to make the little kids ""ooh"" and ""aah"" with happiness. Which I suppose is fine, but looking back at it as an adult, I feel like I was cheated out of my money. Most major events are still included with sufficient emphasis and it seems like a much more faithful adaptation of the book as closely as possible, but with some serious drawbacks.<br/><br/>The plot continues Harry's second year at Hogwarts, where he's got to deal initially with some exposure to the Wizarding equivalent of racism, the first real encounter he has with intolerance and bigotry on a harsher level than in the previous novels. Then, a fabled monster is released from the innards of the castle, said to be hiding there for hundreds of years. Turns out, one of the school founders, who subscribed to the bigotry against Muggle-born wizards, placed him there expressly to kill them when it was released. The majority of the story takes a sort of detective mystery theme, where Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to find out who/what is attacking the students.<br/><br/>As far as pacing and plot goes, the film succeeds in building up suspense and a story - to some degree. A number of the attacks are cut out to conserve time, and they don't show the castle being locked down as much, etc. but overall they manage the job. What the film suffers from heavily is the literal adaptation of dialogue. Instead of improving where it needed to be improved, they adapted it very literally and it relies too much on awkward exposition. The most striking scene that irritates me is when Fawkes heals Harry's wound, and he goes ""of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers!"" I half expected him to give a thumbs up to the camera and grin. There was no damn need to put that dialogue into the film. Another instance was where the trio happen upon the blood written sign in the corridor, and Hermione reads the sign aloud. I realize they're doing this because it's unlikely a little kid is going to remember what Dumbledore said earlier in the movie, or even necessarily be able to read the words on the wall fast enough while it's on the screen, but for the rest of us, it's just annoying.<br/><br/>Still, worth watching and I'd recommend it as a much more faithful adaptation, even though it's probably not as good a film as many of the others."
"sweetlittlepie","7","0","1","25 April 2009"," A great improvement by Columbus
","Like I said in my review of the Sorcerer's Stone, this film is a definite improvement by director Christopher Columbus from the first one. I think Chris was more comfortable and took more chances with this one. One thing that I couldn't help, but notice was how the cinematography changed. In the first film the color of the film is golden and bright, while in this one is a darker color and the brightness has been considerably diluted. Columbus said in a documentary about the making of this movie that the cinematography here was darker, because it suited the feel and environment of the story much better. In the first one everything is bright because we are getting to see Hogwarts for the first time, and it helps the audience fall in love with the school just like Harry. While in the second one we are already comfortable with the surroundings so things get darker because we see a darker side of Hogwarts that we didn't see in the first one. Again great acting by Radcliffe, Grint and Watson. And some great performances by newcomers Kenneth Branagh, Jason Isaacs, Christian Coulson and Bonnie Wright. This is a great movie for kids and families, and a great addition to the HP franchise."

","Harry Potter's (Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts is affected by the opening of a legend known only as the Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>The second instalment of the series brings more adventure and more imagination to the now infamous adaptations of J.K Rowling's wondrous world.<br/><br/>Rowling's first novel broke barriers for the concept of magic and a different world and the film broke numerous records all around the world with a stunningly entertaining and enjoyable family make over.<br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets follows in its footsteps by targeting family viewing again with humour for the young (Errol the Owl) and comedy for the old (Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart) and never underestimating the significance of magic relating to serious issues.<br/><br/>The question of friendship, the treatment of children under adoptive parents and the importance of blood relations are all points that become even bigger in the sequels and here we again see another wonderful build up and get to see where they all began.<br/><br/>Like Philosopher's Stone, this has a mystery all set up for the students to figure out and there are subtle hints being dropped along the way with laughs, drama not to mention twists and turns but ultimate fun and great family viewing.<br/><br/>All the stars reprise their roles from the Philosopher's Stone with the younger stars like Radcliffe and Grint noticeably more sophisticated and mature in their approach to their respective protagonists. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy is perhaps one of the finest pieces of casting that have been implemented into the series. Branagh, Rickman and Richard Harris' last major film role are all stand outs once again but like the first, these films are all about the magic narratives.<br/><br/>J.K Rowling's second novel was more flowing and slightly more exciting than her first, not to mention darker. This was noted by Columbus who uses a more artistic style to capture the more mature moments.<br/><br/>There are lapses and moments which feel a bit outdated. Not to mention recent novels have hindered the meaning of elements, in particular the diary but don't let that take the shine of the adventure that is still sharp and entertaining.<br/><br/>This is a fine adaptation of the award winning novel that delivers everything a family film should and reminds us of what happened at the beginning and when watching years from when it was made (2002) it brings back some magical memories."
"long-ford","Null","0","1","19 February 2009"," Good sequel, overlong but entertaining
","This film picks up from where the first one ended and remains generally entertaining. Directed again by Chris Columbus, this time, a few more risks are taken, and Hogwarts appears more magical and menacing this time round. The VFX are good as (MINOR SPOILERS) Harry escapes from terrifying spiders, and battles a ferocious Basilisk. Still, the film is way too long and the mid-section sags. Some scenes could have been cut. The acting is decent with the adult cast doing much better than the kids. Alan Rickman remains the pick of the lot while Kenneth Branagh looks like he's having a lot of fun. Watchable.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

","9/10<br/><br/>I thought Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a phenomenal movie, which made remarkable progress since the first Harry Potter movie.<br/><br/>The story follows, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy and strange events occur such as, blood-writing on the walls, saying that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, people getting attacked and Harry keeps hearing these strange voices. No one knows who's doing it and Harry and his friends go on an exciting adventure to uncover the truth about it or Hogwarts may come to an end.<br/><br/>The performances from the delightful cast were stupendously charming, all of them played their role well and realistically, especially by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) Rupert Grint (Ronald Weasley) Emma Watson (Hermonie Granger) who were the main stars of the movie and I felt that they put lots of concentration to it and still put lots of energy to it, which makes the movie more moving.<br/><br/>The plot was, for me, the greatest achievement in the movie. It was complex and solid from beginning to end, not too many characters or dialogue, it was completely simple and understandable. And it also matches very well with the book, not too many bits were skipped out, just a wonderful adaption to it, so a big well done to the writers.<br/><br/>Overall a splendid movie, with great performances, great plots and great settings. It has made incredible progress since the first movie and it's the best Harry Potter movie so far."

","Probably, you have all heard the story and most of you have already seen the movie, I don't think there's a point in saying what everybody else already said.<br/><br/>This turned out to be a worthy sequel of the first ""Harry Potter"" film and of course, a good movie adaptation of the novel ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" by J.K.Rowling.<br/><br/>When I saw the first movie I was ten years old, the same age the characters where supposed to be. My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn't going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn't have time and I wasn't old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That's how I became obsessed with reading and writing.<br/><br/>I may say, ""Harry Potter"" affected me in a positive way, because after I finished reading all the published books back then, I wanted to read more books and I must thank J.K.Rowling for her genius, if it wasn't for her books, I might have been right now your normal seventeen year old at a party and wasting myself out. This amazing fictive world got me to the right path in life and helped me stay there.<br/><br/>I know, you probably don't care about my story, you readers only want to hear about what I thought of the movie, but I believe my story can influence you if you are a parent thinking whether or not you should let your children watch this film. My advice is yes and I have presented my reasons above.<br/><br/>The story is simply magical and ""Hogwarts"" is a genius invention. The movie is done well, almost perfect. It's the closest to the book they can get and it's an amazing experience for any kid. It's not that ""Harry Potter"" is a world-wide phenomena, most people don't even admit they red the books and enjoyed the movies, in teen world, it's considered ""geeky"", but what does it matter? The complexity and originality of the story made ""Harry Potter"" one of the best ""things"" ever invented."
"amypeterson12345","10","0","1","2 July 2008"," Breathtaking, Cinematic, Epic ... Perfect
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is not only an amazing family film, it's the gold standard of movie-making, equal to and in some parts better than J.K. Rowling's incredible book.<br/><br/>From the opening credits to the final note of 'Hedwig's Theme,' Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a true joy to watch. Leading the movie as everyone's three favorite Hogwarts students, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson continue to captivate and delight the audience with their talent. Hogwarts is once again a captivating and enchanting safe hold for young Harry and his friends, a world of true magic eons away from the rundown teenage hangout it becomes in movies 3-5. The chilling and charming music creates atmospheres of both whimsical wonder - such as in the Weasley's home or Hogwarts at Christmas - and eerie tension, such as Harry's conversation with Riddle's Diary or the final encounter in the Chamber. Newcomers such as Ginny Weasley, Colin Creevey, Lucius Malfoy, Gilderoy Lockhart, Professor Sprout, Moaning Myrtle and Tom Riddle suit the characters perfectly.<br/><br/>From the sweeping camera shots above Hogwarts' highest tower to the ominous music that plays as Tom Riddle reveals his true identity in the chamber, everything breathes Hogwarts. Even for someone who isn't a fan of the books, the storyline is easy to follow and weaves an enthralling fantasy film with a true moral in the end. The acting, the storyline, the animation, the music ... everything is 100% perfect."

Daniel Radcliffe is a better actor since the first, as are Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Everyone in this movie is great, as is the young Voldemort. Dobby was pretty cool, and I kind of wish that they kept him for GoF and OotP. As a triumph over the first, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is possibly the best entry in the series."
"vip_ebriega","10","0","1","19 May 2008"," Better than the fantastic original.
","My Take: A fantastic special effects-laden adventure that's better than the original. One of the best in the series. <br/><br/>While I read only few parts from THE SORCERER'S STONE, I even read less in the second chapter in the series, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS. But, like the original, this adaption doesn't harm viewers that didn't read the book before purchasing the ticket. It's very faithful to the novel like the first film, but what a surprise! This is better than the original. While its heavy faithfulness leaves less room for surprises, this one has more cinematic edge. The action scenes are more exciting, and the magical sequences are more spellbinding than ever. Fans have no doubt enjoyed it, and who am I to disagree. I loved this movie, and it may just become a favorite. <br/><br/>For the story, I suggest you read the book instead. There's few point in writing a summary if most of you already know what it's about. I will point out the finest scenes and plot points. While this is just as filled with special effects as the first film, these effects are just as imaginative. Although the goal is to make them more magical than the effects in the first film, they haven't left the imagination behind. The wonder is there also. In sequences with the special effects, they're made more believable by the presence of wonder and awe. There's also excitement of the high order. Even if you have read the book, the thrills will get to you. Sequences like when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron (Rupert Grint) are chased by giant spiders, riding a flying car, battling a legendary killer Basilisk is especially exciting and thrilling.<br/><br/>Once again, there's also good acting. The all-star supporting cast are back, with the addition of Kenneth Branagh as the boastful Gilderoy Lockhart and Miriam Margolyes as one of the new professors. The younger actors, including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson (once again, the best of the bunch) and others, are back, and since they're growing up, their acting skills got even better. The screenplay is faithful, and although it's faithful to the book from cover to cover as possible, there are still a lot of surprises here and there. The production design and costumes are dazzling. Director Chris Colombus, who has worked with Steven Spielberg before (GREMLINS), has certainly learned much to give the series just the same amount of wonder, excitement and humor the way Spielberg himself could have done it. <br/><br/>HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is darker, edgier and better than the first film, and you know that's saying something since I liked the first film a lot. This is in my opinion the best in the series so far, tied with the next chapter in the series HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."
"Friday_Saturday","8","0","1","4 April 2008"," Best of the Series!!!
","OK, the majority of these movies aren't too good (Order of the Pheonix & Goblet of Fire being the worst). But this one really outstrips the others. They included the majority of the things in the book (but not the DeathDay Party or the Hand of Glory - but the thing that grabbed Harry's hand was good enough for me).<br/><br/>The Basilisk & Dobby looked (and sounded) just like I thought they would. The flying car sequence was excellent...although Harry falling out the door and dangling over the train was a bit much for me. The Acromantula attack was incredible, and fighting the Basilisk was INSANELY cool! Unfortunately, I'm a villain fan, and I was very sad when the Basilisk was killed. Riddle's death was well-done too.<br/><br/>Overall, the thing that sold this for me was, once again, John Williams' fantastic score...buy ""Fawkes the Pheonix"" off iTunes, it's excellent! I truly miss John Williams' work in these movies.<br/><br/>Don't pay ANY ATTENTION AT ALL to those dunderheads who say this movie sucked. It didn't. At all."

","Well, I think that when they made this one, what they were looking for was to remind the audience of why they liked the first one and for the first hour, they do just that and from there they move onto a darker and cleverer version of Harry. Now, in this one it seems that some actors who did maybe not so well in the first one were starting to really pick up in this one like Hermoine. Well, there was again lots of talk about this one like whether Daniel Radcliffe could keep up with the ever evolving character but he pulled it off with what seems like very little trouble although I doubt highly that it would not have been a little trouble. Well this one has better special effects then the first one and they had done a great job extending the characters to fit in with times and the effort used in this one is just so cleverly used. Once again, they got away with some scenes cut out in this one. I rate this 74%."

Daniel Radcliffe breathes life into Harry and he brings to life all of Harry's emotions showing us that Harry's life is not as wonderful as we might think it is. We also get a glimpse into the life of Hagrid before harry was Born and we also meet for the first time Tom Marvelo Riddle a man who hates Harry beyond all reason.

","Which is hard to do. They both stick very close to the story. But this one has more humor, action, suspense, acting, and plot. This movie didn't have the burden of introducing you to this world of fantasy. So it could just jump right into the story. And it did. Again the Adult actors and actresses deliver wonderful performances. Richard Harris' Dumbledore is back and better than ever. Looking more comfortable in his role. Alan Rickman, simply looks like he is Severus Snape. And whoever plays Lockhart fit the bill nicely.

"de_niro_2001","10","0","2","12 October 2007"," Superb!
","J K Rowling has a unique talent. She takes the basic structure of a boarding school story and works in elements of classical mythology, Arthurian legend and many other things. Because she taps into so many diverse sources that is one reason the books have sold tremendously well (that's an understatement) and they have been made into films which star the cream of the acting profession. It's not often you get a film which draws on old legends which also includes steam trains and Ford Anglias. Harry Potter has forever altered the way people look at a Ford Anglia. This film, though, is a bit more scary than the first one (in fact the films have got progressively scarier) and the scenes with the basilisk may be a bit too much for small children. I am also a bit arachnophobic (like Ron Weasley) and the scene with the spiders made my flesh creep. But this is still a great film. Although it's a fantasy film, children can still relate to it. When he's not at Hogwarts, Harry lives in a street of Brookside houses, namely Privet Drive. Kids can relate to this setting as it is one many of them will identify with. Many of the children's stories of yore like Peter Pan and the Phoenix and the Carpet had their real world sections in upper class Victorian or Edwardian nurseries, which is just as much a fantasy world for modern kids as Neverland or Narnia. This aspect has also contributed to the success of the Harry Potter books and films."

","It's the second installment to the Harry Potter series, and it's an excellent follow-up of The Sorceror's Stone. The Chamber Of Secrets sees some evolving elements of the series. There is also plenty of action in this one, and the acting is even better than the first.<br/><br/>It's the second year at Hogwarts for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and things aren't getting calm at all following last year. They're just getting more exciting. Harry Potter has definitely changed. He's wiser, less reactive to everything, and sees Hogwarts as his only home. Daniel Radcliffe does well bringing the new version of his character to life. Rupert Grint acts just the same, as his character is the same. Ron is the same clumsy wizard who likes to panic. Hermione has evolved the most. She's not nearly as bossy or rude, although she's still the most willing to study and learn of the trio. Emma Watson continues her terrific acting as she makes this new Hermione clearly evident. The rest of the cast was terrific as well. Jason Issacs did well as Lucius Malfoy. I can tell Lucius is evil. In movies, guys with long blond hair are always evil.<br/><br/>The plot is as follows: Harry receives warnings not to return to Hogwarts. After Ron and his brothers rescue Harry from his still rather rude and mean uncle, aunt, and cousin, Harry returns to Hogwarts anyway. Strange mishaps occur to Harry as further warnings to leave, and at the same time there are random attacks against others, leaving students literally petrified. Our trio of young wizards then learn about the chamber of secrets and what it holds, and that the heir of Slytherin will use it to extinguish muggle-born students. Worried that the heir has returned and is causing the random attacks, our trio plucks around for answers. Harry is accused of being the heir when it's discovered he can speak Parseltongue(Snake language). When Hermione winds up petrified, Harry and Ron seek and the chamber of secrets, leading to the truth. I'll save that for surprise.<br/><br/>There is so much action in this movie. There's a flying car, more Quidditch matches, a nest of huge spiders, a dueling club, and plenty of spells. Far more spells than the first movie. Hermione still casts more spells than her friends. Personally, Hermione is one of my favorite characters. It's in this film that the friendship between Hermione and the boys is really established. They're in things together and they back each other up. Also featured is a new dark arts defense teacher, and more clues about the mysterious past of lord Voldemort. This movie I give a 10/10. Awesome acting, terrific special effects, wonderful plot."

","I definitely am quite pleased with this title. This, along with the first, got the series off to a very good start--a start that was unfortunately stopped with the third film, but that's another story.<br/><br/>The casting in this is still flawless. Lucius Malfoy was perfectly portrayed, with a smug voice and rigid stature. Richard Harris (God rest his soul) continued to amaze as Dumbledore, soft of voice and graceful of movement but with an underlying wisdom and power. Even Tom Riddle's actor pulled it off nicely.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also breathtaking. John Williams manages to capture the many tones of the Harry Potter universe without missing a beat. This work easily competes with his acclaimed Star Wars soundtrack.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was perfect, and I give Chris Columbus two thumbs up; it's a pity he won't be directing any more of them. He set up the series nicely, and unfortunately, Cuaron ruined everything in the third movie, from the set to the actors to the flow. I keep this--and the Sorcerer's Stone--with pride, and almost wish I'd never bought the Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>Good job, Chris Columbus, and everyone involved."

Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) has spent his summer cut off from his friends and living with his abusive uncle and aunt. Fortunately Ron Weaselly (Rupert Grint) arrives to whisk him away in a flying car to begin some new adventures at Hogwarts Academy...<br/><br/>All the regulars return, including Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Maggie Smith as Mrs McGonigall. Also back is Emma Watson as the boys' friend Hermione. Some terrific set-pieces abound as Ron's car has a tense encounter with Hogwart's Express train, an icky encounter with a forest full of spiders and Harry's duel with a giant snake...<br/><br/>I liked Kenneth Branagh's turn as a cowardly braggart of a teacher, and the appearance of ""Tom Riddle"" near the end. Aided by some fine music and colourful special effects this is a worthy cinematic continuation of the ""Harry Potter"" story."

","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002, Dir. Chris Columbus)<br/><br/>It's Year 2 at Hogwarts, and Harry Potter, Ron and Hermione are back learning, but their year doesn't go past quietly. Members of the school are turning up petrified and bloody writing are appearing on the walls, revealing to everyone, that someone has opened the chamber of secrets. The attacks continue, bringing the possibility of the closure of Hogwarts. Harry and his friends are now forced to secretly uncover the truth about the chamber before the school closes or any lives are taken.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is the second movie in the 'Harry Potter' series, and is definitely an improvement. The story is a lot more interesting than the previous film and can be a lot more frightening to younger viewers. The acting has improved greatly amongst the younger stars. Their skills are not better but are also apparent when watching the film. As different scenes were shot at different times, you can tell what scene was filmed before what. The special effects have improved a huge amount in this film. No longer do they look like a computer game. Both the CGI Dobby, CGI Basilisk and the large model of Aragog are amazing and so realistic. This movie is definitely better than the previous.<br/><br/>""Dobby feels most aggrieved Sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."" - Dobby (Toby Jones) ""You better clear off before my bones come back Dobby, or i might have to strangle you."" - Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)"

I'd still be You-Know-Where. So I'd just like to say: thanks. Harry: There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. <br/><br/>The usual cast is back, as Richard Harris is still with us. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson still steal the show, but Kenneth Branagh as professor Lockhart gives an excellent performance.<br/><br/>We still have John Williams great music, and great makeup, set decoration and special effects, but they don't have the impact of the first film.<br/><br/>We do so look forward to harry growing up."

","Second time around we get a slightly better outing for Harry Potter and Company. There's a little more fun to be had, a greater sense of danger and mystery and a few dark moments, indicating the route the series was going to take. I've always considered Chamber of Secrets to be one of the best of J.K. Rowling's books, and the studio does a more than adequate job of bringing it to the screen.<br/><br/>As you'd expect there's the same house style present as in the first film - a little bland, slightly cartoony but again it's a little better than first time around. The actors are growing into their roles well - in an alternative universe we might have had Spielberg directing and Haley Joel Osment in the leading part. I for one am tremendously glad that the film makers stuck to their guns and kept the cast British. Osment is a superior actor to Radcliffe (at least at this point in their careers) but it would have taken away the verisimilitude if he'd landed the role.<br/><br/>Highlights this time around include the flying car, the ""who dun it"" - or should that be ""who is it"" and the spiders. Boy those spiders! There's also another exciting Quidditch match - it beats doing ""Educational Gymnastics"" at school any day! The climax to the movie is brilliant and genuinely gripping. What can I say? I'm just a kid at heart.<br/><br/>At just over two and a half hours it is rather long, though."
"RCWjr","8","0","2","16 July 2007"," Second film is a really good extension of the first
","Being the 2nd, in what will be a 7 film franchise, Chamber of Secrets was basically more of the same with another year added to the kids. The dark overtones that will dominate the later films was introduced here, as is the growing uneasiness by everyone in regard to Harry's potential power and how he will use it.<br/><br/>All the kids raise the bar another notch in their performances. The effects, though sometimes dodgy, adequately convey the magic and wonder that Harry is experiencing. Williams is back for another stab at the score and again delivers in spades.<br/><br/>We once again get a new professor against the dark arts, which I gather from the films, is a rotating storyline through the books. It seems to be used to introduce new characters, though it would seem in the case on Kenneth Branaghs character, it is a one-shot deal. Pity, I could see his character being one that could be explored delightfully. I really enjoyed the inclusion of Luscious Malfoy played excellently by Jason Issac's.<br/><br/>My one on-going complaint with all the films is the lack of character exploration in regard to Snape and Dumbledore. You know there is a lot more than what we are seeing, yet the films continue to introduce more new characters that take up time that I would love to see spent on Snape and Dumbledore. Not sure if this is how the books are, but it is a disappointing aspect of the films for me.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and looked forward with great anticipation to the 3rd."

","I have enjoyed this movie ever since i first saw it, well, when i left the theaters i was shaking from freight! this movie was darker than the first and it got to me. the scary moments were powerful.<br/><br/>But i have a little doubts about this one and yes I watch the movie over and over again because it is still a brilliant adaptation.<br/><br/>First what i wish they could've done was put more screen time on for Nearly Headless Nick. The whole deathday party was left out and it would've added more unexpected magical, uh, things into the movie.<br/><br/>OK and secondly the camera movements in certain scenes were a bit of a disappointment. I seen that certain action scenes lagged a bit. Like in the scene where harry fights the basilisk in the chamber almost at the end of the movie. The camera kept switching multiple times.<br/><br/>Bu t overall the movie is brilliant, the music is brilliant and the acting was decent enough. i give an 8/10"

","I loved the first Harry Potter film,and was extremely excited for its sequel hoping it could quite possibly be better than the original. I must say that I was not at all disappointed upon first viewing the Chamber of Secrets, and might even venture to say that it is better than the first. In terms of truthfulness to the book Chamber of Secrets excels, and when transferred to film it has lost none of the magic that made its book counterpart a triumph.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets begins when Harry(Daniel Radcliffe) meets a house-elf named Dobby who claims Harry must not return to Hogwarts this upcoming school year because bad things are supposed to happen.Of course Harry refuses to listen,and Dobby continuously tries to foil Harry from getting to school.Eventually Harry arrives to school in style.Once at school Harry meets the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,Gilderoy Lockhart(played superbly by Kenneth Brannagh),discovers he is a parselmouth(can speak snake language),and learns of a secret Chamber in the school that holds a monster that is petrifying many of the muggle borns in the school and naturally Harry and his friends try to unravel the mystery that is the Chameber of Secrets before the school is closed.<br/><br/>I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this film.All of the cinematography,special effects,and production design is once again top-notch and perfectly creates this fantasy world.Cris Columbus steps back into the director's chair once more and once more did a very respectable job.Yet again John Williams score steals the show,its magical sound sells every single scene.The acting was once more the definite highlight of the film,bringing back old favorites and adding new ones.This film is superb entertainment and is yet another modern day classic.With more action,more laughs,and just as much heart as the original this one is a definite must see.Even if you aren't a Potter fan you might find something to enjoy in this film.It is one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better than its predecessor.<br/><br/>Another perfect: 10/10!!!!!!"

","Forced to spend his summer holidays with his muggle relations, Harry Potter gets a real shock when he gets a surprise visitor: Dobby the house-elf, who warns Harry Potter against returning to Hogwarts, for terrible things are going to happen. Harry decides to ignore Dobby's warning and continues with his pre-arranged schedule. But at Hogwarts, strange and terrible things are indeed happening: Harry is suddenly hearing mysterious voices from inside the walls, muggle-born students are being attacked, and a message scrawled on the wall in blood puts everyone on his/her guard - ""The Chamber Of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies Of The Heir, Beware"".<br/><br/>This film is darker than the first film (obviously each Harry Potter films get darker within each sequel) and there's much more great action sequences and faster paced. This movie is faithful to the book but it's like Chris Columbus wants to fit everything in the movie (unlike the third and fourth movie) which results them to be almost three hour movies instead of focusing to the plot. Well, I don't mind that.<br/><br/>There are much funnier comedic and more scarier scenes in this movie. Those who haven't read the books will get more information of Voldermort and Harry Potter and those who haven't seen the first film needs to see it to understand this second film. It's not a movie that stands for itself.<br/><br/>Again, the score is terrific, giving the movie a magical feel. The CGI for Dobby, ghosts, and the action sequences are fantastic. The main trio's acting is yet again terrific and fits well with the book's characters. And I would give a moment to remember Richard Harris, who sadly passed away after filming this movie. He portrays a great Dumbledore.<br/><br/>I wouldn't know if this movie is better than the first. Each Harry Potter films are terrific and some of the best films ever created. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you'll like this movie. If not, well, you'll still enjoy it as much as I did. It's a fantastic family film!"
"walsh-22","9","0","2","16 May 2007"," Just as good as the first film
","The special effects were awesome, the scenes I was particularly impressed with was the flying car, the phoenix bird going up into flames and then a little baby growing out of the ashes and the snake at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I hadn't read the books at this point which had me wishing I hadn't read the books after The Prisoner of Azkaban as in some way it spoiled my enjoyment of the film because I knew what would happen in the next films. At least with this film, it was unpredictable and kept me gripped as I didn't know about all the plot lines. I recommend people not to read the books and see all the movies first as it is fun not knowing what will happen in every part of the movie.<br/><br/>More characters were introduced in the film. Dobby the House Elf, I found to be annoying at times. Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart was funny especially being in the worst job as a coward, a professor against the black arts. He likes to brag what a hero he is to anyone who will listen but hasn't done any of the things he's claimed he has. Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy, at his villainous best. Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, a wizard interested in the muggle world unlike his other wizard peers. Great casting as ever.<br/><br/>What a plot! When I saw it, I was blown away by what an interesting plot twist J.K. Rowling introduced to the story, Voldemort has cast a spell to put his 16 year old self in his diary, waiting for a time to come out and attack students he considers 'mudbloods.' Wasn't disappointed in it, at all."
"ScarletSwimmer","7","0","2","14 April 2007"," Not as good as the first, but the magic is still there.
","The first two movies are the ones that do the best keeping to the original magical world created by JK Rowling. This one is very accurate with the first one, I really feel like after the first two the movies go into completely different directions as new directors come in and the set is continuously changed. This is also that last one with the great Richard Harris in it, sadly.<br/><br/>However, though it is very true to the books as well as the first movie, the story has not yet gotten into the darkness and huge plot-it's still just a story of kids getting into trouble and finding adventures at school. Also this book was my least favorite of the series, not for any particular reason other than there just wasn't much to it.<br/><br/>Still, not to be missed, and the story only gets better from here."

He learns of an eminent threat revolving around an ancient chamber of secrets that could potentially close down the school, but his fellow classmates become suspicious of him when they learn that he's a parsel-tongue and may in fact be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin. Like its predecessor it goes on too long, but the story is much more interesting, and there are an abundance of exciting, inventive, eye-popping special effects.

","Harry's second year proves that there is more challenges ahead of him. His relationship with Hermoine and Ron is getting stronger and the love for Dumbledoor is quite plain as I feel Harry is starting to see him a father figure which I think is brilliant. J.K has done it again, she had made you feel what Harry is going threw that this is only the start and quite right it is. Pre pare yourself for a heck of a ride with this series of films. I loved this film from every minute. The magic was great, the chemistry between actors made you feel that these were real people and not just actors trying to make something believable. I will watch it again and again and I'm 23!"

It was so close to the book that all the magic I had when reading the book was brought back to life in this film.<br/><br/>One of the first things I noticed about this film was the dark plot that was realized in full detail by Director Chris Columbus. He did such an excellent job in the first film that I knew he would do the same for the sequel.<br/><br/>Dobby was a great character for the book series and was a great character in the film. I really enjoyed the scenes where Dobby and Harry were together, it was cute. I didn't really like Daniel Radcliff's acting as much in this film as I did the previous one.<br/><br/>I recommend it to those who have read the book and love the series!!!

"jonny07326","10","0","2","2 February 2007"," Has to be the best one yet.
","I have to say, this is my personal favorite Harry Potter film. It introduces a lot of new aspects of the film and brings up many questions. I loved the characters Dobby(The House Elf), Professor Lockhart, Luscious Malfoy, Ginny Weasley, Weasley Sr, and the introductions of The Whomping Willow and Moaning Myrtle. The film was incredible. I loved the flying car scene and when they were trying to escape the giant spiders. Sadly, it was the last one that Richard Harris lived for, and the last of John Williams music and even the last Chris Colombus directing. I don't know why the rating is only 7.3, why is it so underrated?"
"bartonim","9","0","2","8 January 2007"," Potter entertains!
","As with the first film, Chamber of Secrets has all of the visual flair that the first possessed, and--thankfully--the same key cast members to reprise their roles in this fine follow-up to Philosopher's Stone.<br/><br/>What I think is most pleasing about this film is its controlled use of special effects. Some might say it goes overboard, but for a film about wizards, it is surprisingly restrained, concentrating more on atmosphere than visual theatrics. Sure, the eye-catching effects play an important role in this movie, but so does the plot, with some fine touches in character and friendship development.<br/><br/>Unlike other longish films in this genre, Chamber never tires. An entertaining treat for all ages."

"etsm92","10","0","2","4 July 2006"," Even better than the first! WONDERFUL!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets/2002/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint<br/><br/>Okay the first one was WONDERFUL! But it turns out I liked the second one even better than the first! Okay the first deals with the Sorcerer's Stone while this one deals with The Chamber of Secrets. Okay I'd choose the chamber before the stone or maybe even after because best is for last. Yes, this had an imaginative, creative story to it with even more and better characters and better story, longer than the first: Aragog, Dobby the House-Elf, Tom Riddle, Moaning Myrtle, and Colin Creevey. They were all interesting and entertaining characters and of course more so than the first. This so-called Chamber of Secrets is a wonderfully looking chamber with an old man's head in it (Salazar Slytherin) where the basilisk (a giant snake) comes out of and chases Harry. This is the first time you physically see The Burrow, or the Wealsey's house, which is a very tall building for a house. Also you see the old Ford Anglia for the first time that is able to fly (because Mr. Weasley enchanted it) and turn itself invisible and helps Harry and Ron escape from the Forbidden Forest in one scene that includes the spider Aragog in the scene. It also is the car they fly to Hogwarts itself since someone in particular closed the barrier and didn't let them get onto Platform 9Â¾. When they are actually inside the castle you see Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris) for the first time in the film. He obviously didn't look good because he was very sick in the film and I'm surprised Harris was able to make the film with how ill he was. He passed away shortly after the film was released in the theaters. That is one cast member dead from the Harry Potter series. The new Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is worse than and not as convincing as Richard Harris. I'd prefer Harris over Gambon because not only is he wiser and has straight posture (like Dumbledore should be) but he's calmer and not as loud and annoying as Gambon. So, on with the mysterious chamberÂ The chamber has supposedly been opened and Hogwarts needs to be under supreme caution because, as I said before, the chamber is a home to a vicious monster snake, or basilisk. The teachers were getting anxious and were also thinking of closing the school if the culprit behind the attacks was not found. Harry and Ron also seem anxious and use the Invisibility cloak to get around to places where they really need to go like Hagrid's hut. Hermione tries to discourage them because it could be dangerous but she did not succeed. Students are supposed to be in their dormitories or accompanied by a teacher at nine o'clock at night. Each Head of House tell their student that. So Harry has the Invisibility cloak idea. They have many questions for Hagrid like how the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Hagrid, however, could not finish this statement because someone knocked on the door at that exact moment. Harry and Ron were unconvinced. They were then told to follow the spiders if they needed any specific information on the chamber and who opened it and blabitty blooÂ So they arrive in the Forbidden Forest, which is home to many terrifying creatures, and the one they were going to interrogate was the giant spider Aragog. He gave them as much info as he could give them, which was very limited. Ron was still unconvinced; but Harry found out a big piece of information concerning it. That led to one of my favorite parts of the film, the chamber that Harry, Ron and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (Gilderoy Lockhart who is played by none other than the stage actor Kenneth Branagh) discover. He's the cowardly teacher that thinks he's one of the best wizards in history. This made the magnificently adventurous film become even more magnificently adventurous. This is definitely THE BEST Harry Potter film ever to be released and probably will remain. I made a big mistake saying that the fourth one was the most spectacular. I was just astounded by it in the theaters but now I've found out that the second one is still THE BEST. I would be astonished if there was a Potter film that could beat this one. So now we wait. Movie directed by Chris Columbus."

","""Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets"" is a phenomenally well-made film. Although it has taken me a while to start appreciating the Harry Potter films, I can safely say that this one is the strongest of the four so far, with great action, visual effects, acting, story, and tone.<br/><br/>The film begins with Harry Potter receiving a visit from a strange house-elf named Dobby, who warns Harry not to go back to school next year, for there is a terrible danger awaiting him there. When Harry gets to Hogwarts School For Witchcraft and Wizardry (after some perilous yet humorous encounters), strange things start to happen. There's a crying ghost named Moaning Myrtle in the girls' bathroom, the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher is an egotistic madman, and a mysterious part of the school known only as the ""Chamber of Secrets"" has been opened. Soon, no one in the school is safe, and the danger comes to the point where Hogwarts could even be closed. But not if Harry can do anything....<br/><br/>The film is well-acted as well as swiftly-paced, despite the fact that the movie is quite lengthy. Lots of characters and actors from the previous film return for this installment. Overall, this film is very good and is certainly not one to be missed, wizard or not.<br/><br/>Rating-***1/2"
"cwrdlylyn","8","0","2","24 May 2006"," CHAMBER OF SECRETS : A Great Improvement On The First Film...
","HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS <br/><br/>In terms of the Harry Potter books, ""Chamber Of Secrets"" is probably the most light-hearted book in the series. It covers very little ground in terms of offering background on Hogwart's legacy and it doesn't necessarily establish central themes of the entire series... however, it is arguably the most fun. ""Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets"" was a large step up in quality from the first film in the series, and it is without a doubt Chris Columbus' best film to date.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Harry's second year at Hogwarts. The school is beginning to be terrorized by an unknown monster that is supposedly being controlled by the Heir Of Slytherin. The Chamber Of Secrets, a mysterious cave that's whereabouts are unknown to all of Hogwart's staff, has been opened causing students to be ""petrified"". On top of all this, Harry has started to hear strange noises coming from the walls and he's the only one who can hear it. Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger set out to figure out the mystery behind the Chamber Of Secrets and the voices in Harry's head.<br/><br/>What makes the second film so much better then the first film is that it remains focused on the story it is telling. Whereas ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" tried to incorporate more of the fan's favorite moments from the books that ultimately didn't serve the plots... ""Chamber Of Secrets"" edits out all the extraneous material. So although some fans will ultimately be disappointed that certain chapters from the book are missing, the film is far more exciting and cohesive because of it.<br/><br/>By remaining focused on the storyline, all the action scenes are given more excitement. Whereas the first movie used special effects for flash and spectacle (the flying lesson, the shifting staircases, etc.), this film utilizes the special effects to offer more scares and thrills only when the story calls for it. All sequences (ranging from the Spider Pit, to the flying car, to the finale) are handled much better and therefore, ""Chamber Of Secrets"" never lags like the first one.<br/><br/>Performances from the supporting cast are solid as ever, with Richard Harris offering a wonderful final performance as Dumbledore. Kenneth Brannagh also makes an especially entertaining addition to the ensemble. Brannagh plays Gilderoy Lockhart, the arrogant new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, and he obviously has fun really digging into the vanity of this character. Also, Jason Isaacs makes a wonderfully threatening villain as Draco Malfoy's father.<br/><br/>The children still don't quite nail their roles for me... but they are still young. The only actor that really captures his character is Rupert Grint as Ron. I just sense that Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are more tentative when it comes to their roles... whereas Rupert Grint both understands his character and is willing to have fun with him. However, Daniel Radcliffe does do an admirable job of helping bring the CGI character Doby to convincing life. Doby remains one of the only CGI characters in movies (aside from Peter Jackson's films... where Gollum and Kong were phenomenal additions) that adds to the film instead of detracts.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets"" is the most commercially enjoyable film of Chris Columbus' ""Potter"" films. And even though a little more artistic integrity probably could have been added by a more experienced and gifted direct, I think ""Chamber Of Secrets"" stands up against time and the more recent films in the franchise.<br/><br/>...

Even though I Enjoyed this movie, not yet knowing the first time I saw this I was Going to be greatly disappointed in the next two, I felt that it strayed a little from the book.

","This is, so far, the best Harry Potter film made. I hated the third movie, I have yet to see the fourth movie, and the first one is a little lower on my Favorite Movies List.<br/><br/>But this is my favorite HP film so far.<br/><br/>***Spoliers*** I love the actors. Only Daniel Radcliffe can do Harry Potter. No one else comes close. The same applies to Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.<br/><br/>In the book, when Malfoy called Hermione a ""Mudblood,"" Hermione did not know what it meant. However, in the movie, she did know what it meant. This, I like. It made better sense for her to know what it meant, and for Hagrid, not Ron, to explain what it meant.<br/><br/>The third book is my favorite by far, bu the movie makers made BIG mistakes. Too many things were changed or taken out.<br/><br/>But this film, directed by Chris Columbus, was superb. Watch the first movie you watch this one, or read the books first. And make sure, if you watch the third movie, read the book first! Otherwise, you won't understand a thing.<br/><br/>My Score: 9/10."

"Hitchcoc","9","0","2","14 February 2006"," A Little Darker Than the First
","After really being charmed by the first film, I now begin to see more of the darkness and seriousness of these movies. I read and enjoyed the first book, but haven't got the wherewithal to continue to read them. I've decided to rely on the movies. This one takes us to a new level with interesting new characters and, especially, villains. Those who were exposed in the first movie are now developed and a part of the pattern Harry and his pals share. Hogwarts and environs becomes even more amazing and puzzling. The long shots, especially, are so very creative. We find out as each movie comes along that Harry is fallible and must face his fears without much help. This leads to a real empathy with him. There are so many superheroes frequenting the movies these days. Many are pretty tiresome. Their stories lack character. Harry, of course, is a wizard, but he is always becoming. Not being a Potterfile, I am going to have to remain a charmed observer. I think this is a wonderful series and look forward to seeing them all.<br/><br/>After encountering the ever threatening Voldemort, Harry now has a new task. Somewhere in the past the Slitherins, influenced by an evil wizard, kept a monster in a secret place. The purpose of his being there was at some point to decimate the school, sending all non ""pureblood"" students packing (or even killing them). Harry and his friends must find out what happened back then and move to find the person whose destiny it is to release the monster. There are some great scenes her, beginning with Harry being picked up by the Weasley boys and being brought to Hogwarts in a most dangerous manner. Malfoy and his father become bigger threats than they were in the first film and lay the groundwork for a future confrontation. Hagred is sent off to prison for a time, falsely accused, and Dumbledore comes under suspicion. The episode ends in an incredibly clever way, setting the stage for more uncovering of Harry's role in what is thrust upon him."

","Chris Columbus managed to bring the world of Harry Potter to the big screen with success in The Sorcerer's Stone. Now, Columbus returns to direct the second Harry Potter movie, Chamber of Secrets. After watching the movie it's safe to say that it has improved upon the first Potter movie but still falls in areas.<br/><br/>The deal in Chamber of Secrets is that Harry tries to go back to Hogwarts for another year at school but encounters a house elf who is unwilling to let him go. This leads to Harry's rescue from the Weasley brothers and a real intro to the Weasley family. By the time Harry does get back to Hogwarts he has a lot to deal with, as if the troubles to get there weren't enough. Mysterious things happen to students at Hogwarts that is connected to the Chamber of Secrets being opened. From there on, the movie keeps a good feeling of interest for the audience to keep everything go nicely.<br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets is more serious than that of Sorcerer's Stone and is a darker film. But there isn't anything in this movie that should haunt the youngsters until they're teenagers. While the darker mood isn't used to great effect it does help keep the movie going, and very smoothly at that. There's also a bit of real action in this movie, just a bit though. The Quidditch match is more in-your-face than the last and the scene in the Chamber of Secrets has a bit of an edge-of-your-seat way to it that actually works well.<br/><br/>The acting in Chamber of Secrets is improved from Sorcerer's Stone, but marginally only. Yes, the trio has matured since Sorcerer's Stone and it does show, part thanks to Radcliffe's deeper voice. Even with the acting being just slightly better than that of the first it's not a bad thing. In fact, under the circumstances of most Hollywood sequels, this a good thing, as each person in the movie leaves the same good effect as before. A bit of maturity doesn't go a long way here, but at least it shows.<br/><br/>From start to finish, Chamber of Secrets is a worthy sequel that manages to be better than the first in every way. However, the movie is plagued by the extreme loyalty to the book. This also creates problems for the young performers in the movie and it does show. But anyone that has a good taste for movies should be able to find at least one way to enjoy Chamber of Secrets."

"c-blauvelt","9","0","1","23 November 2005"," Harry Potter's Second Year at Hogwarts means more character development!
","Wow! What an improvement in every way over ""The Sorcerer's Stone!"" At first I was a little ambivalent that this film would be essentially a rehash of what happened in the first film, and indeed that is the case, but it helps to examine the nature of the universe and characters created in the first film and ties it in extremely well to the films that follow. More specifically I am referring to how this movie was essentially designed just to provide more character insight into the connection between Harry and Voldemort. Whereas we encountered the ""real"" Voldemort in ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" as essentially a parasite living off of Professor Quirrell, here we have a ""copy,"" a virtual Voldemort created when he was a student named Tom Riddell 50 years ago. The copy has all of the knowledge and memories of the Voldemort in the present but retains the form of the past and even tries to ""become more than a memory."" Not only is this a highly innovative way to flesh out the arch villain's backstory but it also provides greater motivation for his rebellion years ago and for his return two years later. Both of these two movies have the same plot really which is setting up the background and personality of a boy wizard prodigy who comes to learn more about himself through the attempts of his nemesis, Voldemort, to seek revenge. This movie posits Voldemort on a more realistic playing field and yet with the most creative of devices, that of the virtual becoming the real, which then allows for the revelation that Voldemort rubbed off some of his powers on Harry. Is Harry then another more complex copy of Voldemort we wonder? They certainly do have a connection, mutually attracting and repulsing one another, tied by history and circumstances, and yet divided by alternative perceptions of this connection. Voldemort derives his view of the world from his abilities, an ideology akin to predestination, while Harry has defined himself by his actions, his choices, not by any predetermined role that he must play because of the innate tools which he has been given. Philosophically, the ideas are far richer than in the first film. It is as if Columbus remade the same plot only with new scenarios better connected thematically. The complexity of the ideas presented in this film are so far beyond that of typical kids fare, and I can see why fans of all ages are intrigued by this franchise on so many levels. <br/><br/>In terms of intensity this film still grapples with having a kid-friendly, toy-box insipidness that can't accommodate the more complex ideas, more probing character exposition, and darker themes. Once again I feel completely immersed in this magical world, and, although this film is more epic in scope, I would like to see this scale expanded to give us a glimpse of the world beyond Hogwarts. As much as I love the claustrophobia of these first two films, I still find it difficult to posit this magical world within our own real world. The cinematography exudes mythological reverence with its massive establishing shots of the most richly appointed interiors with the only external establishing shots being of the castle or the dark forest. When this epic camera-work could have really been applied to great effect I don't think it was all that effective during the closing battle scene, which should have been taken more seriously than its almost plastic-y, Spy Kids dimension which I think patronizes the youth audience towards which this film is marketed. <br/><br/>The best thing about this film, though, is the acting. Emma Watson has obviously received professional help--acting lessons that is, and the addition of British gods Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs added the right mix of serio-comic absurdity. And their presence helps to mitigate the dull political banter that reminds of the debate over the taxation of trade routes in a galaxy far, far away. Outstanding film all around.<br/><br/>Originality: 100 Intensity of Effect: 90 Complexity: 90 Coherence: 100 Average: 95 Dialogue too stilted for real children at times (-5) Acting excellent (+2) Cinematography (+1) Brilliant pacing (+2) Sumptuous mise-en-scene (+1)<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: A (96)"
"dgale79","10","0","1","20 November 2005"," The Chamber of Secrets Is Open For Business!!!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an incredible adaptation of JK Rowling's second book. In it, we're introduced to some new characters: Dobby the house elf, an enjoyable creature who wants nothing more than to help Harry; Moaning Myrtle, a hysterical and morbid ghost of a teenage girl who wants nothing more than to share a toilet with Harry; Gilderoy Lockhart, a moronic and grinning teacher who wants nothing more than to steal the spotlight from Harry. and Lucius Malfoy, a devilish adult who wants nothing more than to hurt Harry. The movie continues to expand on the world of magic introduced in Sorcerer's Stone and adds an incredible storyline to it all. The story is significantly better than Sorcerer's Stone and one of the most clever in the entire series to date. The kids seem to be more comfortable in their roles now and the adults continues with their brilliance, but I must admit, it doesn't seem like any of these adult British actors have the capacity to be bad actors. Lots of new and imaginative magical items make their introduction in this film in exhilarating fashion: Polyjuice Potion, Riddle's Diary, Aragog and much, much more. The film, like the first, still lacks edginess, but that's fine, because so does the book, and I see nothing wrong with sticking to the books, especially when the books are so good and after all, these movies are made for the readers more than the casual moviegoers. I don't mind creative licensing here or there, but stick with the elements that make the book good, and the movie will be good too. Terribly clever, great cinematography, enjoyable performances and much more make this installment into the Harry Potter series a gem."

","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to his miserable home with the Dursleys after his adventures at Hogwarts during his first year. Before returning, he is warned of great danger at Hogwarts by a house elf named Dobby. He is urged not to go, but Harry is anxious to return back to the only place in which he finds happiness.<br/><br/>Upon returning, Harry meets back up with his two good friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). He finds that he is more popular than ever after his second encounter with Voldemort and happily returns to playing Quidditch. But as prophesied, fear takes control of Hogwarts as students start to become paralyzed, just as years before when the chamber of secrets was open for the first time. Harry is told about the chamber of secrets and how the true descendant of Salazar Slytherin is the only one who could open it. Harry fears that it is he, who has accidentally opened the chamber of secrets because he starts to hear voices coming from the walls and his rare gift of being able to talk to snakes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione journey to save others once again in this wonderful sequel and second chapter of the Harry Potter saga.<br/><br/>Like the original, The Chamber of Secrets has a playful, family oriented tone to it. I found this to be a weakness because the books were not this way. ""Secrets"" finds itself quite equal to its predecessor in just about every way possible. The acting, writing, and effects, all kept at par with the first. Once again, ""Secrets"" comes up short with the book, but did quite well for an adaptation from a book.<br/><br/>The thing I liked best about the movie is that the character of Harry Potter goes more in depth. He becomes more complicated than just your average kid who likes hanging out with his friends than with a family that he considers to make him miserable. He becomes much more than that. He shows us that he thinks in detail about other's actions as well as his own and finds himself making tough decisions throughout the movie. Whereas Harry changed immensely, the other characters remained quite the same, showing no complicity whatsoever. This was disappointing but understandable due to the limited amount of time given to cover a three-hundred page book. Overall, the movie was another great adaptation of the book and shows to be another nice step towards the breathtaking movies that should be soon to follow.<br/><br/>I recommend this film."

","Yet another disappointment for the Harry Potter book fans. Surprisingly, of the three movies, this one stayed most true to the book. I was delighted in some areas, where they truly made some things out as they are in the book, but very upset when they made it out to be a children's film, which they too often do with Harry Potter movies. <br/><br/>Good points: They stuck to the book and made out the Chamber of Secrets most realistically. It stuck to the main plot and didn't get itself caught up in unnecessary details. In accordance to the book, most everything remained in order.<br/><br/>Bad points: Directing wasn't all too great, but not horrible. Again, it was made out to be a film for the kids, when it is not. If you read the novels, nothing is described as it is portrayed in this movie. Several fun details of the book are left out, but for a two and a half hour movie, it is necessary, but it'd be nice for some comic relief.

I personal have not read the book, but now after seeing this movie, it makes me want to read the whole series starting with the first one. My favorite character in this film was Dobby the mischief elf; he is mysteriously great in this film. It was apparent to me that Harry Potters (played by Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (played by Emma Watson) has settled comfortably into their roles.<br/><br/>The theme I have noticed in this film is that family is not only blood.

","I believe that the summery speaks for itself. If there is anything about movies that I simply can't stand, it's a movie that doesn't follow the book it is written about. And on top of that, this movie obviously allows a lot of creative license to the director, because he seems to have changed a lot. That said, it is obvious that he wants to give Harry a lot more credit then is really due him. In the books, we read about a boy trying to make it in a world he doesn't fully understand. In the movies, we see a young superman running around being rather self righteous and suffering from some sort of hero complex. If a movie is going to be the on screen version of a book, then it should remain true to the book. That may just be my opinion I guess..."

And in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, ""The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware."" But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful Movie is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny.

","Chris Columbus stays the course and creates the fullest Harry Potter movie, although it still feels more like the ferris wheel instead of the roller coaster. This is the movie that made me understand the obsession with Harry Potter. The first movie, as well as the first book, feels a little awkward, tentative. The Universe of the story comes into the light in this outing. This movie has the same stellar cast, which is joined by the goofy Kenneth Branagh and is supported by the emergence of the three young stars. Watson is the most improved. She seemed ready for a school play in the first movie. Ratcliffe's stronger voice makes him more believable. This movie, as all three have, suffers from deviation from the book. The worst offenses are the nicing of Branagh's Lockhart and of the final scene. Lockhart was a bit of a ditz in the book, but he was also little mean, which makes his choice in the chamber more natural in the book. The final scene of the book in Hogwarts shows just how smart Dumbledore is, while the movies tend to make him look like too much of a minor character. This can also be said of Snape's diminished role. The special effects are a lot stronger in this movie. Dobby, who returns in Goblet, is a real treat, a good intentioned trouble maker. If you didn't like Sorceror's Stone, try this and don't miss Prisoner of Azkaban, the movies have at least gotten one thing similar to the books, each is richer than the last."

After staying with the Weasley family, including daughter Ginny (Bonnie Wright), mother Molly again (Julie Walters) and father Arthur (The Fast Show's Mark Williams), and before going back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, they pop to Diagon Alley. It is there that Harry is reunited with Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Hermoine (Emma Watson) and unfortunately the mean Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), with his father Lucous (Jason Isaacs). When they get back to Hogwarts, with getting through Platform 9 and 3 quarters and using the blue car, and after being told off, the lessons soon continue again. Teachers include Professor Pomona Sprout (Miriam Margolyes) teaching magic plant handling, and new teacher of The Dark Arts, who Harry met in Diagon Alley, the ""famous"" Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh). The second Quidditch game is good because Malfoy is against Harry as the new seeker. Later, terrifying things are happening to people, they are being petrified by something, and in a lesson with Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) she explains about the note left on the wall, i.e. about the Chamber of Secrets. Later, Harry finds a diary belonging to someone called Tom Riddle, and through this magical book he sees a vision about who may be responsible, Hagrid! Oh, and Harry also finds out he can talk Parceltongue, like a Slytherin student, which comes in handy when they go looking for the beast petrifying everyone, the Basilisk. The Basilisk brings death to someone if they look in its eyes, it's only petrified those people because they didn't look at directly, i.e. reflections or through a ghost. Harry, Ron and Lockhart, who they found out stole all his stories from other wizards, erasing their memory, anyway they find the bathroom with the entrance to the chamber, and where Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) was killed by the beast, and Harry battles the blinded (by the phoenix) Basilisk, and Tom Marvolo Riddle (Christian Coulson, his name is mixed from the words I Am Lord Voldermort). The film ends happily with Hermoine and the other victims revived from being petrifying, Professor Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris, in his last film before dying) returns from Azkaban prison (faulsly arrested), and Hagrid is applauded when Harry makes him one of the big helps. Also starring Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, David Bradley as Argus Filch and John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick. It won the BAFTA for Best Feature Film (Kids' Vote) and it was nominated BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?), and the film was number 24 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!"

","The second one better than the first one? I couldn't believe it but it was true. The second film of Harry Potter didn't get more money than the first one, but it still was better than the first one. Usually, the first movie is better, but Harry Potter was the exception. It has more adventure, reveals more secrets of Voldemort, and better effects. A masterpiece -- let's say it like this. However, everything is not that good. Unfurtnanetly, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the movie with more errors in the history of the movies. It counts with more than 250 errors, as seen in the web page, www.moviemistakes.com . But it is still a good movie. The book is also better than the first one, but it's a little bored at the beginning. This movie shows us Harry being warned of great dangers in Hogwarts, however, he still wants to go. There's a great surprise at the end, so don't miss any detail on the movie. Watch this film if you haven't. Trust me. You'll thank me later."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","0","1","28 February 2005"," Very nice addition to the series
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a somewhat restrained film, as Christopher Columbus makes the darker book seem much more childish than it is. Granted, the main characters are 12 years old, but it was way too light hearted.<br/><br/>It's Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts, and trouble seems to be brewing again. Harry is hearing voices in the walls, voices that he thinks are connected to strange happenings around the school. Meanwhile, the teachers are equally puzzled.<br/><br/>The second Potter boasts stronger acting than before, as the lead actor Daniel Radcliffe grows in talent (and in size). He once again portrays Harry well, and continues this trend in the later sequels. Rupert Grint is the best of the trio with his knack for comedy. He offers some of the best lines in the film, but this is short lived because he gets some of the worst in movie 3 and 4. The adult actors are always in fine form. Richard Harris gives a warm and fatherly performance as Albus Dumbledore, something his successor, Michael Gambon, lacks. Alan Rickman is mysterious again even though his character was proved to be good in the first film. The standouts are Ken Branaugh and Christian Coulson as Gilderoy Lockhart and Tom Riddle respectively. Branaugh captures the essence of the character very well, making it one of the most accurate performances in any of the movies, and given his past, it's no surprise. Definitely the best part of the movie. Coulson also gives a great performance, but unfortunately telling you would be spoiling the ending (although half the world has either seen this or read the book or knows the truth about Tom Riddle). The other actors (Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Jason Isaacs, and Julie Walters) all give fine performances as well.<br/><br/>The film is very restrained in its writing and directing. The script is the most accurate translation of the books, but there are moments where it gets slow. The climax, however, comes out of nowhere and moves along fast, which is one good thing that Steve Kloves does. The film is also an action/adventure breed, and it fits the bill this time around. The quidditch scenes are back and better than ever, although one scene contains the most obvious example of how fast the kids are growing (Tom Felton's voice changes drastically throughout the film). All in all, CoS is a fine movie for the average moviegoer, but the book lovers will find that it is a rather restrained and toned down version of the book. Due to some violence, especially the potentially scary climax (giant snake, anyone?), HPCoS might scare a viewer under age 10.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"
"lamhorwai","9","0","1","23 February 2005"," Harry Potter 2 - Quite interesting
","The one main reason why I like this movie is : It is exciting, and keeps me nervous all the time. During the part in which Harry fights with Riddle, at first Harry is beaten by the curse & I really think that Harry would die. However, with the help of the Phoneix which is sent by Dumbledore, Harry finally can escape from the attack and be safe. In addition, the music, the vivid acting of characters, it all makes me thrill and as if I were in the scene, witnessing the whole incident. I think the music is well written and digital sound effect in the theatre is astonishing. I can still hear all the sound effects even when I am sleeping. Besides, the story fulfills the spirit and the ideal of youngsters: fight against the enemy and having mysterious adventure. I learnt that we have to be brave when we are in tough situation. Furthermore, we need to have confidence for ourselves and at last the good guy can beat the evil. Though we can see such plot and philosophy in other movies, but I am truly touched in this particular one. The story seems to be a mystery when people become petrified one by one. However, with Harry at the most important role, he solves the mystery by himself and fights against Lord Voldemort. Finally he wins and there comes a happy ending. I think throughout the whole movie, the acting of characters, the music, the set-up and the storyline all reach a satisfactory standard for audience.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend that all students should watch this movie as it is one of the greatest movies one should not miss. After watching it, I come out with a view that life is full of hope. The only thing is you have to be determinant and at last you will win."

","The movie was not as enthralling as the book. thats how to put it nicely.

The scenes use fancy special effects that i imagine costed a lot of money for nothing. I rate it 5/10 since i think they could have done much better, especially when it comes to scene arrangements. The characters i like, and yet i like the books. Acting was fairly good, though i remember seeing a blimey lot of bloopers at the blooper site one day after airing. However the experience is enjoyable, and it captivates you in that great way that means that when your sitting on a broken couch in front of old trusty, your old television set that has springs loose and you can hear the little birds outside singing in scary scenes, you still get the same feeling of involvement you get in surround sound projector screen cinemas."

It is a great adaption of the book and once again the actors did a terrific job. Everyone was back and even some new ones came in like Colin and Jason Isaac's who portrayed Lucius and play him brilliantly. The whole feel of this film is dark and creepy and the visual effects in it are better than the first and the most creepiest bit for me was the spiders as i am scared to death of them.

","I hate to say it, but this was actually quite good, and definitely far better than the first movie. The characterisation is much better, although they still carry through a few too many ideas and there is, once again, a problem at the end with tying up the loose ends far too quickly and neatly but still leaving too many unanswered questions.<br/><br/>There's a lot more darkness and levity to this story, and less concentrating on the pure kids element, which I think is beneficial for the the audience of adults and children alike.<br/><br/>The effects are also ramped up a notch from the first, and with no overly CGI effect scenes like the Quidditch match, they are all quite believable. Almost too much for me in the case of the spiders.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is particularly enjoyable on screen, and plays a thoroughly comedic character, something he does very well considering the majority of his performances. Robbie Coltrane provides my second favourite performance in this episode, and he comes across as a thoroughly likable giant. Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs outperforming each other on the creepy, slimy stakes, Emma Watson as Hermione is much less eyebrow and annunciation. It has to be said the casting is extremely good.<br/><br/>All in all an enjoyable movie, despite the ending tie ups and the unanswered questions, it does hold up well. Just not something I would particularly want to watch again."

","While the first Harry Potter was just entertaining, the second one luckily provides more than just that.<br/><br/>Good thing about sequels is that they don't have to waste time on character introduction anymore since we already know the main characters from the first movie. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" also introduce some new fresh character, yet again played by an amazing list of well known actors. Favorite is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father and Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart.<br/><br/>The movie has more story and depth than the first movie had, but still yet again the ending doesn't feel fitting. I did some thinking about it what it is that makes the endings of Harry Potter movies so bad and I came to the following conclusion; The movie is basically about and relies on the three main characters Harry, Ron and Hermione, towards the ending Harry Potter always has to face 'evil' on his own, without Ron and Hermione. I think this is the reason why the endings always feels so out of place, without Ron and Hermione, Harry Potter is quite boring and not at his best. <br/><br/>The movie still has some other downers, such as Dobby the House Elf and the fact that it still relies too much on the book, with as a result too many pointless characters and moments and some elements that are never completely clear for people who never read the books (such as myself).<br/><br/>But thankfully the movie has more ups than downs. Visually the movie looks wonderful with nice costumes and sets. Also the special effects have improved big time!

Then the film makers is going to be able to do a even better job with the experiences they got from the first film<br/><br/>While i liked Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone it had the problem of having to introduce the characters and the wizarding world (fx. Quidditch or the maildelivering owls).<br/><br/>Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets perfectly draws out the important things from the book and mix it up with some of the funny moments that make J.K Rowling's books a joy to read (I'm a big fan of the books if you haven't noticed).<br/><br/>The difference between the two films is that the important thing in the first is the introduction of Harry Potter and his surroundings and then the story is just something that you put in between. In the second film the story is the thing which is focused one and you are still able to get some new informations about the characters, and at the same time introduce some new. You also got better actors, because the kids have matured and got some experience. <br/><br/>When you combine the better structured story, the more experienced actors and the experiences that the crew have got from the first film, you get a very very good film which captures the essence of the books.<br/><br/>All in all ""The Harry Potter films keep getting better film by film"" and if you have only just seen Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets you can look forward to Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban"

"BadWebDiver","9","0","1","7 October 2004"," I am TOTALLY green with envy at Kenneth Branagh!
","Prof Lockhart is the sort of character I would in my wildest dreams have loved to play. As the conceited, flamboyant, secretly craven rogue who's a little too outspoken to be likable, he's the sort of character I would die to perform.<br/><br/>With that aside, I think this film should be congratulated for keeping the personality and characterization that made the first one such a popular success. Yes, the series is getting darker and sinister, and (IMHO) is losing the distinctiveness from the rival LOTR that made the first one so memorable; but the characters are still great fun to watch, have a wonderful chemistry, and the whole effect still clicks very well.<br/><br/>Rupert Grint is still displaying a great knack for comic delivery, Daniel Radcliffe still has the balance of mischievousness and seriousness that makes him such an excellent lead. And Emma Watson is definitely maturing in the role like a full-grown expert.<br/><br/>I thought the final climax was a bit too rushed, and forced; it was very difficult to follow all the plot complications (as I'm not familiar with the novel - which the filmmakers shouldn't assume). But this was still great entertainment value. And I think Hugh Mitchell's Colin Creevey is very cute and sweet."

"Lupercali","8","0","1","8 August 2004"," Real improvement on the first movie
","Well, I was quite pleasantly surprised with Harry Potter II. Like LOTR, I thought the first movie got off to a visually terrific start, but then got progressively bogged down for one reason or another.<br/><br/>To an extent 'Chamber of Secrets' suffers from the same problem, but in this case the first half hour isn't just visually terrific, it's absolutely amazing. The fantasy vision just completely enshrouds you. After that it does suffer a bit from the same problem as its parent: i.e. once they get to the school, you find that without amazing, panoramic things to look at, the story tends to grind on a little (it's a 155 minute movie, after all). However this fault was less bothersome than the first time around, and there is hardly a scene which doesn't contain something unexpectedly delightful (or horrible).<br/><br/>That's one thing that impressed me about Potter II: whereas George Lucas would just fill his second trilogy of Star Wars movies with a plethora of fantastic, whizzing objects, and hope that their cumulative effect would be to daze you into not noticing how boring the film actually is - Columbus deploys all his little cameo monsters, gadgets, objects and scenery with some loving care. The result is that you don't just get gratuitous weird things; you get pleasing weird things which look like they belong where they're filmed, rather than shoved in your face to amaze you.<br/><br/>Though it's quite a while since I saw the original, it seemed to me there was a more adult tone to this film. Certainly there was at least one fairly substantial sequence which was skin-crawling enough to provoke a response in the average adult.<br/><br/>The casting is just superb - again, Columbus employs people who not only can act, but are perfectly suited to their roles, whereas Lucas relegates his few good actors to bit parts and fills his lead roles with people who would barely cut it on 'The Young and the Restless'.<br/><br/>A really impressive film that gets a solid 8.0 from me (the original got 6.0)"
"basrutten","7","0","1","1 August 2004"," An improvement over the first part
","After the somewhat underwhelming ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" I wasn't in a hurry to watch this second Harry Potter movie, but I finally got around to it and I'd have to say that it's a definite improvement over the first one, although there's still a lot that could be done better.<br/><br/>
The best thing about this movie is that it's a lot darker and more mature than the first one. Most of the childish humor is gone, the characters are far more convincing this time around (the children have obviously grown in their roles), and the tone of this movie is definitely more serious than that of the first one. <br/><br/>The plot yet again sticks very closely to the book, although it's a shame that in spite of a 2+ hour running time, almost all things that were not essential to the main plot have been left out or marginalized (e.g. Lockheart barely plays a role of importance, and none of the sharp humor from the book makes it into the movie).  <br/><br/>I also think that too much time is spent on the action sequences (e.g. car ride, quidditch match) and the climax. They look a lot better than in the first movie, but they're all stretched way too long and take up time that could have been better used to flesh out the world of Harry Potter a bit more. <br/><br/>With a bit more focus on characters and details instead of endless action sequences, this movie could have been great. As it is, it's certainly watchable, but it still feels like the director took the easy way out.<br/><br/>

"Angry_Arguer","Null","0","1","11 June 2004"," Cinematic Souls, Borrowed Beings
","Interesting paradox. I admire British filmmakers (Scott, Watkin, Unsworth, Biddle), but when mixed with incompetent American supervisors--like here--we get a mess.<br/><br/>Something like a spoiler warning...<br/><br/>The dominant problem from the first movie is two artless Americans--Columbus and Kloves.  The translation from the books is so literal that no cinematic soul is created.  Compare this to Jackson's 'Lord' series to see where someone tries creating a cinematic soul (yet plagues it with other problems) and then 'Catch-22.'  There a completely separate soul is created, but it is rejected because it doesn't have every nuance of the book.  Why do we keep cutting Jackson slack for work that plagiarize other works, cinematically speaking?<br/><br/>As with the 'Alien' series, we have a formula where different elements are highlighted.  Thankfully, Cuaron changed our emphasis from literal to cinematic.  Since this is totally reliant on the script, our actors aren't important.  Pity since this was Harris' swan song.<br/><br/>The second problem rests in Columbus' handling of the material.  He is constantly warring between being two people: Robert Altman and Steven Spielberg.  Granted, I don't credit Altman with being more than an insufferable loudmouth, but he is at least more stimulating than thoughtless Columbus.<br/><br/>--The whole ""Class War"" subplot is totally juvenile, as is the Celebrity/Society stance.  Altman had already covered this ground without being so ham-handed in 'Gosford'.  Columbus does it in the whole ""smack-me-upside-the-head"" fashion from 'Mockingbird.'<br/><br/>--Columbus becomes Spielberg when it comes to his images.  He repeatedly steals from 'E.T.', 'Gremlins', 'Back to the Future', 'Jurassic Park', and 'Indiana Jones'.  Williams caught on to this ""me-too""-ism, so he recycles his score from 'Last Crusade.'  Even the color scheme is tasteless.<br/><br/>Comments that this is ""darker"" are hilarious.  Darkness doesn't come by throwing in moody music, blood, bigger monsters, or diabolical plans.  If the ending is somber and the hero is humbled, that is far darker than a thousand monsters.  That's the difference between filmic stimulation and simple amazement.  Columbus just takes the images that amazed us before and turns them into spiders and snakes, he obviously didn't learn from 'Empire Strikes Back.'<br/><br/>Speaking of which, something to be said for the effects.  This is so sloppy and artificial that any child can see through it.  We go from Draco to Gollum with Dobby and Jar Jar thrown in the mix.  Not a good track record for CGI characters.  Of course, they follow the Disney character design philosophy--another area where Disney stunted hurt our imaginations.<br/><br/>
However, all is not lost.  We get some nice Dutch-tilted wall shots reminiscent of '12 Monkeys' (also Pratt).  My dream for the series?  Make Attenborough the new Dumbledore, hand directing reigns to Branagh, have Goldsmith do the score, and get Alex Thomson as photographer.  If anything else, get David Lynch.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"

","Chamber of Secrets is definitely the best Harry Potter movie. It improved upon Philosopher's Stone, and had better film-making aspects in it. It is adapted extraordinarily well to the screen from the book, and it's enjoyable from beginning to end. Prisoner of Azkaban was a very bad film, and a horrible adaptation. Chamber of Secrets was great, and still stands strong. Chris Columbus made this movie great, and I wish he would have continued filming.<br/><br/>Dobby was a great character!<br/><br/>I think what made this movie so great was the cast. This movie had the best cast of all three movies so far. Kenneth Branagh as Lockhart was perfect. He was hilarious, a good actor, and fit the part. He really got into the personality of Lockhart. Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy was a stroke of genius as well. And, of course, this movie featured Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore. The third movie suffered greatly from lack of a good Dumbledore, but Harris' performance in Chamber of Secrets is nothing short of perfection. And of course, everybody else was pretty good as well.<br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets really hit upon something. It was a perfect film adaptation of Harry Potter. It's almost indescribable. It didn't leave out anything from the book (except the Deathday Party), it was filmed perfectly, the story was told extremely well, the visual effects are amazingly great (yes, better than the visual effects in PoA, which were pretty bad IMO), and this movie has the best acting of the series (Daniel Radcliffe is the only one that gives a good performance in PoA!). Daniel gives a good performance in CoS. Better than in Philosopher's Stone, at least. He's not quite as good as he is in PoA, but he still does pretty good. Everybody else though, most of the adults, and Rupert Grint, give very good performances in CoS. Rupert Grint was grossly underused in PoA, and what we DID see of him was just his comic relief. In CoS, he is used for a bit of comic relief at times, but he's also a very prominent character who is acted wonderfully.<br/><br/>Chamber of Secrets is no doubt that best Potter film to date, and I can only hope that Goblet of Fire is going to be more along the lines of this movie, than of Prisoner of Azkaban (which is the worst Potter film to date!).

","I think that the main reason that I did not like this movie as much as the first, is that I had read the book first. Between the time I had seen the first movie, and Chamber of Secrets, I had read all 4 Harry Potter books. Sitting in the theater on opening day, I think the main problem was that I already knew what was going on. There were no surprises for me. Everything was pretty much as it happened in the book. I had not read Scorceror's Stone before I saw the movie, so what happened in that movie was more of a surprise.<br/><br/>Still, it is an able movie. The actors do a fine job. The special effects aren't bad. The actor portraying Gilderoy Lockhart does a fantastic job, but the one who plays Tom Riddle left something to be desired. <br/><br/>The movie also suffers from being way too long. I was sitting in the theater wondering when it was going to end. I would recommend this as a good rental, but I wouldn't suggest somebody buy it."

Pretty sad if you ask me.<br/><br/>The second installment in the series, I really think the Potter phenomenon should have stuck to books but, marketing being what it is, I guess that's too much to ask. In this adventure, Harry and his friends get themselves involved with the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets which has been opened a second time and petrifying students all over Hogwarts.<br/><br/>These kids are indeed good actors. Emma Watson in particular never ceases to amaze me. She's a great actress in the making. An entertaining family movie but do yourself and your kids a favor and read the books instead.<br/><br/>5/10"
"ITTMovieFanatic","8","0","1","1 June 2004"," Second of the series
","""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is the second film of the popular series about the boy wizard. I didn't find this one to be as good as the first film (""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""), but it's still a pretty decent movie.<br/><br/>This time out, Harry and friends begin their second year at Hogwarts, this time in a darker tone, as they encounter an evil presence that threatens the existence of the school. Just about everyone from the first movie is back, with a couple of new faces added to the mix. Kenneth Branagh and Miriam Margolyes are introduced as new professors, and Jason Issacs portrays the father of Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter's main nemesis. Everybody's terrific once again.<br/><br/>The elements here are just as good as they were in the first movie. Except I have one quibble about it: the 161 minute running time of the film. The first movie ran only ten minutes shorter than this one, but it felt faster. This second movie felt a little slow going at times, and I kind of wished that director Chris Columbus wouldn't have put so much of it into the finished project. I know Columbus was trying to be faithful to the book, but is it really necessary for a family movie like this to go on for as long as it does? It didn't have to. Nevertheless, this is still for the most part a fun film, and Harry Potter fans will like it anyway. <br/><br/>**** (out of five)"

","A typical Harry Potter film, with stunning performances from: Danial Radclif as Harry Potter, Rupert Gritt as Ron Weasely, and the perfectly G-O-R-G-E-O-U-0-S-E , Emma Watson as Hermione Granger(her parents are the G-R-E-A-T-E-S-T artists E-V-E-R!!!!!!!!). And of course I cant forget to mention the marvelouse Richard Harris as Hogwarts Head Marster, Albus Dumbledor, and it was an extreme tragedy when Richard Harris died a little while after the release of 'Chamber of Seacrets' on to DVD and VHS. i think it is safe to say that Richard Harris made the character Albus Dumbledor what he is today. As a fan i can say honestly that, like other fans i await the release of the rest of the Harry Potter books on to the big screen, however I don't know how thay will replace the awesome talent of Richard Harris, but they will shurly be great films none the less. Thank you for reading my review on the movie 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Seacrets'<br/><br/>Peter Scott Wilson<br/><br/>p.s. if Emma Watson is reading this, I think you are the most B-E-U-T-I-F-U-L girl that E-V-E-R lived."

","The second installation of the Harry Potter films was just as brilliant, well done, and most importantly, entertaining as the first. However, in my opinion, both suffered from one major flaw: the tragic under use and under appreciation for the Snape character played to perfection by Alan Rickman. This movie, like the first, was brilliantly cast, especially with the addition of Kenneth Branaugh as the arrogant Lockhart. But again, I was disappointed with Rickman's 10 minutes of screen time in a 2+ hour movie. Rickman brings a presence to the screen in this role that no other actor could hope to achieve, and is the best cast person in the film. Hopefully, we will be seeing more of this intriguing and deep character and more of Alan in the next film."

The Chamber contains a monster and this monster has murder in mind.<br/><br/>This film, just like the first is addictive and entertaining stuff. With the addition of Kenneth Branagh to the team as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, there is an addition of comedy to an already humour filled series. Ultimately though, once again, it's the combination of Robbie Coltrane and the children which makes this such an enjoyable adventure. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have all matured well and are currently heading towards being serious stars of the future. Radcliffe in particular displaying quality acting ability at times.<br/><br/>Other than praise for the main young performers, there's relatively little new things to be said. The characterisation and plot remain brilliant, mainly due to Rowling's original work, and the films are becoming more slick and well delivered as they run through the series. Simply put, if you loved the first film, you'll love this one. This series gets better and better with time. I'm seriously looking forward to number three now."

","Yes! Harry Potter is back in this - the first sequel to 'The Sorcerer's Stone'. If you haven't read the book then the plot goes as follows- Harry is just about to start his second year at Hogwarts when he is visited by Dobby The House Elf (Voiced by Toby Jones) who warns Potter that terrible things are about to happen at the School, Harry joined by returning pals Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) decide not to listen to Dobby's advice and therefore go to begin their second year. But once they arrive strange things start to happen as students are petrified and turned to stone by an unknown enemy. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened and the monster that lurks within has been set free - But by whom? This is one of the best Children's films since the golden age of Disney, and will appeal to Grown Ups as well as little'uns, with a fantastic supporting cast that includes:- retuning stars Maggie Smith,Robbie Coltrane,Richard Harris in one of his last roles (he sadly died before the film was released) and newcomer to the series good English chappy Kenneth Branagh as the new Teacher of the Dark Arts. It is essentially a Kids film but there are darker scenes that might scare toddlers such as the Giant spiders in the wood.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed this movie as much if not more than the original and it's such a nice change from the usual sex,swearing and violence that seem to dominate today's films<br/><br/>My Rating ****1/2 out of *****"

"Archie_A","Null","0","1","13 December 2003"," Nice, but not without its flaws
","I really liked the Harry Potter books and Chamber of Secrets was (is) my second favorite. As such, I had great expectations towards the movie versions, and while they did a good job in recreating the world Ms. Rowling had created, they still had their shorcomigs, especially the second one.<br/><br/>My greatest problem is how the emphasis was shifted overly to the action sequences. The books are known for their intricate, detective novel-like plot, which doesn't really show here. The creators have spent way too much time on spectacular, but utterly gratuitous scenes, such as the spider chase, the basilisk battle or Harry playing cliffhanger from the flying car above the train (by the way, don't you think someone should have seen or heard them? Oh well). Had these been cut to about one-fifth of length - or omitted completely, - valuable minutes could have been saved and spent on much more important things.<br/><br/>Like character development, for example. In the books, the characters and their interaction provided the comic relief from the tension of the story; unfortunately, there was not time for that in the movie, which is a crying shame. Gilderoy Lockhart isn't half the conceited celebrity he is in the book, and the Weasleys' home - my personal favorite location - is way too briefly sketched. These touches would have added a lot to the atmosphere and thus definitely feel amiss.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's a bad, though. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a decent, good-looking movie in its own right, and thoroughly enjoyable even to those who haven't read the book. However, without all the bells and whistles, and with a little more attention to the ""human factor,"" it could have been much, much better.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."
"jwolford","Null","0","1","1 December 2003"," A Magical Movie
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone explained the difference between the magical world of wizards and the non-magical world of muggles.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets clearly spells out the racial lines between purebloods and mudbloods, witches or wizards with muggle ancestors, and has a darker theme that emphasizes the evils of racism.  In this installment Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (played by Rupert Grint), and Hermione (played by Emma Watson) must fight to stop the genocide of the mudbloods. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Ron, accompanied by two of his brothers, free Harry from his aunt and uncle's home where he is being held. Soon after the students return to Hogwarts something begins attacking mudbloods and Harry begins hearing voices.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione then set into motion a plan to find the Chamber of Secrets and try to destroy the monster before any mudbloods are injured. There are a number of similarities between the Chamber of Secrets and Lord of the Rings the Two Towers.  The most notable similarity is the underlying theme of racism.  Other similarities include the fight between good and evil and the use of magic.  In the Lord of the Rings each of the races believes its race to be superior and orc race trying to eradicate all of the other races. Chris Columbus directed both Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and the first installment Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.  Columbus really sets the stage with the appropriate use of high contrast, low key, and three-point lighting.  Light and dark have very symbolic meaning and without correct use the movie would have lost much of its ambiance. It is very important in today's society that children learn about racism and the effects it has on others.  While education at home and at school are extremely effective tools in eradicating racism we should grasp all opportunities to teach this lesson.  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is able to connect with children and addresses this issue without pressure."

","1. Kids (especially young kids) do like to see the same things repeated over and over with variations. Kids TV shows tend to be like this, they will even watch the same episode over and over.

Will the kids who loved it look back on it when they are 25, 45, 65 and still think it was great, or will they wince and think ""yeah it was fun, but..."" such as I do looking back on ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" or ""Battlestar Galactica""."

","Harry Potter returns to the wizard school Hogwarts for his second year of schooling, along with his friends Ron and Hermione. But danger's afoot for the boy wizard. Before the start of his second year, Harry is visited by a House Elf named Dobby. Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts, but of course Harry doesn't heed his warning. Besides, he must escape from the clutches of his cruel, nasty adoptive family.<br/><br/>So Harry's busted out from his imprisoned bedroom by Ron and his brothers in their flying car. It occurs to me here that this is a movie that might be just a little bit far out and trippy if viewed while under an influence not quite the same as reality. Ron's flying car takes the boys back to their family's house; unlike Harry's adoptive parents, Ron's parents are both magical practitioners; purebred magicians, if you will. It is with the Weasley family that Harry returns to the school.<br/><br/>But alas and alack! Ron and Harry miss the train back to Hogwarts! Ah, the flying car; that'll do, that'll do. Naturally, they almost crash into the train with the car, and actually do crash into a particularly nasty gigantic tree on the grounds of Hogwarts. Eats cars, you know.<br/><br/>That's just the beginning, though. The boys, joined by their friend Hermione, learn that people are being petrified for no discernable reason at Hogwarts. Who's to blame? Is it Snape, the professor with an obvious disdain for Harry? Is it Malfoy, the slicked-back blonde bully? Or is it the newest professor, Gilderoy Lockhart? The early evidence points to Harry, of course, and Hagrid, the Gamekeeper.<br/><br/>Harry and his pals must follow the sometimes obscure clues to find out who's responsible for this skullduggery. What's worse, the headmaster, Professor Dumbeldore, is under pressure to find the culprit. And for some reason, there's this creepy whispering voice traveling through the halls of Hogwarts that only Harry can hear - and, for some reason, he can now talk to snakes? Does all of this tie in together, somehow?<br/><br/>Well, of course it does. The appeal isn't the end result, it's the journey. This is about as good as the first Harry Potter movie, full of the same mystical charm, although the kids are growing up a bit (the boys in particular are hitting puberty, what with their deepening voices and all). I haven't read the books, but from what I'm told the movie follows the second book rather closely. <br/><br/>A real treat for sure is seeing all of the veddy excellent veteran British actors in the cast: Kenneth Branagh,  Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, John Cleese, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Alan Rickman, Miriam Margolyes, and Richard Griffiths.<br/><br/>The Chamber of Secrets is about what you'd expect from a Harry Potter movie; it has style, substance, verve, and audacity. The latter is because the movie dares to be as good as the original, if not better. All too often the sequel to a hit movie tries to rest on the laurels of the first film, not venturing out on its own. While it's evident that Chamber of Secrets is part of a series, it's also an excellent standalone movie.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is rated PG for ""scary moments""; in fact, there are some gross ones, as well. Which means your kids'll love it! The movie is 161 minutes long, so stock up on the popcorn."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","1","31 December 2002"," The Harry Potter series returns with a powerful sequel that adds to the depth of the story introduced in the original film and even throws in a few new characters, all of whom fit perfectly into the Harry Po
","The second installment in what is proposed to be the seven-part Harry Potter series delivers the same intensely imaginative and visually stunning wonders of the original, and is widely considered to be much darker, literally and figuratively, than the original. It is refreshing to see that this sequel did not take the treacherous path of trying to cash in on the success of the original (an unfortunate tendency that is occasionally successful, as in the case of Ace Ventura and Blade, but almost always results in a bitterly disappointing sequel, as was the case with sequels to Austin Powers, Men In Black, Halloween, Mission Impossible, The Exorcist, etc.), and the film is wisely just as faithful to the novel as the first film.<br/><br/>
I have heard and read many complaints suggesting that director Chris Columbus was not creative enough to add in his own vision to the film, changing it enough here and there to make it his, but this is completely unnecessary. Books are only adapted to film if they are at least moderately successful in their literary versions, and the more successful the book is, the less reason there should be to change anything in it. The Harry Potter novels from J.K. Rowling have been justifiably described as `publishing phenomenons,' in which case I can't see any reason why anything should be changed in the film version. The books have developed a tremendous fan base, and what these people want to see in a film version of the books is a cinematic experience that is as imaginative and fantastic as the one that runs through their heads as they read the novel.<br/><br/>I read both of the first two Harry Potter novels after having seen the films, and both times was amazed at how faithful the films are to the source material, a little detail which has led to tremendously satisfying adaptation films in the past, such as The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, and Great Expectations, which was a great film despite the fact that it falters slightly in the last act. The Chamber of Secrets is an adaptation film that follows closely on the heels of a tremendously successful predecessor, and still manages to hold its own.<br/><br/>The younger audience is sure to delight to no end in the way that our three heroes, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, take on the task of solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets (I'm surprised that this was never used by Franklin Dixon (whose real name escapes me at the moment) as one of the titles of one of his thousands and thousands of Hardy Boys novels), entirely on their own. This is an adventure tale of the highest order, which pits these three pre-adolescent wizardry students against an ancient mystery that the rest of their schoolmates and even the most seasoned staff at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are rather apprehensive about looking into. <br/><br/>As the Harry Potter series continues, it becomes more and more apparent that J.K. Rowling had the entire series in mind when she began writing, as much of the action and the story in The Chamber of Secrets involves and expands on material from the first film. The lovable Hagrid, for example, was mysteriously expelled from Hogwarts fifty years earlier, for reasons that he never liked to discuss, and through a story told by probably the most innovative diary in fantasy/adventure movie history, Potter is taken back in time to see exactly why he was expelled, which reveals Hagrid as the prime suspect in the film's mystery and helps to keep the audience guessing until the very end. <br/><br/>Aside from bringing back all of the original characters, the movie also sets up the third installment by giving us a detached but fairly clear introduction to the wizard prison Azkaban, in that we hear a lot about it and see Hagrid taken off to spend some time there, which only wets our appetites to see it more clearly, which is sure to happen in the third film. One of the more interesting extensions on the original story is the introduction of Draco Malfoy's equally antagonistic father, played with precision by Jason Isaacs, who adds perfectly to the rivalry between Draco and Ron (whose families famously have remarkably opposite financial situations) by pitting Ron's father almost head to head against Draco's father. The good vs. evil plots in the Harry Potter films have so far been just about as ultimately shallow as the ones in the Star Wars films, but as was also the case with those, The Harry Potters are so imaginative and come across as such stunning visual experiences that it makes up for the basic storytelling technique.<br/><br/>Even more than in the first film, Harry and his friends are faced with solving a tremendous mystery without any outside help, which usually comes from the lovable Hagrid, who has unfortunately been wrongfully accused and thrown into prison, leaving them entirely on their own even among a variety of helpful professors, particularly Albus Dumbledore, who also runs into some serious hardships that it's up to our heroes to fix. The plot revolves around a mysterious creature that seems to have escaped from the Chamber of Secrets (which does or does not exist, depending on who you ask and what they're too afraid to admit) which is running around the school occasionally petrifying students, crimes for which Harry Potter himself is gradually blamed.<br/><br/>The rivalry between Potter and the vicious Draco Malfoy is just as fresh and appealing as ever, with Malfoy never seeming to let go of his hatred for Potter, a hatred which he holds for good reason and which expands upon his character's personal history, as well as Potter's. The mystery escalates to a point where the entire school is on lockdown, and the very future of Hogwarts is considered doomed, even by the head masters, McGonagall and Dumbledore. Harry Potter and his friends embark on a wonderful and tense adventure in this powerful adventure film. My only complaint about the Harry Potter films so far is that the endings tend to be a little bit too clean and tidy, almost to the point of being Scooby-Doo type endings, but the adventure is so genuine and so exciting that it more than makes up for polished endings. The Harry Potter saga is off to a powerful start, and the success of the novels certainly suggests that this will continue."

"Mentat327","5","0","1","13 December 2002"," Was this by the same director? Is this the same cast?
","The cast of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone did an excellent job; specifically the three children who stared in the movie. They almost looked like real kids being almost overwhelmed with real adventures that you and I could only dream of. And the director, Chris Columbus, did a pretty good job making an entertaining movie out of what was essentially a children's story with many contrived parts.<br/><br/>But The Chamber of Secrets almost looks like it was made by other people. The acting was stale in most parts, over baked in others. And the movie just lumbered along from scene to scene like it was directed by some novice. It's almost like they said, ""We don't care for this particular story, so let's just get through it so we can get to the other movies."" You can almost hear the characters thinking, ""Ok, here we are in class again... Here we are at the quidditch match again... Here are the ghosts...again."" And if that ending was just like the book, I think we could have forgiven Chris Columbus for taking some creative license to improve upon it, just like the LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring was an improvement on the book (an rarity, for sure). Let's hope the cast and crew didn't spend all they had on the first movie with nothing left to give, because there're still 3 more to go."

The acting is great, and the special effects and all the visuals in general are amazing. But...

I can highly recommend this one and suggest that one bring a child for that extra added pleasure of seeing them enjoy themselves."

","I won't try and run against the stream of JK fans out there, but I thought this movie ran 45 minutes too long -- and without reason. The spiders in the dark wood? The quiddich (sp?) game? The teeth-pulling plodding of the opening scene with Harry's muggle family, ensuing rescue by magic-knowing people, and the trip to the place where you get outfitted for Hogwarts...(wait, weren't all those from the first movie?). Many of those (and other) scenes simply added length to the movie without providing anything new except to show that HP has a huge xf budget. I would have thought, though, that Hollywood learned something from TPM or AOTC, namely that even the most imaginative creations can't cover for a story that lacks much....story."

"nalepis","5","0","1","30 November 2002"," What the...?
","For the love of God, people hated poor Jar-Jar and are actually coming out saying that they liked Dobby? Not only he looked like an Auschwitz survivor (albeit a short one), but he was the most irritating, self-abusive, ultra-annoying piece of CGI I've ever seen.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it was pretty much a dud. Take all the bad things form the (mediocre) first one, magnify them and you have this cold, calculated money trap. Why do we have to spend more than half an hour to see everything that we've already seen in the first movie? Such as Harry's eeeeevil uncle and aunt, the bloody train station and that wizards' hidden alley? Or another, meaningless, go at the boring and illogical quidditch game? Which serves nothing to the plot, may I add. This is the film's greatest problem. It consists of dozens of little vignettes that add absolutely nothing to the story. They're only in, because: a) they're in the book and b)give an opportunity for another effects shot. Thus, the pacing is terrible. Somewhere in here there's a good film, but to get out it would need a brave team of screenwriter, director and editor that would deliver a tight 90 minute film. As it is, it's terribly boring and at the same time rushed, something which I thought was physically impossible. Oh, did I mention that the characters are cardboard cut-outs? Or that the music is recycled from the first film and padded with differently orchestrated pieces from Attack of the Clones? And what's the big deal with Harry? He spent the complete first movie and 2/3 of this one doing absolutely nothing, it's always Hermione saving the day and doing all the spells and tricks. Some weird self-pitying sexism from mrs. Rowling perhaps? And is there some conspiracy by the teachers to kill Potter? In the first film they send him to the deadly forbidden forest for detention (!), in this one, they send him back and into the lair of a giant spider. Do they warn him? Nooo sir! <br/><br/>
On a final note, there's no question about it, Voldemort is Harry's father, no matter what Potter-heads might say to you. He might not be mr. Potter, but his father he is. Can you say Star Wars rip-off?<br/><br/>I haven't read the books, but, judging from the films I can't get what's so special about them. Especially for adults. Next one, I'm watching it on video."
"Beast-5","Null","0","1","29 November 2002"," Wonderful for the most part
","One of the most fun things about the HARRY POTTER movies is that they are not only a who's who of British acting, but who will be. Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson. Rupert Grint. Christian Coulson. They have huge careers ahead of them,and the established actors and actresses all have the time of their lives. Kenneth Branagh was a perfect choice to play Professor Lockhart. So was Miriam Margoyles,as Professor Sprout(one of my personal favorite characters.) Of course,Richard Harris did a masterful job as Headmaster Dumbledore(my favorite character); whoever designed his office deserves an award. Again,the script nearly sucks the fun out of the character,but Harris rose above it. <br/><br/>Maggie Smith continues to be an excellent Professor McGonagall,as does Alan Rickman as Snape. Snape is a complex guy,constantly at odds with himself,and Rickman realizes it perfectly. Of course, Robbie Coltrane was born to play Hagrid. Hagrid rules. Then there's David Warner,as Filch,who's pretty ominous. I couldn't tell if Mrs. Norris was a real cat or not. Speaking of animals: Fawkes kicks ass. So does Hedwig. There's a rumor that Hedwig is actually Madame Hooch; it makes sense to me. And Dobby is no Jar Jar Binks. Dobby is hellarious, and some of the things he did dropped my jaw. Jason Isaacs was pitch-perfect as Lucius Malfoy. <br/><br/>Of course,there's the subplot about wizard prejudice; it is handled well,particularly when they tell Hagrid about Hermione being called a mudblood. I love the way Hagrid and Hermione deal with it.<br/><br/>
The special effects ranged from amazing to not bad. If you haven't read the books,I'll just say that something happens to Harry's arm and the the translation from page to screen is amazing,as is the ""eat SLUGS!"" bit. The Burrow is another triumph of set design(loved the clock.)<br/><br/>
Cons: Warwick Davis didn't have any lines at all. Zoe Wannamaker(Madame Hooch) was missing. No one noticed J.K. Rowling's cameo except me. Again,there were things I really wanted to see that didn't make it into the movie or were changed around. <br/><br/>I keep hearing complaints from people about how the ending dragged on and on and on. To those people,I say: sit down and shut up until the storytellers are finished. The ending is great and I'm glad I saw this movie on a big screen instead of waiting for video."
"ayric","5","0","1","28 November 2002"," Improvement, but Still an Hour Overlong
","Better, darker and funnier than the first wreck of a film. Quite sophisticated Hitchcock-like mystery complete with Dutch angles. Kenneth Branagh is absolutely hilarious.

Still for kids. <br/><br/>Rating - 5/10"
"ArrivederciBaby","5","0","1","26 November 2002"," This Film Was Made By Accountants.
","I can understand that after the first Harry Potter film became an international cash cow, the rush was on to capitalize financially with a sequel.  But clearly there was just too little time for the artistic crew to come up with anything as quaint as a plot or character development. Instead, pointless action scene after pointless action scene is thrown on the screen in random order, leaving the entire cast of fine actors with nothing to do but stand wide-eyed, pretending to react to mediocre computer effects.  (And don't even get me started on ""Dobby"", who actually made me wish for Jar-Jar Binks)  Absolutely devoid of the charm, emotion and magic that makes for a great fantasy film.  It will rake in millions upon millions of dollars, but what a shame."
"dudleynomore","Null","0","1","25 November 2002"," Passable entertainment
","People have been saying this is better than the last instalment, and they're right. But it's still only average. I could write a small book on the stupid plot problems of this film (although many are also problems with the book). SPOILERS. If Harry has an invisibility cloak, why do he and Ron need to disguise themselves to get information out of anybody? Can't they just follow them around? If the first victim of the basilisk wasn't killed or injured (and it didn't even kill a squidding cat - I'm so scared), where did the blood which was painted on the wall come from? Why wasn't the phoenix affected by the basilisk's gaze, and wasn't it convenient when Tom Riddle TOLD Harry it had been blinded? Wasn't it great how Tom Riddle EXPLAINED everything to Harry? Convenient also how Harry was able to pull a sword we'd not previously been told about out of the hat - he'd have been completely screwed otherwise. Phew. How come no-one else could hear the basilisk hissing from the pipes if Harry could hear it well enough to understand?<br/><br/>
And now a list: The basilisk was rubbish and looked too much like a snake. Dobby was irritating, although not as irritating as I expected. The Quidditch match was way OTT. The flying car/train action sequence was pointless. The phoenix looked CGI, as did the pixies. Yawn.<br/><br/>The acting was better this time (especially the child acting, although there were still problems). Kenneth Branaugh was great. Richard Harris was great as well, sooo much better than last time. None of the other veterans got time to do anything, although in a film this length that's a necessary sacrifice. The editing was much better near the beginning of the film, but then it went back to the slow pacing of the last instalment in order to cram everything in. I hope they paid John Cleese well for the day of acting in front of a green screen he must have done for his 10 or so seconds of screen time. The cinematography was much better (which helped a LOT), and although I've been whinging about the special effects, they were also better.<br/><br/>The script could have been much better. The direction was boring, as expected. Nevertheless, I liked it how they avoided the problem of the giant spider talking by just not showing it below the eyes - class! The ending, which other people have complained about, was for me probably the best part of the whole movie - it was hilarious! All those kids cheering Hagrid for (drum roll) HAVING BEEN SENT TO PRISON!!! And we've never seen Hagrid speak two words to any students except for Harry and his little gang. Whatever.<br/><br/>
Kids will love it, for now. But these stories won't last - the problems with them just become so obvious with time. Sorry about that. Me, I'm looking forward to the Two Towers, which also features animated trees and a short elf-like semi-antagonist, but will have a story that makes sense. Funny how dispensable that is to many people."

Has the average IQ really sank so low that adults can't be bothered to read books by, lets say, Dostoevsky or Tolstoy?

And I don't like the pointless Quidich (sp?) game, the rules of which seem inconsistent. The house elf wasn't funny. It doesn't make sense how how Harry and his friend found the train using the car.

The most interesting character in this is Draco Malfoy who certainly does develop from his role in the first film.
