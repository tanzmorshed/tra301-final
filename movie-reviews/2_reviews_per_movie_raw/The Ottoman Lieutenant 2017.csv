"ChipperX","10","317","482","16 March 2017"," Movies Are Not Politics, Nor Are They Documentaries.
","While some reviewers cannot see beyond the work of the actors and 
 director in a project, others pay to escape life and be immersed in a 
 world we cannot otherwise visit.
 
 The Ottoman Lieutenant is a grand, sweeping movie that has war as its 
 backdrop. This movie is not a documentary. The artists who worked to 
 bring us this bit of fiction immersed themselves beautifully within the 
 project, and their hard work stands out, much like the Merchant Ivory 
 films. The movie itself does not ask for a review of its accuracy, it 
 simply asks that we put aside the trappings of our present environment 
 to imagine a different vista.
 
 If you are interested in enjoying beauty for its own sake, then you 
 will enjoy this film. If you are still intent on reliving the 
 atrocities of the past, then l suggest you stick to documentaries, and 
 only those with which you wholeheartedly agree.

"armyforever-28741","10","207","325","16 March 2017"," deeply flawed film, as both romantic epic
","Unabashedly old-fashioned and romantic, this World War I-era movie fearlessly plucks at the heartstrings while offering glorious, big- screen cinematography ... and a bit of revisionist history. The Ottoman Lieutenant may may lack big-name movie stars. And, because it was funded largely by Turkish financiers, it shines a positive light on the country, largely ignoring the Armenian Genocide of 1915. But if you judge it based on goal of telling a romantic story against an intense wartime backdrop, like a mini-Dr. Zhivago or The English Patient, it succeeds handsomely.<br/><br/>The three characters involved in the love triangle are very appealing, and their human qualities make their relationship all the more complex. Plus, Ben Kingsley is wonderfully hammy as the founder of the Turkish hospital. Veteran director Joseph Ruben, who usually makes low-level thrillers (like the excellent The Stepfather) forgoes any tricks and simply uses a gorgeous widescreen backdrop with spectacular landscapes and plays of light to underline his story. The telling of it is smart but not confusing, tragic but not weepy, and swoon-inducing without being dopey."

","Very emotional movie, great acting, great cast, great plot. Simply incredible. I'm not really an emotional person, and the only movie that I've ever got teary eyed in was Hachiko. But then this movie made me just as much emotional if not more. Would definitely suggest it to everyone. Don't know about the historical value of the movie. But if you watch it without any prejudice, I guarantee that you will enjoy it. It's more than just a movie, it is."
"Ed-Shullivan","5","13","18","10 March 2018"," So what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
","Okay I will admit that as far as action/adventure/romance films go, I have seen a lot worse, but after watching thousands of films over the past six (6) decades I appreciate viewing more than the run of the mill wide angle cinematic adventure with excellent color and a decent music score but that takes too many liberties with historical events. <br/><br/>This film is a story about a 23 year old Philadelphia nurse named Lillie (Hera Hilmar) who comes from a well to do family. Lillie rather quickly becomes disenchanted with the class struggles in her hometown and infatuated with an American born doctor without borders named Dr. Jude (Josh Hartnett). Dr Jude is only in Philadelphia to acquire donations and to speak about the hospital he works at which is indifferent to the imminent first world war and whose sole purpose is to serve both the Turkish and Armenian soldiers who insist on either killing each other first, or maiming each other as a consolation. So Lillie abandons her comfortable living, cashes in her grandmother's inheritance for medical supplies which she expects to deliver to her dreamy doctor's hospital thousands of miles away. To travel to the hospital Lillie is assigned an Ottoman Lieutenant named Ismail (Michiel Huisman). Lillie and Ismail are from two completely and diverse backgrounds both in their religious beliefs as well as their customs.<br/><br/>So you can figure out there is the makings of a love triangle with Dr. Jude (Josh Hartnett) and Ismail (Michiel Huisman) vying for the naive nurse Lillie's affections. I really liked Michiel Huisman's portrayal of Lieutenant Ismail and I was not very impressed with either Dr. Jude's medical prowess, nor with his continuing to put on and repeatedly take off his spectacles from the bridge of his nose. Quite frankly I would have preferred to see him continually pick his nose than to remove and place on, remove and place on his spectacles, it was irritating and added no value to his proficiency as a medical doctor.<br/><br/>As for Lillie, she was quite attractive, but once again her abilities as a nurse working in a foreign countries hospital were questionable at best. If you must see it for yourself how poorly she behaved as a nurse look no further than the final scene in the film where she is outside supposedly attending to the wounded soldiers. She puts her hand on their forehead (some diagnosis eh?) as they lay on a stretcher and then she points them to one of three entrance ways as if that is going to stop their bleeding?<br/><br/>I liked the film overall for light entertainment with above average cinematography and a decent musical score. The adventure and action sequences though were below par. I give the film a five (5) out of ten (10) score."
"yelenabilgic","10","135","244","7 May 2017"," Nice movie
","This is very nice movie and really i'm very happy to watch it. Scenario is historical based and casting is perfect. Even you can't understand how your time will go so fast... Additionally that movie is throw light on a piece of near past and you are easily understanding that Armenians are telling lie about 1915 events between Armenians and Turks... Armenians has killed too many Turks during the war and Turks has just defended themselves, so at the and Turks has won that fight... Anyway, when you watch that movie, you will see what kind of things really happened and how Armenians are telling lie... Have nice watch,"

"mert-ercetin","10","117","216","7 May 2017"," Rather than over-politicizing the movie, it is also possible to enjoy a story of the east front of WWI
","I believe the ongoing dispute over ""Meds Yeghern"" should not taken to be central to criticize the movie. It's documented in history that armed political organizations such as ""Taşnaksutyan"" (which had members among ""İttihat-Terakki"", quite ironically) became rebellious during the WWI. The deportation and unfortunate results during that can be considered as Ottoman Government's response with unintended consequences against this Armenian nationalists back then. This law has had recoils for the young Republic of Turkey till end of 20th century, too (the assassinations of ambassadors by ASALA). Therefore the movie's attitude to distant itself from political dispute seems reasonable.<br/><br/>Even though the plot's being centralized a love story and a dilemma between the loyalty for home and the love/sexual desire for the eccentric is quite generic, but it's best audience attraction mechanism at hand. Still the movie can be enjoyed as a pavement stone to tell the war stories from non-European/non-American parts of the world and for the sake of Haluk Bilginer who shows tremendous acting performance whenever he plays.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the animation of İstanbul in 1910's is what I can't wait to see in the movie. And the sublimity of the Ottoman capital that is lost after the rapid urbanization starting with the municipal administration of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, current president of TR."
"hayirenefb","1","123","229","30 June 2017"," Completely unconvincing
","This is a story that is taking advantage of people's ignorance in regards to the world history, particularly the region in questions. The acting is rather stale, the movie is horribly fake. while the natural beauty of the landscape is being taken advantage of by the makers, it cannot compensate for the obvious intent of the propaganda which is the main original not so hidden intent. Definitely not worth your hard earned dollars. Go see something more exciting."

Michiel Huisman did an excellent job and fulfilled the role. (As we expect from Daario:) )<br/><br/>Great tale, nice movie to spend time."
"filmtravel101","4","51","91","26 July 2017"," Terrible script and acting - B movie - forget the history it is just bad
","I watched this film not knowing what it was about thinking perhaps due to the title it was similar to one of the my favorite films The English Patient. Unfortunately it was like a low budget B film that wished it had actors like Nicole Kidman and Eric Bana but instead hired 2 actors that sort of look like them.. but are not good enough to be lead actors at this stage of their careers and cant carry a terrible script but kudos to the director for even attempting to shoot it.<br/><br/>Here are the problems about this film that had some potential and yet have little to do with the history issues which is rather pathetic also but only a minor issue of the main problems. <br/><br/>The 2 main lead actors have no chemistry and Hera the female lead is as bland as water and sounds like a 14 year old teenager that just reads her lines with no depth whatsoever, but maybe one day will perhaps have some potential as she matures but in this film she has no emotional scale to be a lead. It was so painful to watch and her narration was so childish it made one almost wish they hired someone else to narrate it.<br/><br/>And her male leading man is also even more bland so there is the main problem with this film. Forget about the terrible script/dialogue that can be forgiven due to the majestic landscapes which are fantastic and the best part of the movie is the supporting cast of Josh and Ben that are wonderful but not enough to carry the entire film. Honestly i do not understand why they did not switch the roles of Josh and this dull lead actor. At least those two seem to have a little chemistry. Bad decision making just like Valerian that also bet on the 2 wrong actors and bombed.<br/><br/>Spoiler: And the funny part is when the lead actor is sent... totally alone on a suicide mission. This is a lieutenant, not a private or low level soldier is sent to blow up an armory of weapons inside a castle guarded by Russian soldiers. Yes more like a suicide mission 007 would do alone. Did the writer really think this through or was there not enough money in the $40 million budget. Simply hilarious and this is the son of a big military man. This is just one example of how pathetic this story is not to mention the lead actor asking the American lead to go out of her way to help some Armenians after he was almost killed by them. Yes that would be high on his list of things to do. The film writing just gets more silly and ends with him thankfully dying and his body being tossed out of a boat into a lake. Hum.. but i don't think muslems really like being buried in water esp if land is right in sight of them. <br/><br/>I give it a 4 star rating because of the supporting cast and the beautiful landscapes and not sure how on earth 13k people are giving it 8.1 which is impossible to imagine. Rotten tomatoes is more in line with a 21% rating. 2/10."
"gokayoral","10","140","271","7 May 2017"," Good script and a mirror to historical realities
","The actors and director and script team done well. Unlikely below evil- minded Armenian friends' comments, the movie tells us much about historical realities. Besides, keep in mind that movies are just movies. We do not need to see art as a part of political conflicts. I liked the acting and screenplay. The script is satisfying."
"falcon291","4","88","166","20 May 2017"," A bad movie, don't waste your time.
","A Turk voting 4, oh no it must be a miracle, one can easily say. I watched it then I vote for it, maybe it is the difference, or I was not paid to vote for it, maybe it is the difference, I don't know. But let me say, this movie sucks.<br/><br/>The movie tells a story of a love triangle between an American doctor, an American nurse, and a Turkish officer. This is the main story. As always Hartnett is the loser as the American doctor. Huisman is the Turkish officer who will be dead at the end of the movie and the winner of the fight to win the nurse's love, and Hilmar is the nurse so the prize.<br/><br/>The first problem of the movie is the chemistry between players, well the problem is there isn't any chemistry and Huisman and Hilmar were not even allowed to kiss. If you are trying to make a propaganda movie disguising as drama or romance, you must allow them to kiss. If it is for the Turkish audience, then still in our movies and TV series even Turkish players kiss, then why? Then why did you pay that much money to all these famous players? Still, Hartnett was believable and he and Kingsley made the movie watchable. Instead of scenery shots, I would like to watch Kingsley and his drama more. Also, Bilginer was good.<br/><br/>About historical facts. Without getting into too many details, producers of the movie tried to show the events in Turkish aspect of the view. History was in the background, but main themes were not all Turks were bad, so not all Armenians, but it was the Russians. Of course, the events were not as it was depicted in this movie, but it is too be honest irrelevant to this movie.<br/><br/>Shortly, do not watch it, you must have better options, take a walk, do some gardening, watch TV, play video games. But don't watch it. It is not a historical movie, it is not a romance movie, it is not a drama, but it is a bad movie. Just this."
"carolrmag","6","5","6","6 November 2017"," Could have been an epic
","It is a good movie, when it could have been a great one. The acting, image, directing, scenes - they were all very good. The problem was the script. The storyline wanted to be everything and ended up missing. Here is a case where the ""less is more"" sentence would have been a bless. They wanted a love triangle and they put it there; they wanted an historic movie. They got one and it was accurate; They wanted action and it is there. In the end you get a lot of information with a lack of depth. Nothing is as compelling as I wish it would be. The history, the love triangle, the true love story, the courage, the intrigue... It all lacked depth and it is really sad, because the story deserved to be awesome."

"rick-georgesco","5","39","71","28 July 2017"," An answer to the Armenian funded ""The Promise""
","The way I see it this is the answer to the Armenian funded ""The Promise"". Both films have good and bad parts, it's obvious both do have a hidden political message. Both tried to fill the cast with some resounding names. Frankly it seems to me that this movie does not have the intensity generated by its nemesis The Promise. Cinematography is very good but it missing depth, long shots riding over the wheat fields too much repeated, some content empty scenes....well to me it's 5 stars!"
"fatihdevos","4","25","43","27 July 2017"," Disappointing Cheesiness and Shallowness
","I was really looking forward to this movie. At last, a Hollywood flick about the Ottoman region during the Great War, a theme very close to my heart because my roots are Turkish. The reviews also looked quite promising, and the high IMDb score gave me extra motivation to spend my evening with this movie. And although the costumes, the Ottoman people, the setting and a lot of scenes (e.g. Istanbul panorama) are quite beautifully and accurately portrayed (even though Van doesn't look like Kapadokya at all, where a lot of scenes seem to have been shot), I really felt more and more disappointed as the movie was continuing. The typical Hollywood romance that you always have to endure when watching these historical movies, was way too cheesy to be bearable this time, partly due to the mediocre lead acting (Ben Kingsley's performance was the only convincing one as far as I'm concerned). The story was also very oversimplified, and seemed to lose more and more of its credibility near the end, especially when the Armenian theme was brought into it (not because of my own political convictions, I don't take a stand in this matter because I wasn't there, but because of the shallowness and the lack of nuance in the way it was portrayed). I really had high expectations for this one, and in a way I am happy that they made this movie, but I believe they could have, and should have delivered a less cheesy, and more elaborate product with that kind of budget. What a pity."
"berkergul","9","88","176","7 May 2017"," A great movie with some minor cons.
","It seems like most of Europeans and North Americans made their mindset through their political perspectives. Your anti-ottoman mindsets are not goodenough to criticize this movie in order to promote some other movie. 9 out 10 comments here are biased, subjective and misguided. So please try to criticize movie not the Ottomans. So lets continue with movie. Movie is well played with famous characters from Turkey like Selcuk and Haluk. They are perfect for their characters. For the nurse and main character i can not say the same perfection but they are good. The scenario might be little bit better but i would say a great movie from Eastern front of WW1. <br/><br/>Note: we never see such movies about eastern front a lot. so lack of empathy of westerners are total disaster for connection between western and eastern cultures."

","The Ottoman Lieutenant was largely panned by film critics. On review Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 21%, with an average rating of 3.6/10. Several critics criticized the film for perpetuating the denial of the Armenian Genocide. In his review for Variety Dennis Harvey writes, ""(In) this primarily Turkish-funded production, the historical, political, ethnic and other intricacies — not to mention that perpetual elephant in the room, the Armenian Genocide, which commenced in 1915 — are glossed over in favor of a generalized 'Whattaya gonna do war is bad' aura that implies conscience without actually saying anything."" In his review of the film for Slant Magazine, Keith Watson writes, ""More conspicuous than The Ottoman Lieutenant's rote melodrama is the way the film elides the concurrent genocide of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman forces, a historical reality which the Turkish government continues to deny to this day."", while critic Roger Moore called The Ottoman Lieutenant ""a botched love-triangle romance set against a revisionist account of the Turkish Armenian Genocide."" On March 7, 2017, the Armenian Youth Federation Western United States issued a statement, urging the public not to watch the film in theaters or support it in any way. ""(We) do feel it is important for our community to be aware of the fact that genocide denial is present and still a major issue, even outside of the Republic of Turkey,"" read a part of the statement."

","Greetings again from the darkness. A story of romance smack dab in the middle of war is always a bit risky and sometimes difficult to sell. Make it a love triangle and toss in distinct religious differences, and if it's not a mess, it'll do till the mess gets here (a sentiment borrowed from the Coen Brothers).<br/><br/>This is director Joseph Ruben's first feature since The Forgotten (2004), and he's also known for Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), the breakout dramatic role for Julia Roberts after Pretty Woman. The film is written by Jeff Stockwell, who is best known for Bridge to Terabithia (2007), and the script leans heavily on melodrama while also sprinkling in some acts of war.<br/><br/>Hera Hilmar (who favors Abbie Cornish) stars as Lillie Rowe, a head-strong free-thinking nurse living a life of privilege in 1914 Philadelphia, but committed to an ideal of justice for all. She meets a handsome and equally idealistic Dr Jude Gresham (Josh Hartnett) who is fundraising for his hospital located in the remote hills of Turkey. Circumstances are such that a Turkish officer is assigned to escort Lillie to Gresham's hospital. As if enough sparks haven't already flown between Jude and Lillie, it's pretty clear that the attraction between her and Ismail (an excellent Michiel Huisman, ""Game of Thrones"") is even stronger. The fourth key character here is Jude's partner, Dr. Woodruff (Sir Ben Kingsley), whose immediate dislike of Lillie is quickly dispensed once she exhibits her medical competency.<br/><br/>Lillie is warned  war is coming. It's WWI and it's the Muslim Ottoman Empire vs the Christian Armenians. To label this revisionist history is an understatement. The 1915 Armenian Genocide is only alluded to with passing mention that the Ottomans ""took steps"" to control the Armenians. Even in such a lightweight and hokey melodrama, an omission like that jumps out. Whether it's selective memory or outright propaganda, it seems obvious that the Turkish financiers were hoping to make a political/historical statement hidden behind a romantic triangle wrapped in war. The sweeping score by Geoff Zanelli and the beautiful cinematography of Daniel Aranyo both emphasize the romance aspects, while minimizing the fighting and cultural clashes."

","when I viewed this movie, the question why anyone bothered to make it kept coming back to me. <br/><br/>I know nothing about the first world war and even less about the Armenian genocide that was part of it, but I know enough to see that this story over-simplifies the issue and understates the atrocities by a wide, insulting margin. An accurate portrayal of these events is clearly not the point of the movie.<br/><br/>I am not a romantic person or so my wife tells me, but I know enough to see that this is a horrible over-simplification of how romantic attraction can pose dilemmas in a wartime setting. We can safely rule out the desire to tell a good romantic story as the reason as well.<br/><br/>I do not know how exactly special effects and other technical aspects of film making combine to produce an acceptable level of realism, enough not to get in the way of the story. But I know enough to see that this is not meeting even the most amateurish standards in that area. When no-one is holding the helm of a sailing vessel because the crew is otherwise occupied, it will turn in unintended directions. When a truck crashes into a ravine, it does not turn up running quite happily a few days later, its cargo of medical instruments including delicate glassware intact. We can assume that it was not intended as an action movie either ...<br/><br/>So the worst thing is perhaps that the question why the movie was produced remains intriguingly untouched. Someone must have written a proposal and some investors must have thought to themselves that the story had potential .... questions, questions."

As I watched the movie, i was incredulous at terrible acting, cliché dialog, and odd plot which made no sense at all. Only as the movie unfolded did I start catching the set up:? it's a whitewash job of the Armenian genocide. A shameless fig leaf for the atrocities committed by the Turks. Once I realized that, all of the oddities fell into place. The movie was made to support one narrative - hey it was war. people died. there were bad turks, good turks, bad armenians, good armenians, stuff happens. look at all that was happening in Europe. <br/><br/>People who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves. I was shocked that Ben Kingsley would take part in this monstrosity. <br/><br/>You can't change history: Turks killed millions of armenian civilians. That's a genocide.

The questionable reality of WWI, that is depicted in every movie that has the backing of the Armenian diaspora, seems to have been avoided and thus, the audience can enjoy watching this film to a greater extent without being overwhelmed by genocide propaganda.<br/><br/>The film does not take the Armenian point of view as a matter of 'veritatis incommutabilis' but it rather tells the stories of both sides. The fact that some Armenians had already joined the Russians and formed armed groups before and during WWI, the events of this war remains as a highly controversial topic for those who look at history impartially. Apparently over 6 nations fought against the Ottomans and at some stage even the Australians had joined the British to fight the Ottomans. It is a miracle that the Turks survived such an apocalypse and founded a republic out of the ashes of Ottomans. I suppose if the Ottomans had only been Christian, we will now have been talking about the tragedies that they endured during WWI. Having said that, the film actually does not deny the humanitarian tragedy that occurred in the Ottoman Empire but it leaves it to the audience to decide whether the events of WWI should be regarded as genocide."

"ravitchn","7","4","8","8 December 2017"," Love amidst genocide and war
","I am amazed that this movie could deal with the background of the Ottoman Turkish genocide of the Armenians in eastern Anatolia without ever coming to grips with what really happened. The movie deals with the early days of WWI in Anatolia, with a large Armenian population which is clearly headed for death and also a Kurdish population in the service of the Ottoman government which is never mentioned. The real culprits here are the Russians, described as brutal savages and Cosacks (which they were but that is a partial view) and some of the Turks, but not of course the Ottoman lieutenant whose allegiance wavers between his nationalism and his love for an American nurse. Love wins out, as does death and genocide.<br/><br/>I am wondering if Armenians in America and elsewhere are complaining about a movie which is somewhat pro-Turkish and not at all sympathetic really to the Armenian cause. This is a complicated subject and both sides, Armenians and Turks, are guilty of much but the victims were largely Armenians and they get most of the sympathy in real life, except for those countries trying to make nice with the Turks. But the movie prefers a romance to historic truth. That can be OK but surely not for everyone.<br/><br/>The movie manages neutrality between victims and murderers but the romance helps you to ignore this, if you are not of Armenian heritage."

You say it is a propaganda because it conflicts with your propaganda."
"lavatch","Null","6","15","1 August 2017"," Merhaba, Miss Lillie Rowe!
","While the title of this film is ""The Ottoman Lieutenant,"" the protagonist is in fact Miss Lillie Rowe, the strong-willed young woman from Philadelphia, who visits Eastern Turkey in 1914, determined to deliver a truck and medical supplies to an American Christian mission hospital outside the city of Van.<br/><br/>Miss Rowe has witnessed the racism in Philadelphia that segregates hospitals, and she finds herself in Turkey in the middle of two men who love her, one a Christian (Dr. Jude Fisher) and one a Muslim (Lieutenant Ismail Veli of the Ottoman Imperial Army). She also finds herself in the broader conflict of the Muslims interacting with the Christian Armenian population in Eastern Turkey.<br/><br/>The film combines romance and history in an epic style with breathtaking vistas and landscapes in Turkey. Two of the most spectacular scenes were a glimpse of Agri Dagi (Mount Ararat) and the picturesque island of Ahtamar, as Miss Rowe was introduced to Turkey by the Ottoman Lieutenant. The film also made use of documentary footage from World War I and voice-over narration delivered by Miss Rowe to explain how Turkey sided with the Germany in World War I and faced an invasion from Russia.<br/><br/>The senior physician at the mission, Dr. Woodruff, seems fatalistic that the medical facility might only serve as triage. By contrast, Miss Rowe genuinely believes that she can make a difference. She even sets Dr. Woodruff right in assisting him out of his depression and addiction to ether. He had suffered the loss of his wife to typhus, and, with the guidance of the idealistic Miss Rowe, he finally emerges from his indolence.<br/><br/>The background on the Armenian genocide is developed haphazardly throughout the film. We learn from Dr. Jude Fisher that ""this war in Europe will split the country down the middle."" But there is only a vague sense of the Armenian slaughter that decimated the Armenian population in the early part of the war. The filmmakers would have us believe that the Turkish army was primarily intent on eliminating the Armenian ""rebels"" who had gone over the side of the Russians. It is not until the ethically minded Ottoman Lieutenant takes a stand against civilian killings at the end that we get a glimpse into the atrocities committed against the Armenians at large.<br/><br/>Overall, the film primarily develops the romantic narrative in the unfolding love triangle of Lille Rowe, Dr. Jude Fisher, and Lieutenant Ismail Veli. While the relationships were clearly developed, the film gave short shrift to the emerging passionate relationship of Miss Rowe and Lieutenant Veli. In the most intense scene, the Lieutenant stops and asks Miss Rowe, ""Are you sure?"" That is a definite sign of lack of confidence not only on the part of the lieutenant, but by the filmmakers in handling the romantic content of their movie. And when Miss Rowe has to prompt her lieutenant to kiss her by asking what is the word kiss (Buse) in Turkish, the audience is genuinely concerned that the direction of this romantic relationship may not run a smooth course.<br/><br/>There was a nice touch on the part of the filmmakers in developing a broader them of spirituality. When the Lieutenant takes Miss Rowe into the Blue Mosque in Constantinople, she asserts that ""it's like being inside God's thoughts."" That non-demoninational statement is effectively developed as a spiritual theme that joins the two characters in their quest to serve humanity in a time of crisis."
"pavlick","7","4","9","11 November 2017"," Nice Movie But Not Remotely Similar To ""The Promise""
","It was a nice movie and well acted, but if one is looking for the Turkish Government's response to the movie, ""The Promise"", this movie doesn't come even close to countering the cruelty and savagery of the Turkish Ottomans toward the Armenian People. In fact, very little of the film has anything to do with the Armenian People. It has much more to do with the relationship between the Turkish government and the Christian Red Cross mission.<br/><br/>The movie does attempt to confuse and mitigate history by hinting that SOME Armenians may have joined with invading Russians during WWI to overthrow the Ottoman Empire. But this was well after the Ottomans had already begun the genocide of the Armenian People, so it was only natural that some might have seen the Russians as their liberators.<br/><br/>The movie goes out of its way to present the Muslim Lieutenant as the ""good guy"" in the film, but I suppose that would be normal being that he was the protagonist in the film. It only ascribes cruelty and genocide to a mere handful of possible renegade Turkish troops rather than government-sanctioned atrocities, as depicted in ""The Promise"". <br/><br/>The movie was very interesting and well done. But it is hardly the ""antidote"" to ""The Promise""."

Never once is anyone bothered by her not wearing a headscarf in this fantasy version of old Turkey. Ben Kingsley shows up to throw away yet another world-weary supporting role.<br/><br/>Outright revolting is how the movie sleazily attempts to excuse the Armenian genocide by depicting the Armenians as lowlife bandits and traitors that were no doubt asking for what came to them. Standing in for the presumed (but eventually non-existent) American audience, our heiress thinks it is best to stay silent about the mass murders the Turkish government carried out, and it very much seems that is what the movie wants rest of the Americans do as well.<br/><br/>While the movie has all the characteristics of a failed Hollywood production, it is produced by a Turkish company.

What I like most about this movie is the acting done by Michiel and Hilmar. They played their roles so well and believable. Emotional, and wickedness concludes their(characters) relationship. Why were Armenians at war with the Turks? There has got to be religion and racial ties involved just as any conflict in state. I strongly believe that his(Ismail) Jihaad at the ending, proves to show that not all Muslims can extremists and terrorists, but will die doing Good's sake. Costumes, culture were pretty good. It's a movie not a documentary so I think the history part played well too. Just as I said, I fell in love with Turkey after watching the beautiful scenes.

","A terribly scripted tale of war and love in midst of WW1. The plot is all over the map and there really isn't much of a script. The only thing that keeps ones eyes glued to the screen is the Turkish scenery but it's not something to recommend others to go see. There just isn't much in the dialogue or engagements between actors to keep the audience alive. This is a poor attempt to release a movie just around the time of The Promise which served a better job at portraying a deeply moving time in history, the Armenian Genocide."

","The data provided by IMDb's web page for this film indicates that it had an estimated budget of 40 million Dollars but it generated revenues of less than one million Dollars. I feel pity for the producers, because obviously many good intentions were intended at the start, and certain themes brought forward were really interesting, such as:<br/><br/>-At the beginning of the last century, a strong willed woman seeks charitable work overseas;<br/><br/>-A love story between an American (Christian) woman and a Turkish (Muslim) soldier;<br/><br/>-Real effort was done in recreating the context of events (filming locations, historical background)<br/><br/>-Very good casting of the three main characters (the nurse, the young doctor, the soldier)<br/><br/>-The theme that in wars it is never totally black or white, and too often individuals are swept by events and are not free with their own choices (this idea is cleverly presented during a conversation between the young doctor and the nurse).<br/><br/>So what went wrong?<br/><br/>-Some of the dialogue is poorly written and is a bit ""cliché'd""<br/><br/>-Many situations are left without closure (the nurse never writes to her parents even though she grew in a house that values compassion and caring for the less fortunate: She seems to be solely guided by the memory of her late brother even though her parents effectively prepared her for her life choices / the nurse does not tell the doctors how she saved the day by letting Turkish soldiers out of the church / the doctors are not told that the Lieutenant saved a group of Armenians at the risk of his life);<br/><br/>-Sir Ben Kingsley is wasted here, though he tried to make the best of the very few lines he was given;<br/><br/>The major flaw in the film is the way it was directed: It drags on and appears slow time and again, cohesion seems lacking, and no real effort or passion seems to have been invested in presenting a sweeping love story in a particular historical setting despite all the material that was available (good story, top actors, location). The film is partially saved by its cinematography and its convincing three lead characters.<br/><br/>One final word on the historical context: The film does not pretend to present an accurate account of the tragedies that played out during those times (especially the full scale of the horrible Armenian genocide) however and as stated earlier it is about individuals caught in circumstances over which they had no control whatsoever. I wish I could give it more than 4 stars, I feel sorry because the film could have been much, much better."

","Very nice romance in beautiful scenery of Eastern Turkey. Just watch the movie and enjoy. And about the history, one of the reviewers already told it:<br/><br/>I believe the ongoing dispute over ""Meds Yeghern"" should not taken to be central to criticize the movie. It's documented in history that armed political organizations such as ""Taşnaksutyan"" (which had members among ""İttihat-Terakki"", quite ironically) became rebellious during the WWI. The deportation and unfortunate results during that can be considered as Ottoman Government's response with unintended consequences against this Armenian nationalists back then. This law has had recoils for the young Republic of Turkey till end of 20th century, too (the assassinations of ambassadors by ASALA). Therefore the movie's attitude to distant itself from political dispute seems reasonable."
"gradyharp","8","4","13","25 August 2017"," 'The most dangerous place to be during war is in love.'
","Jeff Stockwell provided the screenplay and Joseph Ruben directed this slice of history from the early stages of WW I as it encroached on the Ottoman Empire, driving a split between the Christian Armenians and Muslim Turks as exacerbated by the inclusion of the Russian forces. It is a well-considered examination of the brutality of war, the collapse of both the Ottoman Empire and the decimation/genocide of the Armenians, and the role America played in the drama in providing a safe haven hospital in the midst of the battles. It is also a love story that deals with the same conflicts – religious differences, ancient customs, the then 'secondary role' of women, and the survival of contested love.<br/><br/>After her brother's death from tuberculosis, young nurse Lillie Rowe, a beautiful, strong- willed woman (Hera Hilmar), who, frustrated by ongoing injustice at home and her Philadelphia parents' prejudices (Paul Barrett, Jessica Turner), leaves the United States after meeting Jude Josh Hartnett), an American doctor who runs a remote medical mission within the Ottoman Empire - a world both exotic and dangerous, and on the brink of what is about to become the first World War. There, she works as a nurse, and finds her loyalty to Jude and the mission's founder Dr Woodruff (Ben Kingsley) tested when she falls in love with their perceived enemy, Ismail (Michiel Huisman), a lieutenant in the Ottoman Imperial Army. Now, with invading army forces at their doorstep, and the world about to plunge into all-out war, she must make a decision if she wants to be what other people want her to be, or to be herself. <br/><br/>The development of the story is well balanced as we see the brutality of the Turks slaughtering Armenians, the prejudices of Americans who fail to respect the value and stature of women endangering their lives to save wounded patients, the artificial barrier between Christians and Muslims in time of war and in the concept of love, and one of the reasons the story plays well is that instead of stereotypes portraying these misconceptions, the writer and director have instead placed those challenging differences in the characters of their story. In many ways this is a love story that addresses all the issues so rampant during WW I. For this viewer it works. Add the extraordinary photography by Daniel Aranyó and the musical score by Geoff Zanelli and the result is a memorable reenactment of a moment in history whose impact remains."

Few knowledgeable individuals would swallow the absurdity of this twisted narrative and it is a shame there was not more historical veracity applied to the development of what was otherwise a promising story.

","I had this film come to my attention via Netflix. I'd shown an interest in all things Turkish having been an affectionate traveller there and enjoying the diverse people - most of whom (I met) adore the secular anti-Ottoman Kemal Ataturk's legacy, Many of my country-persons feel similarly since what we know as the ANZAC invasion (under Britain) in 1915. That is another story.
.
I viewed the film in a non-nerdy fashions, loved it as I happened to anticipate a bit of escapism and romanticism. The leading man and the 'triangle' love-story helped this!
To my dismay many of the reviews latch immediately onto contemporary political points-scoring. I don't know why this engaging relationship in a scenically beautiful film can't be accepted for what it is. It is in the same genre as countless other 'good man in amongst awful war priorities and complexities' Casablanca, From Here to Eternity, numerous Brit films let alone US's frequent stereotyped heroics and Australia's Gallipoli.. A local 'hero' is permissible surely? Someone who is initially obedient but comes fo question his inherited professional career. How does that thread make this film an anti-Armenian propaganda piece?<br/><br/>And to dump the actress for her 'appalling American accent"". Really? Her gentle voice-over added to the narrative - for me.<br/><br/>Overall I've found in my choices of Islam-based films that the innate 'let the woman choose' aspect of the passion such as the leads shared works fine in a piece of fiction.

Ben Kingsley was excellent, as expected. I enjoyed seeing Josh Harnett again after Penny Dreadful and look forward to seeing more of him in the future now that he seems to getting his career back on track. Hera Hilmar is a new face who seemed a little young for the role while Michiel Huisman was perfect in his ability to portray a reluctant soldier unable to extract himself from life's circumstances but willing to fall in love regardless of tradition and culture.

They just were your citizenships and you were able to save them from this atrocity but you didn't do that.
<ul><li>Spoiler-</li></ul><br/><br/>This is absolutely a good example of westerners' hypocrites. Because in the movie he is an American doctor and he never consider that how did they wipe the American natives and other nations out of their own countries. During the war years many of the areas across the world happened some tragedies. Both Turkish and Armenian people suffered big sorrows. But finally this was a war and some lose and some win. Turks and other muslim poeple would probably have shared the same results with the remaining Armenians after the war if Armenians had been won the war by being allied with Russian supporting. They choice being part of Russian forces which was the enemy of ottomans even though they were still a part of ottoman citizenship, so they lost and faced the painful results.<br/><br/>Well I have a question what differences are there between Armenians and American natives in this context? Or what were there their fault? They'd lived for ages in the america independently until the white men came there. All remains of them are now american citizenships. Did all you Americans have to save them or wipe them out? If ottomans had ruled the North America at that time I'm sure now you westerners would still have blamed Turks why didn't we save them against the massacre of the white men.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, the movie can be better at those points which are casting and scenario and direction.

","Beautiful romantic movie set against the backdrop of World War I. I don't know why many people are saying it as historically inaccurate etc etc. I mean, the movie never claims to be based on history or historically accurate. It is a love story between an American nurse and an Ottoman Army officer, only the timing of their affair also coincides with World War I.
Maybe because I am neither American nor Turkish, so I watched it as neutral. Watch it as a neutral. Think of love story not World War I or history. It is not a lesson in history. <br/><br/>Watch it for the story, for the locations. Beautiful scenery, exotic locations, don't know where it is filmed, maybe Turkey. You will fall in love the landscape. <br/><br/>The lead characters play their part very well. Michiel Huisman is coming up very well. Hera Hilmar looks beautiful. They are good, but they are not big names at the moment and this movie needed some big names to be more recognized. If it was made in 60's, someone like Omar Sharief could have played the Ottoman Lieutenant and today it would have been regarded as a classic. Maybe if they become big names in future, maybe, the movie will have more appreciation. <br/><br/>Ending, I think they messed that part. I mean there was no need for Ismail Veli to die. He is the main lead of the movie, the movie is named after him and he also has the girl. The guy deserved to live at the end of the movie. 
They shouldn't have made it a tragedy. Maybe current times or generation is not that much into tragedies.<br/><br/>Also, pace is fast for a romantic movie. I mean, they should have taken some more time into character development or cultivated the romance between Hera Hilmar and Michiel Huisman. Such movies tend to be a bit slow and long and it also works for them very well. 
Still a beautiful movie to watch."

","The acting was not the best, and I wished I could see more of history than just a romantic love story between two people . There are several things that the writer or the director or anyone worked on this movie should have noticed to make this a credible one. First, Ismail, the turkish soldier says that he is a muslim cannot touch the American nurse just because she is from another religion. this completely wrong; a muslim man cannot touch any woman whatever her religion is except after marrying her. To have a complete sexual relationship without marriage is not acceptable and I found this very humiliating to the respect of women of other religions.
Second, when she went to the mosque, he told her that it is time to go out of the mosque because she is a woman, that is wrong, women can stay in the mosque and men are not supposed to bother since as she did wore a veil and respected the place and people there.
I hate it when those who have money to make such a movie to be watched by millions of people are ignorant and lazy to do research first. Yet, the movie made me curious to read more about the Armenians and their history and sufferings."

Also, most unfortunate, was the decision to open the film with Lillie and her parents - Mr. and Mrs. Rowe (Paul Barrett and Jessica Turner.) The Row's opening performance was wooden and simply unbelievable acting.
