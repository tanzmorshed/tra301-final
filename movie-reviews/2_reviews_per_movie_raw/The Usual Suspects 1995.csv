","Ah, the Usual Suspects. My personal favorite movie of all time. Don't let my bias be a fool. Perhaps it's not THE best movie ever, but it's one that I never get tired of.<br/><br/>If you like flash and bikinis and breath-taking camera angles, you won't find them here. Usual Suspects is not an ""epic,"" and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a modestly-budgeted piece by a fresh director (who later went on to do the X-Men movies, a FAR departure).<br/><br/>A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects an object worthy of praise above its humble-looking shell.<br/><br/>The casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.<br/><br/>Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time."

","DISCLAIMER: Not seen 'The Usual Suspects' yet? Then don't waste any time reading this! Rent it, buy it, borrow it, I don't mind, but watch it before you bother reading any further.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons that 'The Usual Suspects' leaves such a long-lasting impression on the viewer is that it takes advantage of the gullibility of the audience. For the first 100 minutes we are delivered an intriguing and complex story to which there seems no easy answer. When the final piece of the puzzle seems to be in place the entire film is turned on its head. This final revelation initially leaves you speechless and then shortly after the audience realises that they have fallen for a brilliantly inspired trick. The second great trick that this film plays on its audience is making us think that by watching it again we'll be able to understand slightly better what was really going on. The truth is that the more you try to make sense of it, the more confusing it becomes. It's probably best not to try to look for any concrete answers and just accept that we fell for the filmmaker's tricks. The success of the film is mainly thanks to the sense of satisfaction the audience is left with at the end of the film. I think that people love the idea of a story when you're not sure who you can really trust, along with the realisation that the film's most shady characters are the filmmakers themselves.<br/><br/>Aside from the twist the film is also unique in the way the narrative is presented. The majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks by crippled con artist Verbal Kint (a performance which deservedly won Kevin Spacey his first Oscar). The film's other Oscar went to screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed 'The Way of the Gun' (2000)) for his brilliantly constructed screenplay. It's a testament to the director, Bryan Singer that he was able to combine all these elements and turn them into something which is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. His moody and stylish direction help to bring the film together and perfectly complement the film's dark tone. A mention should also go to John Ottman for his skilful editing and amazing score.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is more than just a film with a clever ending. It revealed an awful lot about film audiences and showed us that their expectations can be used against them. It is also a film about story telling and the importance of myth. I think that one of the most valuable lessons that filmmakers can learn from The Usual Suspects' is that the more interesting and intriguing your story is the more your audience will believe.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects was certainly not the first film to contain twist ending (the twist ending became one of Alfred Hitchcock's trademarks) and was certainly not the last ('The Sixth Sense' (1999) also used this technique effectively but left more subtle clues for the audience to pick up on their repeated viewings). Despite this 'The Usual Suspects' remains one of the most innovative and memorable crime thrillers of the nineties."
"Infofreak","Null","339","418","13 December 2001"," A stone cold CLASSIC!
","'The Usual Suspects' has received a lot of comment for its killer twist ending, which while by no means the first in movie history, has proved to be enormously influential (stand up Messrs. Fincher and Shyamalan...). But this movie is so much more than a surprise ending! It is a meticulously scripted, faultlessly acted masterpiece that stands up to repeated viewings. Every single time I watch it I notice some new detail, or get more enjoyment out of a performance or scene.<br/><br/> This movie really put  Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the ensemble cast is outstanding, even Stephen Baldwin(!), who has never appeared in a movie this good before, or since.  I also got a kick out of the Paul Bartel ( 'Death Race 2000', 'Eating Raoul') cameo, and the ultra-cool Peter Greene's ('Laws Of Gravity', 'Pulp Fiction') all too brief appearance. Bartel is sorely missed, and Greene one day (mark my words!) will become the star he deserves to be.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer has yet to live up to the promise shown here with his subsequent movies, the average 'Apt Pupil' and the disappointing 'X-Men'. For all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the real star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational script, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved it's Oscar.<br/><br/>It really doesn't get any better than this!! One of the greatest movies ever made, any time, any where. A truly unforgettable experience."
"dbdumonteil","10","280","346","12 December 2005"," the American thriller of the nineties
","One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: ""the movies of the nineties"" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). For others it will be ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) while others will praise to the skies ""Se7en"" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, ""the Usual Suspects"" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.<br/><br/>The average viewer who watches ""the Usual Suspects"" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch ""the Usual Suspects"" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.<br/><br/>From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this ""coup de theatre"" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.<br/><br/>Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.<br/><br/>A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, ""the Usual Suspects"" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision, be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening..."
"tjowen","Null","128","156","16 February 2003"," Better than the sum of its parts
","The Usual Suspects is two movies in one.  Enjoyable the first time you watch it, even more enjoyable the second time round.  The first viewing asks questions that are answered in an `I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer.  It requires a certain amount of commitment, though.  Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching.<br/><br/>It concerns the story of five felons brought in by the police for a line-up and how those same felons reluctantly end up working for the mysterious and ghost-like Keyser Soze: a legend among the criminal fraternity, a man who no-one has seen and lived, a man so dangerous that he is thought to be the devil himself.you get the idea.  The plot is rather intricate so I shan't bother to explain it here but it does rather make me think that Christopher McQuarrie, the writer, kept going to the office in the morning with yet another complexity to add that he thought up the night before.  That's not to say it doesn't work, far from it, but it does leave you reeling from the sheer amount of information and names thrown at you from the offset.<br/><br/>Gabriel Byrne is good, but not flawless, as the tortured Dean Keaton who is torn between his career as a criminal and his forlorn attempt at trying to go straight, but his relationship with uptown lawyer Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) is badly explored and I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as the crippled Roger 'Verbal' Kint and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic.  The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, supposedly Keyser Soze's right-hand man.  He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer has done well to bring such a momentous and involved screenplay to life and any gripes I may have cannot detract from the fact that the film, as a whole, is much better than the sum of its parts."

","I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a ""gimp."" There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying."
"thinker1691","9","81","103","12 July 2007"," "" The Greatest Trick The Devil Ever Pulled""
","Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****"
"tfrizzell","Null","182","244","26 June 2000"," The Film That Made Kevin Spacey a Star
","""The Usual Suspects"" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't watch just once.  The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup.  However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts.  An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout.  Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances.  But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work on all levels.  This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"".  5 stars out of 5."
"Agent10","10","319","438","1 June 2002"," Not enough good things to say
","Such films like this should be enshrined in museums, simply due to the fact it destroyed the entire genre of mystery films. While this film was unique and captivating, no other mystery will ever accomplish this sort of cult status, single handedly shaping a genre. While most mysteries try to shock you too often with twists and even more twists, it turns out to be overkill. This film encompassed such ideas with flair and originality, which is probably the reason Brian Singer is sticking to sci-fi action films. Only Memento and The Game are the only recent mystery movies worthy enough to stand beside this film. Sadly, Singer has somewhat sold out by doing the X-Men movies, but I guess trying to make films like this would be too taxing. This film will always bring a smile to my face when I watch it with someone who hasn't seen this movie. A good viewing every time I watch it, the new special edition DVD is awesome."

","If plagiarism were a crime in film techniques, director Bryan Singer would be imprisoned for life. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would be serving a similar sentence. However, since it is not, Singer and MacQuarrie (who have joined forces again after the not-so-successful PUBLIC ACCESS) took advantage and duplicated nothing but the best. From CASABLANCA to PULP FICTION, and even a version of a line (intentionally or otherwise) from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.<br/><br/>Many people oppose watching a film with a twist a second time. I disagree. By watching it again you can observe how the director and the screenwriter have hidden and revealed clues, how they have tried to steer the audience away from the ending. First time is for entertainment. Second time is for art. This film is certainly worthwhile to see again. To date, I have watched it five times. (Two of those five times I thought, 'well, I'll just watch about half-an-hour,' but ended up watching the entire film because it is so entertaining.) I'm not exactly a noir fan, so it is assured that this particular crime film appeals to a wider audience.<br/><br/>THE USUAL SUSPECTS has a skilled director, an engrossing screenplay, and ten praiseworthy performances. The film runs a fast 105 minutes. Don't miss a minute of it."

The supporting cast, including Gabriel Byrne, provide the basis for a convincing drama which will change the way you perceive crime thrillers in the future.<br/><br/>One is required to discover the identity of the elusive Keyser Soze throughout the film and if it were not for the well thought-out script and professional dramatic acting then the viewer would feel a sense of anti-climax.

Kevin Spacey gives one of his two best performances (the other being as John Doe in Se7en) in my opinion.  That is probably why he was awarded Best Actor for this role.  It was truly deserved.

"Vishal_s_kumar","10","35","45","21 November 2009"," ""and like that...he was gone.""
","Boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve near-mythological status, The Usual Suspects is known for riveting suspense and action, an intriguing plot line and a jaw- dropping twist at the end. It also features some of the most memorable lines of the 1990s: ""How do you shoot the devil in the back--what if you miss?"" The characters, Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) have real character details and cues.<br/><br/>The film is set in the aftermath of a ship fire that totally burns the cargo and crew. Though meek and disabled, Verbal is the only survivor to walk away from the incident unscathed. He is taken into custody and grilled by the police. Brilliantly played in a characteristic, understated style that earned Spacey an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Verbal is cleared and allowed to leave. But before he can go, agent Kujan from US Customs shows up to interrogate him. Kujan is trying to build a case against Keaton and he wants Verbal to testify in exchange for immunity. Verbal refuses, but Kujan still bullies Verbal into recounting his story of Keaton, McManus, Fenster and Hockney, leading up to the explosion on the ship. <br/><br/>What follows is a fantastic yarn of lies and half-truths sprinkled within the facts of the case. It is all masterfully portrayed as a series of flashbacks while Verbal and Kujan sip coffee and talk in the LA police station. The story begins six weeks earlier in New York City as Verbal and the other four criminals are brought in to stand side-by-side in a police lineup. None of them are formally charged with a crime, and there are indications Keaton has actually gone straight prior to the roundup. But before they are released, the five hatch a plan to get revenge on the corrupt NYPD and make a large sum of money in the process by robbing a police-protected jewel smuggler and leaking news of the police involvement to the press. Keaton is reluctant and must be coaxed into it with the promise that no one will be killed in the heist. He agrees and the quintet pulls off the robbery to perfection. The acting and writing take chances that pay off, with each actor fully immersing himself in his role. Del Toro creates a uniquely colorful persona in his portrayal of Fenster, Baldwin conveys a reckless abandon and lust for violence, Pollak shows steely courage and resolve, Byrne is a complex mesh of toughness with motives pulling him in all directions. Each actor is at the top of his game. <br/><br/>The five criminals go to Los Angeles to lay low in the aftermath of the New York heist. There, they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed to involve no killing. Unfortunately, this LA heist goes horribly wrong. As Verbal recounts this carnage, its aftermath and the growing problems and hostility in the crew, agent Kujan receives a tip from one of his colleagues who has a survivor pulled from the water near the charred wreckage of the ship. The witness is badly burned and cannot speak English, but insists that the man responsible for the destruction of life and property on the ship is named Kaiser Soze. <br/><br/>Whether it is attributable to lies in Verbal's yarn or odd casting decisions, several characters in The Usual Suspects add to the film's mystique. Chief among these is the Irish Postlethwaite cast as the Japanese Kobayashi. There is a strong clue at the end that the name Kobayashi is used solely to mislead Kujan. But Kobayashi is not the only instance of a character's name failing to match his appearance. Another example is McManus' contact in LA, Redfoot, which one would expect to be the name of a Native American. But Redfoot appears to be caucasian. Again, at the end there is an indication that Verbal used Redfoot to avoid giving Kujan a real name. Strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly. Kaiser Soze is said to be Turkish, possibly with a German father. These mixed-up character portraits add a layer of complexity to the plot, but one must always consider the source, Verbal Kint, and his motives. <br/><br/>The dynamic between Kujan and Verbal itself is pure entertainment. A kind of cat-and-mouse game, nuances are thrown into the proceedings that make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. Even the way the interrogation is filmed is unique. Verbal didn't achieve his nickname for no reason. He knows how to run his mouth and Kujan has a difficult challenge in corralling him. Underlying the interrogation is Kujan's suspicion of Keaton and his belief that Keaton manipulated Verbal. But Verbal is hard to pin down and Kujan occasionally resorts to bully tactics. But who is Kaiser Soze? Did he orchestrate the police lineup in New York, and pull all the strings ever since? Is the cargo of the ship drugs or only human cargo? Why did Verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not? Did Keaton really die, as Verbal insists, or did he slip away, as Kujan believes? Is Verbal telling the truth? Much is revealed in the final moments of the film, which wash over the viewer like an enormous wave of recognition. Snippets of dialogue from earlier in the film are montaged over the complex score, providing spine-tingling clues about exactly what part of Verbal's yarn was fact and what was fiction. The final snippet of dialogue, followed by a fortissimo string finale is especially powerful: ""and like that...he was gone."""
"mstomaso","10","64","88","4 February 2005"," A Perfectly Crafted Mystery - (very ambiguous spoiler)
","Kaiser Soze is a super-criminal of almost comic-book stature. Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotine-driven low-life 'usual suspects' of this film - Soze - remains unseen, fantastic, just outside of the camera's view, and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless, he is the central character in the film, and the single force of will driving the entire film. The viewer, like the characters portrayed, must constantly ask 'Who is Kaiser Soze, does he even exist?"", and - as silly as it might seem - ""is he the devil himself?"". <br/><br/>Soze's irresistible will is represented and enforced by an emissary (the stone-faced Pete Postlethwaite) who is just as cold-hearted as any of the hardened criminals who comprise 'The Usual Suspects'.<br/><br/>The narrative begins and almost ends as a retrospective with just a bit of very necessary voice-over narrative by Spacey. His character - Verbal Kint - is interrogated by Palmintieri concerning the murder of several hardened criminals in a single night aboard Russian ship. Most of the major plot points are highlighted wonderfully by the changes of pace and camera work afforded by the shift between one plot - the events leading to Kint's interrogation - and another - the interrogation itself.<br/><br/>Kint, physically disabled and emotionally disturbed, is himself a desperate, down-on-his luck, petty criminal whose chief talent seems to be getting mixed up with and attaching himself to more talented criminals. His latest 'friend' - Keating (Byrne) is a brilliant but depressive thief who is trying to straighten his life out for a woman lawyer he has fallen for. But along with the other 'usual suspects' - expert safe crackers, con men and sociopaths (possibly the best performance of Stephen Baldwin's career thus far) all - Keating is swept up into agreeing to do 'one final job'. In a fine piece of character interpetation, Byrne plays denial to the hilt telling himself that this job, if successful, could end his life in crime permanently. <br/><br/>These expert thieves, con men and killers meet in a bogus police line-up one night and from that point on, they are bound together under the control of Soze until they either succeed or fail in the crime he has laid before them.<br/><br/>Soze has been betrayed, whether directly or indirectly, by each of these men, and he leaves them all no choice. Accept the crime plan or die. They accept, knowing that their odds of success are, to say the least, very limited.<br/><br/>The entire feeling of this film shifts radically from the action of the main plot (described in Kint's narrative) and the narrative itself (Kint's interrogation). While this may look simply like a clever piece of film work, it is actually a very brilliant plot device, as both story lines are finally united in the stunning and brilliant finish.<br/><br/>While I am not usually a ready fan of mysteries, and even less interested in thrillers, this film was pure entertainment from start to finish.<br/><br/>Director Singer has established himself as a pioneer in ensemble cast direction, and this film alone (his third) should have awarded him that title.<br/><br/>The performances are, without exception, flawless. While flawlessness or some approximation of it is something I generally expect from people like Spacey, Byrne, and Del Toro, many of the folks in this film very much surprised me. I now watch out for folks like Kevin Pollak, for example. Without detracting from the performers whatsoever, some credit for the stunning quality of the performances must go to the director, editor, script and cinematography team. This film makes them all look positively great.<br/><br/>I was bitterly disappointed by the fact that this film did not take many Academy Awards in its release year. While I realize that the academy's choices do not always reflect quality or achievement, I prefer to maintain at least a superficial guise of hopefulness. The fact that Usual Suspects did not win for editing was the biggest shock. I can not think of a better piece of editing."

I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.<br/><br/>Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.<br/><br/>Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A-"
"scaevola","6","69","101","2 January 2001"," Excellent production, but relies WAY too much on the surprise ending--which may not even be a surprise.
","This film is basically a dark, sophisticated 'caper' thriller with the added twist that the main characters are rapidly awakened to the fact that they are being ruthlessly manipulated behind the scenes.  The deeper they go, the more intense the experience.  While none of these guys are admirable (in fact they are all clearly trash), you can't help but feel for them.  They are just so in over their heads.  And the puppeteer bad guy is a nightmare.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I guessed its 'big secret' almost as soon as I knew there was one, and am justly disappointed.  It was nice to keep getting confirmation as it went along, but I would like to have experienced the final surprise. (And I am *sure* I'm not singular in guessing the ending.)<br/><br/>This film really relies too much on the 'wow effect' to make its major impression (read other comments for confirmation)--always a clue that a work of art is leaning *hard* on a crutch. Take away the surprise ending, and what do you have?  In this case a stylish and well-produced film with a gaping hole. For example, compare it to LA Confidential. Even if you had guessed LAs secret before they let it out, it wouldn't spoil a thing--because that film didn't rely on a plot twist for its primary punch. It had a whole basket full of assets.<br/><br/>I'd give this movie a 7 if its secret had been better (and more creatively) guarded.  As it stands, I give it a 6 for the excellence of the entire production and that fact that I was fairly well entertained.  But I won't be watching it again, whereas LA Confidential will always be on my list.<br/><br/>********ABSOLUTE SPOILER *************** Agatha Christie first introduced this gimmick in 1926 with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.   Beyond that, the whole gig follows the classic mystery formula right down the line:  Once we realize it's a whodunit (its clearly gotta be somebody we met, otherwise no punch), the obvious choice is the 'least likely one.'  And there he is, perfectly disguised to fool you into not even looking his way--a good indication you should look his way. Another giveaway is that we have one guy telling the story and everything we see is from his eyes.  Makes you wonder:  1) Why did only this guy survive? 2) Who says we are seeing the truth, except him? And the big one:  3) I'm supposed to believe a *con* artist?  Not."

","After a gun fight on the docks leaves only one survivor with the majority dead, NYC agent Dave Kujan flies in to ensure that ex-cop Dean Keaton is really dead.  During the questioning the survivor, Verbal Kint, tells of how events came to happen.  Five criminals are brought together in a line up and decide to use the events to plan a job.  However another survivor tells an extra story  one involving master criminal Kyser Soze.  Kint reveals how the gang were forced into the fateful job by Soze  however who is Soze and why did the men try to steal what appears to be a ship load of drugs that didn't exist?<br/><br/>When I first saw this I saw it in the cinema  the very next day I went back and watched it again.  The plot starts with a cliff hanger and appears to gradually answer the mystery  - however what it actually does is create more questions for every answer it appears to give.  It does this without frustrating you or without confusing the issue  in fact you don't know right till the end that you've been caught in a story teller's web.  The plot unfolds like a normal thriller but it is anything but.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is in the writing but it is the direction that also manages to create a great mood.  Singer uses clever shots weaving the story into a believable web of deceit.  The cast add quality to every single line, every single scene.  It's hard to imagine that the film could be the same with any one person changed.<br/><br/>Bryne is great as Keaton, his world weary cop drawn into a plan he can't control  or is he the master behind it all.  Spacey gives a great performance as our eyes and ears as he retells the events, he deservedly won an Oscar for this role  before he got all soft and started becoming a starring man.  Baldwin has the film of his life (albeit not hard!), he's really good and should be lucky to get another good role.  Even the minor roles in the gang are great  Del Toro's performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way.  Likewise Pollack will never have a better role  he has genuine tension between him and Baldwin (even in later interviews the dislike still seems real  with things like Pollack telling Baldwin he's sorry that his brothers stole all the food from his table).  Palminteri does a great performance and is totally convincing.  Postlethwaite is good despite playing an Asian (?) lawyer.  Suzi Amis is good in her brief role and Esposito is as good as he always is.<br/><br/>Overall I could talk for hours about this film.  It's rare for films now to have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it  it's still twisty and impressive no matter how many times you watch it."

","[**Major spoilers**] This movie began on a sour note in the opening scene with a man on an upper floor pissing down onto a ribbon of flaming gasoline on a lower floor to put it out. Right off we know that there is going to have to be some major suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>The story line is not nearly as complicated as it is made out to be. Within the context of this movie, maybe that was a goal. I never did figure out what the deal was with the image of the rope heading into a rat's nest of junk that was shown several times.<br/><br/>A real problem for me was that the two main thugs in this were not at all threatening. The final plot twist only furthered this dissonance - it was kind of like finding out that behind the mask of Darth Vader we find Pee-wee Herman. And I felt manipulated by the final twist (that was in fact somewhat anticipated, after all Verbal was smoking his cigarette in the Turkish style). Are we to believe that Verbal boarded the boat and changed into a fedora and black overcoat to perform the crucial murder? What was the point of that besides trying to fool the audience? <br/><br/>And so many times in the exchanges between Verbal and Kujan, I felt I was watching actors rather than characters.<br/><br/>The bottom line on this movie is that it is no more than a tricked out episode of ""Law and Order"" without offering anything substantial to think about after it's over."

","I love movies with big twist ending. I love movies that play with your mind and leave you completely confused until the very end where everything finally makes sense.<br/><br/>So I should like 'The Usual Suspects', right? Let's see: Confusing plot? Check. Big twist? Check. Point of the whole movie? NONE.<br/><br/>This movie attempts to be clever by blatantly treating you, the audience, as an idiot. I pushed through this boring, big mess of a movie expecting a huge final revelation that would put all the puzzles pieces together. In the end, the movie throws all the puzzle pieces into the fire and laughs at you.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS***** (but really, don't bother watching, just read)<br/><br/>What makes a good mystery thriller movie? CLUES! You are supposed to leave clues for the audiences to pick up so that when they watch the movie for a second time, they can bang their heads and say ""Why didn't I notice that the first time?"" In this movie, there is NO CLUE at all. Keyser Soze could have been ANYONE of the characters. The audience could never really know who is Keyser because the whole time we are forced to watch the movie from Verbal's own flawed and purposely misguided perspective! <br/><br/>The 'twist' is one big joke. So Verbal is lying all the time? That's a twist? You dare to call that a twist? How brilliant! I could have never see that coming!! No, really. You could have never see it coming because there is literally NO WAY for you to see it coming; nothing is revealed until the movie almost ended. The only way you could have guessed is because, you know, ""the weakest, least suspicious man is probably the killer!"" What a cliché. The ending basically makes the rest of the movie completely pointless, and gives no reason for me to re-watch the movie again, because it would be like listening to a liar tell a story all over again.<br/><br/>The plot is another one big problem. The entire first hour of the movie could have been scrapped off and still makes the movie a coherent story. All the useless, boring dialogues, all the random robberies and gun shooting, did absolutely NOTHING to advance the main story or develop any of the character. Nothing relevant actually happens until the part where Kobayashi popped up and revealed the main plot about Keyser Soze and the boat hijacking. So, bad twist ending aside, the plot doesn't do the movie any justice either.<br/><br/>The acting? Nothing amazing. What Verbal does in nearly the whole movie is limp and talk, talk, talk while giving a straight and near- emotionless face. Casting any middle-aged balding actor as Verbal would have achieved the same effect. I can't say Spacey is a bad actor because I don't think he is, but his performance as Verbal is certainly not Oscar-worthy. <br/><br/>*****END SPOILER*****<br/><br/>I understand that movie ratings are subjected to personal tastes and perceptions. I can understand why so many people like movies such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Reservoir Dogs' even though I find them highly overrated. But I simply cannot accept that a movie like 'The Usual Suspects' is hailed as ""the greatest twist movie ever"" even after 20 years, when there are so many better ones like 'The Sixth Sense', 'Memento', 'Fight Club', or the highly underrated 'Identity'.<br/><br/>Spend your two hours wisely. On anything. Just not on this movie."

","(major spoilers - plus, if you're a fan of the film, you won't like my review)<br/><br/>I've never understood the fuss made over this movie - every time its been on TV i've watched the first five minutes, and rolled my eyes for various reasons (the first time it was Gabriel Byrne's accent, the other times it was how over-wrought everything was) and put something good on instead.<br/><br/>I've finally given it the light of day tonight, to the end, and my feeling is this: one minute of cleverness at the end does not justify putting us through two hours of over-wrought actors playing at cops and robbers.<br/><br/>The general situation is so very familiar - the crims who get together for one last job that goes wrong, and the way its told is not fresh either: the structure of the framing narrative in the present day and the flashbacks which take us back to a past event we want to learn the truth about, comes from Citizen Kane and Rashomon (ie, on its own does not make this movie original). The constant promise of a final mystery, which is intended to propel us to the end was invented by Orson Welles, and is a device used quite frequently (Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Go, Memento, The Exterminating Angel, and most movies, in fact).<br/><br/>For two hours this is a lot of posing, actors dressed in ""slumming-it"" costumes straight from the costume designer's wardrobe, cliche dialogue, unbelievable situations, one unsustainable haircut, stubble and a lot of brooding ""i'm a criminal"" close-ups.<br/><br/>There is a justified reason for all this falseness (aka pretentiousness), given in the final two minutes, which i can't even bring myself to say in case you haven't seen it and are still reading - i've had too many movies ruined for me. Save to say, like The Sixth Sense, this movie is a one-gimmick movie, and it takes watching it for two hours to find out that gimmick (which is the only possible explanation for characters having what i like to call Stephen King names, by which i mean they sound like someone has sat down and thought ""What's a really cool name i can make up?"" instead of names real people would have. Or possibly ""what's the wackiest name i can give a person and have the audience not laugh"" - if this was the case, they failed with me. Every time someone said ""Verbal Kint,"" ""Kobayashi,"" or ""Kaiser Sosay"" i couldn't help giggling) - i spent two hours rolling my eyes and two minutes saying ""yes, that's clever, but if people didn't equate twists with quality then i could have enjoyed the entire two hours - but it would not have been this movie, which is nothing without its gimmick. I had the same problem with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - i need more than one gimmick to keep me interested."
"greggman","1","115","213","17 March 2002"," The movie lies
","I wanted to like this movie but...<br/><br/>**SPOILER**<br/><br/>The movie lies to you.  In %99.99 percent of all movies, what you see on the screen is supposed to be what happened to the characters.  The only difference are things like point of view or missing details, for example you might know what happened from 3:00 to 4:00 and from 5:00 to 6:00 but not from 4:00 to 5:00.  Or you might know that Mr. A was there killing Mr.B but it's not until later you find that Mr.C was also there.<br/><br/>In this movie though, several of the scenes are deliberate lies.  That breaks one of the cardinal rules of movie making.  Not that there are any rules but if the camera lies then there's basically no point in watching.<br/><br/>It would have been a good movie for me, even with the twist, if all the scenes had been about reality and the twist brought all your missing knowledge together.  Instead, the twist just invalidated everything before it.  You end up not knowing if any scene in the entire movie has anything to do with reality whatsoever.<br/><br/>Given that I honestly don't understand why people like this movie.  Try Memento, it doesn't lie.  Try Fight Club,  Try 6th Sense.  All much better movies because they are not full of camera lies.<br/><br/>**END SPOILER**"

It's stuff like Urban Legends and Scream where the killer is the last person you'd suspect because the reason behind it is retarded and mostly based on information that you don't have.  Worse than that is stuff like Clue where there are a bunch of possible different endings to the movie that all work so that there's really no way to predict the ending.<br/><br/>This movie was even more idiotic than those because not only is there no certain way to come to the logical conclusion given the clues but the whole story we're presented with is a string of lies.  Oh wow shocker!  Well of course it's a shocker!  It's like you hear the story of little red riding hood and then at the end your grandmother who's telling it to you says ""You know what?  I was that little girl and there was no wolf after all.  I drugged my granny and stole all her cash then blamed it on the wolf."" Holy crap!  I could never have predicted that!<br/><br/>So this movie is worse than the farces that are Urban Legends, Scream, Clue and a majority of all the other movies that have ever been made.<br/><br/>How this guy also did the brilliant movie that is X-Men is a mystery to me.<br/><br/>1/10 and that's only because the scale doesn't have a zero"

","I gave this movie a 1. Ignore the plot, there is none. The only spoiler is: The whole move is the invention of Verbal/Keyser who is trying to confuse the cop he is telling the story to...and us the audience. It appears that the movie was intended to have a twist ending, but at about 1/3rd of the way through the movie the director gave up trying to be coherent and just went with confusing. The ending that 'ties it all together' is that...well, none of it was true.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you think that finding out at the end of the movie that pretty much everything you were shown was a lie makes for a good twist, you may like this movie. You will not understand it, because there is nothing to understand. At the end, all of the plot points were a made-up story, so what was the point? It is like watching 90 minutes of one movie and then watching the last 10 minutes of another movie. <br/><br/>In short, this is really a waste of time."

","I'd heard people say what a great movie ""The Usual Suspects"" was for a long time, but never got around to watching it...until tonight. I discovered it was available to watch instant stream on Netflix and decided to go ahead and give it a go. I've got to say, I'm pretty disappointed in it.<br/><br/>Once again, I feel I fell victim to hype. People hyped this movie up to be awesome, and I just don't think it was. In my opinion, the movie was OK at best.<br/><br/>The performances were all good. It's just that the movie was so slow...I couldn't believe that it's running time was a slim one hour and forty-five minutes. It felt like it was about two hours and twenty minutes to me.<br/><br/>Then, I just felt the ""big reveal"" at the end was a little hokey. I mean, if you're that great of a criminal mastermind you would've had your BS story made up long before you ever entered an interrogation room -- for Kevin Spacey's character to have supposedly come up with the details for his story based off what he'd seen on a bulletin board...I'm sorry, but I've got to cry foul! If you've already got the story made up, you're not going to need to find inspiration for names of characters off a bulletin board, but I realize if he hadn't have gotten the names off the bulletin board, the audience wouldn't have really known he was lying the whole time. I get that, but I think the ending requires too much suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>I'm sure most people who like this movie like it because of its ending. Maybe if you take it for what it is, at a surface level, it might work...but once you start digging a little deeper and actually think about what you've just watched...it's not that great of an ending.<br/><br/>I'll give it some credit for trying to go a different way than most movies of its type do, but that's about all I can really give it credit for. The movie itself was just really slow and didn't really pay off in the end, in my opinion, anyway.<br/><br/>I'd give it maybe a five out of ten. That's about all the more I think it deserves. It wasn't GREAT, it wasn't HORRIBLE...it was just OK.<br/><br/>You can check it out if you want to, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'd recommend it.

"perew","1","56","101","27 October 2007"," Ending Not a Surprise
","I was deeply disappointed by this movie. The alleged and hyped twist ending could not have been more predictable. As soon as the mystery character was introduced, I suspected who it would be. As the story unfolded, it was clearer and clearer that it could be only one person. In a bit of Sherlock Holmes logic, all the other options were eliminated and the final remaining choice had to be the correct choice.<br/><br/>We know from early on that the narrating character survives the opening sequence unscathed. That alone was a huge signal which spoils any chance of a surprise. The narrating character is revealed to be an excellent story teller, to be manipulative, cunning, and incapable of being truly frightened. Those are exactly the characteristics of the mystery character. Again, this made the ending obvious.<br/><br/>That the story is filled with 90% false information is disappointing. It's a fundamental violation of the compact between the storyteller and the audience. Perhaps if the twist were not so clearly communicated from the beginning, perhaps if there really was some thought required in getting to the ending, then perhaps it might have some shred of justification. Only perhaps, though -- In the end, almost certainly not."

He can't be killed (like we haven't seen this before). His imagination and creativity are so bad he can't even come up with names or stories, but has to take them off of coffee cups and posters. Add to this, the entire story. He orders a police line up, but the police don't know who ordered the line up. Now, we all know most police departments are incompetent, but this belongs on the NAKED GUN series. Then there are the characters. According to the narrator, they can't be broken, because they are hoodlums. Talk about your street myth that people in power would love to have you believe! But it doesn't wash. It isn't even remotely credible. And no one cares. I happen to be watching it while working on something else, and was in a public place where they showed it twice. I naturally assumed it was some sort of ""Worst films"" festival, which it might have been. I was stunned to see it ranked so high on any critic's list. <br/><br/>Now, for the reality. That was the surface appearance on first viewing. The writers claim it's just fluff, but it doesn't make a bit of sense as noir.<br/><br/>It makes complete sense as a supernatural thriller, though. It will take a few viewings to realize that the original line up of suspects had a replacement, just as Wargrave replaced one of his victims in Ten Little Indians. <br/><br/>The fifth ""suspect"" is actually Keaton's girl friend, and we get clues from the clandestine meetings they have. The ending tells us that they actually played with the devil, and tried to make a contract to outwit him. The ""five suspects"" are the five who dared to challenge the devil's turf, and the clues are there, but so subtle that the entire team of writers, director, everyone, failed to see them."

Some of these movies leave you bewildered, the others just leave a bitter taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>80% of this movie is based on Kint's narrative, and because of that, the narrative BECOMES the whole movie experience. I do not think it is clever or fair to end the movie by saying, ""haha, just kidding. the whole movie is just a lie.""<br/><br/>Some people think that Kint's narrative was true, he just obfuscated the names. IMHO, I don't think that would redeem the movie. If it's a good mind-twister, which it's supposed to be, the audience would say, ""so he is Kaiser Soze, yes, thinking back, it was obvious."" But no, any of those five suspects could have been Kaiser Soze, the hints were not obvious nor subtle. I felt that the screen wright randomly chose one of the suspects to be Kaiser Soze at the end.<br/><br/>Don't take me wrong, I think both the direction and acting are decent in this movie, but I cannot agree that the plot is anything special. In fact, except the big twist in the end, there is nothing exciting about it. To exaggerate it a little, the plot can be described as a glorified version of ""Scream."""

","After the fairly unknown ""Public Access"", this film was the second project by director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie. And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup.<br/><br/>As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator/kidnapping scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser Söze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known to stand for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement.<br/><br/>I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime stories are among your genre preferences."

A good enough crime saga with some great one- liners and several sharp twists and turns, it's not something I'd revere alongside the all-timers. I felt like there was too much reliance on name dropping and intentional complications, which I guess fits in with the big twist at the very end, but that doesn't suddenly make it excusable. Tough to follow at many times, with some interesting storytelling experiments along the way; it's a good-to-very good story that often gets too caught up in itself."

","The Usual Suspects is one of those films that like The 6th Sense, tries to get the viewer to think one thing and then suddenly POW!, they hit you with that big comic book like surprise twist at the ending. In the light of todays average fair full of pounding soundtracks, pyrotechnics, and product placements, it almost seems like a thinking mans film, however, this type of story telling has an inherent birth defect due to the very nature of its design, and that is that once you've seen it, the films one true claim of quality is forever lost, the carpet can not be pulled out from under your feet a second time. In essence, it becomes as pointless as trying to dazzle yourself at a magic show when you already know all the secrets behind every trick. Outside of this built in defect there is also the problem that the trick itself is actually very badly designed in the first place, this is in reality a very poorly constructed, and badly written script. This film has been embraced and awarded the highest honors, and yet there is not a single moment in it that isn't bogged down and convoluted, or even one bit plausible.<br/><br/>At the end of the film the other cop who works in the office where Verbal Kent is interrogated tells Inspector Kujan ( Chazz Palminteri )that to basically understand his messy office, you just have to stand back and look at it to see it, the same exact thing can be said about this equally unorganized film. To truly understand this lets stand back and actually take a look at the character of Keaton, played very dully by the very dull Gabriel Byrne. He was a NYPD officer for 4 years even though he is a Brit. In that short time he spent on the force he committed seven felonies, three of which were murders. Not a single one of these crimes could be pinned on him because the witnesses either died or changed their stories entirely, yet as an obvious embarrassment to the department, he was kicked off the force. When he is off the Force he gets indited on a fraud charge and does five years in prison. While in prison he kills three fellow inmates, but just like his other crimes, none of these atrocities could be pinned on him, so he simply gets out when his time is up. Once on the streets he kills yet again, but before he could be prosecuted for it, he dies in a warehouse fire when he goes in to check a leaking gas main. Once dead, the two witnesses that could of railroaded him back to Sing Sing die in single mysterious deaths, and even though there are no longer any witnesses left breathing, an innocent man takes his place behind bars. So now he surfaces as a business man who dates a high priced criminal lawyer. Thats his story folks, told to you specifically to get you to buy that he is this arch super-villain with the ridiculously bad name. Meanwhile this film does all it can to paint Verbal Kent as a bumbling idiotic club footed buffoon con man. The problem with all this blatant manipulation is that Kevin Spacey might as well have the name Keser Soze stenciled across forehead in bright neon letters.<br/><br/>Another place this film falls short is in its attempt to be a two fisted tough guy movie, lets face it, the only female character that even has a name, is simply in the movie as a reason to move the protagonist like pawns on a chest board at convenient times in this contorted plot, so what we are left with is the five criminals, who like small grade school children, spend half the movie puffing their chests out at one another. One scene that never fails to get a good laugh out of me is when Kevin Pollack and Stephen Baldwin almost get into a fight with one another. Possibly for reasons of keeping both men in the frame, director Bryan Singer has these two guys standing toe to toe facing one another with their mouths only a few inches apart, instead of looking like a fisticuff might take place, it looks far more likely that they might engage in a lusty soul kiss. This nice moment is capped of by brilliantly by a disembodied macho voice calling them ladies, and Kevin Pollack asking the Baldwin brother if he wants to dance. The fun continues in a later scene in which the Baldwin character comes up behind Pete Postlethwaite as if he might mount him any second, and whispers in his ear ""I'm the guy thats gonna get you."" Yes, due to inept story tellers and bad dialogue, what might of been Clint Eastwoon like one liners, is reduced in the hands of these hacks, into homoeroticism running wild.<br/><br/>I know that audiences continue to be impressed by this film, and that this thing won an Oscar for its script, but this story is nothing but a clunky ludicrous mess wrapped up in a bow of paper thin phony freshness, it simply does not deserve all of the love it is getting. The Usual Suspects is a film that makes me want to quit my day job and move to Hollywood, since tripe is so often confused with genius."

","This film has got to be one of the greatest in recent history. The ending superb, the acting of the highest caliber, this film shines as the most memorable, clever, and re-watchable of this decade. I personally have seen The Usual Suspects over fifty times, and each time I learn something new. Last year I watched the movie every day for a month, twice a day on weekends. It doesn't matter that I know what happens to each character, it doesn't matter that the end is already placed in the back of my mind, just waiting to explode onto the screen before my eyes in a visual and psychological masterpiece.<br/><br/>When I call the film memorable, I would cite the acting of Kevin Spacey as a prime example. His performance almost makes the end forgetable (even after I've spent so long spouting how memorable the film is. Bare with me, it all makes sense when you take a step back). As I watch from start to finish, I get so wrapped up in the story, and in searching for minor details that I definitely missed the first fifty times (the first six or seven times you are too busy grinning at the obvious facial gestures and body language that you missed the first time around that almost guide you to the logical, yet completely loopey climax), that it never gets boring to me. I will probably continue to watch this incredible movie for the rest of my life.<br/><br/>The supporting cast each lends a little to the overall high quality of this film, in their own way. Postlethwaite is a tall, dark, mysterious enigma; Baldwin is a loud, comedic psychopath; Del Toro adds a quirky accent and sex appeal; Pollack comes through with spunk and charm; Palminteri shines as the arm of the law with pizazz; Byrne is the wistful dreamer, searching for the straight life, caught in a snare between the law that holds him down and the unrelenting crime world that calls him deeper into the criminal fold; and Spacey, well my dear Kevin Spacey is the highlight of the film, innocent and true to his feelings, observant, worthy of sympathy, and admiration towards the end, and the Oscar is well deserved for this stellar performance.<br/><br/>The movie is action packed and well rounded, leaving the viewing audience stunned, baffled, bewildered, and ready to watch again. After the last line is uttered I feel like I did the first time I watched the film, completely in awe for the master deception. I recommend this movie to everyone I know (and don't know for that matter), for it is truly what a movie should be: entertaining and thought provoking. It is my favorite movie of all time (slyly beating out Gone with the Wind)."

","A crime thriller that isn't about redemption or revenge or much anything at all, ""Suspects"" isn't a movie as much as a display of a director's obsessive lust for the criminal underworld. Director Bryan Singer likes rain soaked gutters, burning cigarettes, crooked cops, clever retorts, smoky pool halls and menacing tough guys. Characters don't populate this movie. Attitude does. The movie isn't interested in where these guys came from, what motivates them, what their struggles are. Without struggle, there's no tension; without tension, there's no suspense; and a crime thriller without suspense exists only to covet the unpleasant, the nasty.<br/><br/>With a quick pace, flamboyant cinematography, and lines like, ""brought in on trumped up charges to be leaned on by half-wits"", the movie insists that it's crafty and clever, but fails with characters who can't come alive beyond brief sketches. Hockney is a surly slob; Fenster dresses in sharp suits and mumbles; McManus is wild and temperamental; Keaton is grumpy; Kint is soft-spoken and club-footed. As dialogue exists here only to move characters from one place to the next, it could really be assigned to anyone. Similar lines like ""I'll f--k your father in the shower"", ""I did it to your mother's a-s"", and ""At least I don't have a captain with his d--k in my a-s all day long"", uttered by three separate characters, generate the impression that a single trash talking lowlife is inhabiting five people.<br/><br/>The events of the plot have no significance either. The team robs a group of crooked cops in New York, then travels to Los Angeles to pull off another job for a guy called Redfoot, and are finally enlisted by Soze's assistant Kobayashi to steal cocaine. Kint's account of the first two jobs takes about an hour of film time. It'd be of no consequence if it were left out. The heists are redundant and advance the characters in no way at all: Keaton is still grumpy, Hockney is still surly, they all still call each other ""cocksucker."" The first hour exists only for the stimulation of watching thugs wave guns and beat people up. The film's sense of aprogress, of stalled, redundant cycles, inhabits the interrogation between Kujan and Kint. The characters never progress beyond a pattern of friendliness, petulance, aggression, a big blow-up, threats, ceasefire and then all over again.<br/><br/>Verbal's account is presented as objective. He has no reason to lie, so we wouldn't expect him to. However, the film lets us know a minute before it's over that everything we have seen is made up. Apparently, Verbal, using things in the interrogation room for material, mostly the bulletin board behind Kujan, tricked the cop and the film's audience. A post-it note about a guy named Redfoot becomes the character Redfoot, a mug by ""Kobayashi"" becomes Soze's assistant Kobayashi, and so on. Realizing that a supposedly objective narrator has misled us, we re-evaluate everything that has come before. What really happened? How does the lie illuminate the rest of the story? Singer supplies no answers. Kint walks out of Kujan's office, ending the film.<br/><br/>One could say that the filmmakers have done this deliberately, that the absence of character, distinct truth, and connection between events is deliberate. That Singer is a nihilist and this is his view of the world. A viable worldview, fine, but his film can't escape being an antagonistic prank on its audience. Singer uses familiar storytelling tools and setups to snare us and as the story develops, he entices our imaginations with more and more clues to figure out the puzzle. We're intrigued because he's telling us there's an answer, that all this is going somewhere, that every scene and every line is a piece to the puzzle. He dares us to pay attention so maybe we can figure it out before the film does. Riddles do the same thing. For instance, the answer to the riddle, ""I'm trying to go home but I can't because the man in the mask; who is the man in the mask?,"" is ""the Catcher."" When we find that out, we take pleasure in knowing that the answer was there, all we had to do was think and see the obvious from a different perspective.<br/><br/>""Suspects"" disappoints because the answer was never there for us to see. Customs agent Kujan only notices the material on the bulletin board when he leans up close to it. Whenever the camera lingers with Kint, nothing on the board can be seen distinctly. More important, the film never cues us that Kint might be making it all up. His total immunity from prosecution gives him no reason to waste Kujan's and our time for the entire length of a movie. What Singer ends up doing is cannibalizing the very genre of storytelling he admires. He mocks the thrill of expectation used to tantalize us, only to say that there is no puzzle. Singer's answer to the riddle about the Catcher is the illogic of ""there is no man."" Much like Verbal Kint's lies, Singer's charade can only be taken as the snub that it is."

","I almost feel sorry for anybody who likes this pretentious crap.<br/><br/>Mostly everyone who does like it only likes it for one reason...the big twist at the end. But anybody with half a brain that is at least partially functioning can see through the transparent and poorly-written script and predict the ending by the half-hour mark.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead. Do yourself a favor and read them rather than wasting your time watching this mess of a film.<br/><br/>OK, the basic plot...cripple is being questioned by a police officer at the police station. The cripple tells the cop about past events that supposedly happened. The stories the cripple tells all seem to contradict one another, and the cop is getting very annoyed since he can't seem to find out the real identity of the man behind the previous events...a man named Keyser Sose.<br/><br/>But who is Keyser Sose? I'll tell you who just by explaining what any intelligent movie viewer would have been thinking the entire time, and that is this. Keyser Sose can only be one person, and that person is Verbal Kint. And the reason why he has to be Keyser Sose is because he is the only person that is involved in the story from start to finish. Nobody else is in the office but Verbal and the cop, and we know the cop didn't do it (although that would have been an actual good twist), so it must be Verbal. Can't be any of the other ""suspects"" because, what if it was? Then the story would move somewhere else and Verbal would no longer be involved.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another major flaw...why the hell is Verbal even there in the first place? Him going to the police station serves no purpose at all.<br/><br/>And as I patiently waited for the extremely transparent conclusion to be revealed as exactly what I predicted the whole time, I thought of one thing...Verbal is a cripple, so he can't possibly be Keyser Sose. But that was nothing more than a cheap red-herring used only to intentionally throw the viewer off in a different direction. Didn't work very well at all.<br/><br/>Why else is this movie total crap? The directing is cheap and thoughtless, acting is decent at best but even that's stretching it, cinematography looks ugly as hell, and I didn't care about any character in the whole movie at all. Didn't give a hell if anybody lived or died. All that paired with the fact that the entire movie was built around the idea of a surprise ending with no substance of itself makes this a piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Wait, I'm sorry. Comparing this movie to garbage would be insulting to things I throw away."

And how completely cynical of the moviemakers. It's their prerogative to take their script in any direction it suits them to, but I couldn't help but feel cheated -- I had actually wanted to know what the outcome of the plot (or what I thought was the plot) would be, not be fobbed off with some kind of superior ""you were actually going along with this guy's cornball story?

","I really cannot believe that this movie has its fair share of bad reviews and people who do not know what actually happened and what parts were true and what parts were lies.<br/><br/>The truth, Verbal did recruit the others for the hit on the boat, he did manipulate, trap, and deceive them into thinking they were going to hit a big drug deal. What he lied about was the names of people and motives. During his interrogation he tried to tell as little as possible and make himself out to be just a pawn in the game. But Dave Kuyan was figuring things out, and as such Verbal would have to reveal more or feign ignorance. Eg, Verbal said it was about drugs, Kuyan figured out it was to hit an informant. So all the actions from the lineup to the boat were real, and the fact that the lawyer picks Verbal/Souze up at the end shows this.<br/><br/>As for the twist, its a good twist, and not one that just comes out of the Blue. There are many hints throughout the movie that Verbal is more than he seems, but these are only apparent second time round. Hints include, The way Verbal shot the guy in the car despite supposedly being disabled and not being able to flick a lighter properly. The absolute first scene that shows Keaton about to die, that shows that Keaton knew who was about to kill him, the sigh and the way he says Kaizer implies he realised he got played, should of know better, and now he knows who that person really is. Other hints, Verbal emotion when he told the story he believed about Kaizer. and also when they were watching the boat he knew specifically that they were speaking Hungarian.<br/><br/>So all in all this is a good film, the genius being that everything makes sense and there are hints throughout about Verbal."

The aforementioned are all bolstered by credible in-depth character development, brought to life by an outstanding cast, who flesh out each role to chilling near perfection. (Kevin Spacey, seen here before most people would have recognized his name, received an Oscar for his ""supporting"" role!) <br/><br/>But let's not get sidetracked. More than anything else,""SUSPECTS"" is about the unparalleled unsettling reaction you get from viewing it! From the first scene to the end credits, it gets a headlock on your psyche, while sending the pit of your stomach into endless free fall! The only way to illustrate this, without giving away any key elements of the film, is a detailed look at the opening scene....a peerless example of instant timeless classic film noir.<br/><br/>On a boat, docked in San Pedro Harbor, the dying sole-survivor of an apparently devastating bloodbath shootout painfully ignites a thin trail of gasoline. His obvious intention: Destroy EVERYTHING...himself included! From a deck higher up, an unseen someone pisses out the trail of flames. The shadowy figure walks down the stairs with an unhurried deliberation and saunters over to the agonizing man he has just saved. They exchange somewhat forced greetings and a few disjointed words of banter.<br/><br/>Without warning, the intruder firmly raises a pistol, his unblinking gaze reflected in eyes locked in contact with his own. Unhesitatingly, he fires two consecutive shots. A brief pause of contemplation ends when he casually lights a cigarette, strategically dropping his lighter to rekindle the liquid fuse, and then beats a hasty off-board retreat. What better way to introduce a character whose twisted iron resolve is so perverse, so deranged, that he saves a doomed man seconds before certain death, solely for the unmitigated pleasure derived from looking him squarely in the eye, his victim looking right back, while pulling the trigger himself.<br/><br/>Without uttering a syllable, his actions shout out, ""I p**s on you and your puny existence!"" His victim's final moments are thusly converted into a living/dying testimony, clearly demonstrating who it is that decides the particulars of when and how he will die! ""SUSPECTS"" has been severely critiqued by a vocal minority (to paraphrase another reviewer) for not knowing the difference between a plot twist and a non sequitur. With all due respect to the reviewer, who painstakingly highlighted the difference for us, perhaps a careful second viewing would shed some light on the source of this common confusion. After watching ""SUSPECTS"" four times making every effort to employ my most discerning eye, I am convinced the true genius of the movie hinges on this particular point! <br/><br/>Let me underscore my unequivocal recommendation of this film with a special note to those of you who avoid the Action or Suspense genre because of your distaste of the excessive violence that generally characterizes them. Well, THIS IS NO Robert Rodriguez FILM! A lot of the scenes are done in the ""Old School"" style, where the violence is kept off-screen. Although there is considerable TALK in ""SUSPECTS"" about some of the most dastardly deeds imaginable, virtually none of this is graphically portrayed. So, PLEASE, if you have not seen it yet, because of this reason, I urge you to make an exception in this case...<br/><br/>10* STARS*!

Verbal recalls the last few weeks to Dave, who listens intently.<br/><br/>We start when five criminals are brought in for a line-up. There's McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Verbal Kint. While they are being held in prison, the five men all agree that the police just need someone to pin the crime they are suspected of on someone. They all agree to plan revenge by forming a league of crime...<br/><br/>Lotta stuff happens, next we know a legendary criminal named Keizer Soze (whose name reminds me of a type of food) has the five men under his control.

Oops, wrong tagline.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is a very good film, but not one of my favorites. It's extremely catchy, brutal, etc., but comes across slightly shallow.

Or is Soze just a legend? It's open to debate. But what makes it a bit more shallow from other films is that Verbal Kint is the one who tells this long story to Dave Kujan, and assumably he made most of it up because he was the criminal all along and had to cover himself up...so there's no real ""wow!"" element. If Verbal made up the story and turns out to be the man behind the killings, well, it's just a bit shallow as compared to some other films. We are expected to be amazed that he is Soze, but if the tale he told Kujan and us was for the most part a lie, then the fact that he was Soze all along isn't quite as amazing...umm...do you understand what I'm saying?<br/><br/>But I'm not saying I dislike this movie. In fact, that's far from it. I really enjoyed this flick. It's terrific. Great performances by the entire cast, especially Spacey, who won an Oscar for his role. Even Stephen Baldwin was good in this movie!<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is a lot like ""Basic,"" a film starring John Travolta. There are a lot of plot twists, but the duration of the film is a bunch of lies, and many of the ""twists"" don't make sense, and are there simply to confuse the audience into thinking something else. Behind all the gloss there isn't a whole lot there. But ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film, and though the end is slightly shallow, and the duration of the film is an excuse for the ending, it's still surprising and effective. And unlike ""Basic"" which dragged on for over two hours, ""The Usual Suspects"" knows when to stop its banter and get to the point.<br/><br/>Effective film-making, but slightly overrated and shallow.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"
"gatbontonarthur","5","8","13","17 March 2015"," Movie relies too much on the Twist
","Going in to this movie, I knew what the twist ending was. A friend of mine told me about it a while back, but I didn't really care because I didn't plan on seeing the movie. Well recently I saw that it was on Netflix and decided to see if it was as great as everyone had said it was. After watching I can't really understand why people are raving over this movie. The movie was boring for most of its running time and didn't feel any better than a mediocre crime film. Even though Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for his performance, I thought his acting in this movie didn't even compare to his role in American Beauty or even Seven (where he didn't win the Oscar).<br/><br/>I know some people might say that I might have enjoyed the movie better if I didn't know the true identity of Kevin Spacey's character before I watched that movie. That may be true in a little sense, but that shouldn't be the whole reason why I didn't care at all for this movie. A WHOLE MOVIE CANNOT BE ENTIRELY RELIANT ON A TWIST. If a movie was so great, it should have other elements that make it great. Not just the twist at the end! For instance, I recently watched the movie Gone Girl and I knew the twist of that movie because I had read the book beforehand. Just because I knew what was going to happen in that movie that didn't stop me having a great time watching the film. <br/><br/>Another thing about the twist is that while watching the movie there were no clues given to the audience (clipboard or anything else was not seen). The movie makers never gave us an opportunity to second guess the true identity of Kevin Spacey's character. Therefore watching the movie a second time doesn't feel any different because you wouldn't be able see any clues about the ending. A twist is supposed to enhance the viewing experience (something the twist of The Usual Suspects doesn't do at all). <br/><br/>All in all this movie is vastly overrated. I believe some people get so caught up in the twist of this film that they were blindsided to how boring the film was for most of it's running time."

","After a bloodbath and fire on a moored ship only the badly burned Hngarian mobster Arkosh Kovash (Morgan Hunter) and the crippled small- time crook Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) survive. Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser Söze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser Söze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser Söze?<br/><br/>Twenty-two years after the releasing date, ""The Usual Suspects"" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser Söze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Os Suspeitos"""

Yet, why isn't someone who could admit that it is quite quite easy to identify Keyser Soze was Kevin Spacey? The role he played was so outstanding, so different from the rest, so weak and so humble.

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","10","6","9","17 April 2008"," Composition
","Subtlety is a very important thing in any good thriller. Not only does subtlety reduce the ridiculous amount of ""in-your-face-quality"" that today's thrillers seem to love, which effectively makes then just plain old action movies, subtlety shows that a film has respect for its audience. It doesn't feel like it has to explain everything at every step of the way since it knows that an interested audience will be on the lookout for hints as to what is going on. That's what makes films like this enjoyable. In fact, that what makes any film enjoyable. It isn't just a barrage of images, but rather an engaging sequence of them. This sequence can be unchronologically organized or in any number of ways obscured to create suspense, but as long as it is engaging, the audience will be happy.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is such a thriller. It can be enjoyed with the eyes as much as the brain. There are numerous hints as to what is really going on and the final climatic twist is really a great one. Even then, upon seeing the whole film, the second viewing only gets better as that is when a keen viewer will pick up on all those subtleties that hint at the result which they are now familiar with. These subtleties are not just obscurely placed props but are woven into the film's montage with clever camera angles along with certain key objects seen on screen. It is a thriller worthy of Hitchcock or the best of DePalma. Nothing is in needless excess and even the profanity is well written and there are no pointless macho wisecracks. Simply put, everything works in this movie. And it works very well. Even upon multiple viewings the film captivates with its clever composition and that can only be a good sign. --- 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+"
"MartinHafer","8","7","11","21 February 2013"," Well made...it just isn't the sort of film I particularly enjoy.
","language a bit confusing during boat attack, where were cops? hard to like anyone in film<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is a well-made film from start to finish and I do recommend you see it...maybe. Let me explain. While the film is excellent it also is unpleasant, violent, filled with expletives (particularly the old f-bomb) and has nothing but unlikable characters. For me, films like this, ""Good Fellas"" and ""The Fight Club"" are just pretty nasty films--but still, they are quality films--unpleasant quality films. <br/><br/>The film is a very confusing story about a gang of five guys who meet in the oddest way--at a police lineup! The five decide to get together for an illegal job and soon end up being extorted to do a job for 'Keyser Soze'-- man who no one seems to know but who inspires fear in those who hear his name (sort of like Valdemort). I'd say more, but frankly I don't want to ruin the film. Suffice to say, it's a film with a BIG twist--like ""The Fight Club"" or ""The Crying Game"" and so I'll stop with that.<br/><br/>The bottom line is if you like violent films with very graphic violence and language, then ""The Usual Suspects"" is for you. The acting, writing and directing are great. If you would rather see films a bit more uplifting or family-friendly, do NOT see this film! Seriously."
"subgold","1","24","50","5 November 2005"," Don't take two hours out of your life and waste on this total screw-up
","Before I watched the movie, I've read many comments comparing ""The Usual Suspects"" with ""L.A. Confidential"", which concluded that this one is even better. So I held an eminent anticipation on it. But two hours later, I just could not understand why this nonsense got so much higher votes and evaluation than ""L.A. Confidential"".<br/><br/>I'm saying this, not because of the labels people usually will put on this movie: confusing, twisted and so on. Actually, I don't think the plot is hard to comprehend. To be honest, I figured out who Kaiser is just at the very beginning. It was so obvious.<br/><br/>The reason is, many fabulous elements in ""L.A. Confidential"", or should I say, a successful movie, are missing. First of all, the most important thing: the vivid sculpture of the characters. From ""L.A. Confidential"", we remember the three young cops, the evil captain, the gorgeous hooker, the sly and sneaky little old news reporter So many impressive roles there. But what is in ""The Usual Suspects""? I feel sorry to say, nothing. Maybe Kevin Spacey's performance can be a little compensation, but not enough at all.<br/><br/>Second of all, the conflict. In ""L.A. Confidential"", conflicts are everywhere, between justice and crime, between righteousness and personal career, between love and cheat, between different parts or even in the deep soul of one part. While in ""The Usual Suspects"", without these conflicts, the movie is not dramatic and attractive but cadaverous and boring.<br/><br/>The third one, ambiance. In ""L.A. Confidential"", I can sense the emotion the director planed to deliver to us. Sometimes intensive, sometimes thrilling, sometimes dangerous, sometimes love-filling, sometimes nervous, sometimes horrifying.Well, when I watched this one, I almost fell asleep in the middle.<br/><br/>I don't think we need a fourth reason to prove this crap. I hate these plays which consider themselves intelligent and tricky enough to make up some mendacious tales to bluff the audience, and turn out to be so stupid and fake. There is always a wire-puller in such movies, who seems to be omnipotent and can do whatever he wants, conniving some brilliant schemes. But finally these schemes are always deliberately mystifying and illogical. I prefer real and organized films like ""L.A. Confidential"". You know, we audience are also smart."

","The Usual Suspects is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie. It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.<br/><br/>Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor - leaving few survivors.<br/><br/>It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.<br/><br/>The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him.<br/><br/>We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.<br/><br/>It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.<br/><br/>The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10"

"zkonedog","9","2","2","11 March 2017"," Looking For Something Different? Check This Film Out!
","Before I offer any analysis of ""The Usual Suspects"", I would first like to say that (as is well know by now) the film has perhaps the most mind-blowing ending in the history of American Cinema. I have long been a fan of movies with endings that are shockers (The Sixth Sense and The Others stand out as favorites), but this movie took it to an entirely new level.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending here, but I will say that this film follows a narrative pattern such that guessing the ""big reveal"" is difficult, as information is revealed in flashbacks, thus getting more complex as the story continues. However, many other Amazon reviewers have said that, after repeated viewings (I have only seen the film once), it IS possible to somewhat predict what is going to happen.<br/><br/>I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but I knew I was not a fan of gangster/crime films, so I was a bit leery. However, the story is so expertly crafted that one (myself included!) completely forgets that the main characters are criminals and instead focuses on the plot twists and turns.<br/><br/>So, I would highly recommend this film to two categories of viewers: First, those of you like me who have never seen this classic film until ""now"" and are wondering what all the buzz is about, you won't be disappointed. Second, those of you who love surprise endings (even if you aren't too keep on cop/police dramas) will obsess over this film for weeks or months after viewing!"

","No matter how many times I watch The Usual Suspects, and believe me it's been many, I still get the same diabolical thrill, the same rapturous excitement and the same rush of storytelling and dramatic payoff as I did the very first time I saw it. Every performance from the vast and diverse cast is a devilish creation packed with red herrings, juicy dialogue and bushels of menace, every scene piles on the mysticism of the criminal underworld beat by beat, until the characters begin to pick it apart and the whole thing unravels like a great serpent coiling forth bit by bit, scale by scale, swerving toward the shocking, disarming third act that has since become as legendary as it's elusive and terrifying antagonist. In the crime/mystery corner of cinema, there's no arguing that this delicious piece of hard boiled intrigue reigns supreme, and it's easy to see why. In a seemingly random police lineup, five career criminals are harassed by an unseen hand, pushed into carrying out dangerous heists and violent manoeuvres by a shadowy campfire tale among the world of organized crime, a Boogeyman called Keyser Soze, if he even exists at all. Slick and sleazy ex cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) heads up this dysfunctional crew of vagabonds which includes hothead McManus (Stephen Baldwin in a role originally intended for Michael Biehn, which kills me to this day), weirdo Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, using an indecipherable mishmash of an accent that would be the first of many), spitfire Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) the runt of the litter. The lot of them are intimidated into performing risky enterprises by lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) until the climate of their actions reaches a boiling point and answers emerge from the darkness. This is all told in retrospect by Spacey, to a rabid customs agent (Chazz Palminteri) who has designs on ensnaring Soze. Spacey scored Oscar gold for his heavy work here, spinning a tale whose layers interweave and pull the wool over our eyes time and time again before offering any glimpses of truth. Byrne is a fiercely guarded storm as Keaton, a man with secrets so deep even he doesn't know who he is anymore, letting the anger set and smoulder in those glacial eyes of his. The supporting cast adds to the class and confusion terrifically, with fine work pouring in from Dan Hedeya, Suzy Amis, Giancarlo Esposito and a wicked cameo from Peter Greene, who provides a moment of inspired improv. The score of the film rarely relies on dips and swells until all is said and done, keeping a tight lid on the orchestra and feeding us nervous little riffs of anxious portent that keeps tension on a tightrope and anticipation on call. A mystery this tantalizing is irresistible the first time around, but the trick is to make your story re-watchable, and I've seen this thing over a dozen times. Every viewing provides some new angle to the story I didn't see before, or I notice a subtle interaction in the very naturalistic and funny dialogue which escaped me in the past. My favourite thing to do is watch films with someone who hasn't seen them before, observe their reactions and opinions on every little story beat and cinematic flourish, it's almost more fun for me than the actual film itself. The Usual Suspects is a showcase piece for that activity, because you get to see this very complex revelation unfold through new eyes as you watch them experience the revelations. Whether your first viewing or your fiftieth, it never loses its power, and the spell it casts just doesn't dim. Masterpiece"

","I don't see the killer joys of this mystery and genre destroying film masterpiece, to quote a few rave reviews here. Verbal was obviously lying and he was obviously the killer early on. I have no problem with camera lies, as one person put it. Because something is filmed is no guarantee that it is the truth. This is fiction, anyway. I love David Lynch and he certainly likes to lie with his camera. No, I don't mind that Verbal was lying. It was obvious that he was the main mover, but there was no motive for his killing of the other 4 and the crew. I suppose they must have done him wrong somehow. But since Verbal is telling his tale to someone obsessed with another character, we couldn't know his reasons without breaking the narrative. The acting was obvious, too. I mean, it seemed acted, not natural, esp Spacey. I saw him in one good TV movie, but since I have been amazed at his Streep-like obvious acting. All the ticks and verbal hiccups learned in conservatory, kinda reminds me of Day Lewis, another actor whose charms elude me. Put that Method away, boys! The others are passable, but just. I can see why this film is popular, why some people love it; what I can't see is why this film is considered the 23rd best film made. I think some people need to see some more films. Well, Inception is fairly high up there too, so the only twisted conclusion I can make it that lots of people need to see lots more films before they start giving out 10 stars here.

I knew most of the movies, at least I've watched the plot, nevertheless this didn't happen with Usual Suspects, I have never watched a trailer or read some synopsisNothing. Therefore I rented the movie which from my point of view started kind of slowly. Afterwards, I honestly felt confused about the combination of scenes in different timeline; you need to pay close attention to the unexpected and subtle movements on the storyline. Suspense, tension and psychological terror might be the exact words to describe this masterpiece, tangled story with several important characters whom cannot be ignored, with the masterly performance of Kevin Spacey who totally deserved the Oscar for best actor.

","The Usual Suspects follows the interrogation of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint. Verbal is one of two survivors of a drug deal gone wrong at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells the interrogator, Kujan, a drawn-out story about events that led him and the four other ""usual suspects"" to the port the night the drug deal went wrong, leading to a fire and several casualties. At the beginning the five suspects are brought into questioning over a truck hijacking. The suspects are Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin, Dean Keaton played by Gabriel Byrne, Fred Fenster played by Benicio Del Toro, Todd Hockney played by Kevin Pollak, and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint played by Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>The theme of The Usual Suspects is that pride and arrogance lead to manipulation and betrayal. At the beginning of the film, none of the suspects will admit to anything that happened with the hijacking. We immediately see that these five men are arrogant but at the same time loyal, not throwing any of the other men under the bus so to speak. During the movie Kint manipulates the other ""usual suspects"" by playing puppet master without them even knowing it.<br/><br/>This theme keeps true throughout the film as Verbal is being interrogated by Kujan. As the story becomes more complex we see Verbal becoming more arrogant and manipulative of Kujan. The character of Verbal becomes more and more interesting as the movie goes on. Kevin Spacey was the perfect actor to play the role of Verbal as Spacey does well in providing mystery.<br/><br/>In respect to theme, this movie is similar to The Interview. The 1998 movie The Interview is also revolved around a man's drawn-out interrogation for crimes he may or may not have committed.<br/><br/>One technique used in The Usual Suspects is the motif of an unreliable narrator. Verbal often skirts around the questions being asked during his interrogation. Another technique used is flashbacks. As Verbal is being interrogated throughout this film Verbal narrates through the flashbacks exactly what happened the night of the boat explosion. The fact that Verbal was an unreliable narrator, thus the flashback scenes being unreliable as well, ties back to the theme of pride and arrogance leading to betrayal and manipulation.<br/><br/>The pride and arrogance all of the ""usual suspects"" portrayed throughout this film shows how easy it is to manipulate and betray people. This film was one a lot of people can relate to in general because we have all been manipulated/ have manipulated others at some point in our lives."

Except riddles are solvable. Trying to solve The Usual Suspects is like trying to solve a jigsaw with lego pieces.<br/><br/>Not counting final few moments, the film is actually good. It takes you into the final scenes with great anticipation. 'Finally', you say, 'the twist will be revealed, which will put everything into perspective.' The film doesn't do that. Instead, the twist leaves you with endless questions. It leaves you thinking, 'Why did any of that just happen?' Why does Verbal design an intricate plan to recruit four nobodies when he could just pay people? Why does he tell Kujan his story using phrases from the bulletin board, when he can easily be discovered?<br/><br/>And to top it off, the final scene is almost as bad as the twist itself. Verbal gets away, but all too late. He's been found out. Two hours of lies for nothing.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects tries combine mystery and a clever twist and fails. Fails hard.

","When you watch ""The Sixth Sense"" for the second or third time, its clues and secrets are in plain sight and you feel at once foolish and delighted at the movie's ingenuity. When you watch ""The Usual Suspects"" again, the clues are not laid out before your eyes; they are withheld until the very end. The final twist is not a re-evaluation of everything that has gone before, even though it may feel like it; it's the revelation that most of what came before was made-up. ""The Usual Suspects"" cheats.<br/><br/>Convinced I was mistaken about this most popular of modern-noir detective thrillers, I revisited it and concentrated on the character I knew bore the most watching. What I found was unabashed narrative manipulation. This is a slick, involving movie that sucks the viewer in with menace and intrigue, but in the end we find that most of its content has been totally made up. Instead of going back over things to track down the clues to what we know at the end, we have to throw up our hands and admire Keyser Soze's ingenuity while accepting that we will never know the real story.<br/><br/>I was on board for most of my second viewing because it seemed at first like the only things that Verbal Kint was truly making up were his little asidesthe barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois; picking beans in Guatemala, etc.but no, it turns out the pivotal characters Redfoot and Kobayashi were also, apparently, invented. Or maybe he just made up false names for them, since we do see the Kobayashi character at the movie's end. The point is that we don't know. We can't tell who's real and who's not, and since everyone plays a pivotal role in the alleged plot, we can't tell what actually happened and what didn't. This is not exciting storytelling; this is trickery, and a waste of two hours. If I'm going to rack my brain trying to figure out a movie while it's unfolding, I at least want to be able to kick myself that I didn't figure it out earlier, since the clues were all there.<br/><br/>Gabriel Byrne (who plays Dean Keaton, the guy who detective Kujan thinks is Keyser Soze) was convinced while shooting the movie that he was Keyser Soze. Why? Because the movie we see is a story invented by the real Keyser Soze precisely to make detective Kujan think Keaton is Soze. This is the penultimate conclusion that we are given just before the real revelation, and, according to everything we have seen, it makes perfect sense. Based on the story we have been shown, Byrne's is the only logical conclusion. To find out that we were all duped by Keyser Sozedetective Kujan and Gabriel Byrne and all of us in the audience too opens up a small meta-cinematic can of worms, but mostly it's just frustrating. The filmmakers have tricked us into emotionally committing to a story that wasn't there in the first place.<br/><br/>This is of course what we do in every movie we've ever been to, but rarely does a film itself expose us for the dupes we are when we go to see it. Maybe as far as the real world is concerned, the real menace of Keyser Soze is that he won't even let us enjoy a movie on its own terms. He pulls the rug out from under us for his own benefit, and somehow we are all beguiled into thinking that's a cool feat, when really it just means we've all been suckered."

The ship don't have any drugs and four out of the five-some are killed by the Don himself, just to know in the end that the fifth survivor himself was Keyser Soze who plans the whole thing by conning his short-time partners. The Con was made up actually to kill a person who was about to disclose the identity of Keyser Soze to his rivals.<br/><br/>Again, the fifth survivor (Verbal Kint played by Kevin Spacey) when gets caught after the Ship is destructed, is offered immunity and when interrogated bluffs the whole story as he being insane and part of the con.<br/><br/>So the first question arises is IF AT ALL ""KEYSER SOZE"" WAS THAT Powerful, why he needed some filthy criminals to get the work done for him ? IF he was that intelligent, didn't he knew the possibilities ? Keyser Soze imitating as Verbal kint is projected as a much clever approach but still at the end he is recognized by the Customs & Police.<br/><br/>This film is overrated and at the end it does not become a lavish outcome, primarily because, it projected the whole plot very simple-to-happen. The script is shabby and was kept concentrating more on flash backs & uniqueness in story-telling editing patterns. The direction never planted intensity & realistic approach. The dialogs are over spoken to relate the cleverness of the plot which was not necessary. The Custom officers are shown dull and organizations effort for detailed investigation was too loose to believe.<br/><br/>Secondly, this is not an ad wherein if you cant convince then better confuse. Even the confusion given to the audience is not worth thinking on it.

","The Usual Suspects is a movie regarded by many as one of the best crime dramas of all time. As any crime drama it opens with a puzzle: a scene unfolds and the viewer watches tentatively, every detail potentially being the one that blows the mystery wide open. Soon we find ourselves a fly on the wall, watching an interrogation between a slimy character named ""Verbal"" and a rather generic law enforcer. The conversation twists and turns from hostility, to bargaining, to mutuality as angles are played on both sides to try and outsmart the other.<br/><br/>Verbal begins to replay his story, and we immediately mistake a point of view for objectivity. Before long a daring plan for a heist arises, as does the name ""Keyser Soze"", a legendary villain unphased even by murdering his own family to proclaim to the world just how much of a big bad wolf he really is. The story itself becomes harder and harder to follow, as motivations and means twist more and more. The mind strains trying to follow it all, blissfully unaware of whats to come. The film presents itself as something to be solved, and we all race to try and beat the movie at its own game. <br/><br/>The conclusion, argued by many as brilliant, is nothing more than a Deus Ex Machina. Its the film equivalent of ""and it was all a dream"", with just a little more window dressing. We discover Verbal has used his surroundings to manufacture the entire story, and even more importantly, is in fact Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>A stunning realization, no doubt. The more I thought about the shocking final minutes, the more I came to reason that I hadn't been fooled, I had been cheated. A plot twist makes new sense of something you've seen before, but in The Usual Suspects there's nothing to indicate we are seeing Verbals description, and not simply the past.<br/><br/>Think of all the movies where a person begins describing a scene, and it cuts back to that scene happening. Are we looking at what actually happened, or what the character is describing? Its difficult to say for certain, but it is hardly unreasonable to expect the former. Playing on such a fickle element of cinematography is risky business, and I was hardly sold.<br/><br/>So much rides on the final minutes, and many are impressed because it dares to do what few other movies consider: to make an hour long turn of events completely irrelevant. We don't see it coming, but whilst the writers were wondering if they could, they never stopped to wonder if they should."

Characters don't have any depth, since everything is sacrificed on the attempt to conceal the ending (consider for instance the scene in which Kobayashy gives the 5 men their personal files: we are shown everyone's reaction, except Kint's). <br/><br/>Unlike many great thrillers, a second view of The Usual Suspects is pointless, unless you want to speculate endlessly on trifles, as if they really matter. Because there is no way a verbal (or Verbal) reconstruction of the events can contain as many details as we see on the movie, details which are told us by Bryan Singer, and not by 'Verbal' Kint.

","For some reason, I didn't get round to seeing this film until quite recently (just one of those weird things). I was excited to finally see it since I'd heard so many people rave about it, but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. Without question it is an entertaining, surprising, and well-acted film, but I can't see why it gets quite such high ratings on here.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey does a fine job of playing the part of Verbal, and Gabriel Byrne is okay too, but otherwise there were no outstanding performances. Similarly, while the plot was clever, it was nothing that amazing, and I saw the twists coming a mile off. Unlike something like Reservoir Dogs, which gave the gangster film a much-needed injection of not taking itself seriously, the crims in The Usual Suspects are just the typical bad-boys-who-fancy-themselves. Also, maybe Americans can accept Pete Postlethwaite's bizarre accent and make-up, but for me it really detracted from the film - what WAS he supposed to be? Indian??? If so, why on earth didn't they get an Asian actor? Sorry, I don't mean to slag off a film that I know a lot of people really like, I'm just giving my honest opinions. I suspect if I'd seen it when it came out, I too would have found it an amazing groundbreaking piece of cinema, but IMHO it hasn't really stood the test of time.<br/><br/>Still, it was a decent way to pass a couple of hours, so I've given it 7/10."

"Jacques98","1","8","15","30 November 2008"," I'm sure this title has been used before, but: The Usual Movie.
","Calling The Usual Suspects one of the top one hundred movies of all time, much less at number 20, is absolutely hilarious. I'm not one of those pretentious losers who think everything with even a pinprick of influence on cinema is gold, and I don't base my scores as such. Put simply, The Usual Suspects is nothing but usual. Typical. Average. Run-of-the-mill. There are a lot of insanely overrated movies, and this has to be in the top 10. Was the plot twist pretty clever? Sure. But, dear God, folks, I've seen a least fifty better, bigger plot twists before in (far superior) movies that the fine-cinema-whores (meaning, people who gorge on ""fine"" movies and consider nothing else of value) wouldn't even consider because they aren't filled with average plots and two hours of pointless conversation scenes.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects, on a very grounded level, is nothing more than this. A movie made for kids who grew up watching Clue, then turned 12 and decided they needed something more ""mature"". The Usual Suspects is perfect for that situation. It really shouldn't be taken any more seriously than that. It's not a hard-hitting, mature thriller as some claim it is. And it certainly isn't the timeless, untouchable classic some claim it is, either. Most of the people making those claims likely haven't even seen a true thrillermeaning one that is actually fast paced and thrillingin their lives.<br/><br/>Everything I just said above is why this is so average. It isn't a thriller at all, unless your definition of thriller is countless close-ups of men's faces and less action than an average soap opera. It's a drama. As a drama, the plot is your standard crime plot. Drugs, murder. How much more average can it get than that? Last I checked, drugs and murder were plots for average movies since the creation of the movie camera. You've seen it all before. The plot twist just twists and average story that I could care less about. Not to mention that if I were paying closer attention, and I wasn't, that I would have figured out the twist in the first half hour as a lot of people did. Even it is generic, even for its time.<br/><br/>The directing and acting both add a layer of cheese to the movie. It reminds me of a kid's movie in a lot of places. Sure, the actors all played their parts well enough, but the cripple was a little over-the-top and the directing was just childish. The only thing I can compare the directing to is to how 80s cheesy slasher movies were directed. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. Close-ups galore and cheesy filter shots around every corner. That's another big problem I had.<br/><br/>For those who insist this is a thriller, I read thriller writers. Dean Koontz and Ted Dekker write plots with just as big of plot twists as this movie, but their plots are not just the generic: drugs, murder. To me, who's seen infinity better plotting, this is nothing. It's a bowl of cereal. It's fun, it's slightly better than staring at the wall, but it's cereal; you know there is so much better out there to eat. Giving this a perfect score, or a near perfect score, just shows you have never experienced a true, original thriller with a true, original plot twist. And that most likely means you'll have to look somewhere other than the generic, critically-acclaimed top 250.<br/><br/>2/10"
"spazmodeus","4","8","15","19 February 2003"," Oh, if only I could care!
","Here's what I saw: Actors reading terribly forced lines is a lifeless way (even Kevin Spacey! For shame!). Then there was a whole bunch of smoking, and some shooting, and a bunch of guys (obviously) pretending they're Godfather. I sat there for an hour waiting for the movie to get better, and it just didn't. Then I stopped caring.<br/><br/>Sure, there were a few plot twists, but if you don't care about the movie, they just seem like sillyness. In fact, the whole thing comes off amateurish, which is weird given who's involved. In the end, there is probably more excitement in watching a grandmother knit socks than this failed movie."

","Should be on the 100 WORST list.  The only thing good in this movie is Kevin Spacey, but even he cannot make this movie worth watching.  As far as the other actors, acting like this reminds me of Coyote Ugly (2000).  This movie is so dry it is hard to sit through more than 30 minutes of it.  There is nothing in this movie that makes me want to finish watching it.  The part of Kobayashi could be bettered by one of ""Saturday Night Live's""  worst performers.  This accent sounds so stupid and painfully fake it makes me wish I wasn't watching this garbage (again, like Coyote Ugly (2000)). This film is a waste.  I don't know how so many people can think differently. Watch it for yourself, but be forewarned, it stinks."

"schuhhorn","6","3","4","4 February 2012"," Well acted but the script is manipulative and implausible
","Why many people think so highly of The Usual Suspetcs is a mystery. I'll give it 6 out of 10 because of some fine performances, most notably Kevin Spacey's, but as a whole the thing is a violence-filled mess. The ending simply does not follow from the film and seems to have been dragged in to resolve a problem that is not all that interesting to begin with. The editing is also confusing; without seeing it at least a second time it is hard to make sense of what has happened when. Throughout the film we are led to believe that the character played by Gabriel Byrne is central to the plot, only to discover at the end that he is not. To put it succinctly: this film cheats the viewer. Don't trust the judgment of anybody who tells you that this is a great or even a good film."
"bholly72","6","3","4","24 July 2008"," Great until the surprise ending
","This movie is a very, very stylish crime drama, with great acting and wonderful dialogue. Dialogue in the David Mamet class, really. And the acting, wow, just look at this great cast, and everyone is at the top of his game. <br/><br/>But the weakness is that all this great stuff is subordinated to a very tricky surprise ending. The first time you see this movie, the ending seems wonderful and delightful, if a bit jarring and confusing. But when you watch the second time, trying to put all the pieces together in the light of the ending, well, it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I just wonder why, among all the critics and lovers of this movie, no one ever points out that the revelation at the end makes no sense. Are we supposed to believe that Verbal Kint made up that long, complex story on the spot, incorporating words visible in the agent's office? That he looked at the bottom of the coffee cup and just chose the name Kobayashi on the spot? That the whole, elaborate story was an extended ad lib?<br/><br/>Absurd. And who killed Edie, and why? The ending is less satisfying every time I see it, but the dialogue, acting, and bravura filming are all still terrific. But they are diminished by diminished by the ending's gross illogic."
"Ismaninb","7","3","4","25 December 2006"," Don't read Agatha Christie
","I have read many, many enthusiastic reviews. The movie is so complex. To understand the plot you have to see it at least three times. Etcetera, etcetera. Alas, already after 45 minutes I exactly knew how the movie would end and who Kayser Soze was. Probably I have read too many mystery crimes. You see, the very first one to use this idea was Agatha Christie back in 1926. Her novel ""Who killed Roger Ackroyd"" caused a scandal in England. Her readers felt betrayed. The second one was a crime novel (forgotten the title and author) woven around the characters of Punch and Judy. Well, I did not feel betrayed while watching The usual suspects. I only felt a deja vu. So the tension completely fell away. Not much was left: decent, but not extraordinary acting, flat characters and artificial twists and turns. As the script remains ingenious of course and the direction skillful, 7 out of 10."

I think it was worth watching, but I have no inclination to see it again. I guess if you were taken by surprise by the ending and you're a big fan of mobster or mobster like movies this would make this a great movie, but I don't fall into this category.

"Clive-Silas","Null","3","4","22 October 2001"," Flawed, but fascinating
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS****<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
First of all, I have to confess that I had inadvertently found out the answer to ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" scant days before seeing the movie for the first time.  Which makes it impossible to watch the film correctly, where you are made to believe that Gabriel Byrne is Keyser Soze.  We see Keaton being killed at the start, and I believed it because I knew he wasn't Soze.<br/><br/>However the montage by which the detective realises the truth was extremely well done, and it was still worth watching the movie for that.<br/><br/>The film has three flaws: Keyser Soze is built up throughout the film as being ""The Devil Himself"", but nothing he does is any worse than anything the other characters do: when they hit Kobayashi, Baldwin casually kills the two bodyguards; they all machine-gun a number of Hungarians (who could be simple sailors for all they know).  The Rat is cowering in his cabin, more frightened of Keyser Soze than anything else.  Well, if he's frightened to die, a huge gun-battle is in progress and its odds-on he's going to die anyway.  Then Soze actually turns up and, um, shoots him.  Big deal.  The story of Soze killing his own family is just that - a story (whatever the ending).<br/><br/>The second flaw is when they do things for filmic effect rather than good sense.  This is particularly notable in the scene where they hit Kobayashi. They are careful to take Kobayashi to an empty office so they can talk to him before killing him (a courtesy not extended to the two bodyguards).  He is thus given the opportunity to talk his way out of it.  Then the cons follow him up to the office on the top floor.  Then they presumably make their way home.  In all this time, there is a bloodstained lift with two dead bodies in it!<br/><br/>The final flaw is that the whole ""end sequence"" of attacking the boat is one of those long sequences of men running around in the dark and shooting people.  It's very common in action films (particularly of the heist type) and I think it should cease.  The audience don't know where they are, who's shooting at what, what the battle plan is.  When the whole point is who was where and when, I think the action needs to be made a lot clearer."

I cant even remember why all the 'usual suspects' were assembled and I don't care. Then there is the ""Finale"" when the detective ""works it out"". How does he do that?

"lagudafuad","8","4","6","20 December 2012"," one of my favorite interrogations
","A movie whose name is gotten from a line in the old classic, Casablanca ""The Usual Suspect"" is about an interrogation gone wrong. The movie is very hard to connect together, and the masterful twist ending for some did more harm than good, but for me it was the thriller of the whole movie. The fact that after the movie is over I still have to sit down and think about it, connecting the dots and wanting to have another re- run of the movie to be sure that I don't miss any dot, that is the reason why this movie is a master piece.<br/><br/>Written by Christopher McQuarrie, the Keyser Söze character is based on the accounts of John List, an accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost 20 years by assuming a new identity before he was eventually apprehended in 1989. McQuarrie got the name Keyser Söze from the name of his former supervisor Keyser Sume, and the last name Söze is Turkish which is translated as ""talk too much.""<br/><br/>The Interrogation scene was first shot and it ran for 6 days, and the rest of the movie was put together next and editing was the grand touch that made this mystery thriller that good a movie to see.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about the interrogation of a small time con man named Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is a one of the only two survivors of a heist gone wrong that resulted to a fire on a ship. He tells the interrogator the series of events that led him and four other criminals to the boat.<br/><br/>This series of events are shown to the viewer in the form of flashbacks as Kint narrates his story to the over confident interrogator. As the story goes on and gets complex the interrogator connects the dots and explains the story better to Kint, only to get the shocker of his life when he releases Kint believing he was used by the other four.<br/><br/>Done with a 6 million dollar production budget, the movie recouped its production cost and more; the well crafted screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie gained him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Kevin Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the criminal Keyser Söze.<br/><br/>The Usual suspect is a fine film, well developed to push the imaginations of the viewer, the unexpected ending is the cream on the top of this delicious masterpiece and one thing is sure, you will be asking for seconds after you are done seeing it the first time. <br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","The film ""the usual suspects"" is brilliant by means of many different facets of film making; and brought together perfectly to comprise one of the most historic and critically acclaimed films of all time. To start, the plot alone is intelligent and baffling, so much that the general public is challenged to piece together a seemingly surrealistic account of mystery and murder. However, there's more to this movie than just the mere genius behind the plot. For starters, the cinematography, editing, and acting are captured perfectly to not only portray a story, but involve the audience as though they were to experience the story themselves. Additionally, the actors are brilliant and capture each character as precise as necessary to accurately forshadow the climactic point of the movie that leaves audiences breathless.<br/><br/>However, behind the brilliance of the film, the editing, the acting, the storyline, the script, and the cinematography; are the ingenious facts hidden within the movie's composition. The antagonist himself was based off of a real-life serial murderer, whose actions are depicted in the film under alternative pretenses.<br/><br/>In all, this movie portrays the perfection of cinematography and should be the precedent that movie-makers strive to achieve."

The dialogue was solid, but the story was completely unbelievable and, upon reflection, the plot has more holes in it than Bonnie and Clyde's death car.

I have read over and over again that it's very good, but I saw nothing good about it. I was expecting an extraordinary psychological movie, but there was nothing of this.

I just thought that he could have been making up some of the story as it was all being told from his point of view.  I thought his acting seemed so obvious, and it seemed like he wasn't telling the truth, as he seemed to be purposely acting.  Then, we find out that nothing in the story could have necessarily been true, and that he was most likely making up every detail in the story.

Most of the people generally did not have any traits to distinguish themselves from each other.  I was rather bored. When I saw this movie I had already heard there was a big ""twist"". So when people were discussing the identity of this Keyser Soze, I couldn't help but think to myself ""hmm... wouldn't it be wild if the cop giving the interrogation was Keyser, or maybe Verbal Kint, or maybe...."".  You just find yourself going through the ropes imagining wild possibilities, and so when Verbal's leg straightens out and we see his sketched face coming out of the fax machine, it failed to have any impact with me. I'm sure that if I had been unaware that there was some kind of twist in the film, this ending would have hit me a little harder- but I'm skeptical that would have made me admire the preceding 100 minutes much more.    I'm sure if I saw this again, I might find other things to appreciate. No doubt, throughout the movie there must have been clever clues to Keyser's identity that I did not pick up on the first time around.

"dowland","3","6","11","13 June 2000"," Surprising ending with little behind it
","Just about everyone agrees that the surprise ending to ""The Usual Suspects"" is very satisfying, as is Kevin Spacey's performance as the pathetic yet strangely-likeable Verbal Kint. Unfortunately, I found that there is little else to be enjoyed.<br/><br/>All in all, the cast's performances were not all that superb. Spacey is an exception, but that's nothing new. The story itself is well written, but not very interesting. It's conceivable that the cast would be seen as fulfilling the characters well precisely because the characters themselves are so vague. The screenwriter makes sure to lay the idiosyncrasies on thick without allowing us to know the characters and better understand their quirks. Naturally, there's only a given amount of depth that can be accomplished in an hour and a half, but ""The Usual Suspects"" still barely reaches that.<br/><br/>So while I would recommend this film for Spacey and the ending, I don't think its worth waiting around for 80+ minutes of ho-hum ""gritty crime drama"" to get to all the scenes where he really shines and where the script isn't so dull."

","******SPOILERS****** Highly overdone movie about a mass killing in a shoot-out and explosion of a ship docked at San Pedro Harbor with connections to a notorious Hungarian drug gang. As well as a crew of hoods recruited out of NYC who tried to rip the gang off of the 91 million dollars of coke on the ship. Added to that a mysterious mob kingpin who set up the whole operation, for very personal reasons, to use as cover for him to knock off a witness on the ship that was to be turned over by the gang to the FBI as a witness against him that could land the mob kingpin behind bars for life. <br/><br/>All this is seen in flashback, at the San Pedro Police Station, with Special US Customs Agent Dave Kujan, Chazz Palmintri, interviewing Roger Verbal (Kevin Spacey),the only survivor of this holocaust, for what seems like the time you would have sat through an old movie triple-feature with cartoons newsreels and coming attractions added on. We're bombarded by Verbal's story that goes on endlessly about how he and his fellow hoods were recruited by Mr. Kobayashi, Pete Postiethwaite, back in New York City some six weeks earlier to do a job for the mysterious Kayser Soze (?) ,whom they are told by Kobayashi that they are in debt to. Verbal goes on endlessly talking about this very strange and confusing plan that the Kayser concocted which in the end turns out to be an elaborate hit, by himself, of a protected government witness. <br/><br/>You would think if this Kayser Soze was as smart as the movie makes him out to be why didn't he or his mouthpiece, Kabayashi, tell these hoods just to knock off the witness instead of having all this killing going on at the San Pedro Harbor as well as all over the country with all of them ending up dead except Verbal? And even more important why did he, The Kayser, have to kill the witness himself leaving himself open to being killed or captured by the Hungarian drug gang as well as the recruited hoods themselves if they ever found out who he was, and what he was planing for them, or the police? <br/><br/>Another thing that doesn't make sense about the movie ""The Usual Suspects"" is that this Kayser Soze who is so unknown and secretive even to his fellow mobsters, it seemed that only Mr. Kobayashi knew just who he was, would be that well known by the FBI or local police to be identified and arrested? And who would their protected witness know who to finger if this Kayser Soze was so unidentifiable? What was so important about this person that the Kayser was dealing with, and wanted to knock off, that he would reveal his real identity and place of residents to him where he would blow the cover that he so painstakingly built up over the years? Was this individual involved in preparing the Kysers Federal and State Income Tax returns? <br/><br/>Even at the end of the film when it was finally revealed just who the Kyser was you still didn't really know who he was since he was using an allies just like the name Kayser Soze itself obviously was. And even if the FBI and local police really knew who he was and where he was and went to arrest him would the murderous and cunning Kayser Soze just stay there and let himself be taken into custody? With all the avenues of escape and control with his mob's vast resources available to him? <br/><br/>The ending of the movie shocked you only because it seemed to make sense at the time that you were exposed to it but after getting over the shock and realizing just how irrational it was, as well as the whole film, you began to see that's all it really was: An end to the movie."

","Lemme start out with what I liked about this movie. Spacey deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and there were many other good performances as well. The movie also had a remarkable score. As for the plot, well, I enjoyed it at first, but as I thought more about it, I liked it less and less.<br/><br/>Having seen this movie, I am not surprised that it is #16 on the #250 list - not that I think it deserves this position, but I've begun to recognize the voters' trends. Call me a cynic, but I think that many people vote 10's for movies with plots like this, that are fairly hard to understand, because it makes them feel more intellectual. ""Other people can't follow this plot? Well, I can, and I'll give it a perfect 10!""<br/><br/>I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to say that this movie has a big surprise ending. But, without the ending, this movie is nothing. It'd have a 7.5 rating, tops. The movie is a decent crime / thriller without the ending, but there's no way it'd be #16 by votes.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: I guess we weren't really meant to understand the plot, since the ending negates it all. So the only part of this movie worth watching is the last five minutes? I didn't mind the negation ending, but I wish the movie could've taken some time to explain just what was true and what wasn't.

","The movie was simplistic and I'd already determined who I thought was the real bad guy. However the director and writers thought it would be okay to manipulate the story by basically lying to us. The fact is, without the theatric lies, the story is VERY predictable. And you will most likely have guessed the perpetrator the same as I did, but be left questioning your reasoning until the end when you realize that your reasoning was sound but that they showed us false scenes that weren't possibly real. <br/><br/>It's like a kids ploy. He shows you a picture of a tree and says, ""Look, it's a tree."" Then he comes back an hour later and shows you a picture of a truck and claims it was the same picture as the tree.<br/><br/>The plot holes in the movie stem from the ending itself. Without giving away the story line, we are told one thing and shown it as a flashback to be real. But then the rug is pulled out from under us only to discover that the flashbacks weren't real at all.<br/><br/>To me that sucks and ruins the movie. There's a trust that is established between an audience and the stage, and I feel this movie betrays that trust. How it got so high a rating while insulting the audience astounds and bewilders me.<br/><br/>I cry foul and refuse to give more than a 5 rating for it's overall movie appeal."

","Whether one is writing a book or a movie, one must play fair by the reader. A competent author or director creates suspense by cleverly emphasising some things and downplaying others. Not by witholding information.<br/><br/>
This is a bad film because the story is told backwards. Naturally, the viewer is mystified. There is no craftsmanship or artistry in telling a story backwards. <br/><br/>The supposedly Turkish home of `Keyser Soze' was hardly Turkish.  The movie being what it is, I suppose it is too much to expect attention to detail.<br/><br/>
This film is little more than a montage of violent scenes and the sort of orotund dialogue Hollywood's action movies specialise in.<br/><br/>
Pulp Fiction was a brilliant film because it tried a narrative style not used very much in films, but common in literature. However, no one would say that the story was told backwards. Singer should have studied Tarantino more carefully before trying this out."

It's a good thriller, a cut above average, but several major flaws prevent it from being a classic. Warning: minor spoilers<br/><br/>The trick ending, which has been widely praised, is in fact too much a gimmick for its own good.  I won't give it away, but I will say that the fun thing about twists is that, on repeat viewings, the trick seems obvious. How could you not have realized it?  (6th sense and Dead Again are perfect examples.)  In the case of Suspects, however, there is absolutely no way you could see it coming.  The script was so perfectly engineered to deceive you, it's no fun the second time around.<br/><br/>More problems: too many characters.  I'm not talking about the criminals--they're all great, but the cops.  There are three officers of the law in the movie--two of which do nothing.  Scenes with them are a waste of time.<br/><br/>I will give it this: Spacey is great, and certain scenes are very intruiging.

The classic scenario of, ""Oh....you didn't get it?"", ""Well you must not be on the same level as me then"" seems to apply here. There are a couple things in this movie that never really added up. Even Ebert mentioned how he couldn't follow the same missing links I was struggling with (not that we're on the same level, but just trying to make a point). I really liked Kevin Spacey, however. This just fell under the ""too cryptic of a plot"" category with maybe only two other movies I can think of. Maybe I'm just too much of a simpleton for this one."

","Featuring a convoluted plot that wanders all over the place, I have to admit that in spite of its high rating here, ""The Usual Suspects"" just didn't take hold of me. As a matter of fact, within about the first 10 minutes I was already finding my mind wandering. I don't mind complicated plot lines when they add to a coherent story, but this story simply wasn't that coherent. Five shady characters meet one night in a police lineup and concoct some sort of criminal scheme. There are then so many twists and turns and so many different angles introduced that I found I simply didn't have the energy to keep up with it all.<br/><br/>Now, most of the cast (most importantly Kevin Spacey as Kint and Gabriel Byrne as Keaton) did a decent enough job on this. They took it seriously; they were believable in their roles. I just honestly felt that those who came up with the story were trying too hard to keep the viewers off balance, with no idea what was coming next, and to do that they came up with a plot that really just didn't flow all that well.<br/><br/>As far as I could see, the greatest strength of the movie came in the last 10 minutes, when the ongoing mystery about the truth about Keyser Soze was finally revealed. (Yes - it does get revealed eventually.) I was glad of this, because it was the one point of an overly-complicated plot that kept me interested. Was this guy real, or was he in fact a piece of fiction? I was glad to see that resolved - and, no, I didn't see the ultimate resolution coming. So, credit for that ending, but the movie as a whole just didn't strike home with me. (4/10)"

","This is an interesting thriller with a fatal flaw. The flaw lies in the point of view. People who love it think that the flashbacks and other information being given the police are being presented in good faith. They are not. It's all Verbal's POV. And he is lying.<br/><br/>Movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others,"" which contain huge twist endings, also use POV to divert the audience. But in those cases, the POV which we see is sincere. The characters in the movie whose POV we use are convinced it is true. They are MISTAKEN. We are shocked at the end and the reason is that the characters whose narrative we have followed are also shocked. <br/><br/>Kaiser Soze is hardly shocked at the revelation of who he really is.

","Since I enjoy praising a great film considerably more than slamming one that I didn't like then I'll try to make it as short as possible.<br/><br/>When I seen this the first time I was already aware of a central character named Kaiser Sose so the question was ""who""?<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey enters a police station and the story begins to unfold. In the first 15 minutes or so I, without concentrating hardly at all, said something out loud.....""I'll bet Kevin is Kaiser"". Of course I turned out to be right. The reason I said it so quickly was.....1.Kevin Spacey's performance as a handicap was truthfully completely unconvincing. 2.Nobody would ever carry on about things like Barber Shop Quartets, big time fat people etc., etc. in a police questioning.<br/><br/>These two ridiculously obvious issues automatically makes the finger point directly at Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/>This entire film reminded me of (and this is not a put down because it was legitimately brilliant) a scene in The Sixth Sense that was perfectly executed comedy relief.....when Bruce Willis does the magic shake scene with a Penney to Haley Joel Osment. Later Haley passes on the routine to another kid and that kid responds respectively with ""That's stupid, I want my Penney back"".<br/><br/>This whole movie was one long and dragged out bad joke that was seemingly supposed to be serious. That's dumb, I wanted my money back. Every Penney.<br/><br/>A truly genius handicap performance was John Hurt in The Elephant Man. John should have received an Oscar but didn't. Kevin received one for this?!<br/><br/>Not to mention, would anyone really be terrified of Kevin Spacey? No, they simply would not.

First, there is this wonderfully crafted plot that holds everything the audience wants to know and reveals them bit by bit. Then, just when seemingly the last bit of clue is revealed and the puzzle is solved, we realise this puzzle is completely wrong. Truth is, the last 10 minutes of this film displays passive excitement to the limit, and i do not think any other film can create this sort of excitement in such a non aggressive way.<br/><br/>The way the flashbacks are used is definitely novel, and pretty much adds to the suspense creating potential of this film. Character development is top notch, not one character is boring or not worth remembering. In fact, everyone in this movie is refreshing. There's a crippled conman, a person who can't really speak English, and of course vulgarity exemplified Macmanus. Keaton, though, was the soul of this film.<br/><br/>Then there is this twist towards the end of the movie that is so wonderfully directed and so wonderfully hidden from the audience.

"MaxBorg89","10","3","5","15 September 2005"," The best thriller of the '90s
","The first and best reason to remember The Usual Suspects is one single line, spoken by low-level crook Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey): ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"". The cult phrase refers to Keyser Soze, a legendary criminal mastermind who, while unseen (or not, depending on the point of view), dominates the events of Bryan Singer's small yet massive masterpiece, the most accomplished entry in the thriller genre made during the '90s.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie's complex, intelligent and Oscar-winning script (lots of flashbacks in this one) kicks off with the final stage of a massacre, culminating in the execution of a certain Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and the explosion of the boat on which 27 people were brutally murdered. The sole survivor, the aforementioned Verbal, tells Detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) how it all started: six weeks earlier, someone stole a truck, and five ""usual suspects"" were lined up and arrested. These included Verbal and Keaton, plus the arrogant Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), the dim-witted McManus (Stephen Baldwin) and the latter's lover, the hard-to-understand Fenster (Benicio Del Toro, who apparently really had problems when it came to making his lines intelligible).<br/><br/>Now, as Keaton pointed out then and Verbal points out now, the usual strategy is putting one real criminal alongside four random buffoons who practically participate in line-ups for a living. Why were those five sharing a cell, then? The answer pops up after their release: the five suspects are contacted by a sinister attorney who goes by the name Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) and told that they have to fulfil an assignment for Keyser Soze, otherwise they will all die. As the story proceeds, the incredulous police come to realize they're not dealing with the usual crime, or the usual perpetrators for that matter.<br/><br/>The film is clearly an independent production (all scenes were filmed in a limited number of locations, mostly indoors, and the director himself famously appeared in front of the camera in some of the close-ups), but it certainly thinks big, like most smaller films from the late '80s and early '90s. The title is of course an explicit homage to Casablanca, one of Singer's favorite movies, and the intricate plotting is blockbuster-worthy (if only most blockbusters were written this well). What it lacks in size it makes up for in mood and tension, both of which are provided largely through John Ottman's editing and music.<br/><br/>The other key attraction, sort of inevitably with such a cast, is the acting: Del Toro's performance promised a very bright future (and Traffic and 21 Grams have done nothing to prove him wrong), Byrne, Baldwin and Pollak delivered the last truly memorable silver-screen work of their careers (not that Baldwin had that much to speak of in the first place), and in the crippled, verbose Kint Spacey found the perfect role to impose himself as one of the fundamental screen presences of our time. And that's without mentioning the elusive figure of Keyser Soze: whether he's physically portrayed by someone or not, he is rightfully remembered as one of the most enduring cinema villains ever created. Not bad for a guy who hardly has any screen-time at all (or does he?).<br/><br/>Alongside The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en, The Usual Suspects qualifies as the most intelligent and enjoyable thriller of the '90s. The extra points it scores are all due to the particular nature of its ""central"" villain: even more than Hannibal Lecter, Keyser Soze and his tricks won't leave your mind very easily."
"james_norman1981","10","3","5","26 July 2005"," Genius thriller with career best performances from most concerned
","A lot can be said about the Usual Suspects that makes you wonder just what kind of film it is: epic twists, killer dialogue, excellent performances, hardcore action and much more. All of these beg the modern question... who did the director steal his best ideas from? Well that's just it. Although Suspects does owe a debt of gratitude to many films, Casablanca being one example, it was made a long time before the recent crop of films created by directors nicking their best ideas of other people.<br/><br/>This is no Tarantino-esquire film because it was made before he hit the full heights of his popularity. It has no Shyamalan style twist because old M. Night probably got the idea from Suspects. In short, this was the film that provided the catalyst for an awful lot of what we now regard as standard in our noirish, modern films.<br/><br/>For anyone who has yet to see this movie any talk of the plot would spoil the surprise, not just the one at the end but the genuine thrill of seeing every actor involved create an ensemble piece of such exquisite pace, tension and thrill. Whether it's Benicio Del Toro's bizarre Fenster, Kevin Pollack's bitter-sweet Hockney or even Stephen Baldwin's characteristic McManus, this film has a bunch of actors doing perhaps their best work to date, even beyond the five in the line up.<br/><br/>There are a few minor quibbles. Continuity provides a problem in places as does the explanations for some characters' motives. The film jumps around different time-lines fairly unpredictably and you can be forgiven for wondering whether the whole thing is just a big shaggy dog story. On the other hand, as twisty turny thrillers go this one can't be beat.<br/><br/>If you have yet to do so buy, not see or rent but buy, this film, watch it all the way through with no one (as they'll be hopping up and down on their seat desperately trying to explain the clever bits and pieces that Singer and co have strewn throughout) and enjoy one of the best examples of modern film making. You must be warned though, when I saw it for the first time I had to start it again right from the beginning just to get to grips with the ending!"

","This is perhaps the only film I would ever be so presumptuous as to call ""overrated"". I understand its appeal, but I still don't like it. The acting is decent enough, but not terrific. If anything, several of the actors seem to be miscast. The dialogue is for the most part exceptionally weak, with Kevin Spacey getting all the good lines. Gabriel Byrne is supposed to be the center of the story, the character we're supposed to care the most about, but he's such a bland guy that I personally didn't really care about him at all. And then there's the ""shocking"" ending where it all comes together. First of all, simple logic would determine that it was the only possible ending - and knowing that this mysterious villain had to be one of the five protagonists made it even easier. Simple math, ladies and gentlemen. Plus, if that ending were true, much of what came before it doesn't fit. I know, I know - you're saying  ""That's the whole point!"" Even considering that, it falls apart under closer scrutiny. And this is the type of film that should not fall apart. It should be as tight as an oil drum. This film's pleasures are purely surface-level. There's nothing beyond the script's trickery and machinations to be found. This might be entertaining in some respects, but it's not a deep or profound piece of work."

Steven Baldwin is a douche in this and every other movie he's ever been in. Yeah, this is a good movie, but I don't see how it separates itself so distinctly from every other movie like it. Don't say there aren't movies like it because there are every year and there were every year before it for the previous 20 years. By the way, Kevin Pollack is a hack comedian who has relied on three impressions to make a career.

"lllinggg","4","4","8","24 July 2003"," Distinct Though Overrated
","Distinct within its genre, though alarmingly overrated, 'The Usual Suspects' is a popular film whose reputation is likely to prove ephemeral. A group of east coast rogues use their unexpected gathering in a routine law enforcement roundup to plan a series of high-profile jobs, only to realize that forces higher than themselves are in control of their plans. Guided by a largely unpolished script, the film's numerous characters -only some of whom appear visually convincing- engage in a dialogue-based interplay that satisfies less than it entertains. Well-trained American actors like Chazz Palminteri and Kevin Spacey seem to have left their vast acting reservoirs essentially untouched, while even the Europeans Gabriel Byrne and Pete Postlethwaite, though refreshingly decent, appear to have their eyes primarily set on payday. The film's much talked about ending is somewhat predictable within its unpredictability, and the directorial and musical inputs, which can ideally salvage conventional visual sequences, are not much help either. Overall, 'The Usual Suspects' deserves to be watched in the context of Hollywood's increasingly sterile fascination with the criminal underworld. Veteran spectators, however, should restrain their expectations far below the over-exultant levels of most reviews."

","Wait a minute... five criminals in one lineup? There's something wrong here, right? Right... In ""The Usual Suspects,"" not only every line but every gesture, every facial expression and every camera cut counts. Even if you distrust the story being told, you can't exactly pin down everything that's wrong with it. The plot unfolds through the tale extracted from Kint, one of two survivors of a massacre and subsequent explosion on a boat docked in San Pedro Harbor, by U.S. Customs agent David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). And at the same time as Kint is spinning his yarn, in a nearby hospital the other survivor (badly injured and fresh out of a coma) helps a police sketch artist draw a picture of the mastermind behind the scheme - ""the devil,"" Keyser Söze. You can watch this movie countless times, and you will still discover new subtleties every single time. Not only will you find that it still makes sense after the story line has been unraveled at the end (which therefore is a plot twist, not a non-sequitur). You'll also discover nuance upon nuance in Kevin Spacey's incredible performance. You'll see that tiny apologetic grin on Todd Hockney's face as attorney Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) lists a weapons truck heist - the very act which brought them together in the initial lineup, and which they have all come to believe to have been a trumped-up charge - as Hockney's latest sin against Keyser Söze, now forming part of the debt to be repaid by participating in the suicide mission in San Pedro Harbor. And at some point you'll also have figured out all of Fenster's lines (not being a native English speaker, I am relieved to find that I wasn't the only one struggling with them at first)... although the mumbling is of course part of his character, and is as excellently delivered as every other aspect of Benicio del Toro's acting, his lines are so funny and to the point you almost wish he'd speak more clearly so you wouldn't miss half his punch lines the first time around. <br/><br/>This masterpiece of cinema deservedly won the best screenplay Oscar and best supporting actor Oscar for the wonderful Kevin Spacey in 1995. The film is a modern day classic with all the elements of great film making coming together. A fantastic script combined with brilliant direction and a cast that seemed to be thoroughly enjoying itself, this is 1940's film noir at its very best, brought thoroughly up to date for the 1990's, combining clever little references to the past with very modern settings at that time. Action, suspense, plotting, double crossing - the whole kit and kaboodle.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 10 out of 10."
"tomgillespie2002","8","2","3","17 May 2014"," Riveting stuff, even after its umpteenth viewing
","Thanks mainly to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992), the 1990's saw the re-emergence of crime noir - talky, violent thrillers packed with colourful characters and even more colourful language. Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects was one of the best of the bunch, thanks mainly to the director taking influence from past masters such as Hitchcock, Lang and Kurosawa, rather than the many Tarantino copycats that flooded the 90's cinema market, who did little but poorly imitate the big-chinned one's chatty screenplays and outlandish, darkly humorous violence. It also had a killer twist; one that will baffle as much as it will surprise, or possibly induce cries of cheap manipulation.<br/><br/>After what appears to be a heist gone wrong on an exploded boat, the only surviving witness, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a disabled con-man, is brought in to be interrogated by customer officer Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Having already been acquitted by some mysterious higher powers, Kint is probed by Kujan for more information. He tells a story of five criminals who meets in a line-up - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a steely criminal gone straight, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), an entry man with a short fuse, Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus's partner, and Kint himself. Having being picked up one time too many, the group hatch a plot to pay the crooked cops back, and eventually start taking jobs from the shady Redfoot (Peter Greene).<br/><br/>While the build-up to the explosion seen at the beginning of the film is relatively formulaic in its execution, Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for his efforts) inject enough humour into the script to bring these characters alive, and bring them over to your side. The clever thing is that it soon becomes apparent that everything were seeing either isn't true or isn't at all relevant, and it's the increasingly looming presence of the mysterious and infamous criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, who may in fact hold all the cards. The twist is not particularly clever at all, and isn't that hard to guess, but the director's skill in capturing it is what makes it so memorable.<br/><br/>The now-iconic poster wouldn't be so iconic if the characters hadn't been so memorably played by it's cast. With the exception of Kint, the characters are little but stock characters, but there is genuine chemistry, especially in the line-up scene where they crack up after Baldwin's over-the-top delivery of a line. Byrne proves again that he is much more deserving than the mediocre roles he tends to land, and Spacey bagged a Supporting Actor Oscar for his puppy-dog con-man. It's far, far from deserving of its place as #23 on IMDb's top films of all time, but The Usual Suspects is riveting stuff, even after it's umpteenth viewing.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

"johnnyboyz","10","2","3","21 July 2008"," Quite ingenious crime film that lets you in and then doesn't give you so much as a sniff unless you can spot all the visual clues and then some more.
","Only a film as cryptic as The Usual Suspects could keep you coming back for more and more. A film that is so involved and so smart and engaging in its delivery that it drops several clues to its ending while simultaneously not entirely making them obvious for first time viewers. In fact the series of clues; ideas and the overall ending is so famous, it's been referenced and spoofed in so many other pieces of text that these days it would be almost impossible to watch without knowing what everything revolves around. The mere fact the ending and whole idea has featured in these other texts only confirms The Usual Suspects' cult status and is really just an appreciation or 'acceptance' that it is truly a fantastic film.<br/><br/>The film is an all over the place (in the nicest possible way), crime drenched neo-noir which cuts back and forth from police station to detective trying to get to the bottom of a supposed drug deal gone wrong on one equilibrium; but also to the flashbacks which are the making of the drug deal on another equilibrium. The film sees visual references, audio references, what characters do as well as general dialogue drop hints as to what is coming and what the truth really is  hell; in one instance, where a certain character looks is an important clue. But The Usual Suspects is more than a series of tricks and gimmicks masquerading under a decent cast and a well shot, well lit crime saga. It is a journey into a world of the detective; it is a race against time and it is a non-linear crime saga revolving around organised crime, criminals and drug lords.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't fully understand the film first time I saw it, but with the added aid of research and DVD extras, The Usual Suspects quickly became one of my favourite films in terms of atmosphere, narrative and the general pacing of the story being unfolded. The film also carries a certain air of manipulation and ambiguity in its presentation, forcing us to think one thing; forcing us to recognise with seemingly the most unnecessary things imaginable: the way a certain character speaks nearer the beginning; the direction a certain character looks and what they're looking at as well as what certain characters are telling other characters and how they're reacting to it despite the fact we've already seen it.<br/><br/>If it all sounds complicated then that's because it is, but that's the beauty of the film when it comes to multiple viewings. Everything is set up in a fast and urgent manner after a more sedate and much more calmer opening in which the aftermath of a shoot out on a boat introduces the prologue to the main strand of the film: an interrogation (or a 'friendly chat' according to the interrogating police man) between Verbal Kint (Spacey) and the officer, David Kujan (Palminteri). The brilliance in the delivery of Kint's story to Kujan lies in its parallel placing with the scenes revolving around the rounding up of the criminals which culminates in that famous line up shot; the developing of their friendship/hatred; the jobs that they do for a mysterious figure known as Redfoot (Greene) and the situation they all find themselves in once crime king Keyser Söze (can't put actor's name in brackets) catches up with them.<br/><br/>If we look at how the criminals consisting of McManus (Baldwin); Keaton (Byrne); Fenster (del Toro); Hockney (Pollak) and Kint are rounded up in the first place, we can see that out of all the arrests Keaton's is given the most dramatic and most coveted. When he is arrested, he is in an expensive restaurant indulging in a rich conversation as opposed to the others whom are crudely rounded up on street corners and in garages. From here Keaton is made to look, perhaps not the most criminal, but certainly the most intelligent of the band but the rest of them are petty criminals or in Kint's case, crippled. This immediately places a higher opinion on Keaton in our minds and already, the film is attempting to brainwash us with its 'who's who'. The extensive dialogue later on constantly keeping Keaton in the dark as to who he could really be helps maintain this doubt as does his scrachy background and his failure to get a business empire off the ground.<br/><br/>Then there is the manipulation of the supporting characters. I mentioned Redfoot being mysterious, something the film establishes with eerie music as his car rolls up to the gang. They meet amongst some odd looking Japanese mise-en-scene definitely un-associated with the location they're currently in: Los Angles, further adding to the bizarre and somewhat surreal nature of both the scene and the film. But there are several incidences where what you think was right, indeed wasn't and as the film develops things become increasingly dramatic culminating in a scene involving a notice board that still chills me even after so many viewings. Quite simply; The Usual Suspects is a smart and engaging film, the likes of which can be revisited time and time again."

","The problems with movies like ""The usual Suspects"" is that they are taken too seriously. People flock to identify a hidden meaning, a socially relevant message or a reflection of time when it was made. While a good movie may and, sometimes, does have one or more of these attributes, still the basic point of every good movie is to entertain. If the movie has involved me in it, made me suspend my disbelief to move along enthusiastically with the story, it has done its job. The Usual Suspects does just that. You may sit comfortably long after the movie is over and think about how some parts make no sense or are improbable. But, while watching it just sweeps you, partly because of its same improbability and also because of its pace. The pace is just right, not fast enough to make you lose track of what is happening, or slow enough to second-guess the motives and figure out the plot twists. The way the movie unfolded and ended was enough to keep me interested throughout. The ending is a classic, even if you guess it a little before you are expected. Of course, the delight in watching it the second time is immense as armed with the revelation at the end, you can view a lot of scenes with an investigative interest and come off totally consumed. Besides its plot, TUS has brilliant performances to keep you entertained and some great dialogs.

Everything hinged on the supposed intrigue of the story. The principal cast members gave poor performances especially Gabriel Byrne who was wooden throughout. Kevin Spacey was good but not great.

It's told in a clever, retrospective, narrative style with some great performances from Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne that leaves us pondering just who is ""Söze"" and to deal with an ending that you""ll never forget!"

"jingaridah","10","1","1","3 March 2017"," Why The Usual Suspects is the best movie of all time
","The best movies of all time are often the types of movies that you can watch over and over again and find something you never noticed the first time you watched it. The Usual Suspects, directed by Bryan Singer, is everything that a thriller mystery movie should have. The story follows a criminal played by Kevin Spacey who recalls the story of his partners in crime and how they all ended up getting killed by a man named Kaiser Soze, a supposed myth in the criminal world. The story, as it unfolds, is full of mystery about who the true identity of this Kaiser Soze character is, making the audience believe that Dean Keaton, portrayed by Gabriel Byrne, is only man that could be Kaiser Soze.<br/><br/>What makes this movie stand out above the others and makes one want to watch it multiple times is the twist. The major twist at the end shocks not only the audience, but also the characters in the movie, making the reaction that much better. What makes the twist in this movie so effective and shocking is the fact that the audience finds out the truth at the same time as the characters. Seeing the characters and how they react to the twist gives the audience a certain way to feel and how they should also react to the mind boggling realization. Not only does the way that the story is told, first person and through flashbacks, make the movie great, but the artistic climax at the very end makes it a movie you would watch over and over again. Since the movie is able to draw the audience in by having two climaxes at the end of the film, of which also happen to be the two twists, the audience is left even more in shock and awe the second time compared to the first. The first climax occurs with only ten minutes left in the movie, as the officer doing the interrogating draws the conclusion from Verbal Kint's, played by Kevin Spacey, story that Dean Keaton is the alleged Keyser Soze. Five minutes later, the second climax occurs after Kint leaves the police station, as the officer realizes with shock and disbelief that Kint is actually Keyser Soze. The way the the officer realizes the truth as well is so methodically thought out. After Kint leaves, the officer sits on his desk, drinking coffee and just looking at all the police stories posted on the wall behind his desk. Wide eyed, the officer realizes that some of the stories Kint told were just stories from the wall. It is this single moment that makes the viewer want to watch the movie multiple times as you're never completely sure what parts of Kint's story is real and what parts are simply made up.<br/><br/>Along with the twists, and the story telling, the acting done by Kenvin Spacey is that of legends and fine tuned actors. The writing of the script and how Spacey was able to portray the emotions of his character, a ""crippled man,"" makes you feel a special connection to him, but the big twist is able to take that well crafted connection and completely topple it over. The artistic way that the camera follows Kint in the last closing scenes also makes this movie mind blowing and jaw dropping. One of the last shots is of Kint's crippled feet, limping away from the police station. However, with the audience now knowing that Kint is Keyser Soze, when they witness Kint's limp evolve into a regular stride, showing that Kint faked even his disability, everything becomes clear.<br/><br/>Besides just being entertaining, the movie can also contain a deeper, darker meaning in that shows the audience that not every story told will be a hundred percent true and can often times be perverted for the benefits of a story teller. Due to the great story, the effectiveness of the twists, and the acting, the Usual Suspects is one of many movies that belong in everyone's top movies list."

"mistoppi","8","1","1","5 February 2017"," Great thriller
","The Usual Suspects is a movie I've been meaning to watch since forever. My dad actually owns the DVD, but sometimes you have to rent a movie to actually see it - because you've paid for it and it would suck if you'd basically lose money and not see it.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about The Usual Suspects. Story-wise I only knew that picture of the line up. I had avoided the spoilers almost perfectly. Just almost? I did know about the twist. I didn't know what it was, I just knew there was going to be a huge twist. Also I had seen that one Saturday Night Live sketch, which kind of gives something away. Even though I kind of knew something about the ending, I didn't know the story, and I didn't know how to get to the ending and what the ending would actually mean in the story, because a SNL sketch doesn't exactly explain the reference<br/><br/>It's hard to get in the right mood with the movie. There's no hook before the opening credits, you just have to wait until they are over or maybe fast forward through them. They offer nothing except John Ottman's music, which is of course decent, but not any different from typical movie music. But when the movie begun, it just begun. It was a bit fast, unclear. What is happening, who are these people, oh now we're at now... When they start questioning Verbal it becomes clearer. Still flashbacks are a hard way to tell the story - they are very quick and the audience can feel like something was left out, except I think this is exactly what McQuarrie might've been after. <br/><br/>But once you get used to the pace and the style of story telling, the movie turns into a very exciting thriller. <br/><br/>I guess the only problem in watching this movie over 20 years later is that it's now easier to guess the big twist. It might be because of a certain actor, it might be because this kind of twist is now more common, or it's just the evolution of cinema. But at one point while watching this movie it all clicked together. Of course the SNL sketch helped, and so did that one scene from the first Scary Movie - which is something I haven't seen in ages but it just came to me and I realised that's where it's from!<br/><br/>But figuring out a twist isn't exactly bad, you can also feel super victorious.<br/><br/>All in all, The Usual Suspects is a good thriller, a bit slow but the end makes it so much better. It has definitely aged well. But after seeing it once I don't feel like watching it again any time soon. It might be like some other movies with major twist: once you know it, you can watch it maybe once more to like see it from the new perspective, but that's it."

""The Usual Suspects"" won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor, due to a fantastic cast and an awesome story with an even bigger plot twist.<br/><br/>The Plot: Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a Customs agent, brings Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a small-time con artist with a limp, into a local Californian police station for questioning in hopes of discovering the identity of the mysterious criminal Kaiser Söze. Kint tells the story of how he, three other criminals, and formerly corrupt police officer Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) agreed to do a job for Söze who had vendettas against all of them. Kint explains that the job went wrong, and a man killed the others, including Keaton, before setting the ship they were all on board aflame. Kujan doesn't believe his story and instead forces him to admit that Keaton was really Kaiser Söze.<br/><br/>The Twist: ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" This is what everybody wants to know, as the viewer sees a crippled man named ""Verbal"" Kint (who was part of a major crime alongside his partners) to the detectives assigned to the case.<br/><br/>Crime lord Keyzer Soze is ""Verbal"" Kint, who has just told detective Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) a pack of lies he's made up. As he's being released from custody, he steps out to the street and reveals himself as non-crippled. One of the greatest cinematic stories ever told and the greatest ending twist in film history. In what is arguably the greatest cinematic twist of all time, Kujan realises that everything Verbal told him during the interview can be found in pictures, clippings, and items around the office, revealing that Kint lied about everything. As Kint walks to his car, long gone from the police station, he drops his limp.<br/><br/>The film ends with Kint reciting a quote by French poet Baudelaire: ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" —Before the screen goes black, he adds, ""And like that he's gone.""<br/><br/>This is the kind of twist that makes repeat viewings so rewarding.

"itaimaimon","10","1","1","6 December 2016"," come for the crime drama stay for the story-telling
","After Watching ""The Usual Suspects"" directed by Bryan Singer, it has quickly become one of my favorite movies. Without giving away anything, this movie has one of the best endings to a film I have ever seen. Furthermore, it is chalk full of engrossing cinematic elements, such as several shot reverse shots and a good deal of chiaroscuro. However, the real draw of the film is in the way it is laid out. The film takes place almost entirely in the office of a police chief, and for the most part is given in the form of a story being told by Verbal Kint played by Kevin Spacey. This allows the film to have a non-linear plot progression, which is in my opinion one of the most interesting ways to display a narrative. It allows Singer to interweave various strands and smaller narratives into one composed work. It would be remiss to review this film and not mention Kevin Spacey's brilliant acting. After seeing Kevin Spacey in such strong and stern roles such as Francis Underwood in Beau Willmon's ""House of Cards'', Seeing him act as a weak easily frightened man with Cerebral Palsy is entirely game changing. Spacey convincingly creates and displays a feeling of weakness and cowardice. In conclusion, I think the Usual Suspects is one of the best executed and unique crime films of its time, and would greatly recommend watching it to anyone who enjoys crime dramas and non-linear storytelling."
"travnicholsg","10","1","1","8 May 2016"," A classic non linear flashback of a story provided from a vantage point evident from two witnesses and the scene of a massacre.

His labyrinthine tale descries the mysterious Keyser Soze as eliminating close to 30 people in this horrific event. As time tells and as evidence builds the killer starts to show as tip after tip are uncovering the layers of deceit brought into account...Near the end of The Usual Suspects, Spacey, in his Oscar-winning performance as crippled con man Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, says, ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" This may be the key line in this story; the farther along the movie goes, the more one realizes that not everything is quite what it seems, and what began as a conventional whodunit turns into something quite different."
"thediggens","10","1","1","16 July 2014"," The Last Great Mystery Thriller
","Sometimes the sum is greater than the parts. The parts are good, but when it all comes together, and fits, just right, there's something more. The Usual Suspects might be the perfect example of this. Nothing on its own stands out. But together, all the pieces fit.<br/><br/>Told in flashback by Kevin Spacey, the audience follows the events leading up to a shoot-out and massacre on a boat. Following a group of 5 criminals (alternating lead between Stephen Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne) from job to job, the plot is told straightforward but lays down layers of dense intricacy and relationships. The story becomes increasingly revolved around the mysterious legend, Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>At its heart The Usual Suspects is merely a mystery told incredibly well. No scene is wasted- the film is tightly paced at just over an hour and a half- and the characterisation comes through immediately. Kevin Spacey's purposefully monotone voice-over is often merely exposition, but the framing device and the dialogue make it work without ever seeming dull.<br/><br/>One should take a moment to bring up the dialogue, which is actually a lot better than many give it credit for. While the screenplay is better known for how it comes together at the end, the whole script is full of wit and slick lines. McQuarrie is well deserving of his Oscar.<br/><br/>Yet one cannot really do a review of The Usual Suspects without reference to the ending. It's a film that relies on its ending to enhance the rest of it. Previous scenes have more meaning, and its cleverness becomes apparent. The main criticism one can see is if the ending is spoiled (which given its infamy is increasingly likely), it can neuter the impact.<br/><br/>Aside from that, The Usual Suspects does no wrong. A giant puzzle with satisfying parts, which when complete reveals a jigsaw masterpiece."
"Degree7","5","1","1","24 March 2014"," Somewhat wonderful?
","Usual Suspects made a long career for Bryan Singer, and an even larger reputation for itself. A crime-thriller that supposedly pioneered the 'shocking' twist, long before Shyamalan came on the scene. But what about watching a movie without any pre-conceived notions? I took the time to slip it into the DVD player with my old man besides me. After 2 hours of convoluted trickery, he was less than impressed with the film's main plot device. ""Well that was clever..... but is that it?""<br/><br/>With a combination of tropes (the dog being the mastermind, crossed with unreliable narrator) the writers try to keep the audience guessing, but somewhat superficially, as the story gradually winds down to a less than mind-blowing finale. The direction is flashy and Scorsese-lite, with bright lighting, wide angles, and mysterious music to let the viewer feel he is being led astray. It works for the most part, but I felt like my buttons were being pressed unwillingly by the filmmaker, to make the mystery seem thicker than it was.<br/><br/>The other problem was the narrator-bound narrative. It was essential for the plot, but also meant we never peek into the lives of these characters we're supposed to be attached to. The history between them is relegated to expository dialogue, and a love-interest's death is dealt out in an offhand fashion right at the climax. It made me realize that most of the story is built around this twist ending, and the rest of what happened in the film, all the mini-adventures the characters had, the elaborate trail they had been lead on, was all window-dressing to get me to the WOW shocker that had been promised all along. <br/><br/>It's neat, artfully told, smooth film making, but the story seems like it could have been condensed into a 20 minute Twilight Zone episode and left at that. Not a 2 hour feature. My time wasn't exactly wasted, but there wasn't much meat to chew on, thematically or character-wise, and all it left me to ponder upon was a quote hijacked from French poet Charles Baudelair; ""The devil's finest trick is to persuade you that he does not exist."" It doesn't exactly scream originality, does it? Shouldn't the writers have to pay copyright material for using another's work?"

For most of this, the audience is working hard to keep up with the characters and the story. It all makes sense but every once in a while, something sounds suspicious. When I first saw it in the theater, more than once it left me scratching my head. Then the twist comes, blows my mind, and explains all the suspicions I had.<br/><br/>The five men crew is played expertly by Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, and Stephen Baldwin.

In the film, the usual suspects are five small-time crooks who are brought together in a police line-up on trumped-up charges. Funny thing - the idea for this movie started only with the concept of a movie poster of five of guys in a lineup.<br/><br/>""The Usual suspects "" is a modestly-budgeted piece . All the actors worked for less than their usual fees. It shows you their dedication to the project and seems impossible to make this film today , when almost every movie has a 200 mln budget.

It's very simple and very effective . Simply unforgettable , when the truth hits you like a ton of bricks. The quote from the French poet Charles Baudelaire ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist"" appears in this movie and it's definitely one of the most famous lines in movie history.<br/><br/>The story seems convoluted , but in the end makes perfect sense. It grabs you from the start with the mystery of what happened in the docks. There are more mysteries and twists along the way until the very end. Like every good criminal this movie does lose it's magic on repeated viewings , yet not quite. On repeated viewings you can see many clues you might have missed . You will also notice how well written the dialogues are.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives quite possibly the best performance of his career as fast-talking yet shy con artist crippled by cerebral palsy.

It's very elegant and moody score. Bryan Singer directs with confidence and energy , never allowing the plot to be confusing.<br/><br/>The only bad thing I can say about this movie that it's only a game .

"The-Sarkologist","9","1","1","27 December 2013"," A extraordinary crime thriller that will leave you speechless
","My first comment is that if you have not seen this movie, stop reading now and go and watch it. It is phenomenal the first time you see it. Do not read any more as what I write will give away too much of the plot.<br/><br/>My friend's comment about this movie was that when he saw it in the cinema, at the end everybody left in dead silence. The ending of it so shocked them that there was literally nothing to say. The Usual Suspects is a movie with a brilliant twist and flows constantly through to the end. On TV it sucks because you simply lose the flow of the movie as the adds interrupt it.<br/><br/>It is impossible to describe the plot without giving too much away, so I will simply say what happens at the beginning and a few other things about the themes in the movie. It is not a thematically deep movie, but it is one that the characters work well and the plot is very well constructed.<br/><br/>It begins with an explosion on the LA waterfront and lots of corpses are dragged out of the water. One man, a cripple, is found alive and is taken in for questioning, but he has to be released due to some immunity he has. Anyway, the story is told through the mouth of this cripple, and seems legit.<br/><br/>It begins with the hijacking of a truck in Queens and five people - the usual suspects, are brought in for questioning. Of course they have nothing on them and their lawyer forces the police to release them. Angered at the police's treatment of them, they decide to bust open a conspiracy where the police offer taxi services to criminals.<br/><br/>One of the lines in this movie shows the idea that once somebody is a criminal, they are always a criminal. It is the line that says, ""you get to a point where you no longer have any rights - no matter how you try to live a straight life, they will always come after you to pin something on you."" This is the story of Dean Keaton. He was a cop who went corrupt but now is trying to make good with his life. Unfortunately the cops won't let him do that. Not only will the police not leave him alone, but when he tries to make good, his past always comes back.<br/><br/>The police believe that Keaton is not just a bad guy, but the bad guy. They are so obsessed with making sure that Keaton is dead that they completely miss the real person whom they are looking for and this person simply walks right out from under their noses while they try to force them to admit that it was all Keaton's fault.<br/><br/>Another theme is that we are never truly free - there is always somebody that is in control, and not only that but what ever we do always affects somebody, and in some cases somebody whom we don't even realise. All of the suspects in the movie did something that upset the wrong person, and they did not even intend on upsetting him, they simply did not think about their actions.<br/><br/>Finally there is a somewhat relative message in this movie. On one hand, things are not always what they seem, but on the other side, the truth is really only somebody's subjective interpretation of events. Even then, we can generally not accept what people say because there is always a subjective intention behind it.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is a brilliant movie. It is not as good the second time round as you already know what will happen, but for the first time, it is simply leave you speechless."

I was feeling somewhat disappointed at how obvious the initial twist was however when the final twist occurred, revealing Costner as the villain, it made me totally reassess the movie into being one of my all time favourites.<br/><br/>There were so many classic scenes in the movie that it would be impossible for it not to be in anybody top 25.

","The Usual Suspects is a movie which works first and foremost on an intellectual level and it is a riddle to be deciphered. This film is directed by Bryan Singer and the main characters such as Stephen Baldwin (Michael McManus), Gabriel Byrne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), Kevin Spacey (Roger ""Verbal"" Kint), Chazz Palminteri (Agent Dave Kujan) and Pete Postlethwaite (Kobayashi the henchman). The film begins on a ship were an unidentified character seems to have shot Keaton (Byrne) and then sets the ship on fire. The police arrive on the scene to investigate; the police officer reveals there are only two witnesses, a cripple and a hospitalized Hungarian. As cripple survivor Kint (Spacey) is waiting to post bail agent Kujan (Palminteri) wants to hear the story from the beginning. Flash back to six weeks earlier, in a police line-up of five criminals who are hauled in and put together into a holding cell because they are the usual suspects. While in the holding cell they all decide to do one last job together to get some kind of sweet revenge. The heist is only a stepping stone to another job which soon turns into a lot of twist and turns, only to find out they are working for a lawyer name Kobayashi (Postlethwaite). The five criminals are roped in because at one time or another they betrayed the mysterious Keyser Soze and does he get his revenge on them. The main theme is trying to reveal who is Keyser Soze, do we the audience unravel the puzzle of who this mysterious Keyser Soze really is and do the police unmasked him. I feel as if the director matched the perfect actors to there characters. If you like mystery, puzzles, twist and turn, this is a movie for you."

","""The Greatest Trick the Devil ever Pulled was Convincing the World He didn't Exist"". This line will always be ingrained in my memory when it comes to my favorite movies of all time ""The Usual Suspects"" is definitely in my top 5 and if you were playing a trivia game and someone asked you to name the movie for which this quote was made I'm almost certain if you've seen this movie you would answer the question correctly. The film begins at night after an apparent bloodbath battle aboard a burning ship in the San Pedro harbor in California. You see a man who appears to be injured and disoriented sitting on the ground having a cigarette, their is fire and explosive liquids everywhere, and of course dead men all over the place, next you see a shadowy figure make his way from the top of the ship down to face are stranger on the ground, the mystery man calls are man on the ground ""Keaton""(Gabriel Byrne), to which he replies I can't feel my legs Keyser, the man called Keyser ask Keaton, Are you ready? Next we assume Keaton is murdered by Keyser with a pistol before the cut away from this scene. The Theme of Usual Suspects appear to revolve around honor, pride, arrogance, fear and betrayal as methods to manipulate the human mind. The use of flashbacks are apparent as the next scene has low level crook Verbal Kint(Kevin Spacey), one of only two survivors being interrogated by US Customs Agent Dave Kujan(Chazz Parminteri). Verbal tells the agent how it all started: six weeks earlier, someone hijacked a truck full of guns, and five ""usual suspects"" were lined up and arrested. These suspects included Verbal and Keaton, plus the arrogant Todd Hockney(Kevin Pollak), the goof ball McManus(Stephen Baldwin) and the verbally challenged Fenster(Benicio Del Toro). They were put in the now famous line-up at police headquarters and told to repeat the line ""Hand me the Keys you Fu_king Cock Sucker"". Out of this was borne a ruthless gang who decided they would do a ""Job"" in other words a robbery together. Keaton wanted no part of it, however, when they are contacted by a strange attorney named Kobayashi(Pete Postlethwaithe)and informed they must carry out an assignment given to them by ruthless and mythical crime figure Keyser Soze, or else they will be murdered. This film reminds me of another classic film in relation to theme and that would be ""Casablanca"" because each time you see this movie it opens a new layer to the plot or a new angle that was missed the first time we saw it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I'd suggest that you do, it's a modern day 90's classic."
"taylot04","10","1","1","5 December 2012"," One Line Summary
","The film is about five criminals who are taken into the New York police station because a crime was committed. The criminals agree to do a job, but do not know that this one person have it out for them. About 20 or more people dies, but the big mystery is the man behind it all who really has control.<br/><br/>Five criminals are arrested and brought into the police station to be questioned regarding the explosion and bodies. None of them is guilty, they plan a revenge job against the police. The job goes well, but then the influence of a legendary mastermind criminal called Keyser Söze is felt. It becomes clear that each one of them has wronged Söze at some point and must pay back now. The payback job leaves 27 men dead in a boat explosion, but the real question arises now: Who actually is Keyser Söz.<br/><br/>The police officers was trying to find out what happened/caused the explosion on a boat on a San Pedro pier. That caused the death of 27 people and $91 million that is from drug money. The only people who survived was the people who was burned badly and very afraid of the terrorist and Verbal Kint, a crippled con-man. <br/><br/>This film would be in reference to the film Donnie Brasco, in many ways and including the theme of the film. These two films reference each other in several of way by with the crime, murders, and with revenge. Also, the theme, setting in bars, police stations, boats, also with the detectives being involved in the cases to help solve the crime, and put the criminals away in behind bars. The techniques used in the film are motifs, because of the scenes with the repeat crimes involved. Also, the lighting that is used in the film, when the scene gets intense and the suspense arises.<br/><br/>The tie in comment on the theme, is when the film first begin with the credits, and music, I knew the film would have suspense and crime. At the end of the film, when the man with the disability walked out the police station and as he got further down the street, he no longer walked with a limp, and proceed to get into the car. The vision of the film, show all elements functioning together as a unique whole. This was my first time viewing this film and I have to say, it was a great film and all the characters did great."
"beltranbedgar","10","1","1","1 December 2012"," Thrilling as hell
","Excellent movie, one of my favorites. The funny thing is to see the guy who directed this jewel, today is on mediocre superhero movies, but here we have a beautifully presented complex history (awesome script wrote by McQuarrie), the whole film seems somewhat predictable, which makes the conclusion (one of the best I've seen) more surprising, taking two switches quickly, pretty confusing. I must say I hated the way is filmed, I think it was an interesting attempt but extremely tedious, very similar to the 80s detective series. Of course is impossible not to love the work of Kevin Spacey, he knows perfectly how to perform his character, it appears to be written to fit for him: the stupid unknown racketeer whose personality for some reason remembers me Sheldon Cooper (at the beginning, at least) and well ... then we all know what happens. Finally, it leaves a memorable quote, one of the best of the 90s movies: ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn't exist."""

","You're introduced to five criminals walking into a dingy police station. One look at them and you know that these are the guys who always get mixed up in something funny. They're called to read out something from a piece of paper which they do, ending their lines with a cuss and allowing themselves a hearty snicker. The scene continues and you see each one of them getting interrogated personally by the cops. All of them claim their innocence whilst the cops threaten them and once or twice, answer back, not giving a damn what the cops might do to them. 15 minutes into this marvel of a film and it had me laughing hard and loud. That's the beauty of 'The Usual Suspects"".<br/><br/>The film follows the story of Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), a small-time con man and a cripple, who narrates his story to the cops about what happened after the lineup, beginning from a small hit-and-run robbery and ending in a waterfront explosion that killed 27 men. His story is about how the five men: Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), a professional thief; his partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), the smart guy; the explosives expert Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), the corrupt cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and Kint, are blackmailed into stopping a drug trade by a legendary and seemingly omnipresent gangster Keyser Soze. As Kint's story progresses, it becomes more and more complex and finally gives rise to a big question: Who is Keyser Soze?<br/><br/>'The Usual Suspects' is unlike anything I've ever seen: fast, cold, dark, unnerving, funny, nasty and spellbinding. It's crude cinema at its finest (how often d'you get to see something like that?). What makes it even better is how director Bryan Singer's got a way to build nail-biting suspense. He never lets you know anything you absolutely don't need to know and gets you the facts on a need-to-know basis. Of course, Singer's not the only hero of this film. The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, is one of the best ever written, pure and simple. In the first scene itself, he introduces his characters and you understand them, not wanting to know anything more about them and he doesn't let on much, making you guess what each of them goes through throughout the film. One question whose answer has evaded me for years: How on earth did he imagine all this? McQuarrie's been equipped with terrific imagination and you see that through his writing.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film that could've faltered if it wasn't for the splendid performances by the cast. Spacey is sensational in the lead role, wearing a slightly bemused expression throughout the film, he gets you laughing when he wants to make you laugh. Del Toro is equally wonderful as the smart guy whose accent is hard to decode. The editing by John Ottman, who is also responsible for the haunting score, is what makes the inspiring climax hit you like a 1000-ton train at full speed.<br/><br/>'The Usual Suspects' is an underrated classic. It's a superbly crafted suspense-thriller which has elements of a dark comedy. Four years after I first watched it, it still holds the pride of being the only film which I had seen a second time as soon as I had finished the first viewing. If it's on my favorite-films list, I would put it near the top."

","This movie was directed by Bryan Singer and was released in 1995. This is a great action, drama, mystery movie all wrapped up into one. It is a movie about five criminals that are well known in New York. These five criminals were initially brought in for a police lineup but then the movie really builds from there. These five criminals all vow to get back at the police force. This takes them on a journey of criminal activity. First they get back at the cops by exposing dirty cops. Then they start working other various jobs together. Then one turning point in the film is that they are called upon by Kaiser Sosa to take on a dangerous job. Kaiser Sozas character is then built as spooky, vicious underworld figure that even the most notorious criminals are afraid of.<br/><br/>There are five main characters that this movie is based around. Verbal Klint, played by Kevin Spacey is a crippled conman that doesn't like violence. Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, is a top level entry man that is deemed to be a little psychotic. Todd Hockney, played be Kevin Pollak, is a hardened criminal wise cracker. Fred Fenster, played by Benicio Del Toro, is a partner of Michael McManus. Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, was and ex cop turned notorious crook.<br/><br/>The movie goes throw many flashbacks to give you pieces to the big puzzle that unfolds. There are many details in this movie and after watching it 30+ times I still don't understand all of it. Maybe Bryan Singer wanted it that way, to keep you intrigued and wondering.<br/><br/>The movie really was edited and directed in very sophisticated way. All scenes were masterfully directed. The lighting was great in various sense throughout the moving. This lighting really accentuated the scenes. All of these aspects gave the film a great visual style and a truly grandiouse feel.<br/><br/>This movie continually builds to the conclusion. In the end of the movie Kevin Spacey pulls off a great performance. He is being interrogated by agent Kujan. Verbal Klint is making up a very details story about what he is being interrogated about. As soon as Verbal is released Kujan realizes that he had been duped. Virbal then enlightens the viewers that he is the notorious non gimpy criminal called Kaiser Sosa.<br/><br/>This movie really doesn't have a parity that I am aware of. It is unique, intriguing and keeps you mentally engaged throughout the movie. One quote and really the central theme to this movie is: ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn't exist""."
"kjarvis1212","10","1","1","9 February 2012"," Possibly The Greatest Crime Drama Ever Made
","Rarely does a film of any genre rise to the level of perfection achieved in The Usual Suspects. The ultimate goal of any whodunit is to keep the audience guessing right up until the very end, perhaps even never quite answering the question with absolute certainty. This movie hits the proverbial bullseye with mind boggling precision. Someone jacks a truck loaded with guns in New York City but police have no leads. So they bring in five of the Big Apple's best known thieves to shake the underworld's tree. But unbeknownst to the police, or our ""suspects,"" there are greater forces at play. When it's all said and done, LAPD, NYPD, and the feds are left sifting through an abandoned cargo ship in an L.A. harbor with lots of bodies but not much else. All they have to go on is the shaky story of a talkative small-time crook named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for the role), and a dying victim of the shootout who claims to have seen the devil incarnate on the ship, a legendary criminal kingpin whose name sends shivers up the spines of police and lawbreakers alike. It may not sound like much, but every aspect of this film comes off so astoundingly well, from the morose cinematography and foreboding score, to the impeccable performances by its stars (Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benicio Del Toro as the ""suspects"" and Chazz Palminteri as the federal agent trying to piece their story together), The Usual Suspects concludes with a classic stunner that only adds to its reputation as one of the greatest crime dramas ever filmed, if not the best ever."

","I remember when I saw the movie for the first time. I was about 13 or 14 years old. My brother and I watched free TV it was Saturday evening. We were zapping around till we came on the channel were ""The Usual Suspects"" were running. At this time i liked Thrillers and now i love it. So we watched it and enjoyed it from the beginning -- Till the ending came and we were astonished. From them I checked always the the TV Channels if the movie comes again. But i just saw it once on Free TV about 4 years later. After it i bought it on DVD and till today i watched it over 50 times.<br/><br/>For normal viewers it is just a normal thriller with gangster nothing special so the most of my friends never seen this movie so far. I told them a few times to watch it but never did. I don't care.<br/><br/>It also was when the first SCARY MOVIE came to the cinema and they imitated the ending from the Usual Suspects. You can believe me. The Cinema was stacked. But I was the only one who comprehend the ending. That was really awkward. <br/><br/>Just to say. Everyone who saw this movie, loves it. He knows the name Keyser Soze. The movie is cult, it is legendary and for me the best movie ever."

This could be Kevin Spacey's best performance and very much deserved to win best supporting actor. The ending is possibly one of the most mind blowing, unsuspecting, and by far the greatest thing in all of movies. You get told all the information but then all of a sudden the writers throw a right-hand and knocks you right off track. My jaw dropped and I was speechless after watching this. If there was something that could ever top this movie it deserves to win every award that has ever been made. There was too much that was thrilling, suspenseful and jaw dropping that is worth every minute of your life. Now it's understandable why I could watch this movie 15 times and never get tired of it!"
"MoniBlankenship","10","1","1","10 December 2010"," Review: The Usual Suspects
","The Usual Suspects is a twisty thriller with a dizzying storyline. The story is very manipulative, demands the viewer's full attention, constantly slithers around the characters, and boils until reaches its unexpected climax. The screenplay is structured as a complex puzzle and refuses to divulge any clues to its solution until the final piece is in place. The film is both challenging and rewarding. It plays with the audience's expectation until the very end when the viewer is finally rewarded by finding out about who Keyser Soze really is. <br/><br/>The story is told via the narration and point of view of one of the suspects Verbal Kint (by Kevin Spacey) through flashbacks. The plot is about five cons, Kint, Keaton (by Gabriel Byrne), McManus (by Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (by Kevin Pollack), and Fenster (by Benicio Del Toro), that are trickily brought together to do a suicidal job for a mysterious figure, Keyser Soze, that will pay them $91 million. The central theme revolves around the mystical man, Soze, who is linked to the devil in the film. However, as the story prolongs, it is not clear whether he is a real person or just a legend. <br/><br/>I watched the full screen version of the movie that delivers a sharp and beautifully defined image. The cinematography features drastic lighting and camera angles to create more or less tension for the scenes. Most of the scenes are played at night giving the film a dark sinister feel. Dark and bright lights accentuate on the drama and tension of the story, low-key lights give a dreary effect. The film features lots of bright white over the head shots. Tension is also created by extreme close-ups. The combination of lighting and camera shots create a shadowy underworld background. The low angle camera shots used to help the audience to understand the helplessness of the character. For example, in the opening scene a big part of the screen is covered by a man, whose identity remains a mystery until the very end, holding a gun on Keaton. Low camera angle accentuates on the height difference between the unknown man and Keaton, who is about to be killed. The low angle shots also emphasize on the importance and power of the unknown man in this scene. The audience only sees a portion of the mystery man and only from behind which adds to his secretive character. <br/><br/>The cinematography also features an interesting interplay of colors, from the bright red shirt of Fenster to the dark color room scenes.<br/><br/>The final scene, where everything comes together, is completely dependent on visuals and requires the viewer's full attention. The ending makes the audience want to see the movie again to explore the story-line for further understanding of the complicated labyrinth of the plot.<br/><br/>The musical score driving the movie reinforces the story and instills even greater emotions in the audience. The score makes the climax of the film even more shocking. The tone of music creates a mysteries atmosphere. Slow songs represent sadness and faster beat represents action. <br/><br/>Two other movies that I could link The Usual Suspects to are Reservoir Dogs and Identity. There are also a group of criminals brought together in Reservoir Dogs to do a job. Identity, just like The Usual Suspects, features lots of twists and turns with an unexpected ending. <br/><br/>In conclusion, The Usual Suspects is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The multi-level plot structure assures that the viewer can find something new at each watch. The farther the movie goes, the more the audience realizes that not everything is what it seems. The plot circles around and keeps building and building before it hits the mark keeping the viewer pinned to their chair."

Second time you see Kevin Spacey in police station - you see him examining the bulletin board. Same performance, different point of view.<br/><br/>I must have watched this film 20+ times now, and still try to figure out exactly what went on - I now think I'll never know. Because Kevin Spacey is telling the story - it could ALL be lies, but some of it MUST be true (eg The body being found on the beach - is it as he says or some other guy he's offed and uses this story to cover up?<br/><br/>I've just read the lowest reviews of this film, and Wow..., Just... Wow. Comparing this to Scream is like comparing Sherlock Holmes to CSI. They both solve crimes right? No. And I think these people are doing this film a grave disservice or are a bit miffed that they didn't guess the end. I guessed Screams killers no problem, the fact that she got chased up the stairs and then instantly attacked in the upstairs room gave away the fact there's 2 killers.. from then on its easy elimination. (my dear watson =) ) This is a completely different game than scream - its not even in the same ballpark as scream as far as films go. (I like Scream BTW) Its like comparing Scream to Goodfellas. Totally different films and genres. As for the guy that thought that this film was rubbish because 80% wasn't exactly as you saw on screen, but thought fight Club was, well .... Maybe you should watch fight club again, and try to stay awake for the ending this time eh?<br/><br/>END SPOILERS!<br/><br/>This is one of the few films that gets better every time you watch it.

"tom_owens_182","9","1","1","25 May 2010"," Brilliant, engaging and entertaining.
","The Usual Suspects is a mix of mystery, action and film-making at it's finest. It truly is genius.<br/><br/>The plot of 'The Usual Suspects' essentially consists of two stories. It starts in the middle, because the basis of the film (the major event) happens within the first 10 minutes. The first story is the build up to this action. The second story is what happens afterwards. The two stories start at different ends and work towards the middle. The result is a fantastically interesting and articulate plot which results in the all characters (including the audience) trying to piece together the pieces of the puzzle.<br/><br/>The Non-liner structure I thought worked, but only to a certain degree. I have to say that it was not the best non-linear film I have seen. I still prefer Memento in terms of arrangement. However, as I have said, the process of working towards the middle really worked in a murder mystery film. I can't think of too many other films like it. With the exception of Reservoir Dogs and although I am sure that the film is not a copy, it is very similar to Reservoir Dogs in it's layout and style. The major difference being that you see the action that took place in the usual suspects and you don't in Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>Another thing to mention is that mystery films do not always work best with non-linear structures. I believe the reason that memento worked was because it turned out that thee was no mystery in a twist ending, it was merely personal vendetta. However in this film, it does become confusing at times and can lose some audience members. I much prefer mystery presented in a linear pattern. For example, I shall use Sherlock Holmes (my dear Watson). In the Holmes novels, the mystery is presented in pattern where the reader begins to solve the case at the same time as Sherlock Holmes. Making it more interesting and engaging. I just felt that the non-linear structure didn't have this attraction.<br/><br/>Another things to mention is that all the acting is universally brilliant. I don't say that lightly either, but I totally bought the reality of the characters, without meaning to add favouritism, Kevin Spacey was just fantastic in his role. For not being a method actor I was amazed on the realism he managed to bring to the character in terms of his body movement and vocal style.<br/><br/>Finally, what can be said about the end? Well, as far as I am concerned, it was one of the best twists I have seen in modern cinema. I can guarantee that 90% of the people who watch this film will not guess the true ending. It is such a great twist that is so cleverly paced out that it puts Reservoir Dogs to shame.<br/><br/>The film is guaranteed to please, if you're a fan of Tarantino movies, or for that matter, mystery films, then watching this film should be mandatory. Not questions asked.<br/><br/>Brilliant.<br/><br/>9/10."

","Every bad review of this film can be summed in one question: ""what's the point of watching the entire movie if it's all just made up?!"" <br/><br/>The problem with this view is, of course, that it fails to appreciate that The Usual Suspects is a MOVIE. Every movie has a narrator. Some narrators tell part of the story by talking (e.g. The Shawshank Redemption). Some tell part of the story by writing (e.g. Star Wars). The vast majority of narrators don't talk or write, they just show--no voice over, no text at the bottom of the screen saying ""Somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean."" A few movies have a narrator within the narration. The Princess Bride, for example, tells the story of a grandfather telling a story. We appreciate the story-within-a-story plot of that film because it draws us in from the beginning.<br/><br/>But one thing that all these movies have in common is that they're movies. They are fictional stories told through a visual/auditory medium. The fact that none of it is true doesn't make a movie any less spectacular. Take Saving Private Ryan for example--does it take away from the movie knowing that the story behind it is completely fabricated? <br/><br/>This is what the naysayers tend to miss about The Usual Suspects--like any movie, it tells a fiction...but UNLIKE most other movies, this one goes a step further and ADMITS that the whole story was made up. That is, the ""outer"" narrator (the all-seeing, all-knowing camera), shows you that the ""inner"" narrator (Verbal) was lying through his nose.<br/><br/>This doesn't make the film worse...it makes it better. It reminds the viewer how gullible people are. The living proof is the people who criticize the movie for not being clear about what really happened. As if ""what really happened"" really happened. Newsflash: it didn't...this is fiction.<br/><br/>Of the many reasons why The Usual Suspects is a great movie, here's the one that I'm trying to point out with this post: The film makes you believe that it is a story about a master criminal. Then you find out that it's a story about a master storyteller (who just happens to be a master criminal)."

Even now that I've seen is several times I'm not 100% sure what is true and what is misdirection.<br/><br/>The cast all do a great job, especially Gabriel Byrne as the charismatic ex-corrupt police officer Dean Keaton who is trying to go straight after a life of crime, Pete Postlethwaite as the mysterious Kobayashi and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, a crippled con artist who is explaining what happened to the authorities (and us) what may have happened in the run up to his arrest.<br/><br/>The film opens in the aftermath of a battle on a boat in a harbour in Los Angeles, there are only two know survivors; Verbal and a badly burnt Hungarian. Dave Kujan, a US customs officer, is sure that Keaton masterminded the attack and has escaped so he interviews Verbal who has done a deal with the police and is soon to be released. Verbal tells a tale of how the group met up when they were all hauled in by the NYPD for a robbery and put in a line up together. There they plan a job to get back at the police before heading to LA to lie low and to fence their ill-gotten gains. Here they are approached by Kobayashi, a lawyer claiming to work for Keyser Soze, a mysterious character who strikes fear into the hearts of criminals even though none have actually met him. Kobayashi explains that they must do one job for Mr Soze. All this is told us by Verbal so we never really know if he is telling the truth, and if he is lying is it to protect himself, his friend Keaton or perhaps he is just making up a story for his own personal amusement while awaiting release.<br/><br/>The story is brilliantly told and it is rightly considered a modern classic, if you haven't seen it yet then I strongly recommend watching it... twice! Although even then you'll not fully understand what has happened."

","The Usual Suspects. The name didn't interest me and so did the cast. But I wanted to give it a try as it was a crime movie. Generally, I never watch a movie more than five times even though if its perfectly made and this movie is an exception. I have watched it completely for 23 times and I still long for more.<br/><br/>Firstly, all the actors put up a brilliant performance. I have never heard of Kevin Spacey before in my life and after watching this movie I have become a revered worshiper of his. Ah!, how he acts through the movie. It's pleasing to see him act and when the Final twist is revealed one will definitely applaud for his wonderful, stunning performance.<br/><br/>In fact this little movie houses the best Climax EVER in history. Strictly speaking this movie can only be enjoyed after repeated viewing.<br/><br/>Pete Postlethwaite is brilliant as Kobayashi, Keyser Soze's aide. Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Paliminteri and Stephen Baldwin put up a memorable show.<br/><br/>The revelation of the story is simply super. The way the story unfolds from a normal crime thriller to a great master-piece should simply be seen. In fact, this is one movie where the power of the villain is felt without actually filming or portraying the villain in action. A great movie to be watched and in my opinion its the best movie ever made!!<br/><br/>Hail!, The Usual Suspects!! A perfect ten on ten!!"
"weekly-movie-review","9","1","1","14 January 2009"," Although Bryan Singer has directed some pretty good movies.....
","Although Bryan Singer has directed some pretty good movies (X-Men, X2, Valkyrie, Apt Pupil), nothing comes close to this masterpiece. The intricate storyline follows a cop (Chazz Palminteri) trying to solve the mystery of the identity of a mysterious and very feared Keyser Söze. The suspects include a strong cast consisting of Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollack, and Kevin Spacey. The film is strong in every area: soundtrack, sound effects, visual effects, etc., but its legend comes from its superb writing, both in dialogue and plot. This is a very fun flick to watch time and time again and is probably necessary to watch more than once in order to piece together the complicated mystery."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","1","2 December 2008"," The very definition of a movie you have to watch twice
","""The Usual Suspects"" starts out just like a crime film, but evolves into an almost classic mystery. It's the kind of film you need to watch twice in a relatively short period of time to truly understand the script's mastery. I've seen the film twice, but years apart, so my insight into the tremendous cinematic achievement of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie is there but limited.<br/><br/>""Suspects"" is derived from a concept of a line-up of hardened criminals who have been brought in not with any evidence, but just because they are ""the usual suspects."" Their union, however, soon finds them all on a job that ends up with a giant boat explosion and only two survivors, one of them being only one of the criminals, ""Verbal"" Kint (Spacey) a constantly rambling cripple who must explain the entire situation to the police. The story is told almost entirely from Kint's perspective, which already adds a shade of suspicion to the plot.<br/><br/>The film lines up in strong cast with Spacey including Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Toro and Chazz Palminteri. Their characters, especially the criminals, all add an interesting dynamic to the film, keeping all the scenes interesting when the greater mystery is really the film's greatest asset.<br/><br/>McQuarrie has lined the script full of gems so carefully that when he unloads one of the best twist endings in cinematic history, you are slapped across the face and filled with absolute glee. There's no other way to put it. Credit for this also should go to Singer and Spacey. There's no question that Singer's direction keeps up the intensity. It romanticizes the criminal lifestyle a bit, but it's necessary. Spacey's incredible portrayal of Kint, not only in his mannerisms but in his dramatic highs and lows keeps the storytelling engaging too.<br/><br/>You simply have to watch this film and then watch it again. Then you will unquestionably like it to some degree. If you need a heavy dose of action in all your crime films, that degree will be lesser. This movie does rely heavily on script and character to keep your attention. However, as far as pure mystery goes, you can't beat ""The Usual Suspects."""

Else you ll have to go through the second time to make some sense of the end. Singer stands out with the best on this...<br/><br/>Kevin spacey is the standout performer in this movie... Even though everyone else chips in and plays their roles flawlessly....

","After hearing people rave about this movie I finally managed to watch this movie a couple of months ago. I have to admit it the first time I disliked it, I probably wasn't concentrating. The second time I absolutely loved it. The usual suspect is fantastic twisty thriller backed up by wonderful performances from all the main leads.It seems hard to imagine thatthe writer of The Usual Suspects was only twenty four when he wrote it.Kevin Spacey in my opinion completely stole the show. Even though I knew whatthe final twist was it did hinder me from appreciating it. What is so amazing is how the writer managed to skillfully put in clues that could lead us to a conclusion but the references are so slight we might not notice it. It seems to have inspired other movies with twists at the end that leave your head spinning, for instance The Sixth Sense. The Usual Suspects in my opinion is the best thriller of the 90's."

Before watching this film, I had never really sat at the edge of my seat all the way through a movie: I did with this one. I was hooked from start to finish. <br/><br/>The film doesn't just have one of the best endings of all time, but the actual body of the film is virtually flawless. I have watched this film over 20 times and I'm still finding new things in the movie that I didn't pick up before!! Everything about this film was of a very high standard, especially the cast- Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey and Pete Postlethwaite to name but a few. <br/><br/>To highlight what a great film this is, it's been mentioned in many screen writing books as a study case. It has so many twists turns, not only in the storyline but in the relationships between the characters.<br/><br/>This is a must see film for anyone who loves films, as it really shows how a film should be made."

OK...sometimes you do get off the beaten path and take an exit you didn't expect, But it's still point A to point B.<br/><br/>This movie, however, takes all the back roads, some of them unpaved and very bumpy, some of them narrow and curvy, and some of them downright scary! I am not going to give away ANYTHING in this movie, because I believe it would be a disservice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie before. I will only say that it's one of the best whodunits I have ever seen! Kevin Spacey is spectacular with his understated performance. He and the rest of the cast work magic with this wonderful script.<br/><br/>The cinematography, while not being sweeping vistas, move the story along nicely, and the score is foreboding, without obviously leading you.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I figured a key point out before it was revealed.<br/><br/>What that key point is, I'm not going to say!"

It was when you found out about Kaiser Sozar that I began to become exited with this movie. From then on to the very end of the movie I realized why this movie is supposed to be a cult classic. The acting was great from Kevin Spacey and the movie was interesting and suspenseful. I also enjoyed Stephen Baldwins cool character. I also enjoyed they end of the story when they were on the boat with the Hungarian Mafia and all of the mysterious deaths. After that the very ending was just the cherry on the cake it was overall a great movie and a noticeable cult classic."
"juanbuddha","10","1","1","31 August 2005"," A great film in all ways
","It's so pleasing to know that great films are still being made, if even on an far too infrequent basis. The Usual Suspects please on so many levels its hard to put into words. Bryan Singer comes out of nowhere to direct only his SECOND feature film and hits a home run. While he's now quite famous from his work on the X-Men films, what he did with the Usual Suspects is far beyond any expectations that could have been placed on him. Christopher McQuarrie (who also worked with Singer on his first film) also comes out of nowhere to write a script so well thought out and put together its sad to think he's only turned out an indie and Way of the Gun since. And lastly, the cast are terrific. Top to bottom (even Baldwin) are great. Benicio Del Toro steals every scene he is in with his awkward, mumbling way of talking. And this really marked the start of Kevin Spacey's ascent into A list stardom in Hollywood. In addition to his standout performance in this film, he quickly followed it with parts in Seven, A Time to Kill and LA Confidential. If you're looking for one of the great films of the 90s, you've found it."

Everyone has been telling me about the movie and now after all that fuss I've seen it with my own eyes.<br/><br/>The acting is exceptional. In all sense, it captures the attention and pulls you right into the action. You feel the whole movie developing around you and you understand everything. However in this movie we see that what we do not see is true.<br/><br/>The scenario is also well built. The notion of power has been widely depressed on us as well as on the characters. There is a story inside a story and it is all about power. And the better thing is, as long as you believe, the power is where your beliefs are.<br/><br/>This is surely a must-see movie regarding the movie. It is a must-must-see regarding the acting.

But when the end of this movie came around; I was pacing the floor in front of my TV in total disbelief. I had to replay the ending again, it was that amazing. Everything was there, all of the evidence, but it was hidden very well. If there were more movies like this the film industry would not be in as much trouble as it claims to be.

Behind it all is the mysterious and dangerous Keyser Soze. Bryan Singer's criminal saga is haunting and clever, and well cast.  Kevin Spacey turns in a great performance as Verbal, setting an oddball tone.  The rest of the crew is headed by Gabriel Byrne's Dean Keaton, with thugs Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro and Stephen Baldwin along for the ride.  This crew of five shows great clashing chemistry.

"Pedro_H","7","1","1","11 September 2003"," Entertaining enough thriller, but treats common-sense with reckless disregard.
","A group of criminals are brought in for questioning about a crime, but from the manner in which they are thrown together it is clear - even to the criminals themselves - that something is a-foot.<br/><br/>A classic example of how different the world of film is to the world of literature. If this was a book the publisher would ask ""how drunk were you when you wrote this?"" Thankfully film has music, acting (the best thing here) and special effects to distract the viewer. And this film does a fair-to-middling job. <br/><br/>Here we have a film that doesn't so much contain holes, but is more one giant hole. However in this big hole we have various smaller holes! At an early stage one of the characters smells-a-rat, but carries on regardless! Excuse me, but if you want to present someone as a ""master criminal"" this hardly helps your case!<br/><br/>Credit other reviewers for going through the nonsense and holes on a blow-by-blow basis (although technically a spoiler); but achieving what is intended here, through the method employed, is as silly as anything I have seen in a serious film. <br/><br/>Even if you think this film is great - and plenty do - you have to agree that it somewhat lacks real-world credibility. It may have a twist ending, but when you have confused the living daylights out of any sensible and logical person (and yes I do know flashbacks are not always the truth!) then a song and dance finale wouldn't have made any less sense."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","14 July 2001"," A clever con game - but the con is on you
","***MAJOR SPOILER WARNING***<br/><br/>NOTE: I am trying to think of a nice way to write this review while staying mum about the facts and I think that I have done my best.  But if you are reading this with the intent on seeing it, it may be a good idea to stop here and wait until afterwards.  I wrote this to contest those who highly praised the film.<br/><br/>`The Usual Suspects' sets itself up as a puzzling thriller that demands your complete attention (which it does), it lays all the pieces on the table but comes up with an ending that feels like manipulation.<br/><br/>The story begins on a ship that has been ripped apart by an explosion leaving only two survivors: one seriously burned and muttering about someone named Keyser Soze and the other is an innocent-looking club-footed man named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey).  Kint sits in the office of detective Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and begins to spell out the entire story of the past few days.<br/><br/>It seems that sometime earlier he was arrested along with a mixed bag of criminals (Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro and Stephen Baldwin) who end up in the same cell and begin to talk over plans to steal a fortune in Cocaine from this Keyser Soze person.  Soze, as Verbal tells it, is a Hungarian mob boss so frightening that the mere mention of his name strikes terror in the hearts of even the most hardened criminals.  No one seems to have ever seen Soze except Mr. Kobayaschi (Pete Postelthwaite) who steps in late in the film to lay out a story about how Soze murdered his own family to keep the mob from getting their hands on them.<br/><br/>I got all the facts of the story but I found that they didn't add up to much.  Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie come up with a closing scene that seems to pull the rug out from under everything.  In that, I felt that the movie had wasted my time with a lot of unnecessary fiction on Verbal's part.<br/><br/>I didn't see `The Usual Suspects' in a movie theater but waited until the video release and that's probably just as well because if you are like me, you tend to miss certain things the first time around.  I felt that the best way to see the film would be in front of my television with my thumb on the rewind button so that if I didn't get certain facts, I could go back and listen harder.  Doing this, I got a tighter grip on the facts but ultimately I was left feeling rather cheated.  <br/><br/>Rating: *½ (of four)"

Similarly, the direction also takes a while to warm up, although Kevin Spacey overcomes the awkward handling and won a Supporting Actor Oscar. Spacey, who often strikes an indifferent presence on-screen, is eerily haughty here and almost removed from the surroundings, yet his actorly tics are colorful and he works his hypnotic eyes with quiet drive.

But this is no ordinary interrogation; what we find out here may be the end of normalcy as we know it. And I don't just mean what we find out about Keyser Soze (whether early on or at the end); this movie has more twists and turns than Lombard St. With perfect performances from Spacey and Palminteri - and from Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and Dan Hedaya - this is one movie that you can't afford to miss.<br/><br/>Every time when I'm talking about this movie with someone, I start...well, doing what we find out about at the movie's end.

Once you realize that, there are only 1 or 2 persons that could be, and that list becomes one person well before the ending.

And I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have seen. Kevin Spacey is the most amazing actor I have ever seen. Him and Gabriel are wonderful. The ending is incredable. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It's worth a watch, then another watch, then another watch. You kind of have to pay attention. :D<br/><br/>10/10"

","The Usual Suspects has a great cast and good scenes, but falls short of it being spectacular for it's ending. I love to watch the film and I believe it is much easier to do than most would like to think. The ending is more about surprise, not suspense. Thses days films are more concerned with plot twists than not making sure they make any sense (""Along Came a Spider""). In the old hitchcocks, the film would go deeper into character and motives. Just because a film susrprises you, doesn't mean it deserves every award on the planet. Example, compare ""Scream"" to ""Psycho,"" and you'll get the idea. However, The Usual Suspects does answer one question, the most intriguing one, and that's why everyone loves it. And the film is just plain fun. This noir has comdey action and some suspense towards the end. You're drawn in to the world of these characters because of the intriguing and almost-mythical Keyser Soze. it's only entertainment to me, nothing more. After seeing this movie, I dare you to try to write down what actually happened and the motives of each character. Maybe you'll only get two or three motives."
"Quinoa1984","6","9","29","8 December 2004"," Good film, but over-rated from my perspective
","Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a clever (if not too clever) film that showcases some good actors in a better than average cops and robbers movie. Unfortunately, Singer brings some flaws (not immense, after all, how would Christopher McQuarie win a Oscar for his screenplay is the film's flaws weren't immense). That includes a ending twist that negates the whole film.<br/><br/>Still, there are many good things in this film, including fine performances from Stephen Baldwin (surprisingly so), Benicio Del-Torro, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmienteri, and Kevin Spacey (his first Oscar he earned for).

","Hands up everyone who thought that the solution to `Murder on the Orient Express' was clever, fair and satisfying.  I see.  Two of you.  Hands up everyone who thought it was an outrageous cheat.  (The author raises his hand.)  Well, people in the first camp MIGHT think that `The Usual Suspects' is clever, fair and satisfying, even though it's even more of an outrageous cheat.  If you want a good twist, stick to old Agatha, or to those of her works that play fair - `Witness for the Prosecution' (1957) and `Endless Night' (1971) are particularly good screen versions - or try ... I don't know, any number of things.  `The Spanish Prisoner' (1997), for instance. It not only plays fair: it also paces itself correctly.  For that's the other problem with `The Usual Suspects' - we are fed no intriguing information whatever as we go along.  Even referring to the few surprises as `twists' is generous.  The film opens with a confrontation, followed by an explosion, on a boat, and from then on we listen to one of the characters narrating events leading up to this explosion - and he takes FOREVER.  It feels as if he's saying, `And then we had to kill a bit more time before we got to the boat exploding, so we robbed a bank.  Then we went to the beach.' If we weren't so busy glancing at our watches while waiting for the denouement, we'd be bored stiff.<br/><br/>The ending had BETTER be worth it, we think - and it turns out to be one of the weakest (and did I mention it's a cheat?) in the history of cinema. Usually, after the killer revelation, our minds are abuzz.  `Of course!' we think.  `THAT'S why the ring was on her left hand - because if she hadn't been to France, where else could they hide the microfilm?'  But `The Usual Suspects' leaves one feeling flat.  There's nothing to think about.  While it's impossible to work out what happened, it's all too easy to come up with consistent theories about what happened, and any one of these theories is about as good as the rest of them.<br/><br/>Damn it - I really want to play the Grinch who stole Christmas and TELL you what happens at the end, just so that you'll know I'm right.<br/><br/>One final point - the title is an allusion to a line from `Casblanca'.  We can spot the allusion pretty early on.  Pay no attention to it.  It is NOT, as you might expect, a subtle hint to the audience; nor is it cunning misdirection.  It's just an attempt to be smart."
"Batterupdp","10","3","7","3 July 2006"," one of my favorite movies!!!
","The Usual Suspects is hands down one of the best movies ever. It is one of those movies where you don't realize what you've seen until the end. The story is flawless and leaves you on the edge of your seat, which explains why it won a best original screenplay Oscar. The film is Directed by Bryan Singer (in his second picture).<br/><br/>The usual suspects has great ensemble cast. However, the one that shines the most is Kevin Spacey(who won a best supporting actor Oscar for the role)Spacey plays the cripple Verbal Kintwho is the only survivor of the boat incident. The film is told through the verbals flashbacks. Verbal flashbacks tell the story of 5 criminals who meet in a line up, which they think was no coincidence. The 5 criminals decide to pull a couple cons together, but when a they learn that a under ground drug-lord could be pulling the strings things start going terribly wrong.<br/><br/>The one thing I don't understand is why this movie did not get nominated for a best picture or director academy award. I love this movie you have to see it if you haven't already , you have too."

"FatPhil","6","3","7","6 October 2002"," Two good actors, one good twist, everything else poor
","I'm amazed that everyone raves about this film, I found it most annoying. Fortunately the last 10 minutes make the film worth watching, but still only enough to pull back up from the doldrums into a middling kind of position.<br/><br/>Let's face it, the acting, on the whole, was useless. The only two exceptions would be the two who spend the most time in the office together having their ""I'm smarter than you"" battle (Verbal and Kujan). And neither of those were in any way challenging roles. I have nothing against Spacey, but that was _not_ demanding enough to be Oscar material.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, it looked like lots of stuff was just thrown into the mix for the sake of it, not for any concrete coherent reason. My girlfriend and I played ""guess the next country mentioned"", after about 20 minutes, when we realised that the writer was just trying to make the thing sound as big and international as possible. Where were that Arabs? When I thought there'd be Arabs, there were Argentinians. When I thought there'd be Indians, there were Japanese. So I was wrong with my guesses, but I knew the unimaginative, yes unimaginative, writer would try to throw some more random countries into the plot for no good reason at all - and I was right. At least there was a brief mention of Pakistan, which made my girlfriend's guess partially right. (I remember playing ""guess the next death method"" in the Omen trilogy too, old habits die hard.)<br/><br/>It's a film that's worth seeing exactly twice. Once to get bored to for an hour or so, and then have the fun of the twist at the end. The second time is to see if you were ""missing the point"" for the first hour of the first viewing, and conclude that you probably weren't, it is actually pretty tedious as you first thought.<br/><br/>If you want twists, then Fight Club is head and shoulders beyond this."

"dee.reid","10","2","4","18 July 2015"," ""The Usual Suspects"" is not the *Usual* mid-1990s crime-thriller...
","I have a strange history with the 1995 neo-noir crime-thriller ""The Usual Suspects.""<br/><br/>I saw the film for the first time when I was in middle school; I remember being thoroughly impressed with the picture and I may (or may not) have rented it a few times from Blockbuster Video (I entered middle school in the late 1990s). And then I never really saw it again, but I do remember that ""The Usual Suspects"" always stuck with me, even if 15 years has passed since I last saw it. And then on a whim, I watched the movie again today. My opinion has not changed on this movie at all, but today's viewing has only reaffirmed my glowing praise for this picture.<br/><br/>The other reason that this movie stuck with me for so long was because this film made the reputation of its director, a then-29-year-old Bryan Singer. I came to know Bryan Singer through his work on the ""X-Men"" movies - ""X-Men"" (2000) and its superior sequel, ""X2"" (2003). Although I won't go into the details why, I've long been a fan of the X-Men superhero team and I've long believed that Singer - through certain aspects of his personal background - was the perfect director for the first two films in that series and he brought those particular aspects of his personal background to make those films his own. That is something I'll always be thankful to him for, and ""X2"" is my personal favorite film that he's ever done (if not necessarily his best).<br/><br/>But still, let's go back to the film that started it all for Bryan Singer...<br/><br/>Let me just say that I consider ""The Usual Suspects"" to be the best crime-thriller of the '90s. Yes, I said it, ""The Usual Suspects"" is even better than ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994); while I like Quentin Tarantino, I've never truly liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and have considered that to be Tarantino's weakest effort - yet Tarantino won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, so he obviously did something right. I don't think that it's any coincidence that a year after Tarantino won his first Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for his script for ""The Usual Suspects,"" which I obviously feel is the better of the two. I've just found ""The Usual Suspects"" to be far more inventive - and watchable - in its story and characters, and complex and involving story-line.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is one of the most compelling, original, frightening, and (occasionally) blackly humorous thrillers ever made, with one of the greatest, and shocking, plot twists in cinematic history. The film begins in the aftermath of a mysterious ship explosion and firefight in San Pedro Bay in Los Angeles, California. The police arrest cripple and con man Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his performance here), who was only one of two survivors. While being interrogated by U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), Kint reveals that six weeks earlier in New York City, he and four other small-time criminals - Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt ex-cop who's since been trying to go straight; professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin); McManus's partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro); and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a hijacker and explosives expert - were arrested and interrogated by the New York City Police Department on trumped-up charges in connection to a gun shipment robbery.<br/><br/>Kint goes on to further explain a rich and complicated back-story, in which the five of them enter into a series of complex criminal schemes that eventually brings the attention of a mysterious crime figure named ""Keyser Soze,"" whose criminal exploits and ruthless reputation are so feared that he has earned a near-mythical status in the criminal underworld. It all leads to a shocking revelation of just who it is that's been pulling the five men's strings the whole time - Keyser Soze, or someone else?<br/><br/>I have to admit that I loved every moment of ""The Usual Suspects."" This movie definitely earned every bit of praise heaped upon it by the mainstream and independent movie press upon its release in 1995; just as an aside, this film was released into theaters three days after my tenth birthday in 1995. Kevin Spacey earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor here in one of the great performances of the '90s. Though the work of the four principal actors cannot be discounted - Gabriel Byrne is by far the most sympathetic of the quintet as their de-facto, albeit highly reluctant, leader, Dean Keaton; Stephen Baldwin (whom I personally took the greatest liking to) as Michael McManus and this is probably his best-known film role before his career took a hit in the late '90s and early 2000s; Benicio Del Toro as the mangled-English-speaking Fred Fenster, who would go on to become an Oscar-winner himself in just a few short years (for ""Traffic"" in 2000); and Kevin Pollak as the one true common-man of the group, Todd Hockney.<br/><br/>Neo-noir crime-thrillers were big in the 1990s after ""Pulp Fiction"" almost single-handedly reinvented the cinematic medium; ""The Usual Suspects,"" with its gripping story and characters, and snappy dialogue, was the next (and arguably) greatest thing to come from that era. It's a brilliant, mesmerizing viewing experience from a film-making team that struck cinematic gold. And how can anyone not mention John Ottman's touching, occasionally brooding and mysterious film score? I just had to mention that also before I finally close this out.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is certainly not your ""Usual"" mid-1990s thriller...<br/><br/>10/10"
"long78","5","2","4","7 May 2013"," a movie about stereotypes
","The Usual Suspects (1995) is a movie about stereotypes. The theme focuses on ideas and the social problems of the police investigations. A crime is committed and first group of suspects the police bring in to question are the men who have formerly committed crimes and are automatically assumed to be involved with the current incident. When the five men are brought in, they decide to collaborate on a scheme to teach the police a lesson. Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) is a crippled con artist. Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) was a former corrupt police officer. Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin) had a bad temper that got him into trouble along with his partner, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro). Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) is the last of the five ""usual suspects"".<br/><br/>The lighting in The Usual Suspects is effective because it fits the criminal activity going on. A bunch of criminals meeting in a dark alley just gives it that ""typical"" feel. They are sneaking around at night, or after dark, to put the plan into motion. Admittedly, it would be easier to hijack a ship in the dark than in broad daylight, when someone could see you coming.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Verbal narrates the situations and orchestrates the entire collaborative event. His voice is very calm and soothing. It sounds as if he is an innocent victim. Verbal was portrayed as a ""poor"" crippled man that was just a victim of circumstance. As it turns out, he was very intelligent and could think very quickly on his feet. As the scheme to fool the cops plays out, the other four men are disposed of and Verbal is in the detective's office being grilled and yelled at. The detective is hot on his trail and knows something is awry. The detective is not buying his story about him not know what was going on and insisted he knew more information about Keyser SÃ–ze than what he was telling. After being released, because they did not have enough evidence, the detective begins to see the full picture. As the truth comes together, it is too late. <br/><br/>The multiple layers in this movie make it difficult to follow at times. It is definitely a suspenseful thriller, but not really a believable true event. The point is well proved; people are not what you think they are based on how they are stereotyped."

","Say what you will about this low-budget Oscar winning hit-but if you were lucky enough to catch it initially on the big-screen then you know what I mean. It opens up with the tail end of a massacre on boat just before being lit up to flames. We then end up in interrogation room with Verbal Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) telling the cops how he ended up on the boat. At this point the movie seems to pick up the events (mostly) in the order they happened until those crucial moments on the horrific ship. As Verbal goes into detail how him and four other ex-cons were wrongfully detained for questioning 6 weeks earlier and ended up working together 'taking jobs.' There's Keeton (Gabriel Byrne) who is looking for way out and go straight, Finster (Benicio Del Toro who really started his career here literally) whose horrible accent brings a lot of laughs but basically pals around his convict hot headed buddy McMannis(Stephen Baldwin). Then there's Hockney(Kevin Pollock)whose comedic input serves the tone well especially since he really plays the angry smart ass of the gang. I really don't want to type too much else cause either A most of you know the story even if you haven't seen it or B you've seen it. What I really wanted to say about this movie is that people who don't like it are people who never really got it or people who have not seen the whole thing from the beginning.

"DeeNine-2","8","2","4","1 February 2007"," Testosterone thriller cleverly done
","The title might suggest a comedic takeoff on a crime thriller employing some sophisticated shtick or maybe we're in for something like Danny DeVito in ""Throw Mama from the Train."" But this is not a comedy. It is not exactly your usual crime thriller either. It is an unconscious parody of crime thrillers with some curious depth replete with corrupt cops, shadowy off screen sinister villains and pathetic low lifes.<br/><br/>Although I don't think director Bryan Singer and his high school pal and collaborator, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie, had the slightest intention toward burlesque, I was again and again struck by an unconscious underlying tone of parody. The title is the tip off.<br/><br/>""Round up the usual suspects"" is a line from Casablanca (1942), as most movie buffs know. Claude Rains, as Captain Renault, head of the police in Casablanca, says ""round up the usual suspects"" more as an indication of local Moroccan justice than as a real order. It is just the sort of cynically ironic line that would inspire Singer and McQuarrie to dream up this exceedingly cynical, but bordering on the funny, flick.<br/><br/>While Casablanca was a bittersweet love story, ""The Usual Suspects"" is anything but. The cast is decidedly and deliberately all male with only Suzy Amis in a minor role as Edie Finneran to interfere with the macho lineup of crooks, cops and shady sinister types. The movie features Stephen Baldwin (Mike McManus), Gabriel Bryne (Dean Keaton), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (Dave Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and stars Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint. These guys are all excellent actors who together create a kind mass energy that propels the film. In more ways than one I am reminded of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) and David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) (movie directed by James Foley). Consider these similarities: In both Glengarry and The Usual Suspects you have a virtually all male cast who sling expletives at one another in an ""at your throat"" style. In both Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects you have five crooks thrown together to do a job, and again everything is exceedingly macho with threats and expletives flying around like water in a hurricane. In all three films the cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Ed Harris, Alex Baldwin, Kevin Spacey and Alan Arkin leading the cast in Glengarry, and Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi doing the same in Reservoir Dogs. These guys are not your run of the mill actors. They are the kind of guys that star in kick butt movies. They know how to look and act authentic.<br/><br/>But an even more startling way to compare The Usual Suspects with Glengarry and Reservoir Dogs is in the dialogue. In all three movies the dialogue is preciously wrought with an emphasis on sounding just a little different. In Reservoir Dogs Tarantino sometimes makes the characters sound like they are spouting Shakespeare, and in Glengarry Glen Ross Mamet has them playing verbal hijinks like machine gun chatter in an experimental stage play. Here Singer and McQuarrie (his script won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) employ a lot of the same rapid fire, seemingly authentic vernacular interspersed with theatrical sounding speech especially in the case of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who calmly calls everybody ""Mister"" like an English butler. And of course Verbal is very verbal and able to spout lines like, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist."" Keep that line in mind as you watch, and ask yourself who plays Keyser Soze, the devil incarnate, so to speak. And pay attention to references to Skokie, Illinois. That will help to unravel the plot. The ending contains a nicely set up surprise.<br/><br/>Currently rated #17 at IMDb, The Usual Suspects is the sort of cult favorite beloved by young males fascinated with testosterone-hyped action, macho-inspired dialogue and devil man care anti-heroics. But it's a little better than that. And clearly this is not a chick flick, and therein lies a problem. While most males will at least find this interesting, many females will just shake their heads at how obvious is the seduction of the targeted audience. Personally I thought the movie was a laugh. I actually laughed out loud at some of the theatrics and grinned with appreciation at how surely Singer had captured the mentality of the targeted audience while bonding with it. But I have to say (for those directors, writers and producers who would like to do half as well), you can't fake it. Tarantino and Singer and others have been able to pull this sort of thing off because they really believe in the psychology. They really believe there are tough guys who say ""f-you"" even with a gun shoved in their face, and there really are guys who see the world in a kind of cops/robbers, good guy/bad guy, buddy/rat persona world. And there's some truth to it.<br/><br/>Spacey won a supporting actor Oscar playing Verbal Kint, a kind of crippled loser, it would seem. He should have won Best Actor, he was that good and he was the heart of the film and the guy with whom the audience most identified. He is the seeming loser, the little guy, the underdog who turns out to be smarter and tougher than anybody else. I think that is what the targeted audience really loves about this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a must see for anybody interested in the history of the American cinema and in the evolution of the mystery/thriller/noir genre. A few academic dissertations have been and will be written on how the cinematic hero has evolved from, say, Tom Mix to Verbal Kint. You might want to write one yourself.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","2","4","28 July 2006"," I imagine this film was superbly effective when it was first released
","Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is easily one of the most original and most talked-about films of the 1990s with a notorious ending-twist. Because of this and the fact that it was being advertised as a run-of-the-mill crime thriller back in 1995, I can only imagine what a shocker it was when no one knew about its surprising turn when walking into the threatre. You bet a lot of people must have spilled out their popcorn. Today, however, some of its riveting effect has subsided as the twist is so well-known and anticipated for new viewers. It becomes the whole film. It's setting itself up to be anti-climactic with such hype, and it just about makes it.<br/><br/>However, The Usual Suspects is, first and foremost, a heist film about five men working together to pull of amazing jobs involving narcotics, money and hits. The story of these heists is told in flashbacks from one of these five men's perspective as he retells it in a police office, the day after they've been caught and killed. Kevin Spacey is this one man and he is definitely an eccentric character, and the way he tells the story is a real thrill -- the tiniest details have been meticulously crafted into the script, crammed with fast dialogue, sprinkled with equal doses of humour and suspense, featuring several story lines and a multitude of characters and names to remember, and it becomes a big mess that you can impossibly keep track of, even with a notepad. Just ask Roger Ebert.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects gets points for being uniquely constructed, and for sending shivers en masse down your spine at the end. But other than this, is it a greatly enjoyable movie? No, not really. It is actually borderline tedious and exhausting at times, and relies solely on its twist to be a good film. Like I say, it just about makes it but this is nothing I'd call the 15th greatest film of all time. <br/><br/>7/10"

","Tips to those who want to have a review before viewing the film / DVD.<br/><br/>1) It's better you don't get any clues (spoilers) from people who have seen it. Enjoy the film till the very end, and you would have seen one of the best suspense / thriller film.<br/><br/>If you already know something about the film - <br/><br/>1) Yes, there is a twist at the end, but that is not the only enjoyable thing in the film. People see the film for the 100th time and still enjoy it :-)<br/><br/>2) If you are trying to guess the twist at the end, while watching, remember one thing. The film shows three things i) the past, ii) present, and iii) the past according to a lead character. Hope this is enough clue, if you want you prove yourself smart.<br/><br/>3) If you want to be surprised, remember that the lead characters including Kevin Spacy were not this popular when the film was released in 1995. <br/><br/>Happy viewing."

","I set the spoiler button, actually in a sense nearly every review here is a spoiler apart from the ones that just say ""best film ever, watch it"", but this one doesn't really contain any detailed spoilers.<br/><br/>Is this the best film ever? I'm inclined to say not, but I can't immediately think of something I'd rate more highly, and certainly none of the 14 which are higher in the IMDb ratings - The Empire Strikes Back? C'mon :) I am beginning to think that Kevin Spacey may be the best actor ever, and he definitely has an amazing knack for picking the right films.<br/><br/>Actually I've only just watched the film for the first time, and I'm not sure that really qualifies me to review it, my immediate reaction is to want to watch it again immediately (it's sitting on a hard disk recorder so maybe I'll do just that - or indeed buy the DVD).<br/><br/>I have to say that long experience of tricky films did lead me to guess the ""famous"" twist, at least as a possibility, but I don't think it made much difference to the surprise, and as everyone says the way it plays out is something special. Actually I think the only film which ever fooled me totally was Vertigo, and the Usual Suspects definitely bears favourable comparison with Hitchcock.<br/><br/>I'm not sure it really makes much sense to review the film in detail, you just have to watch it. Lovers of mindless action adventures may not enjoy it, although there may be enough to keep them amused, and if you don't like complicated plots or (as one reviewer complained) films which try to confuse and fool you then maybe this isn't for you - although some people probably don't realise just how thoroughly they have been fooled! One of the few other bad reviews here complains about the violence; it's true that there is some, but not much by modern standards. There is also a fair amount of bad language, so the easily-shocked should steer clear.<br/><br/>On the other hand, anyone who likes Hitchcock, who likes having to think, who has seen a lot of films and can appreciate all the trickery and the sheer attention to detail which has gone into this, will get a lot out of it - and I suspect more the second time, and the third ... this is just an immaculately-crafted film which works on many levels.<br/><br/>Bottom line: like everyone else says, just watch it!"

I can see why this movie takes heat from some people because of predictability issues. I was fortunate enough to not know anything about the movie before I watched it which left the element unspoiled to me, and provided great thrill.<br/><br/>The plot twist ending is predictable to some who say ""oh I know it"" but I don't buy that for a second.

"vladymirror","Null","2","4","11 August 2003"," very good pure nonsense
","7 years after my first viewing of this movie, I just finished my second one. I remember that at that time I though this was one of the best movies ever made, but not anymore. And itfs not because I knew the ending already, it's just it makes no sense, NO SENSE at all. I read most of the reviews on IMDb and a saw only one with similar to my opinion. Most of those that didn't like the movie were because they claim they saw it coming long before the final twist (who is Soze). Well I am not, or I should say I was not one of them. This movie kept me guessing till the final scene. What troubles me is something else: <br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>Donft read if you haven't seen it yet. Last warning. OK. I still give 10 for the suspense (if there is a definition of suspense then ""The Usual Suspects"" should be in it) and 10 for the twisted ending even 11, however the whole thing makes no sense. I don't know what was true from Verbal's story, but at least the part where our crew had to kill that Argentinean guy because he had seen Soze was true-it was confirmed by the police. Are you following me: in order to eliminate the only person who could recognize him, Soze made his persona (picture) available to the whole world. Or maybe he didnft expect that the cop would reveal the truth, quite naive for a ""devil"". And then: why he needed the police to gather them in the first place. He could have just contacted him individually and threaten  them the same way he did later. Actually, why he needed them for; with all his power, money and connections he could have hired a whole army-after all it's not a big deal-just blowing up a small ship it's not about stealing a space shuttle. They weren't even the best crew for the job-there were good thieves, but the job was not about stealing, it was job for Rambo. You got my point? PURE NONSENSE<br/><br/>Anyway, it was a great experience the first time I saw it which is what movies are all about. The bottom line is: don't watch this movie twice. It doesn't hold scrutiny."
"Rerun-2","Null","2","4","5 February 1999"," Less than meets the eye
","Watching The Usual Suspects gave me a feeling of emptiness.  There was so much happening on the screen, such good acting, so many plot twists.  Yet it all adds up to much less than it appears, largely because everything about the plot, the characters, and the dialogue turns out to be completely arbitrary.  What is it about, really? I can try to describe what it seems to be about.  I am afraid I will fail to cover all the bases, because this is the kind of movie that requires much notetaking, index cards, organization charts and detailed presentations to keep track of the plot.  5 men meet when they find themselves in the same holding cell after being arrested for various petty offenses.  They swap war stories about their various lines of work, and one of them brings up the fact that he stumbled across a startling piece of information: plainclothes detectives are using unmarked cars to provide armed transport for mafia bosses willing to shell out good money for this service.  After being let out they set one of these cars on fire, to draw media attention to this fact.  This sort of thing is the stuff of male bonding, I guess, because they decide they like working together. A mysterious man shows up (Pete Postlethwaite, in a nice performance). He offers them a lot of money to do a job for his ""client"".  The job involves stealing cargo from a European freighter docked in the city harbor. It comes out that it is really an excuse to get the men aboard to eliminate a witness who could put his ""client"" at risk.  Eventually, the client, they are told, is Kayser Sozay, a notorious Hungarian crime lord whose very name causes stark fear in those who speak it.  Legend has it that he killed his own wife and children when rival drug lords attempted to drive him out of town. If I have missed anything, please excuse me, but I believe in doing so I have made my point.  The Usual Suspects is the kind of movie that demonstrates what it means when critics say a film has too much plot for its own good.  There are many twists and turns, and surprises.  I am not averse to surprises but in the end I felt manipulated, as though there was no way to sort out all the details to make sense of what had transpired.  The ending suggests that everything we have seen may never have happened.  Did it?  I felt as if I didn't care.  If the filmmakers don't care enough about their own plot I can hardly be expected to. It's too bad, because the movie wastes a good cast.  Kevin Spacey is fascinating, Gabriel Byrne does a good job with his role, as do Pollack and Postlethwaite.  I enjoyed Chaz Palminteri as the detective assigned the joyless task of discovering who Sozay is.  But it takes too much energy to follow this, and the performances are lost in a maze of plot devices.  Enjoy it for the acting, but take along a notebook if you plan to piece together the story afterward."
"Overlord-3","Null","2","4","1 December 1998"," Now I understand why this movie had so many good reviews...
","Yes, I understand. The reason? *Lack of understandment.* The movie has absolutely no logic at all, and the twist at the end is a very bad one which never explains itself. Absolutely *no one*  understands the ""trick"" of the film, simply because neither the director nor the screenwriters do! There's nothing to understand: you are no fool, it is the movie, that is inconsistent. Besides, I don't like being manipulated, and the movie bases its quality on this. Because, if you can't trust the ""objective"" narration of the film, then you can't trust anything. It's the same as those movies or books that in the end tell you: ""It was just a dream"". Oh, good! Then how I was supposed to know that! The movie is not ""clever"" at all, because you have absolutely no way of solving the problem.<br/><br/>So, what's the value of this film? Let's see:<br/><br/>1- The twist. As I said, it is not a ""legal"" twist, since it is plain manipulation. No value here<br/><br/>2- The story. I went to see the movie for a second time, since, obviously, I felt confused. The second time I discovered what I've said before: the plot has no logic. You can't tell what was true and what was not. What is it that verbal was inventing? The whole story? The names? What?!?!? No one knows! So, no value here, either.<br/><br/>Total value: 0, zero, zilch, none<br/><br/>I challenge any of the fans to post here a consistent explanation of the plot.

"bzelkowicz","Null","2","4","10 February 2002"," entertaining, but with a lame twist
","CONTAINS SPOILER Twist endings are gimmicks, pure and simple. More often than not, they are cheap attempts to add punch to a climax that would be utterly forgettable otherwise.  In the best cases, they force you to reevaluate the experience you thought you were having up to that point.  (SPOILER ALERT!)  The usual Suspects works as a fast paced, well acted heist film, with some genuine moments of suspense and excitement.  The twist at the end, though, is nothing more than a negation of everything that came before, the equivalent of the hoary old ""It was just a dream!"" cliche.  All the ending tells us is that everything we have seen is a lie- of course it is, since this is fiction!  Unlike a good Agatha Christie story (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd being the most clever, IMHO), or even<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense (whose twist I figured out based on nothing but the preview, but which I still thought was effective) the ending does not inform the previous piece of entertainment, it robs it of value by telling you that there was nothing of substance there to begin with. <br/><br/>Memento, whose twists (most of them) are logical, integrated, and sensible, is a far better film."

"a-kos","7","2","4","29 May 2000"," Very clever and superficially entertaining, but unsatisfying
","Last week in a comparative literature class, we watched and discussed The Usual Suspects.  After listening to many perspectives on the film, I've arrived at this conclusion:  It's not challenging or difficult, it's impossible (or at least seems that way).<br/><br/>I'm going to assume that anyone who reads this is at least familiar with the plot, so I won't summarize too much hear.  I also won't reveal the details of the ending, as not to spoil it for anyone.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects does have quite a bit going for it:  A clever and often funny screenplay, first rate acting, and direction that is generally very riveting.  Even though the characters are well acted, they are presented in relatively superficial manner; we never really know them accept on a surface level.  There isn't anything intrinsically wrong with that, but for this film it is a crucial flaw because it renders the conclusion unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The story and plot are extremely complicated and the details are mind-numbingly intricate:  We get multiple perspectives and interpretations from at least two characters (sometimes simultaneously) of what happened during different times.  It is difficult to determine what flashbacks actually did happen and which are fallacies.  The plot is almost impossible to follow, even before the conclusion.  The conclusion is genuinely surprising (for MOST people, including me), but later doesn't seem to make sense.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, it is suggested that Keyser Soce is the devil.  It is not clear if he literally is the devil, or just a PERSON so evil as to be like the devil.  Regardless of which assumption you make, the ending of the film isn't satisfying.  If Soce isn't the devil (and has no supernatural powers), the film does not work:  The pieces of the plot simply don't fit together (from what I can tell).  If you accept that Soce literally is the devil, then this premise gives the filmmakers license to do almost anything, regardless of whether it unfolds in a plausible manner.  This isn't satisfying either because it seems to render much of the plot irrelevant.<br/><br/>If the viewer completely disregards all plot holes and only observes the surface, The Usual Suspects is an entertaining movie.  In that sense it is worth seeing.  The pleasure does seem to be entirely superficial.  It is clear that a great deal of thought went in to making this film, and it certainly isn't mindless.  However, the film is void of any depth of human element and any real meaning.  The plot may fit together if the film is closely and repeatedly examined, but it's shallow nature doesn't motivate the viewer to do so.  This makes The Usual Suspects a good, but not great film, and certainly not one of the best films of the 1990's.<br/><br/>Note:  If anyone would like to e-mail me to agree, disagree, or make any other criticism, I'd be happy to hear from you (not petty complaints please)."

","This film is mysterious from the beginnig. Night on the deck of a ship strewn with bodies, apparently an aftermath of a shoot-out, a wounded man, who later we know is a criminal Keaton, resignedly looking up at a figure who he calls Keyser, then Keyser aims a gun at him, and bang, bang.<br/><br/>Then it is exploring what has lead to the culmination. U.S. Customs agent Kujan sets up an unofficial investigation into a survivor Verbal, through whose statement we follow the series of events that he, Keaton and other three fellows went through for weeks.<br/><br/>The five men's mug-shot scene, six weeks before the ship and just after a truck-hijacking, is iconic. I already know in terms of plot, Keaton and Verbal are the main, and other three are something like supportive. But each man is equally attractive as a character. I love especially Fenster's babbling. And each man is a man who 'never bend over for anybody'.<br/><br/>After released, the five men go on to the next heist, and next. But pursueing is somehow turning into being pursued and manipulated. A lawyer calling himself Kobayashi shows up, and alleges his employer is Keyser Söze, who is told in the fearsome underground urben myth.<br/><br/>The plot is so complicated that you will hardly keep track of everything. But no matter how well you comprehend the plot, you will be drawn to the mystery anyway. As Keyser Soze's invisible influence is looming, their fate become desperate. This is a film noir, all about the misery of criminals, and that is poignant joy to us viewers.<br/><br/>I'm sure it must have been very astonishing Kevin Spacey's acting as Verbal was, as he was much less known back then. His expression is interpretable as A or B, which in turn irritates Kujan, played by Chazz Palminteri, who is also excellent. It often uses close-up shots, and every character's close-up face is tight and powerful. The suspense will never loosen you up to the ending, one of the best ending scenes I've ever seen."

The Usual Suspects is a gem of this era, borrowing traits of the classic noir film and coupling them with a wonderfully convoluted plot to produce a movie for the ages.<br/><br/>Having watched it twice, I find it remarkable that most of what impressed me on the first viewing retained the same quality the second time around.<br/><br/>Although the effect of the twist ending was admittedly dulled having seen it once, this is clearly more a property of twists in general than a fault of the one in the film, which, is one that will truly blow you away. Despite being rather a one-trick pony of a plot, the beginning and middle of the narrative are vivid enough to keep the viewer engrossed, with a few refreshing moments of comic relief thrown in.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's masterpiece in acting cannot go unmentioned. In a deservedly Oscar-winning performance as Verbal Kint, Spacey demonstrates his unique skill of portraying a very layered character. Looks may indeed be deceiving.<br/><br/>John Ottman's score, at times chillingly suspenseful and at times eerily suggestive, is a perfect musical companion to the events that unfold.

This is a film I look forward to giving repeat viewings to in an effort to find more subtle trinkets of information."

I will say this: quick paced drama, complete with excellent casting, acting, directing, scoring and script.

This movie avoids that pitfall and holds your interest from the opening scene.

","I've been excited to watch The Usual Suspects for a while now, and it did not disappoint at all. Any complaints of plot holes or confusing things that don't make sense to the viewer I think are absolute bullshit - everything that happens in the movie is very clearly laid out, you just have to know that Verbal is an unreliable narrator. As soon as they started discussing and Verbal began to be questioned about Soze, I was convinced that he was Verbal. How would Verbal get out alive and be the only survivor if he wasn't? It's likely we already know Soze given his reputation and influence on the group, and with Verbal as the only survivor, it just makes sense to be him, especially thinking about the opening scene with Keaton being killed. His limp is a great cover as well, and he was always the guy planning everything. I did think the bit at the end with all his names and stories coming from the board behind him was brilliant and adds to his covering of his tracks. I didn't think there was any ambiguity in the plot - Verbal has always been Keyser Soze, and orchestrated this to tie up loose ends.
While the intelligence of the twist is indisputable and the success of the movie certainly comes from this misdirection from Verbal, it's tough for me to decide whether this is truly an all-time great or just a really good movie. The point of the movie is to draw you in and show you the brilliance of Verbal, and it literally could not have done a better job of that (aside from maybe offering more red herrings or making it less obvious, but it seems like it tricked almost everyone who watched it, so maybe I just came in looking for it). You don't really connect or deeply understand the other characters beyond a very simple, flat personality. The plot is definitely complex and fascinating to unravel, and it is exciting throughout. Even when I saw the ending coming the whole time, I was still so excited and gulping down every detail of each scene, and Spacey's performance is truly brilliant. I think I'm leaning towards it being a 10 because it's so satisfying and electric, and succeeds to such a great degree in developing this complex thread which unravels to show Verbal's character, but may change it to a 9 due to the lack of strong secondary elements beyond the brilliant plot orchestrated by Verbal and, to some degree, its predictability to me. Either way, a brilliant movie that must be seen."

I somehow knew, from the start, who Soze was all along. It happens at many occasions, once we see many such great movies, that we always expect the unexpected. But, even though I tried my best to find a loophole in the plot, or tried to understand it a bit better, I was always left astonished. I knew the cripple was Soze, but the movie was so beautifully crafted that the audience has absolutely no chance of guessing who it was. So much care was taken while making this film and there is so much detail in every scene that I am utterly baffled that someone could hide such a huge twist from the audience till the end.<br/><br/>This is one of the most beautiful mystery movies I have ever watched."

","A fun movie - in a very dark and twisted sort of way. This is more than just an action thriller; this is a brilliant movie that has all sorts of interesting dialogue. The dark humor aspect comes in where one character enters the office of a detective who starts to question him about a certain crime legend. The way the character tells the story is gripping and funny because he starts to jumble all sorts of myths, legends and free association nuances into a powerful mystery. The way the characters handle the police investigation is also quite comical, but the humor is not blatant in any way whatsoever - it is subtle and is mixed with real-life struggles and questions.

"MaximumMadness","10","0","0","13 November 2016"," ""The Usual Suspects""- An electrifying and complex thriller. One of the best films of the 90's.
","There is always that handful of films that help to define their era, shaping popular culture and influencing new talents in storytelling and performing for years- even decades- to come. The 1990's, a strange sort-of transitional period in American culture, brought forth many a modern day classic. Films such as Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"", David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" and Wes Craven's ""Scream"" revolutionized then-modern cinema and showed a degree of class and complexity within their given genres unlike any we had seen before. And of course, another of these now iconic films was this one... director Bryan Singer's mind-warping and electrifying crime thriller ""The Usual Suspects."" It's a film that has continued to live on and attain respect as perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made in the twenty plus years since its initial release.<br/><br/>We follow the recollections of con-artist ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is apparently one of the few survivors of a bloodbath on the San Pedro Bay. He is interrogated by Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) over what went wrong. Kint weaves an extraordinary tale of five criminals including himself, former crooked cop Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack) and Fenster (Benicio del Toro), who were brought together seemingly by chance and began to take a series of jobs together just six weeks ago. However, their actions eventually place them into the cross-hairs of a mysterious and mythical figure in the crime world. And they will be forced to perform one last job for this twisted mind known only as ""Keyser Soze.""<br/><br/>Director Singer, now known for his work on big-budget studio pictures like Fox's popular ""X-Men"" film franchise, excels at his art in this film- only his second feature-length work. I've long been a fan of his as a skilled and talented visual storyteller, and here he shines with very subtle and even old-fashioned touches that give the tale a degree of timelessness. He eschews the tendency for mid-90's entertainment to constantly be flashy and in-your-face to instead give us long, drawn out and highly deliberate sequences where the entire scene is defined by only dialog or the look of reaction on someone's face. Which is then perfectly accentuated by a few key moments of pure, kinetic style, mainly during the twists and turns the film takes at key moments. It compliments the classic tale of corruption and intrigue being presented and builds off of the expert writing of Christopher McQuarrie.<br/><br/>McQuarrie's script plays a constant and carefully thought-out balancing act that builds suspense and drama on a constant basis, while also giving us plenty of nice, human touches for the frequent piece of levity. It's a film that strikes an admirable and even highly likable and entertaining tone while also subtly hinting towards an ever-pervasive sense of dread beneath the surface. The handling of character is also stunning, with each and every player feeling completely defined and developed regardless of the amount of screen time spent with them through believable and organic dialog and reaction. Even characters that are more unbelievable, such as the mastermind that is Keyser Soze come off as thoroughly engrossing because they are grounded in a sense of reality- in this case as a figment that has become a myth due to his infamy.<br/><br/>This is also very much an ""actor's movie"", and everyone present gives work that is nothing less than stellar. Spacey and Byrne particularly steal the show as our two ""leads."" Spacey, now a highly respected legend of the industry, gives the performance that helped define his career and stardom here as an unsure and worried man dealing with the events that have transpired. He also gets much praise for portraying a character dealing with Cerebral Palsy in a realistic and sensitive way. Byrne knocks it out of the park as a man trying to move past his career in crime but can't quite let go- there's some powerful stuff going on beneath the surface with his character. Baldwin, Pollack and del Toro make for a great rest of the gang, and supply plenty of laughs and many a gasp with their turns. Supporting roles by Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Suzy Amis and Giancarlo Esposito build towards creating an ideal ensemble and all act their hearts out no matter the size of their role.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is, this is one of the new classics to emerge from Hollywood in the past thirty years. And it's impact not only on filmmaking but culture as a whole is undeniable. Even to this day, the perplexing question of ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" is a highly recognizable and important piece of pop-culture entertainment, and no matter where you are, if you ask someone ""Hey, have you seen 'Usual Suspects'?"", chances are you'll be met with a smile from someone who has seen and adored it as much as everyone else. And for good reason! It's a wonderful film. Filled with keen visual storytelling, phenomenal writing and some of the greatest acting chops ever put on-screen. It's a masterpiece of its era and is still very much a valuable and entertaining film today.<br/><br/>It easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10 from me. If you haven't seen it, stop what you're doing and go out to pick up a copy. It's well worth it."

","After watching ""Reservoir Dogs"" I could slightly tell the similarities between this film. Although their maybe a lot of people that may disagree, I thought it was slightly similar. This is a cool and clever, film that build suspense and interest as it goes. This is more of a mystery movie, but it's not a mystery movie where the audiences will try to piece together all the puzzle pieces. Instead it's a intricately woven mystery crime thriller that gets more interesting as it goes. Maybe because of the multilayered direction, the really well done editing and clever storytelling. So the story is told from Roger ""Verbal"" Kint about what went down on the before, during the ship heist. With him and his dysfunctional and yet effective crew getting set up for a task and how they went about it. And what the motives of each of the crew members were and so on. The lighting and camera work was also really good and it felt like you were following the heist crew and following through with the process to a slight degree. Bryan Singer started making this movie at the age of 27 and to craft a clever and smart movie at that age and got the resources and cast together is one heck of a accomplishment. This movie is rightfully a cult classic.<br/><br/>8.8/10"

A film that's had Scary Movie utilize one of its premises. A movie that influential that it's completely infiltrated the collective unconscious. A movie you'd call: ""classic"". Overall, the qualities are as follows: the acting especially from Palmintieri and Spacey, but also Byrnes and the Lord Kobayashi guy. The concept and its execution globally close to flawless. The irony behind it all, and of course the twist at the end. The flaws: there's too much talking, and the film seems like it draws towards the ending more than stands on its own, it feels like the movie-makers gave the ending so much importance they unknowingly neglected the rest of it. It's not a particularly enticing film to watch in its entirety, and it only gets interesting starting at a certain later point."

"cleary-joshua","9","0","0","6 January 2015"," This provides one of the most incredible payoffs in cinema...
","An incredible twist is enough to propel any film into greatness, even if it's not an incredible movie. People can have their opinions of a film completely changed just because of a cunning twist at the end, even if the rest of it is unremarkable. It is therefore crucial when reviewing a film of this nature that all of the movie is taken into account, not just the ending. Thankfully, ""The Usual Suspects"" is completely worth the journey to the end, earning its runtime with funny and thrilling cinema, and providing one of the most incredible payoffs at the end. For those who haven't seen the film, I will attempt to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but I can't promise anything.<br/><br/>The film is told mostly via flashback by Kevin Spacey's character, the odd ""Verbal"" Kint, about a group of criminals who are brought together by the mysterious crime boss Keyser Soze. They get into deeper and deeper trouble throughout the film, only meeting Soze's strange associate, ""Mr Kobayashi"", played masterfully and mysteriously by the late Pete Postlethwaite. The ensemble, made up of Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne and Benicio del Toro, among others, has incredible chemistry, and you believe every one of the fights and fall-outs that they have. The whole point is that they're being forced to work together, it's not their choice.<br/><br/>The film is an excellent example of neo-noir styling, especially in its cinematography and score, and the climax on the ship at the end is pulled off extremely well. It's a truly heart- pounding sequence, helped by the fact that you're manically trying to unpick the mystery at the same time. What makes it such a success is the fact that nearly all of the preceding hour and a half is interesting and engaging. The characters are well thought out, not just one-sided, and the performances on display really complement each other well.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS FROM HERE*<br/><br/>Is it perfect? Almost. It's inevitable that putting so much reliance on a twist can scupper parts of the film's success, and despite taking you completely by surprise, it does in many ways completely invalidate everything seen before. Obviously the true test of this is whether it stands up a second time, once you know the twist, but I have yet to experience this. An unreliable narrator is okay so long as you can piece together some form of truth afterwards, and I'm really not sure if this is possible.<br/><br/>Despite this, the first watching certainly holds up. You're taking on an incredible ride with the film, constantly trying to guess its secrets, and if anything, it's a brilliant way to experience one of Spacey's two breakout performances."

","The film was great with an excellent plot twist at its end. A group is 'called' together with the common background of having made the film's antagonist upset, so they must do a job for him to wipe their debt clean. The group consists of Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey). The theme of duality comes up as Dean Keaton is trying to be legit, though he can't escape his past, and there is also the true identity of Keyser Soze – the film's antagonist. Duality of character is commonly used, like in Psycho.<br/><br/>The group is rounded up following the prologue of the film by the police after being fingered that one of them was supposedly part of a robbery. The rest of the information about what happened is done through flashbacks by means of Verbal talking to the police. The group was to be held for a while, but in Dean's pursuit of a normal life he is dating an accomplished lawyer, which got him out of jail though he hadn't been charged with anything. Later in the film the audience is informed by Verbal's flashbacks that Mr. Soze has a job for them to perform, which would wipe away any debt they have to him. Before Soze's job is introduced to the group, Dean goes against his attempt at a normal life and does 'one final job' with the group to get back at the police for ruining his normalcy.<br/><br/>The five don't like the odds in the job put before them, especially Fred Fenster, so they try threatening Mr. Soze indirectly by seeing Mr. Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who is Soze's lawyer and voice. The camera shots of Verbal were rather well done in capturing his emotion during the scene, and the camera angles of Michael and Dean threatening Kobayashi were close for a personal feel. Things take a turn and Dean and the rest find that Soze's lawyer is extremely well informed. The group decides to do Soze's job since it seems he knows too much about them.<br/><br/>The group goes to a ship to take a shipment of drugs away from Soze's competition, but it goes foul, as can be seen from the prologue of the film. Through the flashbacks it appears that the identity of Mr. Soze is made apparent, which is actually what the police present as an idea to Verbal during interrogations. Verbal swears their view is incorrect, but the police make him see otherwise, that it was just difficult to see from his vantage point near the docks. The police let him go and the audience gets to Verbal's duality."

","Films cab transport our minds and make our brains work extremely hard by using build-up and mystery. In order to appreciate this from of cinema, you have to pay attention! That's not hard to do while viewing ""The Usual Suspects"" due to it's brilliant directing by Brian Singer and its unique, leading, mysterious, and shocking screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie that doesn't just make you think and intrigue you for every second of the film, but makes you analyze the crime scene as if you were investigating the films plot yourself. ""The Usual Suspects"" revolves around a brutal fire on a large ship leaving only two alive. One named verbal (Kevin Spacey) explains the incident to the FBI explaining how Turkish criminal Kyzer Soze was responsible for the murders of the men on board, and tries to help them find this killer. Using suspects to fit Soze's appearance, four men are investigated. The criminals get involved in a heist that set up a wild conclusion that will leave you speechless. Every criminal, Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, and Kevin Spacey are electrifying and play their parts perfectly. What's so smart about McQuarrie's story is that he's building up a story that could go any direction at any time. he isn't set around one character and one story that continues to move on. Instead he uses five men who could all get into trouble and shift the story like a hurricane. We are filled with mystery and suspense and get a shocking ending that concludes everything that happened and explains all its mysteries, but doesn't leave a stitch unclear. Director Bryan Singer gives elusive shots that always have that pressure and tension built on them even when nothing too important is occurring. It's always unpredictable and its like watching a frog; you can watch a little toad sit all day, but you'll never know when it'll jump."

Does it make the movie any less better? No. I think what makes it stand out for me, even when I know who the true villain is is the direction. It's fast-paced and tense; tight close-ups everywhere. Keeps the audience from catching a breath. No time to recall on previous spoilers, because all the time the movie gave us is already used to think along and solve the puzzle. <br/><br/>Overall, brilliant writing combined with tight direction keeps this movie mysterious and worthy of its ending."

","Despite the heavy cursing in this film I was captivated from the moment it started.<br/><br/>Although when I first saw that there is a ""Hungarian mafia"" in the film I was absolutely surprised. I've never heard in my entire life about a Hungarian mafia in America. I am Hungarian and what I know that in the entire history of my country we have been victims of horrible things, oppressors after oppressors, and I could go on. So my guess is that the screenwriter was bored with the usual story of Italian mafia and wanted to come up with some exotic language that these mafia people could use in his movie and which the viewer can't understand, which turned out to be Hungarian.<br/><br/>And the twist at the end is pretty cool but I have to admit that I knew the identity of Kaiser Soze right after the riddle has been given to the viewer to solve. To see my educated guess be confirmed at the end was very gratifying :)"

","I just re watched this masterpiece, and once again i am not in one bit disappointed. Every time i watch this movie, i think to my self, ""why do i like this movie that much?"" this goes on for about the first hour of the movie, where you aren't really sure what is happening. Then in a matter of minutes the whole charade collapses on top of you, and you what the meaning of the movie is, you do not necessarily know who Keyser Söze is. If you are watching it, looking for the small cues, knowing that Kevin Spacey is in fact the devil, that we are all looking for. When you do look for it, you can in fact see the brilliance in Spacey's work in that he at times, looks like a person that plays his role poorly. He looks as that if, he did not have his given or taken, handicap, that Roger Kint has, the performance would never hold up. And that is why i love Spacey's performance in this masterpiece. All this is great, but the thing that really sells this feature film as one of my favorites is the scene in the end, where verbal is walking down the street and the camera is getting a fairly straight forward angle on his feet, and suddenly, he starts walking normally. That is in my opinion, one of the best scenes, ever to have been documented on film, because it is so simple, and because that if you are totally out swimming at this point in the film, you are sure that he is Keyser Söze at that moment. I remember this being an amazing experience watching when i wasn't very old. That scene blew me away."

","""The Usual Suspects"" is a must-see and one of the best movies of 90s. The movie has got fantastic scenes. The last scene that is the most important one includes the famous plot twist. Another great scene is the voice line-up where each character reads a particular sentence in his own way that somehow shows his personality. Kevin Spacey has given a superb performance. He won his first Oscar for the role of Roger 'Verbal' Kint in this movie. He narrates the story that we see in flashbacks. During the movie the audience believes what is being shown in flashbacks but after the plot twist they understand that what they saw wasn't exactly what had happened. This is one of the movies that must be watched for the second time. Because in the second time the brilliant screenplay and Spacey's wonderful acting stand out. For example the first time you watch it, Verbal is just bored and looking at the wall but in the second time you know that he's making up stories that you're gonna see afterward."

","A great film that begs you to watch it again right after you've finished it. The twist today may not hold up as strongly as it did when the movie was released, but it still makes for a great revelation at the story's close. Rare is it that a film will cause you to re-watch it in order to put loose ends and confusing pieces together in order to put the film as a whole which the makes the overall experience more viewer interactive, be it mentally and idealistically. Bryan Singer's film that jump started his directorial career is a great one, despite it not leading to forthcoming treats such as this. Kevin Spacey gives off a brilliant performance and the seemingly least likely character that ties the whole film together, but what makes it fun is how he fits in to each frame as he manipulates everyone in order to get away with whatever he wants to do. Highly recommend as it is a timeless classic."

","In 1995, Brian Singer and Christopher McQuarrie dreamed up a simple concept: Five thieves, rounded up on suspicion of hijacking in New York, stand in a police lineup. Seen that one before, huh? Just wait. From that, they went on and created the most plot-driven, intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years. The result: the Usual Suspects, one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist.<br/><br/>The story is convoluted, and is really confusing to read, although easy to follow on screen. Special investigator Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) grills ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled con- man who is the lone survivor of an LA boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims. Kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis, the rogue cop Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), is actually dead. Kint relates the majority of the film in flashback, beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police-station lineup in New York City. What follows is a shell-game of violence and betrayal, all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly compact: it's the shortest 105 minutes you'll ever spend watching a movie. The cast is exceptional. Palminteri shines, he is brutally honest, a true cop, one who is going after the whole story because its there. Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak are all exceptional as the other suspects that are tagged along within the story that is told by Verbal.<br/><br/>However, this will be forever known as the film that launched Kevin Spacey. Spacey is simply breathtaking, he is a force on screen, giving a magnetic performance that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze. Spacey's performance will be remembered for years, for it is the best of his career. Verbal Kint is a clever storyteller, weak, oppressed, and gleefully evil to the bone, yet pitiful, one who draws sympathy. What this film boils down to is one of the greatest twists in cinematic history. I won't dare spoil it, but let me be assured that you will be amazed. <br/><br/>Kudos to McQuarrie and Singer for giving the audience a delightful, fast-paced, furiously plot- driven movie with quirky characters, phenomenal acting, and some hilarious moments that lead up to a climactic and shocking twist. I highly recommend it."

","""The Usual Suspects"", is an old school drama that exemplifies how truly great screen writing, direction, and acting can come together to create a ""huge"" movie with relatively minimal budget and production effort,and captures some of the best acting ever caught on film by it's cast members. From its onset, ""The Usual Suspects"", virtually transports the viewer from their seat right into the action itself.<br/><br/>Its seemingly circuitous plot line hooks the viewer so tightly that they simply cannot wrench themselves from the screen. The attention to each and every minute detail innocuously revealed to us as Kevin Spacey's wonderfully crafted and portrayed character is interrogated is absolutely mind boggling; and, as the story line almost excruciating slowly unfolds itself, pulls every viewer further and further into the detectives' angst driven desire to get to the bottom of the case. Yet the awe inspiring screen writing and direction serves up all these details as though they are absolutely insignificant until the plot loop finally, completely, and almost instantaneously closes.<br/><br/>All along this ride the viewer is drawn to the next scene,if not the very next word, like a moth to a flame. Regardless of the audience, the viewers always become unwitting, active participants in the detectives' search for the truth behind the actions of all involved in the unknown, unseen, dark, criminal mastermind's grand scheme. The ""Usual Suspects"" is, and will always remain, a true testament to the art and passion that a cast and crew bring to a set and how that passion, more than any other single factor, can create a truly classic film."

"TxMike","Null","0","0","10 September 2013"," Intriguing script, it pays to watch it more than once.
","It is hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. I first saw in in 1999, and several times since then. I have found my overall impressions changing over time. Is it a great movie? That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple ""Verbal Kint"".<br/><br/>What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five ""usual suspects"", perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan.<br/><br/>So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is ""How much of this was really true?"" <br/><br/>That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he?<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs.<br/><br/>An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. <br/><br/>Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably ""gold"" watch and ""gold"" lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser Söze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser Söze continues."

"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","9 August 2013"," The Greatest Trick Bryan Singer Ever Pulled Was To Convince The World That This Film Is Just Another Thriller
","The greatest trick The Usual Suspects ever pulled was to convince its audience that it's just another crime thriller. For the majority of its runtime, it travels the same route many other examples of its genre have done before, narrates its complex plot in a manner that does enough to keep the viewers around until the end & within those final moments, delivers a masterstroke so profound that it changes everything that unfolded on the screen before.<br/><br/>The story of The Usual Suspects is covered in flashbacks & is narrated by a small time conman who is one of the only two survivors from the boat explosion that killed 27 men. His recounting of the events during his interrogation by the FBI links back to the time when he & four other criminals were rounded up by the police after which they formed a group of their own. Things become interesting when the near-mythical criminal mastermind's name comes up.<br/><br/>Fabulously directed by Bryan Singer, The Usual Suspects is his breakthrough feature for it instantly catapulted him into the Hollywood limelight & the way he managed to bring the outstandingly written script to life is laudable. Singer progresses the plot in a slow n steady manner which lets the tension build up naturally & also employs various twists n turns at regular intervals to keep the viewers guessing and he is wonderfully supported by its rich cast.<br/><br/>However, the film lacks a refined presentation for the narrative sometimes feels convoluted while on other occasions, it's highly intriguing. Editing at times struggles with the pacing but for the most part, it's brilliantly carried out. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with a foreboding atmosphere along with a mysterious vibe while John Ottman's score further elevates those elements which in turn makes the experience all the more suspenseful.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio del Toro, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite & others. And while everyone is good in their respective roles, Spacey manages to take his role further with remarkable simplicity whether it's his dialogue delivery, vacant expressions or cerebral palsy. Finally, the image of Keyzer Söze looms over the plot so much that the character is already an iconic figure way before appearing on the screen.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Usual Suspects is a tense, confusing, captivating & entertaining cinema that delivers a mind-blowing experience the first time & is even more fun the second time around when you try to connect the dots from your first experience, and that's exactly when the film's biggest strength is revealed. It's so meticulously crafted with subtle placement of hints that it requires a bit of commitment from its audience but the reward in the end is incredibly fulfilling too. One of the defining works of 1990s cinema with a plot twist as legendary as Keyzer Söze himself, The Usual Suspects comes strongly recommended."

","The Usual Suspects is that genre of cinema in which everything is cleverly woven throughout the film in seamlessness, with the famous phrase of nothing is what it seems. Ironically, Bryan Singer scoffs of the spectators in the broadest sense of the word, convincing them to believe what is vividly visualized before them while keeping up the brilliant final outcome to the very last minute. Up until today, this dense and overwhelming intrigues throughout the film remain timeless, making it one of the most interesting and refreshing nineties thriller. Furthermore, we can easily list down the strengths behind this classic goody starting from the simple but robust camera work, the casts' unsurpassed acting work, the intrigue, suspense and also the remarkable complex structured framework.<br/><br/>To be honest, in my first viewing, I tried to find out the 'culprit' responsible for whatever happened along the way; however, I failed for I went with the flow who were led to believe by my so-called careful viewing. This film turned out to be much clever than how it looked at the beginning. It contained a tension, intrigue and uncertainty that all filled within the mind of the audience so absolutely it's a delight for all senses. Personally, I felt cheated. I found this film superb, extremely intelligent, perfectly developed from all points of view and sustained by characters. A very solid film from the beginning to the end. If you haven't seen it then I advise you go see it. Get immersed in the magic of this movie, waste no time and get ready to have some fun. In short, this is a pure entertainment at the highest level."

","The Usual Suspects (1995) is a movie based on twist, turns and most importantly ""manipulation"". It is not long in the movie before you realize that playing with the mind of a human is the ultimate goal of the movie. The movie starts out with a man who appears to be dark and cold killing someone on a boat. Then this mysterious man sets the boat to a blaze leaving two survivors. The two survivors include Kevin Spacey who plays Roger ""Verbal"" and a Hungarian. The twist and turns begin once FBI agent Giancarlo Esposito who plays Jack Baer and U.S Customs agent Chazz Palminteri who plays Dave Kujan , show up to interview Verbal who just so happens to be a con artist. The theme of manipulation is present throughout the film. Here you have a master manipulator con artist that has taken pride in manipulating someone. The theme of The Usual Suspects is very similar to Primal Fear starring Richard Gere. Primal Fear is about a boy who convinces the jury and his attorney that he suffers from multiple personality disorder and the evil side of his disorder murdered someone. <br/><br/>Verbal whose character appears to be a vulnerable man dealing with cerebral palsy tells a story with one goal in mind and that is to manipulate. He begins to tell this story of five criminals, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). Who were brought in by the police to be questioned about a crime. Verbal convinces these individuals to pull of a robbery which leads to more than robbery.<br/><br/>As Verbal tells the story he has flashbacks of the robberies. He explains how the five criminals became involved with an evil man by the name of Keyser Soze. The five criminals were to smuggle 91 million worth of cocaine from the boat. This cocaine was to be sold to Soze rival. <br/><br/>Kujan seems to be intrigued by the story Verbal is telling and he believes every word of it. Kujan, is so involved with this story he encourages Verbal to tell more. Verbal tells of a story that explains Keyser Soze character. He goes on to mention how the Hungarian rivals broke into the home of Keyser and rapped his wife and murdered his son but to their surprise Keyser Soze kills his family and the invaders as he could not stand to live with himself after that event. <br/><br/>This particular scene in the movie the lighting and color was enhanced so that you would believe in this evil character described by Verbal. The home was full of colors that are typically seen in Spanish homes. But the colors also helped to enhance the evil in the room. The music helped to intensify the anger of Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>Verbal is enjoying every minute of the manipulation. Verbal goes on to tell how they planned to take the drugs. The criminals planned to take out the crew on deck which was the sellers and the buyers. Keaton, McManus and Hokney attack the sellers and the buyers which they manage to kill most of them. Once the thieves load the ship they find no drugs on board. Hokney, Keaton, and McManus are murdered by a mysterious assailant leaving only Verbal and a severely burned Hungarian. <br/><br/>Verbal a cerebral palsy man sitting in this cluttered office looking pathetic and incapable of bursting a grape has managed to convince Kujan that he is victim throughout this ordeal and Keaton was the mastermind behind the robberies and the boat heist. Keaton was still alive and had faked his death. Keaton has to be Keyser Soze this evil drug dealer who you dared crossed. <br/><br/>Twist, turns, and ultimate manipulation was the theme throughout this entire movie even up to the end of the movie. The director managed to take all elements of the movie and tie back to a jaw dropping ending. The movie will reveal how clever Verbal is at taking his surroundings and convincing others of this elaborate story that tells of crime, murder, deception and manipulation. ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"" (Singer, 1995). This movie is one that you can continue to watch as it will almost for certain turn up something you missed the first time around. The actors selected for this movie was perfect for each character. I would recommend this movie."

","The movie ""The Usual Suspects"" directed by Bryan Singer is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The plot twist was amazing at the end. The movie showed that emotion and distraction of a very charismatic individual being Kevin Spacey's character Verbal played a key component of emotions of fear to manipulation of a story to deceive another character's point of view and also for us the audience who viewed the film. Verbal and a Hungarian criminal were the only two survivals. Verbal is interrogated by the character Dave Kujan who is played by Chazz Palminteri to find out the whole story of everyone involved. Verbal is a cripple and rambles a lot on his stories. He introduces the five criminals that includes Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin, Dean Keaton played by Gabriel Byrne, and Todd Hockney played by Kevin Pollak, and Fred Fenster played by Benicio Del Toro. They were all taken in for a lineup of a crime they didn't commit. As the working relationship between the five criminals develops in the movie, the Hungarian criminal who is hospitalized mentions the name Keyser Soze, who Verbal describes as a person of urban myth. Verbal then states that a man name Kobayashi who works for Soza blackmails them to do the boat of Soze's rival in cocaine trafficking that tied into the massacre. After finishing, Dave tells his side of what he thinks happened on the boat as all setup by Dean, which I can kind of see with this analysis because at the beginning of the movie it shows a darker shadow man shooting at Dean. Verbal then breaks down and agrees but is let go due to no charges being pressed. Then when we think the movie is over, this is where the plot twist happens! When Dave lets Verbal goes, he sits on his desk and then slowly notices the board that is hanging up on his wall. He then drops his mug that the camera shoots in slow motion pace. Then there is a fast pace close up shot for all the document clippings on the board along with clips of the beginning part of the movies that shows every character and locations used in the story by Verbal was fabricated from the beginning. There is also a close up scene for the mug to show that was used also with naming the character Kobayish. He runs out to go after Verbal but it is too late. The camera also shows a fax that comes in with a picture of what the hospitalize criminal described as Soze. Another shot shows the camera filming Verbal body transformation starting with his feet to his hands working as normal. Then your point of view of the character of Verbal changes to him being Soze as his gets into the car with a man who looks like the Kobayashi ending on Verbal's quote ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist. And like that, poof. He's gone."" (Singer, 1995). Another movie that is similar to this movie is Fight Club. The way the movie is made, it creates a point of view where we believe in one thing of the main character and yet it turns around and changes on us. Two techniques used a lot during the movie were camera angles/tilting and lighting. I noticed that the even in really dark scenes, like the beginning of the movie the lighting was really bright on the character Dean's face and Soza was shadowed out even with the flames around them. The camera was then moved when Soza shot at him, leading us to only believe he was killed. The best part of the techniques used was editing of the scenes for when Dave figured out the story was fabricated by Verbal as he looked at all the documents and images on his wallboard and also his mug. I really liked the movie because it shows how a perception of a situation or person is not always accurate to what actually occurred due to the falsified details given by one person. Emotion is a strong persuasion for us to believe in the unknown, especially fear. It is kind of like what we hear on the news. They will tell us one thing and yet the situation may actually be different than what is told."

The techniques used in this film were very exceptional, the low - key lighting when it came to the identity of Keyser Soze gave you the heightened suspense of who is this individual? Just when you thought you were going to see his face, the light would become shadowed again. The use of different angels such as high and low came together perfectly and just when needed to give the viewer the feeling of helplessness and despair.The theme for this film is definitely the usual suspect is sometimes unusual.

Its fabulous script(richly deserved Oscar tot he script writer). 2. Great acting by Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin and the guy who acts as Keaton. 3. One of the best endings ever seen on screen that leaves you with your mouth open. Kevin Spacey became a celebrated ""bad guy"" after this and went on to act in some great movies after this stint."

","Five men got arrested, acquainted, and set a revenge to NYPD. That valiant act brought them to the attention of a legend, a mastermind of evil: Kayser Soeze. They soon learned that each of them had wronged Soeze at some point of their criminal life. Debt must be paid. A near-suicide mission must be completed, or their loved ones will perish. Who will triumph? The quintet or Soeze?<br/><br/>I cannot say what's the best thing of about this film. Not that it is not brilliant. It is! But sadly, cannot even utter the word. It's one of those films where you cannot risk reading the plot summary. I'm glad I've watched it with the full satisfaction, as intended. Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey had done brilliantly.

","""Who done its"" are usually puzzles that are solved, but there's nothing usual here.

The brilliance of writer Christopher Quarrie is hidden by an all star cast that emotes with over the top language and right into the myth of the story but the obsessive performances by Spacey and Palminteri are the soul of the film. The action only supplements the interrogation that doggedly looks for the cracks in the birdsong. It's the little pieces that are so special in review.

","Let me say first - I loved this movie from beginning to end. Well written script, superb acting, great direction, good pacing.

OK, great. But now Keyser just sat in a police detective's office for two hours. Now there's a cop out there who knows what Keyser looks like. (Plus there's a second cop who spent a lot of time with the surviving suspect too.) Doesn't this just defeat the purpose of Keyser's whole plan?

","I guess you don't get the same effect when you first watch a movie like THE USUAL SUSPECTS more than fifteen years after it was first released. Any chance of being ""surprised"" at the ending is ruined because spoilers have long since become common knowledge. I knew who Keyser Söze was way before I ever bothered to hunt down the movie. Of course, if you're reading this there's a possibility you haven't seen the film and, on the off chance you've somehow managed to avoid exposure to the oft-spoiled ending, I won't mention it here. I'm just here to explain if I enjoyed it, which I did for the most part. The movie is your conventional crime drama with a strong cast and some sharp writing that prevent it from fading into obscurity. It begins in the aftermath of a boat explosion where three career criminals were killed and evidence of a rumored multimillion dollar drug deal is no where to be found. What brought these criminals together and what went wrong on that boat? Only one man might hold the answers: Verbal Kint, a smalltime criminal with cerebral palsy and one of only two survivors from the botched operation. In an interrogation with Agent Kujan of US Customs, Kint will explain how it all came together: how five con-men with their own agendas were brought together with the help of a police lineup and eventually found themselves employed by the mysterious Keyser Söze. But the question remains, who is Keyser Söze?<br/><br/>Having seen this movie so long after it originally hit, I've got to say: wow, it feels dated. When I was watching it, it consistently screamed 90's. The editing, the cinematography, just the overall style is firmly planted in the decade. In a sense, it kind of sucks. As much as I've heard and read about the movies over the years, I guess I expected something with a little more of it's own style. It doesn't detract overwhelmingly from the movie. It's still a solid story with a great cast of characters, but it's just visually unimpressive. It's a pretty basic premise for a movie and I think it was the ""twist"" ending that grabbed a lot of people's attentions. Really, it's not so much a twist because it didn't really have that much of a bearing on the story. Looking back, the big revelation could've involved any character and it wouldn't really have been any different. It makes the ending memorable, sure, especially the means in which it was accomplished during the interrogation. That much was cool, no doubt. Christopher McQuarrie has since gone on to prove himself a capable enough screenwriter and his nonlinear storytelling keeps the movie intriguing (even when, in my case, you know how it ends beforehand). I suppose the best thing to come from this movie was director Bryan Singer's first major success. I can't imagine he would've been able to bring his vision of X-MEN to life if he hadn't knocked this one out of the park with audiences.<br/><br/>Going in, I knew Kevin Spacey was in the film and, as anyone who's even seen Kevin Spacey in a film can attest, he's guaranteed to be awesome. And he was. He brings his best in every role he adopts, and Verbal Kint is no different. Kint is a strange man, seemingly small time compared to the situation he's found himself in but you can't help but feel there's more to his character. Speaking of characters, let's go back to how I mentioned the overwhelming 90's vibe and take a moment to bring up the cast. If this cast doesn't feel ripped right out of the decade, I don't know what does: Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, comedian (with a penchant for dramatic roles) Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, and (I kid you not) Stephen Baldwin. To be fair, Del Toro has gone on to continuing success in his career and I love his character, Fenster. Del Toro has admitted that Fenster only serves the movie as a plot device about halfway through and took the opportunity to have a little fun with it, giving him near indecipherable speech that steals scenes from the heavyweight performances going on around him. These guys make for an interesting, if eclectic, bunch. Byrne is great as the movie's ""hero"". His character, Dean Keaton, is a formerly crooked cop who's gone straight but finds himself reeled back into the world of crime. Even Baldwin does well here. All of the elements are here for a fun crime drama and new viewers are sure to find something here to enjoy."

","""The Usual Suspects"" is, quite simply, one of the greatest crime dramas ever made. The writing is sublime, the acting magnificent and the score is top-notch, all of which contribute to create a taut, tense thriller in which five hardened criminals are rounded up and dropped into a situation in which they are not only way over their heads, but from which there is no escape. Kevin Spacey's Oscar-winning portrayal of crippled con artist Verbal Kint is masterful and truly well-deserved.<br/><br/>The entire story is told almost completely in flashback, as Kint relates the story of the death of his partners, and the events of the six weeks leading up to it, to the police who are interrogating him. At first evasive and vague, Kint begrudgingly hints to the existence of a faceless, seemingly omnipresent criminal mastermind, who goes by the (great) name of Keyser Soze. Soze is painted as a master criminal and manipulator who is behind every facet of the tragedy of the death of Kint's partners.<br/><br/>For those of you reading this review who have not actually seen the film, and do not know about the ""twist"" ending, I will only say this: I NEVER SAW IT COMING.

The movie opens up with introducing the five con-men that are arrested for questioning and are in a line up after a truck was hijack in New York. The only problem is none of them are guilty and they then get together to plan a revenge against the police department. One scene in the movie was of a boat that exploded on the San Pedro pier were 27 bodies were discovered and $91 million of drug money. Roger ""Verbal"" Kint was one of the survivors. The movie is told by flashbacks of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint who is played by Kevin Spacey telling his side of the story to the US Customs Agent Dave Kujan played by Chazz Palminteri. There is one main masterminded criminal called Keyser Soze who is played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is well known for his violent reputation and he even responded to a threat to murder his own family so he could prove that he feared no one. It is told in the movie that each of the five con-men at one point has wronged Soze and they must pay him back now. <br/><br/>This movie has a lot of action in it and also a lot of twist in turns in events and lots of suspense. Although Usual Suspects was a good movie the beginning to me was a little boring because it took too long to introduce the characters in the beginning but after that it kept my attention till the end. The movie was made in 1995 but the lighting that was used gives you the feeling of being in the earlier years such as the late 40's or 50's. The music and sounds are used very well, particularly in the scene in the garage parking lot the music gets more intense and you can feel the suspense as the shooting starts. They did a very good job when the movie fades into another scene slowly so you can feel the lapse of time that was created. This movie also makes you question who is controlling or pulling all the strings and has you are focusing on a character and then you realize that the character doesn't even exist. Near the end of the movie Kint says, ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."""

","US Customs Agent Dave Kujan, portrayed by Chazz Palminteri, is investigating a terrible crime in the harbor where a heist gone wrong turned into a massacre. Kujan tracks down and questions the only survivor from the incident, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). Kint is a very unassuming man with a crippled hand and leg and shows himself to be somewhat of a coward as he describes the events that took place on the ship. Agent Kujan has convinced himself that Kint's partner Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is the mastermind behind the events and that Keaton is still alive somewhere in hiding despite the testimony given to him by Kint that he is dead.<br/><br/>Kint's story is incredibly believable as it pegs the mastermind behind the heist as being none other than the somewhat mythical criminal and murderer of his own family, Keyser Soze. Even though nobody has actually seen Soze, Kint and through Kint's story, Agent Kujan believes Soze to be behind the massacre. Kujan then has to alter his beliefs somewhat, but still sticks to the ultimate fact that Dean Keaton is not only behind the whole fiasco; he is actually Keyser Soze. And he purposely got the four criminals Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (Kevin Pollack), and Kint to join him for the jewel heist as a front.<br/><br/>The story told by Kint is ultimately blown out of the water as Kujan decides to let him go from the interrogation. Just as Kint is walking out of the police station, what do we see come through the fax machine? The first police sketch of what Keyser Soze looks like. We finally get to see that Soze was actually Verbal Kint, and aside from that, Kint isn't even crippled! Arturo Marquez, the only man ""alive"" that can identify Soze, is in critical condition at a hospital and has given up who Soze is. We find out that Kint's story, which comprises almost the entire film, was all a lie. I believe that the film does a good job of foreshadowing the ultimate reveal the Kint as Soze. Throughout most of the story telling, everything is dimly lit and has subtle hints that Kint is not who he says he is. When we see events that actually take place, they are brightly lit with very exact details while the scenes showing Kint's story are dark and portray even the characters involved as being very confused. Soze didn't actually exist as he mentioned and for that matter, Redfoot, Kobayashi, and the drug deal that puts the five criminals together never existed either. The jewel heist and incidents at the harbor were all a front for Kint to kill the one man that could identify him and stage the whole incident as a heist gone wrong where he would have almost no hand in any killings.<br/><br/>The thing that makes this story so great aside from the events that are portrayed in the movie itself is the brilliance of the plot twist and the focus and theme of the movie. How many movies can say that they have a character based theme on a character that never really existed? That is the brilliance of the film and writing and is the reason for my comparison to the movie 12 Monkeys. 12 Monkeys focuses on the theme of preventing a terrible future, but also ultimately shows a focus on the character of James Cole (Bruce Willis). The film shows that Cole runs into himself in the past as a child while trying to prevent a future where most of mankind is wiped out by a man-made virus. You see the same scene in the beginning and end of the film without realizing that you are in fact seeing the events from the viewpoint of the same character (young Cole and future Cole). This film also utilizes some of the hidden foreshadowing to a plot twist that is used in The Usual Suspects as seen in some of the conversations between Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) and Cole at the mental hospital. Some of the conversations were used to show that Goines was in fact the mastermind behind the man-made virus."

","IMDb Top 250: 25 The Usual Suspects is a great film with a great script, excellent direction, a cool plot and interesting characters. Arguably a neo-noir film (L.A., twisting and convoluted plot that is difficult to follow, crime), 'Suspects' demands your full attention. It's an excellent film.<br/><br/>The story is about 5 criminals who are brought together without reason, and try to get back at the police. They are then approached to attack a boat because of debts they didn't know they had. Told through flashbacks, it can be confusing- but intentionally so. The plot is big and interweaving, and unless you're a detective, will demand a second viewing to figure everything out.<br/><br/>The 5 characters are mostly awesome. Byrne is great as the conflicted ex-officer, dragged back into crime. Baldwin is charming as the crazy, outgoing MacManus. Del Toro is nuts as the incomprehensible Fenster, The fourth guy is just an extra, I can't even remember his name. But this is clearly Kevin Spacey's movie. He's a magnificent actor. He's definitely the main character though, so his 'Supporting Actor' Oscar is questionable. Maybe he was put in that category to guarantee it.<br/><br/>And that's all that's needed to make this film great. Witty dialogue, interesting scenarios and great performances. Suspects is better than the sum of its parts. Some things are under-developed, like the apparent irrelevance of Keaton's 'love(?)' interest. But an exceptional plot, with one of the greatest twists ever that I can't talk about, makes this film a modern classic. 8.9/10"

Also, seeing Giancarlo Esposito from TV's Breaking Bad was pretty great.<br/><br/>The twist wasn't all that shocking, but maybe that has to do with the fact that I had read something about it before.

","A+ I haven't looked much into the mystery genre, but I must say this film drew me in with ease and intrigued me even more so once the credits rolled. I definitely recommend viewing it more than once, because seeing it just one time is nowhere enough to soak up all the details. With each viewing you pick up more, and, as I have, garner a greater appreciation for this movie. It is helmed by Bryan Singer, who directs his films by focusing on atmosphere and character.<br/><br/>The characters are very interesting ones and the performances are pretty awesome. Stephen Baldwin (McManus), Kevin Pollak (Hockney), and Benicio del Toro(Fenster) are very good at their roles. Pete Postlethwaite was excellent as Kobayashi with his icy composure. The film mostly centers on Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a man of a dubious past and even more threatening cunning. Kevin Spacey is as talented as ever, giving off the fragile nature that mask Verbal Kint, and Agent Kujan's search for the truth of what really happened on that bloody night at the harbor. Despite many of these men appearing imposing the brilliant screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie cleverly turns the con men into pawns of a much bigger ploy than they planned for. And before I forget, John Ottoman is a grand composer, creating music that is chilling and never overplays the moment at hand.<br/><br/>It's such a great mystery that the film will turn your many assumptions on their head multiple times.

","Among thousands of movies available in the market, you might have seen some Suspense/ mystery movies which starts with an act of stupidness and make you fall asleep even before the interval. The twist is none shocking, and actors really make themselves look dim-witted. Well, this is NOT the movie I am talking about. This is what you call a perfect supence movie. Simply classic. ""The Usual Suspects"" starts with a boat being destroyed and the movie revolves around 5 suspects who are in circle of suspect of the Police and FBI. The presentation is great, all the actors have done a great job. A few movies like these are like a time machine. You never know what you are going to see next and they take you to a journey where you dive into the very depth. I am talking about movies like The ShawShank Redemption, Memento, and The Usual Suspects. Unlike other Suspense movies, though you may be able to guess how the movie will end ( which happens in almost all the Suspense movies), in the case of TUS , I guarantee you will never know about how the movie has taken a twist until the movie ends maybe because the script is so great, a double thumbs up to the writers.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit puzzling at times and you will need to gearup your brain to understand the depth of the drama, but the things get more and more exciting, knotty and ass kicking when the term ""Keyser Söze"" starts to kick in. Lots of great dialouges and quote in the movie, including "" Give me the ****ing keys you ****sucker"" which of course does not make sense at all but WILL have a smile on your face (if you are an adult i.e.) when the police ask them to tell it. Names in the movie are unique and different, names like Kobayashi, kaisor Soze really add Suspense/mystery to the scenes as they are not the names that are used often (not in the US or any western society). Till date I have watched this movie like 4 times, and wont stop watching this movie once in every 2/3 months until I get bored of it, which I know will never happen. I give this movie a 9, a minus one because, the movie needs full attention from the start to the end. If you don't, you might want to click the red button at the top right corner of your media player. All in all, a great movie, a huge suspense, will take you to the edge of your seat and find your fingernails all chewed up till the very end.

"slverstargirl9","Null","0","0","20 June 2011"," Great film with a strong theme and clever use of camera angles
","**May contain spoilers**<br/><br/>The film The Usual Suspects has a flashback driven plot that tells the story of why several criminals are killed and a freighter was destroyed. Throughout the film there is a running theme that people cannot escape the beliefs that others impose on them. As I provide a plot summary, I intend to show the connection between this theme and the plot points as well as how different film techniques such as angle and lightening contribute towards this theme. <br/><br/>The film opens with Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) seated on the deck of a freighter and lighting a cigarette. He tosses the still lit matches on a trail of gasoline but it is extinguished from by faceless figure in a suit and hat aboard an upper level of the freighter. The figure descends the stairs past some dead bodies to stand before Keaton, the camera pans away and two shots are heard. The camera returns to the faceless figure flicking his lit cigarette to the trail of gasoline creating a fireball that consumes the freighter. <br/><br/>It is the task of the rest of the film to explain this key event and it does so with Roger 'Verbal' Kint a crippled conman as the narrator explaining to a US Customs officer, Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) the sequence of events that led to this event. He recounts that six weeks ago Keaton, Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and himself were all called into a lineup for a truck hijacking. As a result of this meeting in a lineup they decide to do a job together. Keaton is reluctant because he'd gone straight, but is coerced by Kint to do it. Another factor for why Keaton agrees is that he doesn't believe he can go straight with Kujan always breathing down his neck. This relentless refusal to allow Keaton to try and better himself is further evidence of the theme.<br/><br/>However one job becomes two and before they know it, they are in front of Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), a lawyer for the infamous Keyser Soze. He is there on Soze's behalf to request they stop the drug deal of one of Soze's competitors. Soze is a kingpin in the world of crime and Kobayashi provides evidence that each of them has stolen from Soze and they must perform this job for him in order to atone. He also explains that Soze set up the lineup in New York in order to get them together. They don't like the idea of working for him, and Fenster even leaves in the middle of the night to avoid it. However, once Fenster's body is discovered and threats are made against each of the remaining crook's family members, they concede that they must do the job.<br/><br/>Initially the job goes smoothly. Kint stays behind per Keaton's orders, Hockney sets the explosives, Keaton plays the decoy and McManus uses his sharp-shooting skills. But then Hockney is shot from behind and Keaton and McManus don't find any drugs on the ship. Then McManus is stabbed in the back and Keaton is shot in the back by the faceless figure and we are back to the first scene in the movie with the faceless figure on an upper level of the freighter. <br/><br/>As Kint is recounting his story, an FBI agent named Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) is investigating some of the survivors of the freighter disaster, specifically one Hungarian man who saw Keyser Soze's face. He has a translator and a sketch artist working with the Hungarian to come up with a drawing of Soze. Baer also discovers that one of the dead bodies was a crook turned states evidence who had seen Soze's face and knew many details about his business. It was this person and his knowledge that was being sold, not drugs. Soze organized the attack by Keaton and his crew so that he could go after Marquez. Kujan informs Kint of this and theorizes that Keaton is Keyser Soze and offers to have him turn state's evidence and protection. Kint refuses saying that he's not a rat and that he'll take his chances. <br/><br/>At this point, Kint retrieves his belongings, a gold watch, a gold cigarette lighter and a pack of cigarettes. Kujan and his Los Angeles contact Sgt Rabin (Dan Hedaya) are talking in Rabin's office where the interview with Kint had been conducted. As they're talking, Kujan looks around Rabin's office and sees words that were prominent in his conversation with Kint where amongst papers on Rabin's corkboard behind where Kujan had been sitting. He drops his coffee cup and it shatters on the ground. Specifically he sees Redfoot as an alias on a wanted poster and on the bottom of his coffee cup is the name Kobayashi. There are multiple shots of his coffee cup hitting the floor from different angles that helps set the tone of the big reveal. Furthermore the use of previously spoken dialogue while Kujan is spotting the words emphasizes the impact of what has been discovered. <br/><br/>He runs out to look for Kint as the fax comes in from the hospital where the Hungarian was dictating Soze's appearance and the faxed drawing looks like Kint. The camera cuts to Kint, focusing on his legs as he walks with the limp and crippled leg we've seen throughout the film, and within a few steps he's walking normally (Kint becoming Soze) and gets into a car with Kobayashi while Kujan is still on the street looking for him. <br/><br/>Again, this is a great film. In a manner, the theme is similar to the relationship between Samwise Gamgee and Sméagol/Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy where Sam refuses to allow Gollum to escape his past. In both cases, an antagonist's refusal to allow the protagonist to grow keeps them from being a better person."

","The Usual Suspects is a film that keeps the mind open and in wonder all the way through to the end. The movie begins with an explosion on a ship which has killed all but two men. One of the men, Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey) is brought in for questioning. Kint's story begins when a truck full of weapons is stolen. The police have no suspects so a lineup of five criminals that reside in the city are brought together. While waiting to be released, an all-star cast of criminals, consisting of Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack) decide that they would pull off a heist together. <br/><br/>As the heists become more elaborate, the criminals find themselves in the presence of a Mr. Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) who works for a Kaiser Soze. Soze, who some of the men consider a myth, offers to forget about the men's past actions against Soze in return for their participation in one last heist. The mystery of Kaiser Soze, and the events as Kint recalls them, helps create a plot, similar to that of Reservoir Dogs (1992), which causes the viewer to make attempts to discover the identity of Soze, but as the events continue many of the initial identities are ruled out; mostly because they end up dead.<br/><br/>Excellent acting by almost every cast member really creates an atmosphere that brings you into the movie. Kevin Spacey (who won an Oscar for his role) does a remarkable job of maintaining a character that appears to have cerebral palsy. Mr. Baldwin's acting, however, did not win him an Oscar for obvious reasons. His 'crazy' character was only crazy when Mr. Baldwin was over-the-top acting, causing a feeling of disinterest in the movie. When he wasn't acting 'crazy', he appeared to be in his element with his character.<br/><br/>Background music and low-key lighting help create a menacing feeling throughout the movie. With the exception of a few scenes which take place in the open daylight, the low-key lighting brings an additional level of eeriness to many scenes in the film. With the help of some sinister background music and sound effects, the overall creepiness of the film is enhanced, but does not interfere with the scenes events.<br/><br/>Overall, The Usual Suspects was an extremely entertaining movie with only a hint of gore and excellent acting. The mystery of the film is only revealed at the very end and takes a keen eye to discover the identity of Kaiser Soze before the film reveals it and is a must-see for action-adventure, mystery, and drama enthusiasts."

","This was an admittedly good movie.<br/><br/>It opens with an ex-cop named Keaton on board a ship. He seems seriously injured.

The next day,a detective named Kujan interrogates the key witness, Verbal Kint, a crippled small time thief who has apparently gotten immunity and posted bail.

","The Usual Suspects was released in 1995. Christopher McQuarrie was the writer and it was directed by Bryan Singer, and edited by John Ottman. <br/><br/>In the movie there are five primary characters. Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) is a crippled man who serves as the brains. Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is a former police officer. McManus (Stephen Baldwin) is extremely happy but crazy, and Tod Hockney (Kevin Pollack) is extremely odd and Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) has trouble speaking correctly. The twist of the film is that not all of the characters are who they are perceived to be. These five characters are forced in to a police lineup because they are suspicious. To get back at the cops they all join forces. They begin to take more jobs because they are offered money. They find out that the person who is hiring them is named Keyser Soze. Keyser Soze is believed to be the ultimate bad guy that everyone should be scared of. <br/><br/>This film includes many visual references and flashbacks to previous scenes in order to tie in the current plot. The editing of the film seems to be extremely tasteful. Even though there are quick scene changes throughout the entire film, the editing never interrupts the flow of the story. In order for members of the audience to get the most out of this film, it is crucial to pay full attention to details. The story-line is fairly complex because of the many characters. The lighting of the film seems to be fairly natural but dark. Specifically when some of the characters encounter Keyser Soze, Keyser's face is completely hidden from to light to conceal his identity.The final scene of the movie is monumental. They close with a specific quote that summarizes the entire experience of watching the film. This movie is extremely well done."

","The film The Usual Suspects directed by Bryan Singer is a suspenseful crime thriller. The film has an assortment of attention-grabbing characters starting with Gabriel Byrne who plays Dane Keaton a stoic ex-cop who has a way of making people and witnesses disappears. Next, Kevin Spacey plays Roger ""Verbal"" Kent con artists with cerebral palsy's disease and squealer. Next, Stephen Baldwin plays Micheal McManus a hot tempered and risky thief willing to gamble with his life for major profit. Next, Benicio Del Toro Micheal McManus partner ""Fence"" a mobster with a passion for destroying the English language. Finally, Kevin Pollack plays Todd Hackney a wise guy thief with a love of explosives. The film would not be complete without detectives. Every great mystery movie has to have detectives. Giancarlo Esposito plays FBI agent Jack Baer and Chazz Palminteri completes the cast as US customs agent David Kujan. The themes of the movie are illusions; nothing is what it appears to be and mystery. From the beginning of the movie, you are enthralled in mystery. A boat blows up, close to thirty men slaughtered and rumored ninety million dollars worth of goods on the boat. The question is what was on the boat? Who was on the boat? And at the end of it who is this mythological criminal named Keyser Soze? So immediately, the detectives are on top of it. The detectives begin investigating but know learn nothing so they stage a smoke out. They wrangle up five criminals that are always up to mischief and seem to know a lot of information. Dane Keaton, Verbal, McManus, Fence, and Todd are arrested and held until the detectives can squeeze some information out of them. Meanwhile, the criminals begin talking amongst themselves and criminal do what normally they are inclined to do. It is plot on evil ways of making crime. Dane Keaton is reluctant because he trying to fly straight. The criminals eventually find out the detectives are only blowing smoke and have zilch. Dane Keaton quickly makes bail due to his high profiled lawyer lover. So on the steps of leaving the precinct, the men peer into each other eye as though they have figured out what they are going to embark on next. They form a team and begin doing crime for profit. Next, they run into a so called character name Red Foot and he gives them a heist. They commit a robbery for jewels. The heist ends up as a let down. They come away with some cocaine. Immediately, frustrated and upset they begin arguing with each other. Then out of know where they learn of the so called mystery upper echelon boss through a Mr. Kobayashi. Then, on out the plot thickens. This film reminds me of the film Sherlocke Holmes (2009) directed by Guy Ritchie. It is suspenseful, mysterious, and a roller-coaster packed full of illusions. In the film Sherlocke Holmes, you have to watch it to the very end just like you will have to do this film which screams ending full of twists. Two things that are specialized in this film are characterization and narration. The narration of this film is done by Verbal in a flash back method. He sits in the office and spills the beans. He tells the story from his perspective. In any crime movie, a criminal perspective can always be subjective due to modus operandi. Characterization is done by having two of the main characters Dane and Verbal. Dane is a strong powerful, stoic, and cold blooded killer with intellect. On the other, hand you have Verbal a wimpy, cripple, mouthy, and equally divisive person. These two compliments each other like the two characters off of The Andy Griffith Show. Remember in a mystery movie, clues are every where. Criminals are often multifaceted and cannot be generalized, and every one has an angle when money is involved. If you remember any thing from this review remember nothing is as it seems or is it?"

","Nothing is as it appears in 1995's mystery thriller The Usual Suspects. Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie create an intricate puzzle that demands a viewer's total focus in order to unravel the mystery. The twist at the end is the final piece that points to the gullibility of people, including the viewing audience.<br/><br/>The movie begins ""last night"" and continues to travel between the past and the present in a series of flashbacks to untangle the story. After a Hungarian ship in a California harbor is attacked and set afire, leaving alive only a badly burned foreigner and a cripple aptly named Verbal, the story begins to unfold through the voice-over narration supplied by Verbal. According to Verbal, it all began weeks ago when he and four other criminals were brought together on suspicion of hijacking a truck. Placed in a lineup and then later held together in a cell during questioning, the five criminals plot revenge against the police for hassling them. Stephen Baldwin as McManus portrays a career criminal and expert shooter who is appropriately menacing and threatening. He is tempered by side kick Fenster, played by Benico Del Toro, who provides some comic relief through his mumbling, half-incoherent speech. Kevin Pollack plays Hockney, a criminal with a major chip on his shoulder. Rounding out the line-up of five is Gabriel Byrne whose character Keaton is that of a corrupt ex-cop who is trying to go straight. He needs convincing to join the group and that is left to Verbal, the mild-mannered, seemingly harmless crippled con man played by Kevin Spacey. After their successful revenge job, the five travel from New York to California where they take on a job that eventually puts them in the path of the infamous and mysterious Hungarian criminal Soze, who blackmails them into committing a major cocaine theft. All of this leads back to the burned ship and the attack in the harbor. Verbal, who while telling this story is in the company of Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a Customs official who very badly wants to pin crimes on Keaton, even linking Keaton to the frightening and elusive Soze, is the only survivor of the original suspects. What appears to be a drug deal gone bad turns into a need to unmask the mysterious Keyser Soze, much as the reporter in Citizen Kane hunts for the meaning behind the word ""Rosebud."" <br/><br/>The flashbacks could be confusing but the voice-over narration of Verbal help weave the action into a clever tale of gullibility and deceit. The twist at the end leaves the viewer feeling just as gullible and deceived as the characters in the movie. Containing a great script, award-winning acting, and a musical score that contributes to the suspense and mystery of the film, this movie is well-worth the time to view it---several times."
"haller04","9","0","0","28 July 2010"," The film is an exhilarating mental battle.
","The film is an exhilarating mental battle between Verbal Kint (Spacey) and U.S. Customs agent Dave Kujan (Palminteri) keeps the action of the film intense and flowing throughout the film. The verbal battle, interview/ interrogation if you will, was over the heart of the truth behind a ship exploding in a California port. The central concern of the film was where to place blame for the master minding of the ship exploding in the harbor. The setting for the film was within the walls of a detective's office that happened to be extremely cluttered. A box of cigarettes along with the subsequent lighting of the cigarettes becomes an important piece of the tale and the relevance is only revealed late in the film. Kint was indulging Kujan's curiosity by telling the tale of the five suspects that were rounded up six weeks earlier by some random act of fate, as it appeared early in the film. The five suspects would be directly involved in the ship's destruction after the six weeks. The editing of the film, violently at times, flips the viewers back and forth from present to past and back again. The action, when not being a voyeur of Kint's story, is thrilling and action packed with killing, thievery, and tense meetings with other characters outside of the law. Kint's story is complex, intriguing, and the details are difficult to follow. However, if the viewer's full attention is given to the viewing, the story is probable. Con artists are seedy and are only out for themselves at every turn. The viewer wants to believe this intricate story of criminality at its finest. A criminal master mind is divulged while Kint is telling his story, Keyser Soze. Kujan badgers Kint into giving up who the alleged Soze really is. Angles and lighting portray Kint as the weaker of the two men in a physical sense. The calmness and deliberate actions of Kint, allowed Kint to maintain some dignity throughout the story. The overriding concern of both Kint and Kujan became predicting, with some reasonable certainty, the real identity of Soze. The overriding concern with a specific element within a film could be compared with the intensity of the meaning to Rosebud in ""Citizen Kane"". The complexity of the tale is revealed as Kint is walking out of the police station. This film is a definite must see."

","The Usual Suspects is one of the best thrillers of the 90s. It's very rewarding, especially with the huge twist in the end. Visually, it's stunning. The cinematography, the sets, the action is all meshed together, but in a good way. Though the story and direction seem to be on spot, there is one HUGE moment at the 20-25 minute mark that the narrative switches paths. It's done horribly. It confused the heck out of me and probably did most people. I had absolutely no clue what was going on for a minute there. I'm not sure if it was the script or the director who complicated it, but it certainly didn't function. That being said, the story (other than the plot point I just mentioned) is extremely well-written. It pulls the rug out from under you in the end, after already pulling a ""Trick Twist"". It's wonderfully done. There are some very suspenseful moments in here as well. The ending especially. The acting is incredible. The ensemble is wonderful, but can't hold up to what Kevin Spacey does in this film. He is downright electrifying. The film's huge flaw will test some audiences, but Spacey is just sublime here; 8.5- 9."

","This is a movie review I wrote for my English course at the Community College of Denver. I hope it helps give some added insight to this incredible movie. Enjoy!<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects<br/><br/>If you are looking for beautiful women, breath-taking CGI, and hilarious comedy then look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for an elaborate plot and brilliant twist of an ending then ""The Usual Suspects"" is a movie I would highly recommend. The story begins with five well-known criminals being put into a police line-up and getting asked to say a particular line. This setup quickly turns into a complex investigation that revolves around the simple question, ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" It is cleverly directed by Bryan Singer, and I would even go so far as to consider it the best mystery movie I have ever seen. Though I would not consider the score and special effects anything to be awed by, what really makes this movie so good is the incredible cast of actors, the gripping plot, and one of the greatest twist-endings in cinematic history.<br/><br/>To begin, the acting in this movie is certainly not something that can be overlooked. Kevin Spacey plays the role of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, a cripple and one of the suspects whose version of the story we are seeing through the mind of Dave Kujan, a detective played by Chazz Palminteri. Kint's explanation of the events are what shapes the entire plot, and Kevin Spacey's portrayal of him could not have been better. He was even deservedly awarded Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars that year for his role. Gabriel Byrne's acting of another of the suspects, Dean Keaton, was also breathtaking. There are several one-on-one interactions between Keaton and Kint in the film that help to pull the viewer even deeper into the plot and shape the ending. Their on-screen chemistry is prefect, and I do not believe either one of those roles could have been played better. The cast of the five suspects is also complimented by Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, and Kevin Pollack who play the other three crooks in the lineup. Their performances are equally amazing and add to the overall feel of the film. Del Toro especially, whose adaptation of Fred Fenster is unlike anything he has ever done before. If not for the Oscar-worthy acting by everyone involved, the movie would certainly be far-less riveting.<br/><br/>Then, another aspect of what makes this movie so incredible would have to be the gripping plot. From the lineup at the start till the brilliant twist at the end, this movie grabs you and will not let you go. All of it centers around the mystery of what happened on a ship that caused 27 people to die. Only two men can fill in the blanks. One of them is a badly burned and comatose Hungarian, and the other is Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, a gimp crook. His story of what happened involves five suspects that were brought together, a man named Keyser Soze, and several intense heists. The plot is so elaborately constructed that leaving for even a few minutes could cause you to miss something important. Though it may seem difficult to have to pay attention to every little bit of information you are being shown, I believe that it is one of the most beautiful and unique aspects of this film. Every little detail is made to fit perfectly with the twist at the end, making it so that every time you watch this movie you notice something new and intriguing. <br/><br/>Finally, the jaw-dropping plot twist at the end of the film is what completes this story. Without giving too much away, Kint finishes his explanation to Kujan about what happened on the boat that left 27 dead, and Kujan then aggressively confronts Kint about what he believes really happened and who he really believes Keyser Soze is. Just when you believe everything has been figured out, Kujan comes to a realization that takes your breath away. Even the way Kujan comes to this realization could not have been filmed better. It consists of a sequence of shots from his point of view that puts everything together for both him and the viewer so that you feel like you are coming to this shocking conclusion with him. Your mind will be running back to all the previous events as you piece together all the little details leading up to what just happened. In the end, I was left with a sense of wonder at how someone could come up with something so brilliant. It is hands down the best twist ending I have ever seen and a fitting conclusion to a great movie. <br/><br/>""Who is Keyser Soze?"" This simple question helps to create one of the best mystery movies of all-time. In fact, the American Film Institute ranked it at #10 in their list of the greatest movies in the genre. The incredible cast of actors, the elaborate plot, and the breathtaking twist-ending all come together to create this masterpiece. So next time you decide to watch a movie in your spare time, keep in mind ""The Usual Suspects"". I would highly recommend it."

","Five professional criminals meet when they are pulled on a trumped-up charge into a police lineup in New York City. They plot a revenge job which goes well, but are then blackmailed by a shadowy figure, Keyser Söze, into hijacking a big drugs buy. Is Söze for real, and if so, what is his secret agenda ?<br/><br/>In my view, The Usual Suspects is the best crime thriller of the nineties and one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Perhaps what's most astonishing about it is the confidence and style of director Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie, both of whom had only made one feature film before (the low budget Public Access). The movie was made independently and for pretty meagre money but looks sensational, has a deliciously harebrained mind-bending plot, truckloads of fancy-pants dialogue (""Now you talk to me, or that precious immunity they seem so fit to grant you won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.""), an elegant and stylish atmosphere, and a payoff of such witty proportions that I guarantee you will never forget it. Most movies, if they're well made, have maybe two or three really interesting characters in them - this one has at least eight, and every crazy situation they're thrown into brings out all of their intriguing facets. Why did Keeton reform ? Who is Kobayashi, and does he even exist ? Why is McManus such a hothead ? What is Fenster saying ? And of course, is Verbal really who we think he is ? These characters dance around each other in such variable and complex circles that just when you think you've got a handle on things the movie pulls the rug out from under you again. Repeated viewings only enhance the delicious enjoyment of this, and the entire cast seem to peg exactly the tone Singer is going for. Spacey is simply unforgettable (watch his eyes as he reads the cue card in the lineup) and won an Academy Award, Byrne is a supercool bad apple, Del Toro gives an amazing, career-making, what-in-the-hell-was-that physical performance, and Palminteri takes the standard cop exposition part and revs it up so high it shifts the entire movie up a gear. Another crucial element is the combination of the equally brilliant score and editing, both by John Ottman. The link between music and cutting is vital in any film, and how many professional movies have it done by the same person (aside from Ottman's work with Singer, John Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 13 is the only other example I can think of). There is a delicious tap-tap-tap suspense score with heavy strings which ticks along like a pressure cooker, and pares everything to the tense minimum; the action scenes are taut and fast, and Ottman carefully reserves a few choice moments to take his time, like the scene where Verbal shoots the jewel dealer. The movie is a textbook in good editing for pacing, atmosphere and suspense. There are some films which just seem to gel together seamlessly and this is one - it's a gleefully evil flick, hand crafted with loving care by and for those who love crime stories and gangster pictures. McQuarrie (who was twenty-seven) deservedly won an Academy Award for his script; Singer (a ripe old thirty) should have won as well - the two have since teamed again on Valkyrie. Trivia - the memorable title comes from a throwaway line in Casablanca."

After all, once one unravels the film's central mystery it cannot possibly produce the same reaction again. That being said, the film is one of those instances whereby a repeat viewing is rewarding since actions and events take on a different meaning.<br/><br/>The cast is surprisingly good for a low-budget film. Securing Gabriel Byrne was a coup and Kevin Spacey delivered the goods in an Academy Award-winning performance. The rest of the cast includes dependable character actors like Pete Postlethwaite, Chazz Palminteri, Giancarlo Esposito & Dan Hedaya. Benicio del Toro stands out in a memorable supporting role but I have to say that Stephen Baldwin & Kevin Pollak leave something to be desired. Nevertheless, on the whole, the acting is in good hands.<br/><br/>However, it's the screenplay that justifiably gets most of the credit for making this film memorable. Opening with the aftermath of an apparent drug deal gone wrong, we're led through the preceding events as related by 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey). He tells of how the titular 'usual suspects' got together and how they came to be embroiled in a mystery that has the cops baffled. All of this leads to a climax that I can only say I hope no-one has spoiled for you.<br/><br/>On the technical side, Bryan Singer's direction is well-handled as he manages to imbue the film with a distinct sense of style without going overboard. Editor John Ottman also scored the picture and he did a fine job on both counts. The efforts of Singer & Ottman give the film a polish that defies its relatively low budget.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's difficult for me to judge this film (or any film with a twist) since I've seen it multiple times. That being said, the fact that I have seen it multiple times shows that the vaunted twist is only a part of the film's appeal. Nevertheless, for a first time viewing I'd be tempted to bump the film's rating up to a 9 out of 10."

","This movie raised the bar for cinema. The writing is perfect, no doubt. and Gabriel Bryne more than exceeded my expectations. Stephen Baldwin was very captivating in his role as McManus. But the true beauty was Kevin Spacey as Verbal. He guides you through the movie with a smugness about him, even though he appears to be the weakest of the criminals. The ending will leave you asking ""what just happened?!"" Half way into this movie, you know it isn't just another crime film. And nobody could pull off that ending as well as Spacey did. Another wonderful aspect of this film is that you can watch it again and again, and it doesn't get old. The creators put so much in that you don't notice the first time around (even if you think you are paying attention.) If you like good movies, I cannot recommend this movie enough. The only thing I wish the creators would have gone into more, was Keaton and his girlfriend. The movie tried to convey that she was the main reason that Keaton tried to turn his life around, and yet they don't really get into their relationship in the movie. But they do an EXCELLENT job of showing the life of crime, portrayed by all the other characters. Which ultimately lures Keaton back. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"

","This movie is undoubtedly among the best thrillers i have ever seen till date. Most thrillers, after leaking any twist it has, make the movie dull for watching 2nd time. But this movie is otherwise. And u will love watching repeatedly to see the beauty of the screenplay and dialogues. The way in which the story unfolds is initially confusing, but is very gripping. All the actors have been brilliant. The way in which the Keyser Soze is characterized is also awesome. This movie has one of the greatest twists, (even better than The Sixth Sense), and one is forced to rewind back to previous scenes to get convinced. This will be well appreciated if one sees this without much hype, and not reading and spoiler reviews, Since all the people who have rated low are misled by the hype."

","Be prepared for whats coming.<br/><br/>You will never even know what hit you.<br/><br/>This just maybe the best crime/ thriller/ drama/ action movie around. Though this is not one of Kevin Spacey’s best roles, it is one that should not be missed. Almost the entire movie is a flash back that suits the plot very well. It’s a wonder how this movie was not even nominated for best picture at the Oscars. There are no technical achievements, no slapstick dialogues, and no wondrous action stunts. Even so the movie has the power to engage you and just for cruelty’s sake it gives you a hard kick on the butt in the end. You will feel like slapping yourself a couple of times to recover from shock and for being so blind that you could not realize the truth that was staring you in the face, right from the beginning.<br/><br/>The movie flows so brilliantly and in the end “just like that *click*, its gone.”"
"vinnieboards","10","0","0","20 June 2009"," A real villain with menace who may not even exist!
","I'm posting here to have real good moan. Not at the film which is absolutely stunning but the moronic comments posted here.<br/><br/>Point 1 - Gabriel Byrne's accent? A number of posts complain about Mr Byrne's stupid accent. It is an Irish accent. He is from Dublin. It is HIS accent!!<br/><br/>Point 2 - I guessed the plot twist? No you didn't. Why do I say this? Because the vast majority of smart arses who say they guessed the plot twist hate the film. I think the reality is that these people feel some inadequacy about being duped and then not getting the twist at the end. Well I didn't get the twist and for me it made the film even more enjoyable. Just take it on the chin like I did.<br/><br/>Point 3 - anyone of them could have been Keyser Soze? Sorry did I miss something? Keysor Soze could be the greatest movie villain of all time that doesn't even exist. Is Verbal Kint Key Soze? Or Kobayashi perhaps? The fact is we are left not knowing - Keyser Soze could be the most elaborate confidence trick of all time which adds to the films overwhelming charm.<br/><br/>So why is The Usual Suspects so good? Whilst all the actors give a first class performance (Byrne's struggle between staying on the good side of the law or accepting what he is, Baldwin's psychotic lust for the big job or Spacey's persona as a loner and low life), for me Pete Postlewaite steals the film. Steven Spielberg has stated that he considers him to be the best character actor on the planet and here is a fine example of his work.<br/><br/>Mysterious, sometimes sinister, lulling the 5 protagonists with an air of vulnerability stemming from his fear of not carrying out his masters orders, he probably only appears in the film for no more than 15 minutes and yet his presence is there throughout.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect (no film can rightly lay claim to perfection)but as an entertaining and engaging thriller its pretty damn close. <br/><br/>So in summary, accept the film for what it is - a cracking yarn which ramps up tension about a monster gangster who may just be a figment of Kint's and Kobayashi's imagination. For me it's in the same class as LA Confidential as a 90's thriller par excellence.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it buy it - its a must have for your collection."

","I knew the secret to this for years before I ever got a chance to watch it. That it was still immensely effective should provide an idea of how well-made this is. This was Singer and McQuarrie's second feature, together and at all, and they both do incredible in it. The direction is beyond reproach. The writing is spot-on, in all areas. The dialog, which is also well-delivered, the characters, all of them treated to perfect portrayals, and the plot, that develops impeccably. The acting is excellent, there's not a single performance that can particularly be criticized. Cinematography in this is gorgeous. The editing is sharp and marvelous. This is film-making at its finest. I understand the arguments for the twist of this being cheap, and thus the overall movie, undeserving of the praise it receives. I don't agree, however. As the ending unfolds before our eyes, the point of this becomes clear. Highly interesting use of the concept made famous on celluloid in Rashômon. A certain aspect of this, I don't know if it was intentional, or a sacrifice necessary by virtue of the fact that this was made in Hollywood, and for the mainstream crowd, but while it is unfortunate, you can't have everything. There is little to no visual sexuality, various disturbing content, some relatively mild violence and plenty of strong language. I recommend this to any fan of competent thrillers and/or any of the people behind it. 10/10"

"hnt_dnl","10","0","0","13 July 2008"," A maddeningly meticulous and crafty film!
","My top 10 films of the 90s EASILY include this film, THE USUAL SUSPECTS. I remember seeing it shortly after it first came out in 1995 and being enthralled by the story, dialogue, and characters, then came the punchline at the end! No matter, I still think of it as a fascinating piece of film-making. Because of the trick ending, it is debatable as to what is real or not in the film. If you watch it objectively, it is just a damn entertaining, complex, well-plotted film noir piece with an exciting climax. If you take the subjective route, which you pretty much have to because of the ending, then what you've got is perhaps the most puzzling film ever made, one that even with multiple repeated viewings will make you second (and third and fourth, etc.) guess yourself. Regardless, THE USUAL SUSPECTS is one spectacular film! <br/><br/>THE USUAL SUSPECTS starts off with the film's supposed protagonist, Dean Keaton (terrifically played by Gabriel Byrne), being assassinated by a mysterious figure (unseen to the viewer) named 'Keyser'. I think it's safe to say that this opening scene is objectively told. It really happened. Then Keyser burns the ship that Keaton and a bunch of other men (who we find out about later) are on. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the cops and FBI question the sole survivor of this massacre, Verbal Kint (played by Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Kevin Spacey). Verbal is the only one who can tell what happened. He is our link to the story of THE USUAL SUSPECTS.<br/><br/>Leading the investigation is US Customs Agent Dave Kujon (effectively played by Chazz Palmentieri). Kujon grills Kint relentlessly in order to piece together all the events that led up to the massacre. Kint begins with the events weeks before when Kujon and his fellow agents had arrested Keaton and the other 'usual' suspects Kint, Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). These 5 men were suspected of a hijacking and were brought in for questioning.<br/><br/>As Kint continues and the film progresses, we find that the 5 criminals were manipulated into the situation by Keyser Soze, a Hungarian uber-gangster/drug dealer who they all think is really a myth until his #1 lackey Kobyashi (played with cold efficiency by Pete Posthlewaite) pays them a visits after their release from jail and tells them that indeed Soze is behind all this. Soze wants them to to do job for him by killing his Hungarian competitors, who are making a huge drug deal with some Argentinians on a ship docked in LA. This leads us to the climax and back to the events that started the film.<br/><br/>THE USUAL SUSPECTS, whatever one's feelings about the surprise at the end, is one brilliant example of modern day film noir. Nobody is innocent, yet every major character is multi-dimensional and draws you into the story. There is quite a bit of action and violence, but it is tight, well-placed, and quite convincing. The beauty of the film is that you can watch it at least two different ways: objectively to be entertained and subjectively to try to figure out what the heck is really going on! The acting is uniformly superb, the Oscar-winning screenplay crackles, and the film is NEVER dull. One of the best of the 90s!"
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","0","12 July 2008"," Never believe appearances, or how you can fool the police
","It is not a recent film, indeed. The Twin Towers are still standing. We are entering the profiling era and it was tempting for criminals to return the favor, though they have always done that. They here profile the police and their investigative methods. If you satisfy the police's way of thinking you will go through their net with no difficulty. You just have to convince the cop that a certain criminal does not exist, that this criminal projects you in some kind of legend or saga, is a bogeyman under the bed or in the closet. If the cops are convinced that this bogeyman is a pure collective invention, some folklore in another word, they will just shrug their shoulders and consider the one who is telling the story is, like all the others, haunted or possessed by a phantasm. And it works. He is the only survivor, or nearly, and he convinces them that his criminal persona is a myth. They are dubious, suspicious, skeptical and many other things, but they cannot imagine you are that myth, that criminal and that you are fooling them massively. To play on the impossibility for these cops to believe such a story can exist is your best diversion, disguise. They are ready to buy a lot but not that someone who is a coward, a weak person, a subservient non-entity, what's more a cripple, can be that ruthless, pitiless and unwavering mastermind of crime. Of course the punch line of the film is that the cop realizes he has been fooled because this cripple being the mastermind is the only explanation why he knows all he knows: he knows too much to just be an accidental witness. And the punch line is doubled with the composite picture of this fantasized criminal as seen by the other survivor who should not have survived and the criminal does not know he is still alive who has seen him very distinctly. This composite picture, a very sketchy image, is arriving on the fax machine as the cripple straightens up and gets into the car that was waiting for him outside the police station. Too late. This tactic has been used by other thrillers, but in this case it is very persuasive and the film works very well provided we do not profile the thriller-maker, otherwise we would know the end before the film ever starts.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

","A boat has been destroyed, criminals are dead, and the key to this mystery lies with the only survivor and his twisted, convoluted story beginning with five career crooks in a seemingly random police lineup. But the question is...who's the one controlling everything? Simply put, this film is a deceptive maze of lies-not clues. For example, I'll start off by saying how the character we are getting our supply of information, the crippled Verbal Kint ( Kevin Spacey): is clearly an 'unreliable narrator.' Secondly, all of the information Kint is describing through flashbacks or not, is for Kujan's satisfaction. Remember, Kujan keeps saying he is ' smarter' than him. Remember the line ""My guess is you'll never see him again."" Verbal wanted Kujan to know that he was outsmarted, ever since Kujan told him he was smarter than him.<br/><br/>Fantastic acting all the way around from Spacey to: Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak, and Benico Del Toro. Christopher McQuarrie also created a real unique and fresh script.<br/><br/>The brilliant thing about this film is how you can simply watch one scene once, and then re-watch it and find something that'll peak your interest. A what in the hell just happened moment. For example, the scene where both Kint and Kujan are drinking coffee with Kint literally reading from the bottom of the mug. Or the scene on the boat where Bryan Singer once again, adds a masterful touch, by having Gabriel Byrne's character, Keaton dress up in a fedora and trenchcoat...... Did he just kill himself? Huh? What just happened?"
"Mosquito_Maps","10","0","0","1 January 2008"," The best film of the 90's - But more than just a twist
","I still find it unbelievable that a fairly amateur team in Singer and McQuarrie (at the time) could produce one of the greatest films of all time. This film is pretty much flawless and it definitely the smartest most stylish (even more than any Tarantino flick) film of the 90's and is probably the memorable for me personally ever.<br/><br/>It hinges on the brilliantly crafted script and plot from McQuarrie (something he has never been able to emulate and never will) and the fantastic acting. The cast is superbly picked with all in question on top form. I love the fact the actors in the film are not the strongest in the world, the fact that we see Stephen Baldwin acting superbly is incredible and also i feel it the greatest ever performance from Gabriel Byrne and the same can be said about Chazz Palminteri who is fantastic as Agent Kujan.<br/><br/>However the show as usual was stolen by Spacey. This film portrays Spacey's versatility as an actor and is his finest performance to date which earned him the a well-deserved Oscar (all be it in the wrong category.) Spacey's presence is subtle but yet very effective as the entire film really hinges on him and he pulls it off fantastically. This film i feel began to establish why Spacey is the most interesting and versatile actor since Nicholson and i feel puts him on a par with De Niro, Pacino, Hopkins etc. but of course that is not forgetting his other great performances.<br/><br/>It would be a crime in itself if i did not mention the twist. The greatest twist of all time..... yes for sure better than the sixth sense and many others for the reason that on repeated viewing the number of clues you spot as to the identity of soze makes you really feel like you've been flipped and completely outsmarted. It is of course more than just a twist but of course that is what you remember on reflection but that can't be helped.<br/><br/>I loved this film for so many reasons and it is definitely the best film i've ever seen and definitely the best of the 90's as i feel it is more stylish than the like of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs and more memorable than other neo-noir crime film of the 90's.

"countvonbarron","Null","0","0","8 November 2007"," who says the movie is a lie?
","I take issue with the people who say the whole movie cheats and is a lie. ALL movies cheat. That is why they are fiction. They are stories. Actors are acting. They are paid to lie essentially. And the best of them make you believe that they are telling the truth. If you want truth go see a documentary. That is what Roger Ebert said. Even movies that are supposedly based on true stories are still dramatizations. They are the vision of the director and the writer. They take liberties with the actual history out of dramatic necessity. And the sets and costumes are recreations of reality. So before people say that the movie doesn't play fair does any movie play totally fair with it's audience? They manipulate reality to tell their story. In fact the greatness of the film is the complexity of it. One user commented that all the suspects were dead except verbal. But Fenster wasn't killed on the boat. Was he really killed? Did he actually exist? Also what if Keyser Soze was actually 2 people Spacey and Pete Posthelwaite. That would explain why the Hungarian in the hospital saw his hair when he was wearing a hat. Spacey could have been a hit-man for Soze. In fact maybe the fax at the end was a deception. Was that Soze? The Hungarian thought it was but what if that is what the spacey character wanted him to think. Finally as to the comment that verbal was dumb to let himself get caught I say he was the smartest person in the movie.He liked toying with Agent Kujan and knew he could slip out from under his nose. Just to prove his superiority. Much like Hannibal Lecter in ""The silence of the lambs""So the films strength lies in it's complexity. And multiple viewings make it more enjoyable."

","""The Usual Suspects"" is one of those examples in which you can't take things at face value.<br/><br/>As the film starts (Which takes place ""last night""), we see Keaton (Gabriel Byrne)on a ship, bodies all over the place. He looks up to see that a figure is standing there. He address the figure as ""Keyser"" before he is shot. The ship explodes, sending a nice fireball. However, there is one survivor: a cripple named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey)who is telling the story of the events leading to the ship explosion to Agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), who has an ax to grind with Keaton.<br/><br/>We then cut to a few weeks before. Keaton, along with McManus (Stephen Baldwin),Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) and Hockney (Kevin Pollak)are taken in for questioning, along with Kint, about a stolen truck. Hot under the collar for the arrests, they decide to get even by exposing a bit of NYPD corruption and get paid in the process. However, it seems that they soon end up in even worse trouble.<br/><br/>It seems that at one time or another, each of the guys have stolen from Keyser Soze, an underworld figure that is just as mean and rotten to the core as the 5 guys (After all, he did kill his family rather than let his enemies get to them). No one knows who he is or what he looks like (He works through buffers, so no one knows anything about who is giving the orders). He is also incredibly feared, and has a job for our 5 anti-heroes: they are to board a ship to steal nearly $100 million in cocaine. Clearly a suicide mission, they have no choice but to follow through, especially when Soze's lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite)explains quite calmly (Even when threatened with death)just how high the stakes really are.<br/><br/>However, it is the final minutes of the film that will have the moviegoer shaking their head and saying ""What the HELL?"" This is a must see film and it put Bryan Singer (Who has done the XMen films since then)and Kevin Spacey on the map. Dark and full of twists that make a pretzel look straight, ""The Usual Suspects"" is something to watch on a stormy evening."

","I can't believe it took me ten years to finally see this movie and some of the actors aren't even big names anymore. I was finally convinced to download this movie from a friend at work who mentioned that if I liked surprising endings then I would sure like this movie. As I watched this movie I pretty much had a feeling that since there was a twist in this movie someone of the five usual suspects had to be Keyser Soze. Now if he really was or wasn't is another story but the one I guessed it to be was actually correct. I thought to myself what if Kint was actually not handicapped but just pretending to be. But then when they brought up the idea that is was in fact Keaton or so they thought, I thought to myself damn I was wrong. But then right when he drops his cup of coffee I was like IT WAS KINT! and my body got goosebumps for some reason. Also another reason I guess it was Kint was because my friend had also told me that Kevin Spacey had won an Oscar for it. So it would be only fitting for the Best Actor to be the one who is actually the villain in the end. I am fresh off of watching the movie and just got done browsing the threads and boy is there a lot to be discussed about this movie. I wish there was an actual answer to all of the questions brought up but I know that the people who made this movie would like to leave it up to the audience's interpretation on who they think actually is Keyser Soze. This in my opinion makes it one of the top movies on my list because you can actually discuss the movie with friends and makes it a good topic to talk about for hours on end!"

","This film narrowly gets an 8 of 10. My main complaint about the movie and the reason for writing this is to point out the fundamental hole in the movie (here comes the spoilers). The whole point of Soze going after the guy on the ship, and thus the point of the film, is to protect his identity, ""the one guy who could identify him"". However, at the end of the movie, not only does one person know his identity but the police have a sketch and full description of him. He's much worse off at the end of the movie for all his efforts. Yet the closing remarks of ""and like the devil he was gone"" or something to that effect makes it sound like everything has gone as he had planned. It's true he may not be aware that the police have this information on him, maybe it was set up for a possible sequel where the police attempt to apprehend him. Trouble is this failing to cover up his identity takes away from him mystique of being this ultra-cool untouchable underworld figure, he's failed to accomplish his main aim.<br/><br/>Having said that the film has great performances from Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro (who oddly isn't given credit on the cover of my DVD edition).

Never once in the film is it indicated, through dialogue or visually (using standard 'camera tricks' for example) that it was imagination. Each audience member has to either accept the premise that it was a 'fact', or spend every moment of the movie reminding oneself that it was merely another character's guess. No movie should require that much energy from its audience. This wasn't hiding crucial information from the audience, as in Hitchcock films. This was pushing a falsehood onto the viewer.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there is more than one detective questioning him at the time. Which one is actually visualizing what Kint is describing? Certainly two or more individuals would have their own unique interpretation of the description. How do we know that we, the audience, would imagine the same thing? And yet the identical person reemerges in the 'flashback' scenes every time Kint's story continues.<br/><br/>If the wife of the Crowe (Bruce Willis) character in Sixth Sense were to enter the restaurant in the anniversary scene, then we (through the camera) were to step into her point-of-view, and actually see Crowe across the table in the chair, but then at the end of the movie discover he was actually not visible, we would feel ""ripped off"", would we not?<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects commits the same sort of transgression to the audience. Until someone attached to this project can convince me that all of the officers questioning Kint somehow had a shared 'psychic' experience, and imagined exactly and precisely the same person, continually, down to the last long strand of hair, for several hours, I stand by my claim that this was a rip-off."

","It's good but not as good as what I imaged before I rent it. I think maybe that's because I have watched movies like 'LA confidential', 'Seven"" or ""6th Sense"" before I watched this one, so the dramatic ending of this movie did not surprised me at all. Another reason is that, when I was watching it, my wife did not pay attention to it because it is not the movie type she likes, she just took a glance at the screen occasionally while I was watching. When the scene appeared that the ""cripple"" was interrogated by police, my wife said "" I think this guy is the one who did it."". When she said that, she even didn't know what happened before this scene and what case the police is investigating  I said ""No. if that's what it will going, this movie will not be listed in top 20 in IMDB database.""

Unfortunately, this is not one of them.<br/><br/>I agree with Simon P. Beyer who stated that the movie is nothing but a complete waste of time.

By this, I don't mean the movie needed a hot and heavy sex scene.

If this were a military or prison movie I would understand the lack of female characters, but this is supposed to be FILM NOIR!

I couldn't care less about the characters, had no interest in whether they lived or died, the acting was uniformly average, and that it was only a short film was a surprise - it felt a lot longer.<br/><br/>As the film ended, my wife looked at me as if to say, betcha didn't see that coming ... um, that was supposed to be a surprise ending?

","The Usual Suspects is a modern classic. It is an intelligent, complex film, that was well written, acted and directed.

If it was up to me Braveheart wouldn't have won an Oscar and this film should have got Best Film and Best Director. The Usual Suspects treats the audience with some intelligence and makes your brain work, whilst Braveheart see the audience as idiots and tries to get away of with murder when it comes to the fact, plot and characterisation.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is a crime film, which when done right can produce some of the best films made, such as the Godfather and Goodfellas. This film focuses on a one off crime, a raid on a ship which had gone wrong. Verbal (Kevin Spacey), was arrested by the FBI and he tells them the story about the raid and how the team he worked with was formed. This included attacking a secret taxi secret run by crooked cops in New York. It then turns out that these men have all crossed plans with a major crime lord, Keyser Söze and his representative demanded they repay him by taken part in the raid on the ship in San Pedro. It is after that event start to decline for the gang and the raid fails.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects has a great plot twist at the end and trust me it's gob-smacking.

What happens is that 4 of them die and there is only one survivor who narrates the whole journey from the time they all were arrested for a crime they did not commit and how they end up dead  killed by Kaizer Soze. The police try to solve the mystery and find the murderer. Who is the murderer is the final twist in the tale  that is disclosed in the last two minutes.<br/><br/>The only survivor is Verbal (Kevin Spacey) and the four other crooks are Michael McManus (Stephan Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). The interrogating customs officer Dave Kujan is played by Chazz Palminteri. All the actors have acted well and the movie holds interest till the last scene.<br/><br/>But the movie does not live up to the suspense and expectation that it builds. The ending and disclosure of the murderer is childish. One laughs at the Director Bryan Singer on how he thinks of creating suspense  totally foolish. When there are characters who play role in the movie and engage audience in guessing  that make the movie interesting. But coming out with a stupid ending like this does not serve good for the creativity of being a director. With such dubious ending, the director could have taken any option totally unrelated to the movie and presented as if the mystery is solved.<br/><br/>So was there a mystery. Obviously not!

","Thought I'm only 18 years old, I've watched this movie about 14 times now. And I'm proud to say that this movie has never lost its luster and excitement every time I watch it. The plot itself is a stroke of genius, well-followed by an ending that I can only describe quoting my best friend, who said it was ""a kick in the balls"". A crude way to describe it, but it was very apt; I can still recall how my eyes had first widened when the interrogation was coming to a close but I remember more vividly of how my jaw had hung as if someone loosened every screw in my head when I saw the ending.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is not only one of the best movies by far, but I think it sets a standard for any criminal-related movie that seems to be ignored a lot of the time. It's a story of power and manipulation, true guts and will and cunning and cleverness - all characteristics of what I believe to be the ""perfect criminal."" And five crooks, all of who have their own very, very distinct personalities, quirks, and stories that you just can't help but admire and laugh with/at simultaneously. Bryan Singer did a very good job with this movie and that includes all the hiccups from the actors that he worked with --- personally, I wouldn't have had it any other way. You get the moments of chuckles and of surprise throughout the movie and times where you can't help but express sympathy for the characters, especially for Dean Keaton (at least for me, anyway).<br/><br/>When you watch this movie, keep in mind it is not just for light enjoyment like you'd see from any other 2-3.5 star movie that Hollywood likes to put out these days. It is a movie that deserves and earns the audience's full attention otherwise you'll miss out on quite a lot of substance and enjoyment.

","""The Usual Suspects"" is by far one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. The movie tells about 5 crooks, who are brought together for questioning because of a truck hijack in New York. This is followed by a period of events and eventually they all are left with a mission, which a criminal mastermind named Keyser Soze has arranged for them because they all have wronged Soze in certain points of their criminal careers. They have no other choice than do the mission, because they're obviously being blackmailed and also because they just simply have to pay back what they've done in the past. It doesn't go as planned and the whole story is told by one of the crooks, Roger 'Verbal' Kint. What really happened on the job and is there even a man named Keyser Soze?<br/><br/>The screenplay's just amazing, the whole plot consists of twists that are just so surprising that it makes you stare at the emptiness leaving you dribbling all over the place like you were being in a some kind of a mental institution. It progresses in a definite flow, leaving you concentrating so much that you don't want to miss one second of the movie itself. It's interesting, it's exciting, it's thrilling and it's just brilliant. The directing compliments the whole screenplay, by being so witty that it feels like you were watching a real live action crime happening, having a very nice cinematography as a backup. Some of the angles and the ways how some things are shot is just so significant for the movie that it's just, like mentioned above, so brilliant.<br/><br/>The music isn't beautiful and phenomenal in purpose to make you cry, it's in purpose of giving you a guaranteed entertainment and a thrilling motion picture experience, composed by John Ottman. I mean, the music's just so fitting that it gives you this specific familiar smile on your face which says ""Yeah, awesome, that's how you do it."" Well, you get the point, it's the kind of music you want for a thriller, giving the movie that required thriller edge to it.<br/><br/>Despite the amazing screenplay, the things that make this movie so fantastic are the characters and the role performances done by the actors. Taking for example the five crooks, there's the bad ass Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, who I haven't actually seen doing a better role performance than as McManus. Then there's the cold and intelligent Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, who really fits for the role like a strawberry for a pancake. Then there's Fred Fenster, the associate of McManus and the one ""with the looks"", played by Benicio Del Toro, who's always enjoyable, yet usually in a weird role. Then there's Todd Hockney, the explosions expert and the one who just doesn't give a damn about anyone, played by Kevin Pollack, doing one of his best role performances yet to date. And finally, there is Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a cripple man who is in no use for anyone, being irrelevant, wanting to be a better crook, played by Kevin Spacey, who also does one of his best (if not The Best) role performances yet to date. Spacey's just so good that he's the movie's essence. Those are a few characters to name, but there are a whole bunch of others, played by actors who are at their best, making the movie so fantastic in every aspect.<br/><br/>All in all ""The Usual Suspects"" is a fantastic film everyone should see. It has some of the best story twists ever written to a motion picture, making you that mental institution patient right till the end titles, where you keep on being that patient until you wake up in the real world realising that the movie's a celebration of fantastic characters and actors, an amazing screenplay and superb directing.

From Se7en I was also familiar with Kevin Spacey being the bad guy. Another thing that bothered me a lot was when Kevin Spacey was shown every time right after one of his friends was shot. Maybe to show that he can't be the murderer but for me it was like ""Eh look I couldn't have done it"". The repeating of the limping and the ""Oh I'm just a cripple""-thing was also very obvious. So I really think I already would have figured it out in 1995. In 2006 I find it extremely obvious. Another problem with this kind of movies is that it's not too much fun to watch them a few times.

Its slow, its boring and I had trouble staying awake. There is slow and there's too slow, and this film was the latter. There seemed to be too much focus on the characters. The relationships were continuous trying too hard to create tension and surprise but unfortunately it did not come off for me. At points the plot jumped too quickly ahead, especially at the beginning when audiences should be getting to know the characters but the film simply does not allow them to settle into the main story and that way allows audiences to play catch up.<br/><br/>It conforms to the genre well with plenty of gun fights, angry money wanting criminals and depressive coppers and these conventions are not portrayed as well as they could have been.<br/><br/>The story is told through Kevin Spacey's character as he explains what happens to the cops.

","(Spoiler Alert)<br/><br/>I would love to say that the success of the thriller genre movies is always when then audience is failed to guess the main villain or antagonist of the film. In The Usual Suspects, I can predict who is the real ""Keyser Soze"" almost after an hour of the movie duration because previously I had watched movie starred by actor Kevin Spacey such as Seven. But the brilliant writing of pre climax and climax (both plot twist) by Christopher McQuarrie cheated me for a moment even though the end result is same as what I had predicted earlier. Without delay, let me go to some unusual facts about The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>1. The title comes from the name of an article in Spy Magazine that Christopher McQuarrie thought would make a great movie.<br/><br/>2. The line-up scene was originally intended to be serious yet the actors were messing around so much that director Bryan Singer decided to put the funniest version in. Blame supposedly lies with Benicio Del Toro's flatulence.<br/><br/>3. When the characters are handed manila envelopes containing their personal details, the order references the order in which they die.<br/><br/>4. Al Pacino turned down the role of Dave Kujan due to scheduling conflicts. He's later admitted that he regretted this greatly.<br/><br/>5. The small role of Redfoot was offered out to Tommy Lee Jones, Charlie Sheen, Johnny Cash, Jeff Bridges and James Spader. It was eventually played by Peter Greene.<br/><br/>6. The interrogation scenes were shot prior to the rest of the film, over the course of five days.<br/><br/>7. The stolen emeralds were actually real gemstones, which were loaned for the shoot.<br/><br/>8. Writer Christopher McQuarrie came up with the idea while working at a solicitors office. He made up the plot from a notice board.<br/><br/>9. 30 of the close-ups in the film were actually done in Bryan Singer's backyard.<br/><br/>10. Benicio Del Toro decided that he was playing a ""Black Chinese Puerto Rican Jew"".<br/><br/>11. Neither Bryan Singer or Christopher McQuarrie was aware that the line ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing man he didn't exist"" was from French poet Baudelaire until after the film was finished.<br/><br/>12. Kevin Spacey claimed that Bryan Singer managed to convince all of the major actors that they were Keyser Soze. At the first screening, an angry Gabriel Byrne stormed off when he realised the truth.<br/><br/>13. Keyser Soze was based on murderer John List, who killed his family in the 70s and then disappeared for 18 years.<br/><br/>14. To make his disability seem more realistic, Kevin Spacey had his fingers glued together.<br/><br/>15. Kevin Spacey met Bryan Singer at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival and was so impressed with his movie Public Access that he asked to be cast in his next film.<br/><br/>16. Christopher McQuarrie originally used the character name Keyser Sume after one of his law firm supervisors but changed it slightly after he worried what he might think.<br/><br/>17. Execs at Gramercy Pictures were concerned that audiences might not be able to pronounce the name Keyser Soze so launched a teaser campaign with the tagline ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" before release and created TV spots which instructed people on how to say his name.<br/><br/>18. In the opening sequence, the unknown gunman urinates on a flame and it is gelatinous and lumpy. Later on, Verbal tells Kujan that when he gets dehydrated, his urine becomes gelatinous and lumpy."
"schafferryan","9","1","2","13 February 2018"," Even better a second time
","""The Usual Suspects"" is a good movie to watch once but an even better movie to watch a second time. This low-budget film from the 90's has won two Oscars and is considered one of the all-time greats by many movie lovers. ""The Usual Suspects"", directed by Brian Singer, is not a super flashy movie with pretty girls and crazy good camera angles, but it's a well thought out thriller that leaves you with your jaw on the floor when it finishes. The movie is about five criminals that get pulled in by the cops on a bogus charge. When they are released they decide to get a little bit of revenge on the police department but end up getting tied up with one of the World's most dangerous criminal masterminds, Keyser Soze, who turns out to be one of the criminals the police originally picked up. The movie has a high quality script, beautifully-acted characters, and one of the greatest endings a viewer could ever want, but the thing that really sets this movie apart from the others is the subtle details of the script the director put into it. After watching it for the first time I was confused and really wanted to watch it again, but after a second time watching it, I really got an appreciation of all the little hints at the ending that the director put in it. Things that you didn't even think were important actually gave away the entire twist at the end. Another thing that this movie does really well is keep the audience engaged the whole time. It starts off a little slow while it develops the characters, but right as it gets to be too slow the movie throws something exciting at you. It is a true thriller that keeps you entertained the whole movie but on the edge of your seat for the last half of it. A great cast, a very well thought out script, top-notch directing, and a twist at the end that will leave you wanting to watch the whole movie again, ""The Usual Suspects"" has pretty much everything that a movie viewer could want."

","The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed.<br/><br/>Baldwin was also good in 'The Genius Club'"
"iollann","9","1","2","31 March 2017"," Review-The Usual Suspects
","Review: The Usual Suspects 'The Usual Suspects' a crime-drama mystery about a survivor telling a policeman about the events leading up to a shootout on a boat, which all started when five criminals met in a supposedly random police line-up. Directed by Bryan Singer and starring Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Posthlewaite, Steven Baldwin and Kevin Spacey. Released in 1995 it is a film with great characters and a very engaging story. The usual suspects starts out with 'Verbal' excellently played by Kevin Spacey' who is being grilled by a U.S customs agent after being one of two survivors of a catastrophic shootout on a boat. Verbal reluctantly recounts how he came to be on the boat starting with him meeting 4 other criminals in a seemingly random police line-up. Firstly what makes this film great is the acting especially Kevin Spacey's acting. My favourite scene in the film is the police line- up. It is a very iconic, well known scene. It is very funny. What makes it funny is that apparently it was supposed to be a serious scene but the actors were messing around and injecting a bit of humour into it. Even director Brian Singer adlibbed in a line: 'In English please?' I love the acting in this film. Benicio Del Toro's mumbling is appreciated. I enjoyed seeing Kevin Spacey's fast talking' innocent and shy manner is extremely captivating. Gabriel Byrne has a very convincing role as an ex-criminal trying to start fresh. Stephen Baldwin does a great job of playing the smart mouth, cocky professional of the group. Bryan Singer expertly uses tension and suspense to deliver a mind blowing twist at the end. I would absolutely recommend watching this film for a second time. Watching it again and seeing all the hints that the director had subtly snuck in is a very satisfying thing and enhances the overall experience. What I think makes this film great is the fact that it didn't have a huge budget, there's not any over the top special effects, the acting is great, it has a relatively easy to follow story line and then the ending is like the cherry on top. <br/><br/>In conclusion I think everyone should see this film at least twice. The acting is excellent especially Kevin Spacey, the story is great and the twist is just right. Overall I give this film a 9/10. It's just so likable and re-watchable."

"msmann-75929","10","1","2","8 May 2016"," Summary
","The 1995 movie, Usual Suspects is a suspense thriller that will keep you guessing right up until the very end. This movie starts out with a robbery and a murder in the dead of night on a cargo ship. Special agent Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) is investigating the hijacking of a truck full of guns. The movie follows the interrogations of a group of well known thugs; McManus (Stephen Bladwin), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Torro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal (Kevin Spacey). <br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is suspenseful movies that could be a modern day Hitchcock thriller. Nothing is as it seems as Verbal (Kevin Spacey) tells his accounts of the previous days before the robbery on the cargo ship to special agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri). Verbal, a week and meager man that seems out of place in the company of the other vicious group of thugs accused of the truck and gun heist gives a detailed story of the time leading up to robbery. Keyser Soze, a mythical character in the movie is a violent, fearless, heartless man that is feared by many even though no one can say what Keyser Soze actually looks like. He is the boogie man that is pulling the strings behind the scenesor is he?<br/><br/>This movie uses lighting and shadows to physically pull you into the suspense of each plot twist and turn. The shadows make the movie more suspenseful because it shows you just enough to make you think you know what's going on but enough darkness to make you wonder. It will have you changing your mind every second wondering who is behind the mask of darkness hiding in the shadows."
"Mr-Fusion","7","1","2","20 November 2015"," It killed in the '90s and still does
","It's been quite some time since I first saw ""The Usual Suspects"", but I still remember that twist ending; one for the ages, that one. Would a person today be able to see it coming? Not sure, but no question does the movie still hold up. It's a playful exercise in misdirection with the novel camera tricks, jumbled narratives and central burning question: ""Who is Keyser Söze?"" (try telling me you haven't heard that catchphrase in popular culture). And even if that big reveal no longer packs punch, at its heart, it's still a sizzling crime movie with a motley assortment of macho gangsters.<br/><br/>7/10"
"lucasversantvoort","8","1","2","18 November 2015"," If ever there was a film that existed solely for its plot twist...
","...the Usual Suspects is that film. Many like myself were floored by the final plot twist and it's since become a classic. <br/><br/>Our story begins at the end, when the unseen criminal mastermind Keyser Soze, shoots an acquaintance of his on a boat. Soze escapes after he lights the fuse that will blow up the boat. The police arrive and the investigation kicks off. This leads to Agent Kujan talking with/interrogating one of the suspects, a cripple called Verbal Kint. They casually chat in an office and slowly Verbal begins telling him the events that lead to that fateful night at the docks. <br/><br/>Doesn't sound like much at first glance, but the final twist will have you reexamining everything that came before. It changes everything. Some might criticize the fact that the nature of the twist undoes a lot of what came before, but when the twist is this good, who even cares? In fact, it slightly reminds me of Kurosawa's Rashômon with its different retellings of the same events. It also helps that the twist is so wonderfully presented by editor/composer John Ottman. What's particularly pleasing about the twist is that you find all kinds of hints with repeat viewings. A small line here, a little visual clue there, little things that'll make you wonder how you didn't notice these things before. <br/><br/>The acting is also noteworthy, particularly Spacey's. Once you figure out his game, watching his performance becomes very entertaining. Very multi-layered. The rest of the 'usual suspects' are all great as well. The ones that deserve special mention are Benicio del Toro who injects a basically useless character with a lot of life and wit and Pete Postlethwaith, who plays Soze's assistant with a dryness that is both terrifying and fun to watch. <br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is, in a way, my kind of mystery/thriller/crime/drama film. Everything builds up to a wonderful twist that has you rethinking the rest of the story. It adds a lot of replay value, not to mention the added bonus of trying to find all the hints strewn across the story like breadcrumbs."
"hailthekingnotapple","9","1","2","24 June 2015"," My All Time Favorite Film
","I've seen many mixed reviews on 'The Usual Suspects'. Many reviews criticise the film because it is too 'Predictable'. I personally believe this film is one of the least predictable and well scripted films of all time.<br/><br/>Upon the first viewing I was left stunned. The plot hit me like a train and left me speechless. I wondered around my house trying to piece together my broken mind. I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone but if you haven't watched this film already I think you are missing out on something beautiful. This film has the ability to confuse you and leave you in utter shock at the end. 'Does the Usual suspects have the best film ending of all time?' ; I think it does. Without a doubt this film has left me in a state that no other film has.<br/><br/>Upon the second viewing I was hitting my past self. 'How did I miss that' and 'Its obvious now' kept coming into my mind. The attention to detail in this film is gob-smacking and its possible to watch it multiple times and always realise something new. The camera angles are all thought out and seem to have meaning. This film defiantly deserves its place in the top 250 films of all time.<br/><br/>The acting is also some of the best I've seen ; the cast are perfectly chosen for there roles and it all adds to the immersion in the plot that the audience feels. The script is expertly written and each character comes at a contrast to each other character. Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne are both amazing actors, and as we all know this is the film that made Kevin Spacey as an actor. <br/><br/>All in all if you haven't watched this film watch it, its absolutely amazing. However, if you have watched it , watch it again because I guarantee the second sitting is as good as the first."
"nadja_ac","10","1","2","10 April 2015"," Favourite movie
","This is so beautiful! The actors are great, all of them. I think, I like Chazz Palminteri best, but then Benicio del Toro was awesome to, and Stephen Baldwin as well, and PETE POSTLETHWAITE, and EVERYBODY! (Kevin Spacey doesn't need any additional praise, he's gotten plenty already.) The score fits beautifully, and of course the script is flawless.<br/><br/>Apart from Sunset Boulevard this was the first movie I'd watched that turned its plot upside down at the end. As soon as I had left the cinema in '95 I knew that I had to get the tape in order to watch it again. And they KNEW viewers would react like this, they relied on it, the film COUNTED on it. It has to be watched repeatedly in order to be appreciated.<br/><br/>This movie got me into binge watching. I watched the tape lots of times. Several times with pen and writing pad, remote control at the ready to pause and rewind, taking notes in order to find a flaw with the script. Once, for about ten minutes, I thought I'd found one: How could Verbal be telling Agent Kujan about what Keaton and McManus saw and experienced on the ship, when he claimed, he himself hadn't been there? Then I realized that for this precise scene it wasn't Kint doing the storytelling – it was Kujan himself, delivering mere hypotheses.<br/><br/>I think I bought the DVD as soon as it was released, even before I owned a DVD-player.<br/><br/>I could watch this a thousand times and still be thrilled and discover new details. The camera closing in on the hawsers; Hockney seeing the light when it's too late; the way the surface of the coffee in the cup fades out to become the cave at the beach at night; Kint waiting silently in the office; taking in his surroundings, while apparently nothing happens at all for a too-long moment. Later we find out that the rest of the plot came into being in those few seconds. Kujan finally understanding and dropping the cup. I get goosebumps only thinking about it.<br/><br/>Pure beauty. I can't understand people getting excited about Avatar or Avengers, when there's a movie like The Usual Suspects around, honestly, I just don't get it. Must definitely watch it again this weekend."

"msowa-930-718784","10","1","2","21 February 2014"," Review of The Usual Suspects
","With twists, turns, and an unforgettable climax, The Usual Suspects, directed by Bryan Singer is a fantastic movie. It is a bona fide classic of the crime genre. This low budget thriller was able to capture the attention of audiences worldwide with a surprise ending that leaves viewers with more questions than answers. This movie is layered with a complex plot generating intrigue. While the complexity of the film, enthralled most, some viewers may be left with an unfavorable view of the film due to the complexity; but for the cerebral viewer, it delivers intrigue, action, and a clever thought out plot captivating the viewer to the end. I believe that this is precisely the audience that Bryan Singer sought and delivered to with his grand design. It lends itself to multiple viewings to dissect the plot. The directing in the movie parallels to that of a Quentin Tarantino movie, with cold blooded, ruthless, characters, violence, and gore filled scenes. Through the use of clever flashback, the movie seems so much bigger that what it actually is. All that really happens during the movie is that Roger "" Verbal"" Kint completes his testimony with Dave Kujan, a detective following a hunch. The movie follows Verbal's testimony, going through the events and with details being filled in as Kujan asks for clarification. Kujan thought there was more to the story than met the eye, and Verbal, played by Kevin Spacey gave Kujan all he could ask for and more. Throughout the whole movie Spacey's brilliant acting convinces the audience almost pity Verbal, who is a cripple with cerebral palsy and a bad limp. This pity for Verbal only makes the ending even more satisfying, where everything that the audience had come to believe throughout the first 100 minutes of film becomes unraveled within the last five. This movie leaves one with more questions than answers, and many holes in the story are left to the imagination, in my opinion only making this story more intriguing. The Usual Suspects was a relatively low budget movie, with production costs around six million dollars. In comparison, another movie from 1995, Cutthroat Island cost 98 million dollars to produce. In terms of grossing, The Usual Suspects grossed over 23 million dollars in the US alone. while the astronomical budget Cutthroat Island only grossed a little over a measly 18 million dollars worldwide. One may be asking 'why does this matter'? I believe that this matters because production costs are one of the limiting factors of being a director. Bryan Singer was able to produce a captivating movie in an era that was already over-saturated with great crime thrillers made in the early 1990's, with a budget that would leave some directors at a loss. By other great crime fillers I am talking about Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction, and Goodfellas to name a few. Although Singer did a standup job filming the movie, he cannot take full credit for this masterpiece. The scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie actually won the best original screenplay at the academy awards, only further exemplifying the quality of this movie. Christopher McQuarrie was not the only one from the movie The Usual Suspects to win an academy award. Kevin Spacey gave the performance of a lifetime playing Verbal Kint, and was awarded the best supporting actor at the academy awards in 1995 (The Usual Suspects). Verbal has a lot more to him than meets the eye, and throughout the entire movie one can tell there is something off about him. Verbal is a cripple with cerebral palsy, a criminal, and is told repeatedly throughout the movie that he isn't intelligent. Kevin Spacey sells the part, allowing the audience to put verbal in a box as a sorry criminal deserving nothing but pity, and almost allowing the audience to empathize with Verbal for having been drawn into detective Kujan's office. This feeling of empathy is completely replaced by a mixture of awe and confusion by the end of this movie. As previously mentioned, scriptwriter Christopher McQuarrie won the best original screenplay at the academy awards . This movie was extremely complex, too confusing in the opinion of some viewers, including film critic legend Roger Ebert, who unfortunately gave this film only 1.5 stars out of four and named this movie to his 50 most hated films of all time list. The reason for the complexity was out of design, in my opinion, as the story Verbal crafted was not really important. This is revealed at the end of the movie, when Kujan realizes that Verbal is actually Kaiser Söze, and that the entire testimony had been fabricated based on various words and pictures that were in his office. This crazy ending is the reason that McQuarrie won the award, and is also the reason that I enjoy this movie so much. In an instant, this movie transforms from being a confusing crime thriller, into a masterpiece, leaving the it to the imagination of the viewer to decipher if there was any truth to verbal Kint's testimony. This Film has stood the test of time, and can now be considered a crime thriller classic. The surprise ending, the acting, and the directing all worked in harmony to produce one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie gets a 10/10 in my book, and should be on the list of anybody that likes good twist ending."

More importantly, however, is that most of the journey is drab.<br/><br/>If you can endure it to past the halfway mark you stand a chance of coming out the end with satisfaction in your face. It slowly improves from there but not overly so until close to the end. <br/><br/>Like when you need to vomit - its not good until the very end.

"alishahmohd","10","1","2","20 November 2013"," Absolutely Brilliant.....
","I am a huge fan of the crime movies having watched classics like Reservoir Dogs, Heat, Pulp Fiction, The Godfather Part 1 and 2 and Scarface among others. I must say that The Usual Suspects is not only lives up to the names of these films but it is one the best films in the entire Genre.<br/><br/>The plot is about an incident that takes place on a pier in California leaving all criminals dead, with only two survivors, one is an Hungarian who is badly injured and burned and the second person is a Cripple, Verbal Kint. Kint describes the events that led to the incident and what actually happened during it, to the Cops. There is a dangerous crime lord who maybe involved in the center of this incident. That's all I can say about the plot without spoiling.<br/><br/>The plot starts out slow but picks up eventually & retains the viewer's interest in what will happen next. There are many many mysterious things which are revealed in the present about the pier incident as Verbal continues to tell the story which will also keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. The plot is rounded off by an absolutely brilliant twist and an awesome ending. The movie also tries its best to swerve the viewer and succeeds very well. The ending is not only brilliant and fantastic but it also leaves a lot of room for interpretations and discussions, which is clearly what the developers had in mind.<br/><br/>The dialogue in The Usual Suspects is absolutely brilliant and it also has very funny and memorable scenes and the exchanges between the main characters are always interesting, even the brief heists that are shown have good action. And switching back and forth between past and present is a brilliant method of story telling. The music and sound effects are absolutely spot on and fit scenes naturally.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch, Kevin Spacey who gets the majority of the screen time steals the show as Verbal Kint, Gabriel Byrne is fantastic as Dean Keaton, Chazz Palminteri actually fits really well in his role as Kujan and acts excellently, this role was offered to the likes of Christoper Walken & Robert De Niro but they turned it down, but Chazz took such a tough character and played it brilliantly. Peth Postlethwaite is just spot on with his lines and just feels natural as Kobayashi. Out of the other three criminals Stepehan Baldwin is fantastic as MacManus with the screen time he is given, whereas the actors who portrayed Hokeney and Fenster do not stand out compared to the others but they still did a decent job.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is so entertaining to watch that you will feel like watching it again and again and still have a great time. Several scenes in the movie specially the ending sequence will just give you the chills and make you want to watch them again see how perfect the music, dialogue, the acting, the delivery everything perfectly fit the situation. The film is a masterpiece, and one of the very best in its genre, if you are a fan of crime or thriller, do yourself a favor and watch The Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>Overall: 9.5/10"

","You know ""the one that got away""? Everybody has one. For most people, that would refer to a failed romance. For your avid fisherman, it would refer to a fish. To law enforcement professionals, what do you think it means?<br/><br/>The film begins on a ship in San Pedro Bay. One man, Dean Keaton (played by Gabriel Byrne) is sitting down and informs someone who proffers a generic ""how you doing, Keaton?"" that he can't feel his legs and identifies him as Keyser. Keaton asks the man what time it is and, after answering, the unidentified man shoots him in the head. Said identified man then ignites a trail of gasoline that causes the ship to explode. Cut to a deposition where Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (played by Kevin Spacey) explains that the events were the ultimate result of a lineup in New York. Dean Keaton (Byrne), a former police officer and a ""white whale"" of sorts for Special Agent Dave Kujan from the U.S Customs Bureau (played by Chazz Palminteri) is arrested in front of potential investors, thwarting his foray into legitimate business. Another criminal, Michael McManus (played by Stephen Baldwin) is arrested in his bed and doesn't bother to open his eyes, let alone stand up or run, when the police break down his door. His partner, Fred Fenster (played by Benicio del Toro) is arrested on the street and does attempt to evade arrest but the attempt itself is rather feeble. Todd Hockney (played by Kevin Pollak) is working on a car in a garage when he is arrested. The police inform him that he is under arrest and Hockney, not very concerned by the presence of the police, reaches under the car for a rag to wipe his face. The police draw their guns, he wipes his face and asks, ""Are you sure you brought enough guys?"" We are then shown the lineup and the interrogations that followed. Back in the present, the boat Keaton was on is destroyed and anyone who was on it is dead, or are they?<br/><br/>I love, love, love, this movie. Spacey as Verbal is amazing. This is one of those occasions where I have no problem with the awarding of an Oscar. Baldwin was never this good before and, to my knowledge, hasn't been since. The story requires constant attention and, at the same time, only serves to set up the twist at the end. Palminteri's character is relentless in his pursuit of Keaton and the result of that dogged pursuit is a major moment in American cinematic history. Other critics, among them the late, lamented Roger Ebert, were not fans of this film. While I don't wish to disrespect them, they could not be more wrong. If you haven't seen it, you should. Right now."

","The only thing that was great about this film was the ending the rest was good, but nothing really ""great"". I though it was a bit boring at parts and it did not hold my attention during it whole duration: I had to make an effort to watch it entirely, which is not expected from a film made in the 1990's (if it was a film from before 1977 (which means, before Star Wars changed the film industry), that would be alright: I gave 9/10 for Citizen Kane, but its finale was even better and the whole film had a better felling).<br/><br/>I won't say it was a great film: it was entertaining but it is not a work of art and it shouldn't be in the top 250 list.

","Near the end of The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey, in his Oscar-winning performance as crippled con man Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, says, ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""

It stars Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey and Pete Postlethwaite.The film follows the interrogation of Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, a small-time con man who is one of only two survivors of a massacre and fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. He tells an interrogator a convoluted story about events that led him and four other criminals to the boat, and of a mysterious mob boss known as Keyser Söze who commissioned their work.

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","24 August 2011"," A Masterpiece of Manipulation ...
","Approaching ""The Usual Suspects"" as a mystery thriller with an iconic ending disregards the real matter that cemented its greatness: the script. ""The Usual Suspects"", more than any film, is a masterpiece of effective manipulation on which the final twist is only the icing on a rather delicious cake.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to believe that most of the fans realized the magnitude of ""The Usual Suspects"" on TV, VHS or DVD rather than in a movie theater. The movie has a fair share of thrills and action but is richer in terms of plot, subplots, and sub-subplots and demands more than one viewing. Although I catch one or two subtleties every once in a while, I think I got now 99% enough to consider myself a true fan of the film, and again, this is not just because of the finale.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is like a modern ""Rashomon"" in the way it plays back and forth with flashbacks through an interrogation between a police officer, David Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a dim-witted cripple and the only survival of a harbor massacre. This is the mystery the movie opens with, as the game consists on finding out the 'why' and the 'how' lying beneath a bloody killing that killed everyone for 91 million dollars worth of an inexistent dope. And progressively, the mystery deviates to a more harrowing 'who' question, incarnated by the haunting presence of a criminal mastermind, named Keyser Soze, a human devil whose identity remains secret. The film puts us in Kujan's shoes, he who pretends to be the smarter, still, both Kujan and us, take Kint's words for granted until we're fooled by the shocking finale, but again, everything is in the build-up.<br/><br/>The build up is why the comparison with ""Rashomon"" takes its full significance. Kurosawa's masterpiece didn't just pave the way for non-linear narrative films, it was also revolutionary through the introduction of subjective narration, inviting us not to believe in everything we see from a character's point of view. Not that most of what Kint reveals is a lie, but what Kujan will believe won't be necessarily the truth. This is manipulation at its best, to make you believe something from your own thinking, by still respecting your intelligence. And this is the irony of the film, while we expect a twist, we're never discussing the veracity of what is said, it's like approaching the virtual core of the truth without never touching the inner verity. This is why the ending is literally spectacular; we're literally blinded by the unbearable truth's light. But this effect wouldn't have been the same if it wasn't for what preceded.<br/><br/>As a reference to the iconic line from ""Casablanca"", the usual suspects are five criminals joined in the famous line-up for a mysterious truck robbery. What strikes the most is that they are criminals of higher caliber, when in general; you've got one tough guy and just some bums put there as fillers. There were obviously lined up for another reason, a mission for Keyser Soze, the criminal whose reputation exceeds the limit of believability, a myth, a spook story? His absence is as chilling as his presence anyway. And there was absolutely no way for them to refuse, the tightly written script leaves no plot holes, only stuff left to interpretation, but for the rest, and every single detail, every line or look on a face, makes perfect sense. It's an elaborate puzzle where you can get the final image until the last piece and nothing can match the first time you experience the film, and not just the ending.<br/><br/>And the greatness is that the build-up of Keyser Soze's character contributes to show him as man so evil, and so present, that his non-existence would be unacceptable if not implausible. He's here, and he's surely one of the usual suspects, and since we feel we're being tricked, we ought to think, maybe Keyser is Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) or this Kobayashi lawyer (Pete Postelwhaite) or who the hell knows, maybe Kujan. It's not thrown in our face, we really try to believe this and when Kujan releases Kint, whatever the truth is, we feel like any coming twist must be both convincing and spectacular. Well, the wall board was probably one of the greatest cinematic revelations ever, getting us the final piece of the puzzle as we understand how Kint used the wall to insert some realistic details in his story. We got the final move of a psychological chess game, an extraordinary manipulation highlighted by the succession of quotes in voice-over in a masterstroke of sound editing sublimated by a perfect music and a revelation reaching its pinnacle on the sidewalk. Check-mate. When the movie ends, we realize what came before really needs a second viewing.<br/><br/>And besides the writing and the editing, there are the little details you re-discover. When Kint is looking earlier at the wall, he looks dumbly detached but the second time you realize that he's building his story. When Kujan drinks coffee, you can see Kint glancing at the bottom of the mug, and you know how he got the Kobayahshi's name from. The details are also in these little something that made the movie so human, the hilarious line up is genuinely authentic, , it's not a movie with big-stars names, but the casting convey the feeling of underdog criminals with no small roles, hell, even Benicio Del Toro, who plays a minor character found the perfect note to make him memorable.<br/><br/>Still, Kevin Spacey outperforms everyone as the character you stop looking at him the same way after each viewing. If not the greatest, he's certainly one of the most fascinating villains of cinema's history, whose shining moment is the last minute where in one look, he metamorphoses.<br/><br/>Well, I guess the ending of the film is a big part of its greatness after all"

"Roarlover34","10","1","2","26 March 2010"," What An Astonishing Film!
","Where do you start with a film like 'The Usual Suspects'? A film of such quality is hard to capture in words. The story follows 5 classic criminals who were placed in the same police line up, and it wasn't a coincidence. The story then jumps from the past to the present in a series of events involving murder, betrayal and police investigation. <br/><br/>It is a movie that redefined the genre of Mystery. A short way into the film a mysterious criminal mastermind by the name of 'Kaiser Sose' is introduced to the audience. Throughout the rest of the film I could hear myself thinking, ""Who is Kaiser Sose?"" To know the answer to this question, you must see the film. This leads me to discuss the film production, hats off to Bryan Singer for creating such a masterpiece. The casting of the 5 criminals is nothing short of perfect, as are their performances. Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Benecio Del Toro, Stephen McManus and Kevin Pollak all give top notch performances as criminals. Kevin Spacey is dazzling as a cripple from New York. Space went on to win an Oscar for the role. Gabriel Byrne is top notch as the smooth ex police officer with sophisticated criminal intelligence. Benecio Del Toro is one of the stars of the film as Fred Fenster. Although Del Toro has few scenes in the movie he creates a character that the audience loves and are amused by. Stephen Baldwin's performance as the real tough guy of the 5 criminals is so astonishing, it is a wonder that roles for him since have been few and far between. Chazz Palminteri and Pete Postlethwaite also pitch in with solid performances. <br/><br/>The fact that there is no real lead role in the film adds to the mystery as, it leaves the audience suspecting nearly everybody to be Kaiser Sose. The mysterious and creepy piano solo theme, by John Ottman, further adds to the phenomenal final result. <br/><br/>The fact this the film wasn't a big seller at the movies is a credit to it, as evidently the quality of the movie was spread by word of mouth not big advertising bucks. This was a similar case to the greatest film of all time, The Shawshank Redemption. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer has created a masterpiece which redefined the meaning of the mystery Genre. It is a film that is bound to live on for decades to come."

","This film should be 15 years by now but I recently watched it again yesterday evening on TV and the impact was still the same.Simply put, ""The Usual Suspect"" is one of the most amazing films in cinematic history. Few films with such entertainment value that I can compare with TUS include the Shawshank Redempion, the Godfather(without the twist),Gladiator etc.This film is a classic which spawned a lot of mediocre ""twist"" movies such as Basic, Hide & Seek, etc.<br/><br/>From the opening scenes of the corpses on a burning boat to the last astonishing scene, the film grabs you and never lets you go.<br/><br/>Bryon Singer has never directed such a better movie since and here, he did a masterful job. All the actors gave powerful performances but the outstanding ones were Chazz Palmenteri, Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Bryne. Of course, Bryne is one of the most intense and yet underrated actors who would have been my preferred choice as the amnesiac assassin in the Jason Bourne series.<br/><br/>I heard Al Pacino turned down the role played by Chazz due to a scheduling conflict. A great loss but Chazz still held his own and gave a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>But the person deserves the most credit is the screenplay writer, Christopher McQuarrie. How he could conceive such a simple and yet convoluted plot is beyond my comprehension. What inspired him? I recommend the film to suspense lovers. Its truly a classic."

","As a friend of mine always asked me, ""Did you see a movie, or a film?"". 'Movie' was moving pictures up on a screen, telling some kind of story. 'Film' was something more. 'Film' was a masterpiece. So after I watched this movie, after my head stopped spinning, I decided: I had just seen a mighty fine FILM. The Usual Suspects is anything and everything you want it to be. A compelling thriller, and, in fact, the best mystery film since the years of Hitchcock. Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne give master-class performances, like they had been born to play the roles of 'Verbal' Kint and Dean Keaton. The cinematography (Newton Thomas Sigel gets credit here) completely immerses you into the movie. Darkly lit, resembling The Godfather films, really brings out the best in director Bryan Singers characters. The characters are sometimes barely recognizable it feels so dark, which fits perfectly with the plot and message: No one can be trusted. Someone maybe even be impersonating someone else. And then, there is Kevin Spacey, bringing sense to it all. Or is he? Giving an extremely impressive performance, trying to keep cool under interrogator Chazz Palminteri, even he cannot make sense of most of his own story. Or maybe there's a different reason... Christopher McQuarrie's script is one of the best in the history of film; dark, complicated, compelling, and bringing out the true colors of all his characters. The Usual Suspects, in conclusion, is one of the best movies ever made."
"hmf_oze","7","1","2","11 November 2008"," Cliché
","I'll start by pointing what i really enjoyed. The acting is mind blowing, so much great actors all put together in one movie drew my attention at first sight. Specially Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro. Bryan Singer is a good director and i can't say much about how perfectly directed this movie is. Not to mention, the soundtrack! Beautiful.<br/><br/>Now, i am the kind of guy that watches movies since very early in the childhood and had kept watching tons of movies until nowadays. My father is a director, i guess that explains. So I'll point out what i didn't like in this movie. First of all, i anticipated a lot of dialog of the movie. Specially all those remarkable lines. But worst of all, i figured out the ending way before i should have. So i hate to say this to a good movie with an excellent cast and with a good director, but i found it to be HIGHLY CLICHÉ ending twist!<br/><br/>That ending just happened too many times in other movies, the ""crippled man cover"" has been seen through and through. I understand that this movie is being overrated by the regular weekend movie spectator. So i would give this advice to people who know movies and have seen a lot of them, do not expect too much of it or you'll end up like me. It surely doesn't deserve to be considered a cult movie or a must see. <br/><br/>This is a good thriller, i enjoyed it. And that's it."

The only two witnesses are a cripple and a severely burned Hungarian that speaks of Keyser Soze. US Customs agent Dave Kujan is flown in from New York to interrogate the cripple--Verbal Kint, played by Kevin Spacey. What follows is a twisted story about five criminals in the midst of a cat-and-mouse game.<br/><br/>An ensemble cast of actors fills the shoes of the characters quite effectively. Gabriel Byrne plays Keaton--the bent cop desperate on going straight. Steven Baldwin and Benecio Del Toro play McManus and Fenster, two crooks working for a Californian mob. Kevin Pollack plays a petty thief named Todd Hockney, 'truly the one man that didn't give a f--- about anything.' Pete Postelwaithe plays a shadowy lawyer named Kobayashi, a creepy and enigmatic man working for...well, you'll have to wait and see.

The plot is confusing at times, but not in a frustrating way. The film raises a lot more questions than answers, but again, it is not frustrating. The ending is one of the most delightful and euphoric twists ever put onto film, and then you realize that you have been completely fooled--caught up in a storyteller's web.<br/><br/>The direction is perfect for the low-budget, independent nature of the movie. Bryan Singer's choice of clever shots and hidden clues that you don't pick up on until your second viewing shows a articulate and thoughtful director--one who truly cares about the craft. It's hard to imagine that this was only his second film.<br/><br/>The music by John Ottman adds another feeling to the movie--one of mystery and suspense. What surprised me about the score was the 'un-hip' feeling to it. His score is very unconventional and quite effective. His theme for Soze is magical and mysterious, breathing a legend into the character.<br/><br/>Finally, Christopher McQuarrie's script. One hell of a script. Without knowing that he spawned one of the most effective and popular mysteries ever made, I'm sure that he was surprised with its cult following--as well as his own Oscar win.<br/><br/>Truly a great thriller. Watch it as many times as you can. The first viewing is for the enjoyment. The second is pure revelation."

Go back, see it again, and when it becomes only Verbal's story, take it as such. Not fact, not what actually happened, but what happened according to the one (and only) person who was to benefit from the telling of it. It will change your perspective.<br/><br/>At the end, yes, one could say they figured it out, but the joy and brilliance of this movie is that you are so totally sucked in, and take it all on face value that you THINK you have figured it out. I am not convinced, to this day (after dozens of viewings and hours of discussion with other fans), that Verbal was Keyser Soze, or that Keyser really ever existed. Was this a story Verbal had heard and decided to maximize it? Was this a story he made up, and spread it for years as one of the most intriguing machinations in crime history?

It is true that he does not do very much in the narrative, which occupies the main core of the film, yet he is the narrator (like Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Leading Actor, and there was a debate about whether it should have been Tim Robbins), and given that he is the latent villain as well, should he not have been nominated as Best Leading Actor? Does anyone agree with me here? I am convinced that if he had been nominated for Best Leading Actor, he would have won the Oscar because his portrayal of the apparently weak yet sophisticated Verbal Kint was very powerful, especially since his role was very difficult to play (harder than his role as Lester Burnham in American Beauty, in my opinion)."

The good news is this - the ending is totally satisfying, and that alone is a rare thing to witness.<br/><br/>Despite the complexity, this film works, but if you don't give it your full attention, it may just pass you by. And that would be criminal! 9/10"
"ecjones1951","Null","1","2","18 September 2004"," A cinematic trick pulled off in high style
","Yes, it's a trick, an elaborate set-up for an ending which is actually not quite an ending.<br/><br/>Yet, I find ""The Usual Suspects"" to be enormously entertaining, and I am a very discriminating moviegoer. I am picky to a fault, and have exasperated friends for over thirty years with my instant 2-star reviews of films they thought ""brilliant"" as we emerged from the theatre. But all of us have varied movie tastes, and simply because we have no emotional involvement or interest in a film doesn't make it a bad film or its fans stupid.<br/><br/>On my first viewing, I was hooked from the opening bars of the John Ottman score -- I find it impressive that he was also the film's cinematographer. ""The Usual Suspects"" is so well-lit and its look so uncluttered, with a color palette appropriately devoid of almost any primary colors.<br/><br/>I could listen to Pete Postlethwhaite read the phone book while watching that dome-like, idiosyncratic face; I find Chazz Palminteri to be perpetually underrated, and wonder what the hell has happened to Kevin Spacey's film career? Sometimes a movie is wildly overpraised on first release; an example that jumps immediately to mind is ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians Are Coming"" in 1966. Four Oscar nominations? Including Best Picture? I mean, come on.<br/><br/>And so it may have been for ""The Usual Suspects."" At least Christopher McQuarrie chose to create something a little outré, a script that stands apart from more conventional detective mysteries. The bones of the story may be a Hammett or Chandler retread, but it's the flesh on those bones that have gained ""Suspects"" a legion of fans.<br/><br/>For all those reasons and more, I'll continue to enjoy ""The Usual Suspects,"" and revel in introducing the unsuspecting to its not inconsiderable pleasures."
"TheNorthernMonkee","10","1","2","26 July 2004"," a couple of legendary movie moments
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>There are not many characters in cinema who achieve as large an element of mystery as that of Keyser Soze. Described by criminals as the Devil, ""the Usual Suspects"" would have us believe that everyone knows someone who knows someone else who knows someone who's worked for Keyser Soze. Nobody knows who Soze is however, and this along with some other unanswered questions, makes up this brilliant crime mystery thriller.<br/><br/>Staring Kevin Spacey as Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, an unintelligent cripple who ends up working with a group of long time thieves and killers, ""The Usual Suspects"" tells it's tale in the form of flashbacks and story telling by Spacey. The five criminals (Spacey included) are united at a Police Organised Line-up. Coming from different forms of life, they decide to unite for a job worth their fortunes. Eventually however, all five will meet the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) and his employer, the mysterious and evil Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>With most modern crime thrillers, there is a habit for the film to be transformed from a decent idea into a hideous piece of straight to television quality. With ""The Usual Suspects"" however, this habit has been ignored as a brilliant film has been created. Whilst perhaps taking it's time getting started, this film is more than willing to set up it's conclusion by dropping minor hints throughout. With a superb, amazing script which would seem complicated, but is made to look obvious, Christopher McQuarrie has made a piece of writing which some of the great murder writers would be truely proud of.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is not purely down to it's script however. Kevin Spacey puts in yet another excellent performance as ""Verbal"", and he is joined by Postlethwaite, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, the particularly superb Gabriel Byrne and many others. Byrne as former corrupt cop Michael McManus demonstrates his skill as he combines his typical intimidating manner with a sense of love for the lawyer (Suzy Amis) who has made him go straight.<br/><br/>Added to the cast and the script is Bryan Singer as director. Singer would later go on to direct ""X-Men"" (2000) and it's sequel (2003), but as only his third film (after 1988's ""Lions Den"" and 1993's ""Public Access""), it is this piece which demonstrates his true potential. Singer's image is excellent as there are one or two moments which are made ten-fold better as a result of particular camera angles. Singer generally helps to make this film the gem that it is.<br/><br/>So to summarise, there's little way to fault ""The Usual Suspects"". With a cast of some of the finest actors of the last few years, Brian Singer has had the resources to create this masterpiece. Without even the finest cast and director available however, no film is complete without a masterful script. This piece of writing which would eventually become Singer's brilliant movie, was superbly written by Christopher McQuarrie as he kept the plot flowing as it leads to it's powerful, revealing conclusion. ""The Usual Suspects"" is one to remember, and one to treasure."
"Shrykespeare","10","1","2","27 May 2004"," One of the best crime dramas EVER
","A poll in Entertainment Weekly magazine a couple of years ago listed, among other things, the Top 10 movies to watch over and over. The Usual Suspects came in 2nd, right behind The Shawshank Redemption. And that says it all... this is a movie that can be watched over and over again. Even if you've seen the ending dozens of times, you like to pretend that you're watching it for the first time. It's just that good.<br/><br/>The first time I ever saw this movie was on cable in the early part of the evening. I was so floored by the way the movie ended, I went out and rented it, and watched it again that very night. As a veteran film-goer, I can think of no other movie that has affected me like this.<br/><br/>I watch this film now and I wonder how this story would have been adapted to film had it been made in the days of B/W. Veteran crime drama actors like Bogart or Cagney could have slipped into these roles like a glove. It's not a stretch to imagine the type of dialogue or the score that was prevalent in crime dramas of the time; this story is a great mystery for any era.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is absolutely first-rate. Spacey earns his well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Verbal Kint, a character so obviously deeper than the two-dimensional crippled crook that he PRETENDS to be. Gabriel Byrne's Dean Keaton, corrupt, ruthless and possessing a conscience that you need a microscope to see, still manages to SOMEHOW generate sympathy. Steven Baldwin? Who'd've thought that anyone associated with Bio-Dome had such a performance in him? The list goes on... Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palmintieri, and my personal favorite, Pete Postlethwaite as the enigmatic Kobayashi. (Side note: I love that not one person noticed or even commented on the fact that a British lawyer had a Japanese name, but that of course tied into the ending!)<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is tense and taut, like a great crime drama should be. The camera work is top-notch, and the score is absolutely perfect. The script is superb, rife with memorable lines and even more memorable characters. (I would have awarded McQuarrie the Oscar just for coming up with the name Keyser Soze; I mean, is that a great name for an omnipresent bad guy or what??)<br/><br/>This film is the exception to many rules. Usually, a film dome mostly in flashbacks is lame and predictable... not this one. Films where the bad guy wins, which are rare, usually leave the viewer with a sour taste in their mouth... not this one. (Of course, when 95% of the characters in a movie are bad guys or, at the very least, people of questionable character, it's not hard to root for them! ""Payback"" is another example.)<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, even if they already know how the movie ends. If you've only seen it once, see it again. This is a movie that gets better with multiple viewings, not worse. I've lost count of how many times I've seen it, and it's taken it's place at the #1 spot of my favorite drama of all time."

"paul2001sw-1","8","1","2","7 October 2003"," Unusually good
","Brian Singer's thriller tells a slick, ridiculous but hugely entertaining yarn, with a postmodern twist: much of its shock value deriving from confounding the expectations of the audience rather than from the innate properties of the story.  Kevin Spacey is excellent as Verbal Kint, the man with a tale to tell the police; and the film as a whole is sharp and concise, leaving the viewer with an appetite for more.<br/><br/>But in spite of this, the film is good, rather than great.  There are holes in the plot, and the essential device is actually a breach of the universal contract between the movie-goer and the the film-maker: the only way to avoid being suckered would be to adopt a scepticism so thorough-going that it would be impossible to enjoy this (or indeed any other) fictional tale. Neither of these things really matter, but what is more of a problem is the nugatory quality of what results: instead of delighting us with alternative realities, the film destroys its own premise without putting anything concrete in its place, as if it has no purpose beyond teasing.  Teasing, however, is something it does extraordinarily well.  In conclusion, 'The Usual Suspects' is a superior work of contemporary entertainment; but too empty to be rated a masterpiece."
"gigotu","9","1","2","8 July 2003"," Is it real or is it Memorex?
","Movies, as other art forms, can manipulate us in ways that we would not be manipulated in real life. Such is the intent of 'The Usual Suspects', and it is a real disappointment in the final analysis. Basically, the last few minutes of the movie are saying to us: ""we tried to dupe you into believing all of this is true, but now you have to go back, watch the whole thing again, and differentiate between realty and a fantasy story as told by a twisted, compulsive-lying, self-perceived genius"".<br/><br/>But when you watch the whole thing again, you (at least if you are remotely analytical) realize that the vast majority of the movie up to the last few minutes is the fantasy story as told by the twisted self-perceived genius, and only a small portion is realty. So you come to understand that only the small portion that is reality can be believed and that the entire rest of the movie that is the recollection of the twisted self-perceived genius is most likely a big LIE. But then so many people love this movie that I suppose the vast majority of us enjoy getting duped.<br/><br/>But ask yourself this: what would you think if, at the end of The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne woke up next to his wife and said to her ""Honey, you won't believe the dream I just had. It was a dream, wasn't it?"" And she just lay there motionless not saying anything. And you wonder - was it real or was it Memorex?<br/><br/>Well, do you get it now? Probably not."

And if I understand correctly that Verbal (Kevin Spacey) is actually Keyser Soze then it's as though I sat through ""Seven"" again. Keyser Soze and the John Doe character in ""Seven"" are both portrayed as these elusive and almost mythic figures and in each film this elusive figure is equated with ""the Devil himself."" Someone actually utters that line in both films when talking about our mystery man. So when Kevin Spacey pops up in both roles they just sort of cancel each other out for me. Maybe I would have enjoyed ""The Usual Suspects""  a little more if I had not seen ""Seven"", although the ""everything-you've-seen-and-heard-up-to-this-point-might-have-been-a-lie"" ending would have still ultimately lowered it quite a few points in my estimation."
"mcq3000","Null","1","2","15 October 2002"," There aren't Several Twists, Only One....
","The only reason this movie achieved the status it did was because of the one twist it had. The whole movie is just a buildup for this same twist and that is why once it occurs, it concludes so quickly. It was a cleverely thought out TWIST. The only thing I liked about the movie was how he incorporated the set pieces in the Interrorgation Room to twist the story to suit his purposes. Actually delving into the ""story"" was a waste of time and pointless. I would have felt the same way if the movie was 30 minutes long and he didn't eleaborate on the story the way he did. Wether he went on for 5 hourse or 30 minutes on the actual story makes no difference to the movies climax and conclusion. This is hardly good filmaking, and isn't even great Entertainment, plus it does not have any genius behind it. What it does have is a ""I would have never seen it coming"" climax/twist that most people just wouldn't have figured out because hardly any clues where given in the first place. Does it require second viewing? HELL NO!!! Once the twist is known, there is nothing more to the movie, everything else is just a buildup to this.<br/><br/>And I think Kevin Spacey is a very mediocre actor personally. American Beauty was an excellent film, but hardly because of him. Spacey to me, has a pretty emotionless face, and only seemed to portray on screen emotion that was appropriate in the movie K-pax. He certainly did not deserve an Oscar for Usual Suspects as the movie didn't determine any real acting skills whatsoever, I mean, 75% of his time is in an office relating a story, anyone can do this..."

"solojones","10","1","2","9 August 2002"," Is it all a lie?
","(Am I biased because my nickname is Verbal, I'm a huge fan of this movie, and I'm a HUGE Kevin Spacey fan? Nooo, this movie gave me those things! With that in mind, read on)<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Saying the whole movie is a lie is not really accurate. The whole movie is being told from the perspective of someone who, to serve his own interests, lies throughout his retelling. We know for sure that he lies about names and probably details of events, BUT there is truth to his lies. Kobayashi is a real person, and the guys are all real, and I believe the basic details of the movie are true. But part of the beauty of this film is that you don't know for sure what is true and what's not. Here's how Kevin Spacey described this movie- <br/><br/>He said it's like a play. When you go to see a play, you are in one seat and you can only see the play from that one seat. But if you go to see it again, your perspective changes and you might see things in the play you never saw before, and have a different view on the play than you did the first time. And everytime you see it from a different seat, you get another piece of what the whole picture looks like. <br/><br/>This is the most perfect analogy for this movie that I have heard yet. It's one of the few films I have seen that really gets better each time I see it. Because each time, I see something in a different way and I notice something I hadn't noticed before. The film is an intricate web, which I find fascinating. <br/><br/>Now, about the director lying with his camera... well, in the scenes where Verbal's telling the story, Bryan Singer is simply portraying the picture Kujan must be getting in his mind as he buys into the lie Verbal is feeding him. Not only that, but before the particular scene you mentioned, the perspective changes. Kujan actually says, ""Let me tell you what I know..."" and at that moment (as Singer points out on the commentary) the storytelling view switches to his own. What we see now on the boat is what Kujan believes has been going on. He doesn't think that Verbal killed Keaton, and certainly doesn't think Verbal is Soze. This is because Verbal has done such a brilliant job of convincing Kujan that Kujan's suspicions about Keaton are right. Verbal has done it! He's planned out the whole thing carefully, and now he's convinced Kujan that he's just an innocent victim. Not only that, but he's also convinced Kujan that Keyser Soze isn't even real at all.<br/><br/>
Remember, the whole theme of the film is, ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" This is just one example of how Keyser Soze (""the Devil himself"") has done this, and an insight into how he's certainly done it before and will keep on doing it.<br/><br/>
On a little different note, would someone PLEASE explain to me how in the world Kevin Spacey was Best Supporting Actor??? Verbal is the storyteller, and Keyser is who the movie is all about. It's not about the other criminals! It's totally about Keyser and Verbal, both of which are portrayed (sometimes simultaneously) by Spacey. If there's ever been a movie that's totally about one person, it's this one! How in the WORLD did the Academy see it any other way?"

","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>I missed ""The Usual Suspects"" when it came out in the theaters, but since a friend saw it before I did and kept telling me how good it was, I decided that I really had to see it.<br/><br/>Believe me, I wanted to really like this movie, to see the genius that some people saw in it. And I am a fan of plot twists. I enjoyed the ones in the Sixth Sense, Fight Club, Memento, or the less bewildering ones in The Godfather, What Ever Happened To Baby Jane or Citizen Kane so this movie, with his highly praised final twist, should have been - if not the ultimate movie experience - at least a very satisfying one. That said, I found this movie mediocre and painfully overrated. And I'm sorry, but that plot twist just doesn't work. It's manipulative and inconsistent with the whole movie, for a simple reason: the whole movie is presented as facts, not as a narrated story.<br/><br/>Where other movies can pull off twists because of their nature - that is, because it's clear that we are seeing a story through a narrator's eyes - ""The Usual Suspects"" uses a manipulative gimmick that, sadly, is mistaken by many as good narration. The movie never explains whose eyes we are seeing the story through, because... well just because. There's no explanation, apart from that explaining it would demolish the plot. So who is actually seeing the story like that? Verbal Kint? Hardly: if it was him, we would know it's mostly a bogus story. Apparently the only person that could possibly see the story that way is Dave Kujan, the cop in the office, who believes almost every single word that Verbal speaks. And that would be rather insulting to the intelligence of the viewer, because there's no reason why we should be watching the cop's visual interpretation of the story rather than our own. More, there's almost no voice-over that would remind the viewer that he's seeing a narration, and it's very questionable that a person that didn't take part in the narrated story would envision it like that (think about it, do you really have a clear image when somebody narrates his own story)?<br/><br/>One of the previous comments by a users said ""shocking and surprising - if you're an idiot"" and that's pretty much what I thought too. The movie relies almost only on a twist that might appeal the casual movie-goers, but that's completely illogical at a further examination.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" was for me a huge disappointment, and repeated views just confirmed this point."

",""" Keaton always said, I don't believe in God but he scares me.  Well I believe in God and the only thing that frightens me is Kaizer Sauze. "" Verbal Kint<br/><br/>So is one the coolest lines in the movie.  And it is a line that sums up how this movie is great at playing with your mind and your emotions and takes you on a journey from point A to point B, then C and then Z and all points in between.<br/><br/>As the story goes 5 cons are brought together suspiciously in a line up and are eventually thrust into a crime spree together.  But what happens later after their apparent one job is completed, puts all of their lives in danger.  They may have been hired by the mythical "" Kaizer Sauze "" ( who strikes fear in mens hearts just by the mere mention of his name ) to complete one further job where, if they succeed, will be free to divide up 91 million dollars in drug money.  Quite the tempting proposition.  But the story is just one of the elements that make this film work.<br/><br/>The men chosen to play the roles of Keaton ( Byrne ) Hockney ( Pollack ) Fenster ( Del Torro ) McManus ( Baldwin ) and Verbal Kint ( Spacey ) were probably done so because they were not major Hollywood players.  Even Kevin Spacey at this time was a B actor at best.  This was before his academy award and before Seven.  And the budget for this film was not that large. But what the casting did by having these actors play the roles of these five men was create excellent characters that are now so familiar to us that I don't believe anyone could have played the roles better.  The energy and charisma that they have together is amazing and watching certain jarring sessions between men is like watching Shakespeare ( if you're into that sort of thing. )<br/><br/>Of course the most brilliant thing about the film is how it is summed up at the end and if you do figure it out before they tell you everything, hats off to you.  But my guess is that you won't and that makes the movie so much fun.  This is a near perfect film and it is worth watching many times."

"Wuchakk","4","1","3","29 November 2016"," Who IS Keyser Söze? Who freakin' cares?
","Released in 1995 and directed by Bryan Singer, ""The Usual Suspects"" is a crime drama/mystery about five thugs who decide to team up and get revenge on the police (Keven Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Steve Baldwin, Keven Pollak and Benicio Del Toro). After their successful operation, the five are manipulated by the legendary criminal Keyser Söze into taking a much riskier gig. One is captured and he's interrogated by the police (Chazz Palminteri & Giancarlo Esposito). The big question is: Who IS Keyser Söze? Pete Postlethwaite is on hand as Söze's right-hand man while Suzy Amis plays the babe of one of the thugs. <br/><br/>This is a ""twist ending"" flick and, honestly, the film is too reliant on it. The whole movie is just ""wait for the twist,"" it isn't actually that entertaining to sit through. In fact, most of the dialog is pretty boring; and only had some value in the end. Moreover, the main characters are just foul-mouthed, tough-guy low-lifes, although Spacey's character is somewhat interesting. As such, it's next to impossible to care about them. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Yes, the ending is clever in some ways, but everything that goes on up to that point isn't really worth enduring. As far as the twist goes, I was able to pinpoint the identity of the mystery man down to two people; and I was right. But there are some interesting details to the twist that I doubt anyone could figure out without first knowing the ending and then re-watching the flick. But, after watching, I'm not interested in seeing it again. The story and the characters aren't worth it. The film didn't make me care enough to watch again. <br/><br/>Filmmakers must understand that, for a movie to be enduring, it has to be about the journey not the destination. And, for me, the convoluted journey in ""The Usual Suspects"" is just dull and laborious. If the characters were worthy and I cared about them I might be more interested, but that's not the case. Then there's something that I experienced a couple of times while observing the five main guys babble back and forth: I had the overwhelming sense that these were just actors playing 'hip' tough-tawkin' hooligans rather than the characters they were supposed to be. This is never a good sign. <br/><br/>I can't believe the high rating this movie has on IMDb; the movie's seriously overrated.<br/><br/>The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and New York City. <br/><br/>GRADE: C-<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>I want to emphasize that this review does not criticize the film based on pretending to ""know the twist all along"" (as stated above, I was able to figure out who the mystery man likely was, but not the other details). The problem is that the entire movie is based around listening to a guy make up a bunch of stuff. Gee, so all we really know is there was a ship that got torched and Kevin Spacey's character doesn't really have a limp. Okay, thanks for wasting my time with everything else. Great storytelling (rolling my eyes)."
"nhawdon","10","1","3","28 December 2015"," One of the Greatest Movies Ever, Period.
","After reflecting on this movie for months and months, it has slowly become one of my favorites. I read a load of negative reviews of this movie and the biggest grievances of dissenters is that the entire movie is a lie, and that watching it is pointless, because none of it ever happened. I would have to disagree.<br/><br/>To prove my point I'll use a film somewhat similar in structure, Life of Pi. At the very end of the movie, it is revealed that Pi's entire story was a lie, and was simply a way to draw parallels between it and a much more boring story which actually happened. THIS movie lies to the viewer flat out, not the Usual Suspects. In the Usual Suspects, the names of people and places were mad up by Kint, but there is a man named Keyser Soze who was involved in the story in some way, and whatever way the story is told, 27 people were killed in an explosion, so at least some of Kint's story is true.<br/><br/>This ambiguity is what makes the Usual Suspects so brilliant. When the movie reaches its climax, and all is revealed, it is hard not to feel an adrenaline rush, as well as a heap of mixed feelings. The main villain of the film gets away, which in and of itself is a bad thing, but I still couldn't help but crack a small knowing smile as both I and Kujan solved the case together.<br/><br/>But alas, it was all too late. The devil really did convince us that he didn't exist."
"aliases","4","1","3","23 October 2015"," Predictable and boring
","Maybe people say they like this movie because they are embarrassed to say they thought it was boring. The main problem is that the ending was very predictable. Perhaps it was a breakthrough when the movie came out but today, it was very hard for me to be surprised when We discover who the villain is. I mean the guy was creepy all along. In addition, the movie was compiled of an all men cast and the screen was too dark, which was not unusual in the 90s but it is another example for how outdated this film is. It was incredibly boring watching a group of ugly men talking about some crime that is too obvious to the audience. Maybe we should just tell em? Why the high score for this film is beyond my understanding."

If I could I would watch this movie once a night. I highly recommend this movie for everyone. The cast and the plot of the movie was great. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.

The film is about 5 criminals who form a team to rob a ship for a mysterious man named Keyser Soze. Keyser Soze is a mysterious man who nobody knows except his henchman. It's almost as if he knows you but you don't know him. The ensemble cast has to be one of the best collection of actors I have ever seen. It consists of Benicio del Toro as Fenster, Kevin Pollack as Todd Hackney, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, Stephen Baldwin as McManus, and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint. All 5 characters are different in personality but have one job to complete together for the mysterious Keyser Soze. The plot keeps the viewer guessing what comes next and keeps them on the edge of their seat.

"sandnair87","10","1","3","23 March 2015"," Nothing Remotely 'Usual' about It!
","The irony here is that nothing is remotely 'usual' about The Usual Suspects. The plot is a Chinese puzzle box of a thriller.<br/><br/>Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a crippled con man (Kevin Spacey), is one of two survivors of a massacre and ship-burning on a south Los Angeles pier. Before Verbal can be questioned in full, he's offered immunity. Something's up, and customs agent David Kujan has only a few hours to talk to Verbal. Through their informal talk, a story is revealed: Five top-of-the-line criminals (including Kint) are picked up for an NYPD lineup as suspects in a hijacking incident. According to Kint, the quintet, angry about the lineup, join forces to heist an illegal operation for Keyser Soze, who is supposedly the one pulling the strings all along - a fiend incarnate, he says. As the Los Angeles police start their own investigation, Verbal runs Kujan through the hoops, an interplay as exciting as an action sequence. And thus starts the labyrinthine story!<br/><br/>What sets The Usual Suspects apart from the crowd is the striking intensity of the performances, the show-off brilliance of the dialog and the diabolical complexity of the plot directed to perfection by the then relatively new Bryan Singer. Singer's sensationally assured direction exerts a riptide pull. He along with screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie, have plenty of surprises up their collective sleeve, breathing new life into the heist-noir genre. Also, he gives us the character of Keyser Soze - a faceless yet discernible movie element - so enthralling and sinister; it will crop up in pop culture references for years. The Usual Suspects is acted to sweet perfection with an absolutely riveting centerpiece performance by Kevin Spacey. A terrific supporting cast of exciting actors socks over this absorbingly complicated yarn that's been spun in seductively slick fashion.<br/><br/>A whammy of a surprise ending makes you want to see the film again to see if Singer pulled a few fast ones to make the pieces fit. The Usual Suspects is an entertaining mystery with plenty of nerve and vigor. A must watch!"

Actually, an enigmatic individual has recruited this quintet because each of them has either stolen from or interfered with him. At the heart of this slick but sophisticated thriller is a super criminal named Keyser Soze. Meantime, a dedicated Customs official, Dave Kujan is in hot pursuit of one of these five, a former cop, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) who did time in jail for murdering several people. Initially, Dave (Chazz Palminteri) thought that Keaton was dead when he found him in a restaurant bargaining with two other business men.

","""How do you shoot the devil in the back, what if you miss?"". The Usual Suspects, a 1995 crime thriller, stars Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio del Toro, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak and Pete Poselthwaite. The film takes place after a boat, supposedly containing a large amount of illegal drugs, has been destroyed. Verbal Kint (Spacey) is the one survivor and the film follows Kint telling his story to Dave Kujan (Palminteri), a US customs agent, beginning with five crooks in a police line-up (Del Toro, Pollak, Byrne, Baldwin and Spacey).<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is an exhilarating, original and suspenseful film for a number of reasons. Firstly, the screenplay is one of the most original and greatest of the last 25 years (Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for his efforts), with dialogue and characters that shouldn't be underestimated. Secondly, all the actors are amazing in their roles of completely varying sides of the spectrum. Spacey won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, whilst the cast won the NBR award for best ensemble cast and Del Toro won Best Supporting Male at the Independent Spirit Awards. Spacey garnished a number of other awards for his contribution. Thirdly, Singer directs the film with intelligence and innovation, a rare quality for a director in just his second feature film. John Ottman performs the unusual double of music and editing, both of which add to the suspense and mystery of the film. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the film is an excellent one for all lovers of cinema. While it may be difficult to understand the elaborate plot, you should not be put off by this. The film has an R rating in the US and an MA rating in Australia, however, it should be suitable for children above 13 as the violence is not too graphic."

I have introduced my friends children who were high school students to this film, explaining that the street language used (very often in the film) throughout this film creates a believable story but is not to be taken as everyday language that they could use in life. They understand it very well and agree that it fits the film and makes the film so much better. Kevin Spacey has such a fantastic ability to morph into his characters that you forget that he isn't that cripple that you see in the movie.

John Ottman's score is a true classic noir piece; brilliant especially compared to his more recent mediocre efforts but I'll save that for another review.<br/><br/>Now I have heard a lot of flack over the ending which I will not be cruel enough to give away. (You hear that, MST 3k?) But no matter how many times I see it, it is the proverbial middle finger that everyone claims it to be. I find it wonderfully and mischievously in keeping with what was established previously.<br/><br/>That being said, Keyser Soze is one of the best film villains there is primarily because he is a bogeyman. Director Bryan Singer wisely chooses to keep him the shadows for most of the picture and even his life story is just hearsay. To me, there is nothing more scarier than what you don't know and understand. How can such an enemy be defeated? This totally raises the stakes.

The viewer is playing catch-up right until the very end, with its utterly outrageous denouement.<br/><br/>It's a serious movie, but its so well made it's actually fun to watch. And afterwards you sit for a few moments quietly mesmerised.<br/><br/>It's certainly no moral movie. It couldn't be called an epic. But it's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>If ever proof were needed that cinema is an art-form, here it is. There are plenty of directors out there who must agonise and blush to see how feebly their own efforts compare.<br/><br/>Watch it and luxuriate in the craft.

","I just saw this movie for the first time yesterday. I had no idea of the plot, all that I knew was that it was a ""must see"". After seeing the film I couldn't help but feel a little let down. I really enjoyed the film, but wasn't blown away. I am still attempting to reconstruct where I've seen this plot-line played out before. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, and I have a feeling it is from a film from his ""Lady Vanishes"" days. If you are one of the reviewers that would give this film a ""10"", I would suggest you look into more Hitch films. Don't get me wrong, this is a great film. The acting is great, as are the cinematography, and script. However, it just isn't the masterpiece that many claim. I can provide no commentary for any underlying themes or standout scenes. Sit back and watch, don't expect art, or you will be setting yourself up for disappointment."

"jlauro9","10","1","3","27 March 2007"," A Crime Fairy Tale
","The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that will still be talked about fifty years from now when it airs on a classic movie channel. The thing I like most about this movie is that once you know the ending, every time you watch it thereafter you notice something new about it. It took me about 3 viewings to completely grasp the point of the whole thing. What's not to like here ? The screenplay is terrific, the performances are excellent, the musical score is brilliantly foreboding , and the ending is one of the best ever. <br/><br/>The story starts when ""The Usual Suspects"" are brought in for a police lineup that sets the stage for the rest of the film. Partly told through the narration of Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) as he is being interrogated by customs agent David Kujuan (Chazz Palminteri) there is more than meets the eye here. After a little bonding experience in the jail, the 5 suspects set out on a crime spree with disastrous results not knowing that they are but pawns in someone else's master plot. As the plot begins to thicken the suspects realize they have unknowingly made it onto the hit list of the iconic crime figure Keyser Soze. Having stolen from Soze, he blackmails all of them into doing one last suicide mission, the purpose of which is the point of the whole movie. What I realized after several viewings is that this movie is not as complex as it seems. The director toys with the audience and makes them look one way and then sucker punches them, while the truth is staring them right in the face the whole time. <br/><br/>I will not give away too much for people who haven't seen this wonderful film, but I will say that the whole point of the movie boils down to two questions. Does Keyser Soze exist and who is he ? Over the years this film has become possibly my favorite of all time. It just seems to get more brilliant with age and it reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller. By now, you probably already know the ending but if you really haven't heard anything about this movie, go rent it now. Heck, go buy it, it's that good."

The idea behind the film comes from wanting to conclude Cassablanca obviously.<br/><br/>I think its the modern version of Cassblanca. Still keeping the theme of rounding up the usual suspects except removing the romance and adding violence. Pure genius. Pure genius. All art would be served well if more artists removed all romantic connotations and replaced them with violence. I know they'd put more bums on seats and thats what art is all about in my opinion.

","I read through several reviews of this film. It seems that many of the people who didn't like this film where upset that the film ""lied"" to us. They say that movies are not supposed to do that. They got that right. Film is not supposed to do that. Maybe that is one of the reasons why this film does that. Many of the reviewers said they were drawn into to the story, only to have their hopes and aspirations smashed at the end. They couldn't understand why the filmmakers would do this. Is it possible that they ""got"" the film without really getting it? To be correct, the film doesn't lie. The character telling the story lies. The camera is simply showing us what the narrator is telling us. We are so accustomed to believing what the camera shows us, that we accept without reserve. We forget that the ""camera"" is actually the filmmaker, a human being (in most cases), telling us a story. People lie. We cannot always trust people. We cannot always trust what seems to be objective reality. This film does the same thing that ""Rashomon"" and ""Persona"" do, although I consider those films deeper and more profound. We the audience are Dave Kujan, Chazz Palminteri's character. We are falling for the lie being fed to us. Though what we are being told is not totally a lie. Many of the things said and told are true. A lie is not a lie unless it contains much truth. Most of what we see actually happened. The fact that not all of it did is what makes the film so interesting. We are left scratching our heads trying to figure out what actually happened. What we thought we knew we no longer know that we know. I think that is one of the marks of a great film. It stays with you, for good or bad. It challenges your idea about film."

The screenplay is perfectly written, there is nothing to give away the ending until you see it for a second time than you catch all kinds of things. The dialogue and characters are also just perfect.

","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs <br/><br/>A group of known criminals are rounded up for a police line up in a rather unusual fashion. As their lawyers wait to post bail, they agree to pull off another job together. Told in flashback, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) a crippled, informed member of the group recounts to a hard-pressing customs officer (Chazz Palmenteri) how the others were killed and the possible involvement of the mysterious, mythical 'Keyser Soze.' <br/><br/>I decided I'd been a film connoisseur far too long to have not seen or reviewed this extremely critically acclaimed work. And last night (after a failed recording on Sky Movies a few weeks back!) my dream finally came true. Back when it originally came out, I guess you could say I had a sort of different slant on what made a film appeal to me, but now I am far more eager to seek out and review far more acclaimed work such as this.<br/><br/>Shot in just, I think it was 30 days?!?, like Reservoir Dogs, this was a low budget production with a shining concept behind it to ultimately make it stand out more than any of the summer blockbusters that had been released shortly before it. It's a fairly simple story (not really high-concept in any way) that could have had a really simple delivery, but the film cleverly twists and turns it into another one of those ones where you have to pay attention to everything that is being said and inferred. It's probably one of the most impressive efforts of such a film I've seen, in as much as I only saw it last night and, yep, like other critics before me said I would, I still think I need a repeat viewing just to have another go at trying to make sense of it all.<br/><br/>Like RD, this film head-billed a group of debut/small-time actors and sent their respective fortunes spiralling either way. Benicio Del Toro went from strength to strength, whilst Spacey would go on to achieve Hollywood gold status. On the other hand, Gabriel Byrne still only enjoyed co-starring appearances in various films, whilst Stephen Baldwin just plopped back into mediocrity and the other guy (says it all that I can't even remember his name!), well, I think I saw him working in Tescos the other week (Hollywood can be so cruel...) Also, like RD, the film made a name of it's director, Bryan Singer, who would go on to enjoy further success with the X-Men films.<br/><br/>Occasionally, just occasionally, I think Hollywood needs films like this to pop up and flush a load of new talent on the screen. I'm certainly glad I finally saw it and look forward to a (possible) second viewing tonight. *****"
"MichaelMargetis","10","1","3","7 June 2005"," ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"". - Verbal Kint
","#1 Best Film of 1995<br/><br/>One of the best years for movies was 1995. Extraordinary films such as Braveheart, Apollo 13, Heat, Leaving Las Vegas, Nixon, Casino, Seven, and Dead Man Walking were released, in this, perhaps the very best year of film yet. However, the motion picture that out shined all of these excellent movies, was the film, 'The Usual Suspects'. This indie film-noir blew away audiences across the globe when it was released in theaters. The public was impressed with it's incredible writing, dazzling direction, and an all-star cast including Gabriel Byrne (Miller's Crossing), Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Chazz Palminterri (Bullets Over Broadway), Stephen Baldwin (One Tough Cop), Kevin Pollack (A Few Good Men) and Benico Del Toro (Traffic). 'The Usual Suspects' was a surprise hit, that kind of came out of nowhere. Both the director and screenwriter of the feature were very unknown, so before viewing this masterpiece, people really didn't know what to expect. I think it's safe to say most people got a hell of a lot more then they expected, making 'The Usual Suspects' one of the most successful and most talked about independent films of all time.<br/><br/>The story line centers around an explosion on a ship in the heart of Los Angeles, killing all it's passengers (who were mostly Hungarian Mafiosos) except two, a nearly dead Hungarian mafia button man and the other being a gimp con artist from New York City, Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Spacey), who was brought in for a police line-up by the NYPD a couple months before, with four other guys who all died on the exploding ship. Verbal tells the F.B.I. who questions him, he was on the ship to ensure a $91 Million cocaine deal with the Hungarian mafia with the four other convicts -- Todd Hockney (Pollack): a foul-mouthed wise-ass hardware specialist, Michael McManus (Baldwin): a deranged convict who works as the ""entry man"", Fred Fenster (Del Toro) : McManus partner with a muddled unintelligible dialect, and Dean Keaton (Bryne), a dirty ex-cop turned criminal, who was thought and confirmed to be dead three years prior to this in a warehouse fire. Kint's story is the boat set fire, and all the other cons died but him. The D.A. accepts that explanation, but U.S. Customs Special Agent David Kujan (Palminterri) doesn't when he later finds out there was no cocaine on that boat. Kujan sets up an interview with Verbal Kint to get to the bottom of what truly happened on the pier that night. But, Kint is smarter then Agent Kujan estimated, and the Kint's retelling of what happened becomes more unbelievable with every word, and Kint and Kujan are always fighting a battle of wits, which eventually leads to the mystery or legend of the Hungarian mob boss who everyone is afraid of named Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>'The Usual Suspects' is filled to the brim with terrific qualities such as acting, directing, cinematography, an awesome musical score, and most notably the writing. Newcomer Christopher McQuarrie, gives us an astonishingly well-written and powerful screenplay, which holds perhaps the most intricate and most unpredictable endings in cinema history. Bryan Singer (X-Men, Apt Pupil) does a fine job behind the camera, especially during the magnificent line-up sequence which takes place about fifteen minutes into the film. The acting aspect of the feature has nos weaknesses whatsoever. Gabriel Bryne gives his best performance since 'Miller's Crossing' as the ex-crooked cop, Dean Keaton. This excellent and complex screen performance should have earned Bryne an Oscar Nomination for Best Lead Actor. Stephen Baldwin (yes, the Baldwin brother who was in Bio-Dome with Pauly Shore) is perfect as the greedy psychopath criminal, and Kevin Pollack is often funny and if I may say great as the angry/sarcastic little guy. Benico Del Toro is consistently hilarious and you never can quite figure out what the hell he is saying, and I never really understood how marvelous of an actor Chazz Palminterri truly was until his turn as the determined Customs agent, another Academy Award-nominee worthy performance. The stand-out of the cast, of course, is Kevin Spacey in his Oscar winning role as the smart, clever and manipulative gimp, Verbal Kint. Kevin Spacey gives us a performance of such unbelievable power, grit, skill and passion, that it ranks up there as the very best supporting male screen performance of all time. PERIOD! Spacey achieves marvel and utter perfection (which is extremely rare even for excellent actors), in this perhaps his finest role besides his leading role in 1999's 'American Beauty'. John Ottman provides a haunting musical score that will stay with you long after the film's completion, and the film's unbelievably crafty twist ending will stay with you even longer. 'The Usual Suspects' also stars Dan Hedaya, Giancarlo Esposito, Suzy Amis and Pete Postelwaithe as Koboyashi, Keyser Soze's cool-headed and laid-back British lawyer who employs the five cons to pull the boat job.<br/><br/>When it all is over, 'The Usual Suspects' proves to be an absolute masterpiece. The film is absolutely perfect every way you cut it. 'The Usual Suspects' isn't one of those flicks you see once and forget about. It's a movie that will stay with you for a long time, and have you scratching your head in awe of the well-played out and anything but predictable ending. 'The Usual Suspects' is a film that begs to be talked about and discussed in depth. So, if you haven't, go out and rent (or buy, trust me, you WON'T REGRET IT!) 'The Usual Suspects'. Watch it with a friend, and after it's over, have a long discussion about it. That's the way 'The Usual Suspects' was meant to be viewed. Grade: A+<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 250 LIST AT # 3"

There are plenty of bad original movies that weren't well developed, and there are plenty of good movies that built upon those bad movies by incorporating all the positive aspects. To me The Usual Suspects is not original, but it's very well done on many levels. The overall plot is very solid with only a few holes, the acting of main characters is collectively superb, the non-linear story unfolds at a reasonable speed and keeps the audience focused, and there are light hearted dialogs to give this movie just the right amount of humor.<br/><br/>For those that are whining about the ending being predictable, give yourself a pat on the back, Sherlock, and shut your yapper so the rest of the people can enjoy it. If these people are so observant, then it should've dawn on them that there was SUPPOSE to be enough hints toward the conclusion so it won't seem out of place.<br/><br/>The bottom line is I expect to be entertained and not educated by The Usual Suspects, and it did just that.

No other movie I can think of has such an involving plot that I can't see why people find this movie confusing.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS) Poor Mr. Ebert. He's so smacked upside the head with straightforward junk like Titanic and Strange Days that he can't follow an involving storyline.  He needs more brain cells in his head if he wants to keep critiquing films and follow a plot.  The ending, by far, comes out of the blue but is not a deus ex machina that some might expect.

","I´ve heard first about this movie when it was ranked on IMDBs Top250. I think it was ranked #9. So I thought that this movie could be good, or at least, watchable. Boy was I wrong. When I rented The Usual Suspects, I kept myself awake by thinking why anyone could like this movie. It was just very bad and very boring. Maybe I did not like it, because I have just seen half of it. But then I watched it twice again, and I still did not like it. It is not THAT bad, but it is not worth being ranked as #15 of all time, and this is above Saving Private Ryan"" or The silence of the lambs"" ?!? Why ?!?<br/><br/>
After this movie there are two actors that dislike a lot. But I do not remember their names. The only one I still like is Kevin Spacey, but I do not know why, since he has taken part in this film. In about one or two months I am going to watch this film again, and maybe I will like it then. But I do not think so. I am going to sit down on a chair, so I will not fall asleep. But probably this film will be the first one that I will fall asleep while sitting on a chair. <br/><br/>The main complaint I have about this movie is : Why was it so slow ? The characters almost act in slow motion. That was very bad.<br/><br/>

It was so with me, at least. *******SPOILER OVER!*******<br/><br/>However, this film is worth watching, not only because it's a classic example for its genre, but also in order to see Kevin Spacey in his first Oscar-role, playing a completely different kind of character then in his second, American Beauty`."
"Sonatine97","9","1","3","20 June 2000"," Nice film but the content is all ""...window dressing!""
","A very clever who-done-it,  that had rave reviews and audiences were waving their hands in the air wondering who the real Keyser Soze was, and saying how wonderful the twist at the end of the film was.<br/><br/>True, seeing the film first time round you do feel as if you've missed something by the end and only by seeing the film a second, third & forth time do you really begin to pick up the many threads.<br/><br/>But in essence its hokum, nothing more than a who-done-it bluff on the audience, or as Dean Keaton, one of the major characters says in the film ""...it's window dressing..a pipe dream..""<br/><br/>Five crims owe a big debt to the mysterious Soze, that involves hijacking a boat full of $91million of drugs from a rival of Soze's. It all goes horribly wrong and the police want to know what's going on.<br/><br/>And thats where we have the cripple, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) offer his point of view of what happened. Trouble is at the end of the film the bluff is played and you begin to wonder if what he said was really true.<br/><br/>Perhaps the whole film was a con - as seen through Kint's eyes from start to finish, and that we, as the audience, don't get the chance to take an objective view.<br/><br/>Either way, the film's notoriety seems to depend on the ending, while the other 95% of the film goes through the motions. Trouble is we don't know enough about these five gangsters, other than Kint, to really care about them. They remain distant & aloof, angry & cold; bit players in Kint's world.<br/><br/>But the cops aren't exactly wholesome either, especially Dave Kujan, the hard nosed dick who bullies Kint into submission during the interrogation, and regards himself as intellectually superior to the cripple, only to have his comeuppance later on (But then if we are seeing the film from Kint's point of view, then of course you'd expect this)<br/><br/>The only other interesting character next to Kint is Pete Postlethwaite's Kobayashi. A very cool player, plenty of understatement but a hint of menace in his eyes. Strangely I was more scared of him than any of the gang of five, the least inspiring of which would have to be Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton.<br/><br/>Byrne tries to look/play the tough leader of the group, and resorts to method acting by grimmacing a couple of times and staring at people with about as much conviction as Roger Rabbitt, not helped by a rather weird Irish/Brooklyn accent, which just doesn't cut the mustard.<br/><br/>So yes, its a good film that offers the audience plenty of meat but on reflection it doesn't rank anywhere near the Big Sleep, Sleuth, any Hitchcock film or Agatha Christie caper.<br/><br/>Who is Kyser Soze? Who cares!<br/><br/>Good, but not that good<br/><br/>***/*****"

This screenplay has one of them, and after that 'that's it'. There are no more. And it's actually very hard to be this original: there are only so many ways you can do stuff like this.<br/><br/>I remember when I first got this movie (on video, not at the cinema). The guy in the store told me to not get distracted while watching as otherwise I'd miss the plot. And I still kept working at home, watching the movie out of one eye, and I worked a long time that night and rewound the tape several times until I just got plain frustrated and figured I'd better lay off the work and sit this one out. At that point I was halfway through spin #4.<br/><br/>So I sat down, away from my work, and watched, and I'd seen enough by then to pick up the pieces pretty quickly - but was no wiser for that, others might want me to add.<br/><br/>Until the very very end that is - when suddenly it hit me like a freight train, and I stopped the movie, rewound a bit, checked out a scene or two again, and then uttered something to myself along the lines of '!!!!!!!!', rewound the tape to the beginning, and finally watched the entire movie as had been suggested, and watched very carefully. And when you realize the full portent of the movie, of what you've just seen, you might get up and applaud, right there in front of your own television screen.<br/><br/>McQuarrie got a lot of grief for this screenplay. He also got an Oscar, so go figure. But the objection all along from the studio was that the screenplay was too difficult.

","In this time and age, many conspiracy theorists are having a field day. They come up with so many mind-bending and mind-boggling explanations to drive home their point of why a particular event happened the way it did. Their story may sound incredulous, but they sure have an appropriate answer for the turn of events.<br/><br/>Take the example of the genesis of Covid-19. One camp will insist that it was a Chinese bioweapon that went wrong. To support their assertion, they would show 'proof' of the Chinese Communist Party's secret laboratory in Wuhan and how a diseased bat landed in their market-place.<br/><br/>Then the opposing party will say that the virus is actually US-made. To arrest China's seemingly unstoppable ascent for emerging as the world's largest economy, the US had to resort to such dirty tactics. A third party would then appear to insist that the virus was just a natural mutation, a sort of Nature's fight back to reclaim its territories.<br/><br/>When you turn around and tell them that their tall stories are too unbelievable to be accurate, they would turn around and tell you, ""Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction!""<br/><br/>Then there is the New World, the Illuminati, the Cabal of Bankers with the Rothschilds, the Mossad and the list goes on who really controls all the wars, the economy and even tsunami and climate change.<br/><br/>
'The Usual Suspects' has a sort of cult following. It is often quoted as a pop culture reference in many American shows including 'Saturday Night Live' and 'Family Guy'. The convoluted storyline told by a convict of an elusive mobster and twist at the end of the movie is a classic for many movie buffs. It also boasts of many memorable lines reminiscent of any good noir movie of the 50s.<br/><br/>As the signature of the film says, 'the greatest stunt that devil pulled was that he never existed' is precisely how the hidden forces of the controlling powers work. Work is done by proxies. The right-hand whacks, whilst the left applies the soothing liniment. The arms that break also embrace. That is the art of deception."

One is the investigation of the case in reality, including David's interrogation of the lame man kint in the police station, the memories and portraits of the survivors in the hospital, and the other is the ""context"" of what kint confessed. The most controversial is the ""context"" of Mr Gent's account. Some think it is all false and all made up by Mr Gent. Others think it is mostly true, except that he compiled the names.
In fact, this movie is very interesting, and we can also see the director's efforts and the actors' acting skills. The first time I watched it, I paid more attention to the development of the story and the guess of the murderer, while the second time I watched it, I appreciated the performance of the actors and the director's skills. At the beginning of the film, a vague dialogue between a suspected behind-the-scenes boss and keaton, who asks him ""what time is it? Does anyone care when they die? At the end of the film, you will find that the lame kint gets his things back before he walks out of the police station.

For the most part, the main cast does a great job in the portrayal of their characters. Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Verbal is well done. Verbal has a physical disability and is considered to be stupid. Spacey displays a convincing lack of mobility in the film. Simultaneously, Spacey's body language is believably timid and mild manner. Moreover, Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of Fred Fenster was fantastic. Del Toro engrains Fenster with a thick accent that lends a realistic and natural spirit to the character. Gabriel Byrne plays Dean Keaton, serving as the assumed leader of the criminals. Byrne's portrayal of Keaton grants the film levity and a cooler head. Byrne's facial expressions are really well done. Keaton is a character tormented by his past. Despite being haunted, Keaton serves as the straight man, driven by love as opposed to gain. Chazz Palminteri acts as Officer, Dave Kujan. Palminteri does a great job showcasing intensity and grit when needed. He drives the film by answering the questions when needed. Despite moments of great acting, the dialogue suffers from poor writing and delivery in some aspects.<br/><br/>Some characters are one-dimensional. Certain actors deliver their lines with too much force and intensity. Verbal has the best dialogue in the film. ""The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled was making people believe he didn't exist,"" is an incredible line. The police officers in the film are also afforded some great lines, and engaging moments of discourse. At times, anger throughout the film feels unnecessary. In terms of being written, specific characters are very dumb, whereas others are brilliant. The aggression in the film is heavy handed at moments, diluting the story's progression. Up until the conclusion, the story is convoluted and predictable. The time jumps and flashbacks are placed poorly at moments. The story could've benefited from more ""present day"" moments, rather than flashbacks. On the other hand, the ending makes up for a lot of these issues by being so impactful. The convolution of the story is a testament to who is truly narrating it.<br/><br/>The cinematography is decent for its time. Mostly, there's no unique style to be had in the cinematography. The camera work is atypical for an action film in the 90s. The best shot moments in the film come from the conclusion. The action in this film is decent. The audio mixing is bright toward the end of the film. However, the soundtrack is very bland, making the film feel like a direct to TV movie, as opposed to a theatrical release.<br/><br/>Overall, The Usual Suspects is confusing at first, but recoups with an iconic and memorable ending. The Usual Suspects is a good crime-thriller driven by great acting."

","Some movies just take a cinematic toll on one's heart and one is bound to assert the cohesiveness of one's senses or they will flee away into an untimely disruption and would present a drop of total chaos. The mystery, embroidered into the details of the movie, summiting finally into some undue breakthrough either in the end or when the credits fall over; is an exhilarating treat for some. It is just uplifting to the senses and it takes one to a level of visual ecstasy. The Usual Suspects is such a movie which actually takes one's senses to get embroiled into the dynamic of evolving twists and convolutions in the play-up and in that one is taken to a heightened spirit. The mystery doesn't know where to end; and the twists and turns only rack up the confusion to an extent, that one is pushed to retort in a hush manner; where is this movie leading us! The movie has a man reminiscing about events and in that he takes to different visualizations, that make up the most of the movie. This 1995 flick, deriving its name from the Spy magazine, is something to watch, and the scenes which epitomize the climax of it; are the ones at the very first and the ones leading to the credits. Another actor that holds my eyeballs for his role as a duty-strict cop is Chazz Palminteri. The movie follows a man recounting a criminal experience that played in the past involving five men; all having diverse criminal affiliations and pulling out gimmicks for themselves. We have him detailing about a police line-up, several hand-shakes with criminal scenarios and the conclusive blast on the pier killing 27 men in the fire. The film follows an overt mystery line anchoring it throughout the film. You are banged by a smooth-and-slow start without any head-boggling twists but as the movie heads halfway through, gimmicks know no end until the last minute. The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled was to convince the world that he didn't exist is such a great line that you are pushed to listen to it on a constant loop and indulge into its precisely-phrased syntax. This line is referred to Keyser Soze who doesn't seem to fit in any physicality and is shown to be mysterious as hell and what to really punch in, when the one who pitches this line, turns out to be the one , thus indicated. The movie turns into twists and turns at every other moment; the mystery hidden never gets subsided. Events are described in a manner that doesn't really erupt any unfamiliarity to what turns out, but as the movie progresses to the latter half; one could see slight slants towards what the mystery is all about and all of what's suspicious and totally above-the-perception, seems to clear off. It's not very much of a chord-striker but it really pushes you into an upsurge; when we have Verbal Kint playing out what he actually is: Keyser Soze. The mystery wrapped around this not-so-visible character and the visualization that ensues throughout the movie and terrifying flashes of this man, make it up for a desperate catch for those who have been watching it from the very start. Keyser Soze is that symbolic character which, I believe, has been dexterously carved out that one only seems to be struck with suspicion and that is highly commendable as per making up an elusive character. The movie is mysteriously put and continues to stroke your brainy cells for a ride of cinematic spiral. It's so enclosed into the maze of mysteries, that we are not able to decipher a bit out of it until halfway or more. It can pose up to you as completely irrational on many sequences: but with a binge-watch extending up to 2 to 3 screenings, I believe it would surely unfurl some of its mysteries."

My family and me liked it, and so when I went to see it again, I came armed with a note book and a determination not to let crucial plot points slip by me. Once again, my comprehension began to slip, and finally I wrote down: ""To the degree that I do understand, I don't care."" It was, however, some what reassuring at the end of the movie to discover that I had, after all, understood everything I was intended to understand.

","I heard about this movie too many times so I had to go watch it and figure out for myself is it really that good or simply overrated? A bit of both.
The concept is not new and the way the story goes through flashbacks and flashforwards was overused in the 1990s but the movie does its best out of it and glues you to the seat and makes you stay until the credits. ""The usual suspects"" is not that exciting because it looks a lot like a simple who-done-it detective story with a usual twist in the end and all you have to do is guess which is probably the main reason why I didin't enjoy this movie - I already knew how it's going to end.
The music helps a lot here: it is very beautiful and outstandingly put over and into the story. The actors' performances is also the strongest point of the movie except for maybe Kevin Spacey's - it seems at times that he's trying a bit too hard and you are able to see through him since the first scene he appears in. Overall the movie is a good and solid piece of art but it leaves you nothing to think about afterwords. I guess I'll never get into detective stories because of their recycled, one-time nature."

"liz-amin","10","0","1","14 August 2018"," The best crime film ever if I may say
","(ATTENTION! THIS REVIEW IS LONG)<br/><br/>Bryan Singer really did it with this one. 'The Usual Suspects' may just be... the best crime film I have ever seen till this day.<br/><br/>The actors were outstanding. It's like while watching the film, you always think that the character that they play is almost real. When I watched Kevin Spacey's performance, I nearly thought Verbal Kint was a real person. Same goes for the other actors, especially Chazz Palminteri (Kujan), Stephen Baldwin (McManus) and Kevin Pollak (Hockney). Honorable mention to Benicio Del Toro (Fenster) as well.<br/><br/>For the people behind the scenes, focusing on Singer, Christopher McQuarrie (writer) and John Ottman (editor, composer), they all made the film into what I call, a near-perfect movie that will live longer than I think.<br/><br/>Singer directed the film as if he had years of experience (when this is just his 2nd film after Public Access), and that's a huge compliment. Ottman edited the film with really amazing touches and him composing the film's theme as well as the entire soundtrack? He's gonna be really huge soon, as the theme still sticks into my head until this moment.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about McQuarrie. He was the one who came up with the whole concept of the movie, starting from just a visualization of five men in a lineup. To make this outstanding film from just that, McQuarrie's super talented when it comes to scripts and screenplays. And the ability to direct too, just like how he did in MI: Fallout recently.<br/><br/>Lastly, the story. Super amazing, super thrilling and super twisty. Spoilers are warned. I have no clue that Kint (Spacey) was Keyser Söze. When Kujan tells us that Keaton was, already in my mind this is such a huge twist, but still questions come up: who really is Redfoot, Kobayashi and others beside what Kint just told? I thought usually, when the twist is revealed, it signifies the end of the film. But oh boy was I wrong. It was actually near the end, but to know that Kint made up the whole story as he talked, from words and phrases from Kujan's board, that was super crazy. He spontaneously made up the entire thing! When that came, I was super mind-blown and can't really accept that Kint was Söze all along. Now ladies and gentlemen, that's a twist. Huge applause to McQuarrie.<br/><br/>That's it from me. Now by the end of this review, I think most of you reading this have watched the film as I put a spoiler warning before. True or false, will The Usual Suspects live?<br/><br/>I think it will. Very much.

","""The Usual Suspects"" launched Kevin Spacey's carreer into stardom instantly. He won an oscar for his magnificent role, but the story itself is the true star of this movie. Not many stories have had this influence and power over the imagination of the public as ""The Usual Suspects"" has had. It is intriguing till the very end. And when the plot is revealed at the end, it is chillingly exciting and satisfying to find out the truth. In a poll on IMDb, the movie was voted as having the best plot twist, beating out The Sixth Sense (1999). Kevin Spacey had to read the script twice when he first received it, to make sure he fully understood it.<br/><br/>It is an intelligent movie, made on a shoestring budget back then. Shot in only 35 days. That's truly minimal. It had gotten only a limited release in America, because it wasnt expected to do very well. How wrong could they have been! Never underestimate the intelligence of the audience. This is one of those movies that grew bigger and more popular long after its release, just by word of mouth reviews.<br/><br/>I had to watch this movie at least 3 times before I really understood HOW I was being tricked into NOT knowing who the mysterious crimeboss Kayser Soze was. That trick is pulled off very simple. But the most clever cons are often the simplest ones. <br/><br/>What is this fascinating story about? Without giving away any spoilers I can safely tell you that Kayser Soze is a mysterious crimeboss who no one has ever seen, but who every criminal fears. In this story Kayser Soze orders 5 criminals to do a heist on a docked ship in the harbor, which is full of cocaine. The criminals refuse at first, but they are blackmailed into doing the heist anyway. Will the 5 crinminals survive the heist on the ship? And who is Kayser Soze anyway? <br/><br/>Reading my own written synopsis of the story above I must confess it doesnt sound mysterious at all. Sounds rather childish. But wait till you'll see the movie, which really has had an immense power to fascinate audiences worldwide. <br/><br/>Acting is great! Debut of Benicio del Toro. Superb role of Gabriel Byrne and Chaz Palminteri. Photography and editing are masterful. Soundtrack is mysterious. And the direction by Brian Singer was just pure excellence. Writer Cristopher McQuarrie got an oscar. But both director and writer went on to make only mediocre action movies after this first huge succes at the beginning of their careers. Well at least they gave us this mysterious gem, which I must have seen over 20 times by now and I still get a kick out of it. What a thrill of a mystery!"

","'The Usual Suspects' is carried by it's clever writing (by that I don't only mean it's twist ending) and star studded talented cast. It's one of those films (like 'Sixth Sense') that doesn't have the same impact in second viewing. Although very wittily written 'The Usual Suspects' still relies too much on it's final big reveal. When you take that away, you are only left with entertaining cat and mouse heist film with amazing performances. Shallow, but fun. Although Kevin Spacey was the only one nominated (and he also won) for Academy Award, the rest of the cast were equally strong. No one shined out - I guess that shows Bryan Singer's talent directing a movie with such cast.<br/><br/>Again, once the big twist is known, the film loses too much of it's impact, but it is still so well written and acted that it leaves most such crime films far behind."

","This movie is unconventional in its storytelling. For those who've seen the movie they know it better for its increasingly complicated story as the movie progresses as well as the plot twist at the end. While some scenes lag on for the most part it's well shot and well told. All the actors bring something great to the table (particularly Kevin Spacey). The story's about a group on criminals rounded up by the FBI about a truck-hijacking as well as a murder that took place during a harbor. One of them Roger ""Verbal"" Kint is interrogated about what he knew as he was found at the scene of the crime. Kint begins to explain that a mysterious crime boss named ""Keyser Soze"" was there and behind the hit. The more he talks the more complicated things get for the investigators when they try to figure out the truth.<br/><br/>The acting's really good. The characters have good chemistry, they really know how to keep the suspense as well as a sense of humor. The plot does get confusing and in some cases boring but at the same time there's enough dialogue and well acted lines to keep you invested. Like I said earlier Kevin Spacey steals the show. His character's meek and unassuming but you know he's hiding something. I won't give away the ending but let's just say it's interesting. Bottom-line it's a movie worth checking out."

","The Usual Suspects is just an all-around great film.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic. All of the main characters deliver wonderfully witty and original performances, nobody is screwing up a line. At the pinnacle of acting here stands - quite obviously - Kevin Spacey. Not only does he effortlessly show the physical disability of his character, he also generates a weird kind of sympathy toward the viewer throughout the movie.
Camera work is also great. Nothing too special, but the dolly-and-zoom combo in the close-ups gives the movie a steady urgency that keeps the viewers interested, even in the more lenghty or irrelevant sections.
This might sound like The Usual Suspects doesn't have too much of a story to deliver. Well, it turns out the story is by far the best part. It's complicated, interesting and surprisingly revealing at times (I won't spoiler here, see for yourself). Though at certain points during the movie, I felt a little left-alone in the increasing amount of facettes that show up and things you have to remember while still paying attention to the dialogues, but that doesn't do any bad to how great the movie is after you've completed watching it. <br/><br/>All in all, I had real fun for the most part except the few confusing bits, actors and production were also great.

","The Usual Suspects is a 1995 crime drama with elements of the noir and thriller genres. The story follows the misadventure of five felons who are brought together after they are all arrested and brought in for questioning. Bringing these five criminals together gives the police more than they bargain for as the rogues plan to work together on a future theft. Eventually, the team crosses a powerful criminal underlord and is forced to pull a suicidal job.<br/><br/>This film is fascinating, fun, and full of intensity. The well- written story, the thrills, and the amazing cast makes The Usual Suspects a fantastic movie. This film will draw you in from the beginning and it only gets better as the plot progresses.<br/><br/>The only complaint that I would have with The Usual Suspects is the accent of the character Fred Fenster, played by Benicio del Toro. It is simply bad, whatever he was attempting to do. His acting, however, is fantastic. In fact, the entire cast is great, including Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Spacey. The casting of this film is perfect.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for anyone, regardless of taste. It is simply that good. A mystery/crime drama/thriller that will leave you amazed."

","As an avid cinephile, who watches a lot of films to help me to be distracted from the pressures of everyday life, old and new and of all genres (have never had a bias against any genre and never love older films and dismiss new films, or vice versa), 'The Usual Suspects' was one of the finest films personally seen in a while.<br/><br/>Other films to have that effect on me (and garnered 10/10 ratings, a rare rating for me these days) are 'LA Confidential', 'Amores Perros', Orson Welles' version of 'The Trial', 'City of God' and 'The Song of Bernadette', though some films came close as well as re-watches of favourites like 'Se7en', 'Much Ado About Nothing' (1993) and 'The Remains of the Day'. <br/><br/>Simply put, 'The Usual Suspects' is a magnificent film all round that deserves to be re-watched over and over again, one of the few films seen recently to not find any fault with it. Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.<br/><br/>'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.<br/><br/>Film is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.<br/><br/>It has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.<br/><br/>Overall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"richvaldes-14379","10","0","1","8 June 2017"," Unusually scintillating
","The ""usual suspects"" is an unusually awesome classic Hollywood film. I had a time when not every film that was released was a blockbuster as it is sometimes the case now days, ""the usual suspects"" brought a synergy and cinematic craftsmanship that has proved the test of time -It's as good today as it was in 1995. Actor Stephen Baldwin (McManus) whom already had a solid reputation truly elevated himself to Hollywood heavyweight status in this pre-millennial classic. A must see for action movie enthusiasts."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","4 June 2017"," Excellently crafted.
","I very much want to keep this a spoiler-free review, because I had the twist ending spoiled for me and I think that definitely lessened the experience. While said twist may be the most remarkable aspect of the movie, it is certainly not the only thing that makes it a great story produced on a relatively modest budget. Brian Singer and Christopher McQuarrie both showcase some excellent talent in this their second movie, and while none of their later work has received the amount of acclaim that Suspects has, they have not lost their touch in evolving into two of the great writer-directors of the past 20 years.<br/><br/>The story is complex-- not so much that you will not be able to follow it, but enough that you probably won't fully understand it the first or even second time around. I wouldn't have minded getting a slightly deeper look into the world that our five criminals live in, but as it is we understand that it is a world in which those who are crossed or betrayed will seek vengeance. It is this that gives us our most interesting character who never even shows up: Keyser Soze. Regardless of who you think Keyser Soze really is, it is undeniable that he exerts a level of power that is rivaled by few others.<br/><br/>The other characters are decent and are played well by their actors, but not that deep. The dynamic between the five criminals is pretty good. McManus asserts himself as the leader, but Keaton proves that McManus' authority can be challenged. Fenster and Verbal serve as foils to each other. Fenster is the loudmouth that nobody listens to, where conversely Verbal uses his small personality to give himself more freedom from the others. I suppose this falls off a bit with Hockney, who doesn't play much of a role at any point. Despite his annoying accent, Kobayashi ends up being a decent presence in the movie, though he seems like a bit too much of a pushover to be employed by the likes of Keyser Soze. <br/><br/>I would recommend this for anyone who likes crime movies or interesting stories. It's a very well-done movie, but that does not necessarily mean you will like it. Nonetheless, it is worth a try. And even if you've had the ending spoiled for you, I would still recommend that you watch it. The ending won't be as good if you've had it spoiled, but the story up to that point is good enough that you should still be able to appreciate and enjoy it and even want to see it again. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."

","The Usual Suspects is a well written, well acted, well directed mystery with a twist ending that puts some of the great ones to shame. However, like any mystery, it's no fun when you know how it was done. Whereas the first viewing of the film is like a tense build up to a killer punchline, the second viewing feels like a drawn out wind up to a punch we know is coming and that we've already experienced. Still recommend one watch, however."

","The literary value was grade A. A great, gritty script, beautifully-acted characters, and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time, are some of the shining qualities that make the Usual Suspects a truly amazing movie.<br/><br/>The entertainment value was very good, it keeps you guessing throughout the majority of the movie with the ""mystery men"". The casting is pretty unusual though it somehow fits the movie perfectly. Gabriel Byrne is convincing as the ex-con trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life. Stephen Baldwin has the role of his career as the smart-mouthed and cocky professional. Kevin Pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role. Benicio del Toro literally takes a one-dimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character, and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity. Kevin Spacey as we know him was born from this movie. His manners and fast-talking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flick.<br/><br/>The artistic value was awesome. The cinematography was phenomenal. Without giving away the plot, the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties. After you see the ending, and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks, you have to watch it again. On the second time through, you'll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time. It's even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing. It's that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocent-looking Usual Suspects one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>The educational value wasn't very dominant, there isn't much to take from the movie other than don't be a criminal."

Just a great idea, they totally tricked us into believing that Gabriel Byrne (Dean Keaton) was the killer, but there were some twists if you really kept your eyes and ears open. And also a movie to watch a second time, even if you understood what was happening the first time.<br/><br/>Just overall a great movie. Differently a 8/10."

"borowiecsminus","8","0","1","21 August 2016"," Relies too Heavily on its Plot Twist
","8.0/10<br/><br/>People were constantly recommending this movie to me. I mean non- stop. And it makes sense. I absolutely adore Spacey, I love crime movies, I love plot twists, and I love Giancarlo Esposito (he's Gus from Breaking Bad. He plays the FBI agent). But alas, this movie didn't have the same spell-binding effect on me as it did on most people. Why? Because I totally called it. <br/><br/>I called it from the very beginning. And I'll admit, towards the end I said ""oh, I'm wrong. I wonder who it really is."" But at the beginning I thought it was going to be Verbal, and I was not at all surprised when I turned out to be right. How did I call it? Because it's goddamn Kevin Spacey playing the role. He (and Esposito, but he wasn't an option) was the only one in the cast who was good enough to pull of that role. So of course I called it. They wouldn't hire Spacey to just play a one-dimensional fool. They'd hire him to play a mastermind, with the guise of a one-dimensional fool. <br/><br/>People love this movie for the twist at the end, and I don't blame them. It works. It's a great twist. But since it didn't work on me, I can firmly stake my claim that this movie is very little without its plot twist. It's all in the story. Sure, Spacey is fantastic, and the camera-work is nice, and the writing is good, but really, it's the story that makes this movie great. And while I understand the importance of a good story, I am not alright with movies depending solely upon a plot twist that is obvious because of its casting.<br/><br/>After all, let's say this movie was full of nobodies, but Verbal was played by Jack Nicholson. Wouldn't you suspect it's him from the beginning? It's the same thing.<br/><br/>I understand I'm biased because the twist didn't work on me. But I'm also biased IN FAVOR of Spacey, so the way I see it, it evens out."

","""The Usual Suspects"" is a very entertaining and engaging mystery thriller. Most of the time, the plot kept me pretty engaged, I enjoyed the movie's style, and I thought the twist as well done. Of course, the best part of the film is the ACTING! Kevin Spacey's performance blew me away, since he was so interesting, entertaining, and funny throughout the whole movie! He played the best character and gave the best performance. The rest of the cast does very well as well, but Spacey is the only one who REALLY stood out, and he earned a well deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>However, besides the acting, nothing really stood out to me as particularly GREAT about ""The Usual Suspects"", it was just an entertaining crime story that was very well made and well acted. There's nothing wrong with that! But, it feels a little slow at times and there were no true signs of GREATNESS that I could see. Despite this, the film is the 25th highest rated movie on IMDb! That's crazy! It's so over-hyped, which is probably why I didn't enjoy it more! I might've even given it an 8/10 if nobody else really liked it, but when people are rating a film so highly, I expect it to be better than just a good, fun thriller with an excellent performance and a surprising twist. Obviously, I am not AGAINST good, fun thrillers with excellent performances and surprising twists, but they aren't normally 25th greatest movie of all time material.<br/><br/>A large part of the reason of why I can't give ""The Usual Suspects"" a higher rating is my own fault. I just don't see why the movie is SUCH A BIG DEAL. It's fun to watch, yes, but it isn't much more than that.<br/><br/>I recommend the film overall, but I do NOT recommend you to watch it expecting a masterpiece."

","""Who is Keyser Soze?"". It's become a part of the pop cultural lexicon over the last two decades. Even I'd used it a few times, and I'd never watched Bryan Singer's 'The Usual Suspects'. That is, until today.<br/><br/>Occupying the 25th slot in IMDb's top 250, 'The Usual Suspects' obviously comes with some rather lofty expectations for a first time viewer like my self, but I endeavored to keep them in check and judge it on its own terms. My first blush impression is that it's very much of its era. Not so much in its fashions and other such baubles and beads as its attitude. It's very much of that mid-90s explosion of ""indie"" neo noir crime films like 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Fargo'. Like those films, it has an exceptional ensemble cast and a story that demands you pay close attention. That said, I guessed the twist (which I had somehow avoided for these past twenty years) pretty early on. I'm usually pretty oblivious to these things, so I was surprised to have seen it hiding in plain sight as it were.<br/><br/>Stylishly made and boasting strong performances, 'The Usual Suspects' is a tight little mystery. I wasn't exactly blown away, finding the total a bit less than the sum of its parts, but at least I can finally use that Keyser Soze line without being a poser."

","This movie could've been great, and I love movies like this. However there was no twist for me. I figured out the ""surprise ending"" about a third of the way into the film.

I, however, was disappointed, and I know I'm not the only one.<br/><br/>The twist is all too predictable. There is a mystery character, who is almost too cunning, cool, and unstoppable to believe. His history makes him out to be the most intimidating and mysterious legend in crime. So who is this figure? It must be someone we know, someone the audience has been introduced to, because if it is anybody new--big whoop, nobody cares. So which character could it be? Well, the least likely guy, in movies like these, is the most likely guy. So, try the crippled, awkward, outcast--Verbal Kint. It couldn't be him, he doesn't know what he's doing--so it must be him. Not to mention, he's the only guy who survived! And he's the one telling the story, as he wants you to hear it.

","If you're under thirty, where do you think you'll be at that age? If you're over thirty, where were you at that age? Maybe starting to figure out your life. Maybe finally getting a stable, well-playing job and starting to take relationships seriously. Brian Singer was directing one of the best movies of the nineties. <br/><br/>Not that he was the only directing prodigy of the nineties. This decade in film say two trends above all else. One, the fluid, dynamic, dark cinematic stylings which were reserved for only 'real', 'serious' movies in the past spread throughout the industry. And two: a crop of new young directors come into the spotlight en masse right as the industry needed some new blood. We may see such an outpouring again. Or we may not. But there is no denying the impact that it made on the film industry. Tarantino, Shyamalan, and many more, including Mr. Singer, started to soar here.<br/><br/>But even considering the fact that it was not uncommon for young directors to make great films in this age, it still surprised me to know that this is a Singer movie. Despite the fact that this movie drapes itself with mythology and fiction at every corner, it is still ostensibly a 'real' movie. I did not expect it to come from the man most synonymous with the X-Men films. Yes, said films have more 'real' elements than a standard superhero story and yes, going from grounded films early in a career to more fantastical ones later in a career is commonplace... but these films don't even stylistically look like they were directed by the same person. Singer would make a good chameleon.<br/><br/>I do admit, though, that such is only one of these reasons I didn't make the connection. This film is spectacularly artistic. It sweeps you vividly into this distorted world of Kevin Spacey's thoughts as he tells of a story centered around the notorious criminal mastermind, Keyser Soze. As much as I love the X-Men films, could hardly imagine Singer directed a film of this cinematic quality now, let alone when he was thirty.<br/><br/>McQuarrie, who wrote the script at only twenty-seven, also shows talents well beyond anything that could be reasonably expected. It is one of the best scripts of the decade and one that deserves to be gone into. So we shall.<br/><br/>If I had to name the one greatest feature of the script as a whole, it would be its ability to guide you while misguiding you. Unless you are Roger Ebert, you never feel that it is isn't providing enough information. But it still manages to make you jump to entirely faulty conclusions. It's like you are watching a play and you occasionally hear noise behind the stage. But every time you get ready to get up from your seat and check it out, the play draws you back in, as if it has some psychic hold on you.<br/><br/>Even before I watched this movie, I knew what the twist was. In case you don't know, I won't spoil it, though you really should know it whether or not you've watched this film. Just saying. Anyway, because I knew this twist was coming, I paid attention to how they set it up. I expected excellence and I got near-perfection. This film does a sterling job of making you think that you don't know what will happen, thus allowing the big reveal to strike you at an even deeper place in your heart. I was almost questioning who it was for a second, imagining that the whole world lied to me like parents do about Santa Claus.<br/><br/>Ahh.. fond memories.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, few films are better. The soundtrack is impressively foreboding. The characters are more than fleshed out enough to let the film work its magic. The cinematography is breathtaking. Two scenes come to mind. One is the scene where the group of criminals that comprises most of the main cast find the body of one their own down by the sea. The second is, of course, the saturated scene where Soze's backstory is 'explained' and Spacey famously says 'The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing people he didn't exist', words that are repeated at this film's climax.<br/><br/>But it is to some extent pointless to technically discuss this film. The whole is worth more than the sum of its parts. I consider a great movie to be that can offer something to me that no other medium can, one that deserves to be watched. This film fulfills that."

","Starting off with a usual group of petty criminals, The Usual Suspects(1995) pulls off a feat that amazes crowds to this very date. An incredible plot-twist which supports an already gripping storyline makes it an all-time favorite. Featuring Kevin Spacey (Roger ""Verbal"" Kint), Gabriel Byrne (Dean Keaton), Stephen Baldwin (Michael McManus), Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster), Chazz Palminteri (David Kujan), Kevin Pollak (Todd Hockney), and Pete Postlethwaite (Kobayashi), the cast is carefully selected with attention to their respective character's details.<br/><br/>The story starts with Verbal Kint recounting the tale of five men set up to take revenge against the LAPD. Following a truck hijack in New York, five criminals, Kint, Keaton, McManus, Fenster, and Hockney are arrested and brought together for questioning. Since they were but innocent of the crime, they plan a revenge operation against the police. The operation goes well, but then the influence of a legendary mastermind criminal, the dreaded Keyser Söze is felt. It becomes clear that each one of them has wronged Söze at some point and must pay back now. <br/><br/>The final scene of Verbal's narrative is a storytelling masterpiece, a payback job on a ship that leaves 27 men dead in an explosion. The audience cannot help but question now: Who is Keyser Söze?<br/><br/>The minor cinematic details that have been put in the interrogation proceedings between Kujan and Kint may look unnecessary, even commonplace, but in the end make the plot an absolute beauty. Verbal's subtle characteristic brilliance has definitely helped Spacey grab an Academy Award for the Best Supporting Actor. <br/><br/>The movie is not made for the superficial mind. The movie is not made for the lovers of sci-fi, action, or of any Hollywood glitter. Rest assured, the first time the plot twist reveals, you might not even understand it. It takes some time for the sorcery of the storyline to sink in. However, fret not. A repeat viewing of the movie becomes far more interesting as you can clearly notice the devious tricks that the movie plays on us. It is definitely more than what meets the eye."

","This movie is one of best written films I've ever seen, never before have I witnessed dialogue this good, that's not a Tarantino film. And the whole concept of the movie is genius. The only annoyance is that I already knew the ending through cultural osmosis, due to the film's cult status I found it somewhat unavoidable, like the six sense or fight club. But that didn't make it any worse, because while the ending is crazy and iconic, the film is not dependant on this alone. Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Verbal is insane, the subtle character traits he possessed, like nervous ticks or strange head movements really encapsulated his character perfectly without drawing any attention away from his dialogue. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am keen to watch it again to pick up on anything I missed the first time. I highly recommend this film."

","One of those movies that everybody talks about in glowing terms because somebody in the media told them it was.Not bad really.Fair direction and standard performances drop this in the DVD shelf about half way.I can see how some people may find this a little confusing as there is a lot going on. Quite a clever twist but not enough to make this any cleverer than it already is.The one outstanding performance is by Peter Postlethwaite who looks as if he is the only person who knows what's going on.Worth a watch on TV but I woudn't go and buy it. If you are seeing this movie with high expectations from the media who bigged this up and from all the people who told you it's brilliant because they listened to it then you might be disappointed.Saying all that I think it would be good to see the extras to get a good idea of how the director wanted this to turn out.Full of one liners and stereotype characters this is good to watch with a beer on the sofa.You might end up feeling a bit let down."

It's easily one of the best films to be released in the nineties, and along with Shawshank, Leon, and Pulp Fiction, its in really good company, because whenever you mention one of the above films, you instantly think of the others.<br/><br/>The film works so well because of the narrative between Kint and Kujan. Yes, the story is fascinating, but its Verbals narrative that constructs the way he story goes, it's his story, his narrative, his film if you would, hence 'Verbal'.<br/><br/>When you watch this film for the fifth or sixth time, you begin to ask yourself, just how much of the actual story is true?, just how much exposition, and juxtaposition has he put into his story?<br/><br/>All of the other characters are important to the story, but not necessarily the narrative, because the story doesn't have a clear path, because it's all Verbals version.<br/><br/>The cast are wonderful, and it's really strange to see just how careers went after this. They are all career defining performances. <br/><br/>Set pieces are terrific, but Verbals story of Keyser Soze still gives me goosebumps, Spaceys delivery of that speech is one of the most perfect pieces of acting I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Harking back to noir movies of the forties, the film is an exceptional piece of cinema, and whoever thinks they know who Keyser is, it's perfectly clear that Verbal was the one with brains...."

"powermandan","10","0","1","15 January 2015"," The Best Brain-Popper Since The Maltese Falcon.
","I think The Maltese Flacon was the first movie that required multiple viewings because of how complex and confusing the story is. Fast-forward almost fifty years to the movie that is just as hard to follow and just as good as Bogart's classic. (""The Usual Suspects"" actually comes from a line in Bogie's best-known film, Casablanca.) In fact, this is such a confusing movie, famous and knowledgeable film critic, Roger Ebert called it one of the worst movies of 1995. Why did Ebert not like it? Because he couldn't figure it out! I have seen The Usual Suspects enough times that I know exactly what it's about and I could help anybody understand it. It really feels good figuring out an all-too complex story.<br/><br/>The complex story unfolds with a massive explosion at a harbour where one mangled survivor in the hospital puts together a police sketch of Keyser Soze: the crime boss and brains behind the operation, who has never been seen. Meanwhile, disabled Verbal Kint (Spacey) escaped and spills his guts to Agent Kujan (Palminteri). He confesses that he and four other con men (Baldwin, Byrne, Del Toro, Pollack) met at a rigged line-up and do a series of heists that leads to the infamous Keyser Soze's right-hand man (Postlethwaite) to do the ultimate job. As Kint's story progresses, the movie becomes all that more confusing. As the movie nears the end, twists erupt with an ending that will leave you speechless. It is one of those endings that is just as shocking as finding out Bruce Willis was a ghost is The Sixth Sense and Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father. It is also one of those endings where the viewer has to make some rash decisions about what they think they saw. Once all the pieces of the puzzle are in place and you fully understand the movie, the greatness of the flick grows and you feel a great sense of accomplishment.<br/><br/>4/4"
"zarrak_khan","9","0","1","12 January 2015"," Unexpected Ending
","One of the best movie with an unexpected ending.Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called "" The Usual Suspects"" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed."

","Lets start off by stating that this is one of the best movies of all- time. The Usual Suspects follows Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) and his interrogation of the events leading up to 27 dead, $91 million in drug money, and the wreckage of a burned out cargo ship. I won't go into further detail, because the less you know about this movie the better. I will however state, that the ending is easily one that will satisfy, and impress you.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is an unpredictable journey of twists, and turns that will delight, astonish, and shock you all at once. It is a near perfect movie. The only complaint, would be that there could be slightly more character development with the supporting characters, although the main characters are very well portrayed. The acting is flawless, Kevin Spacey being rewarded with his first Oscar for this movie, and the supporting actors also bringing incredible performances to the film. The Usual Suspects is a mid-90's, modern classic, a movie everyone needs to watch before they die. A whole new way to look at how crime/thrillers are filmed, and one of the most incredible films in the past 20 years."

But that just starts a series of events where they find out that everything their doing is being manipulated by a very cleaver and sinister character who everyone in the criminal underground has heard of but never meet except Verbal Kint who' for some reason has never heard of this guy. If you've never seen this movie' it will all sound a bit complicated but trust me if you like a thriller where guessing to the end' this is for you.

","Near the end of The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey, in his Oscar-winning performance as crippled con man Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, says, ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" This may be the key line in this story; the farther along the movie goes, the more one realizes that not everything is quite what it seems, and what began as a conventional whodunit turns into something quite different. A massive explosion rips through a ship in a San Pedro, CA, harbor, leaving 27 men dead, the lone survivor horribly burned, and 91 million dollars' worth of cocaine, believed to be on board, mysteriously missing. Police detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) soon brings in the only witness and key suspect, ""Verbal"" Kint. Kint's nickname stems from his inability to keep his mouth shut, and he recounts the events that led to the disaster. Five days earlier, a truckload of gun parts was hijacked in Queens, NY, and five men were brought in as suspects: Kint, hot-headed hipster thief McManus (Stephen Baldwin), ill-tempered thug Hockney (Kevin Pollak), flashy wise guy Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a cop gone bad now trying to go straight in the restaurant business. While in stir, someone suggests that they should pull a job together, and Kint hatches a plan for a simple and lucrative jewel heist. Despite Keaton's misgivings, the five men pull off the robbery without a hitch and fly to Los Angeles to fence the loot. Their customer asks if they'd be interested in pulling a quick job while out West; the men agree, but the robbery goes horribly wrong and they soon find themselves visited by Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who represents a criminal mastermind named Keyser Soze. Soze's violent reputation is so infamous that he's said to have responded to a threat to murder his family by killing them himself, just to prove that he feared no one. When Kobayashi passes along a heist proposed by Soze that sounds like suicide, the men feel that they have little choice but to agree"

The team of five conmen, the suspects as they are, are all played by some very talented people giving their performances of a lifetime.

","Perhaps Bryan Singer's most well known film The Usual Suspects was inspired from a line a line in the 1943 movie Casablanca which says ""Round up the Usual Suspects."". Basically this movie is more of a crime, comedy, mystery, more than a drama film. The movie tells the story about five men who end up getting arrested and get brought up together for questioning. Then they plan an operation of revenge against the NYPD. But for them the operation goes well, but the influence of a so called Hungarian Gangster by the name of Keyser Soze is felt by every single one of them. The movie stars Stephen Baldwin as one of the suspects whose name in Michael McManus one of the suspects who gets brought up for questioning along with the other suspects played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Benicio Del Toro, and Kevin Pollak.

","What can really be said about The Usual Suspects? Its beautifully shot, stunningly well acted but that's really thanks in part to Kevin Spacey's masterful performance. Its one of the most simple movies you'll ever experience with some of the greatest plot twists in movie history. Thia film is a masterful thriller that toys with the viewer's mind and presents a deliberately unfocused narrative to confuse the audience and colorful characters.<br/><br/>The actors in The Usual Suspects are all perfectly cast. Gabriel Byrne presents the most mystery out of the five leads; his Keaton is the most murky and reserved. Kevin Pollak, known for more light-hearted comedic roles, makes Hockney the least serious and more witty of the main characters but still excels in playing a scumbag. Stephen Baldwin, before his career collapsed and he became a has-been born-again Christian, is suitably reckless and unpredictable as McManus. Benicio del Toro is the less prominent of the five leads, although his poor usage of English provides much of the film's humor. Kevin Spacey is the most impressive out of the cast, playing Kint as a sympathetic man who may be more than he appears to be which won him the Oscar. Pete Postlethwaite brings a non-chalant smoothness to the role of Kobayashi, a sleazy but unrefined criminal.<br/><br/>This movie gives you chills, it makes you think about what a person could do, an average Joe. It gives a twist known by many to be a surprise of a lifetime. You can almost feel the betrayal and the sense of trickery. It uses a firm plot and all the right hints to send you the wrong way. If a person watched the first five minutes, as well as the last five, you would have missed nothing short of a great movie. Now when you ad in the other ten minutes, you get a must watch film."

","I have seen thrillers. Nothing comes close to this one. All I can tell you about this movie is that, Kevin Spacey is amazing.<br/><br/>The photography, the music, the dialog, the narration, the plot, the conclusion - in fact everything about the Usual Suspects is amazing.<br/><br/>And like the director intimated, you have to watch it twice for everything to come together.<br/><br/>The opening scene was quite slow and boring. The build up was even more confusing.<br/><br/>The characters developed slowly yet strongly. The constant flashbacks helped a lot.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to you.

"aaron_gurmail","7","0","1","15 June 2013"," Slow beginning with a brilliant ending
","Although I have given a rating of 7/10, I would have preferred giving Usual Suspects 6.5/10. It did not quite do it for me and if the last part of the film was not the way it was, I would have considered giving a rating of 6/10. However, it is promising to see that Bryan Singer (director) went on to produce films such as Valkyrie, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men: First Class, which does show he is able to produce films worth watching. <br/><br/>What maintained my engagement with the film was the change of scenes from the past to the present and vice versa. Acting was of moderate quality. The film did take a fair bit of time to get going. I feel that without Kevin Spacey, the film lacked depth. A clever ending and brilliant acting by Kevin Spacey are as much as I can say when it comes to pointing out the positives."

","""The Usual Suspects"" falls in the same genre as ""Reservoir Dogs,"" which is a crime subgenre in the setting of a fantasy universe populated with brilliantly intelligent career criminals and elaborate heists. The compelling thing about the genre is the complexity of the plots, which often involve several twists and several layers of deception.<br/><br/>The ""problem"" with the genre is that you've got to be buying what it's selling, which not everyone is. Roger Ebert famously gave this movie a pretty poor review. I sort of / kind of agree with him, in that I largely felt alienated from the whole thing. There were some great surprises along the way, but I never really felt invested enough in the plot to feel the impact of these surprises.<br/><br/>It's a well-made film with colorful characters, sweet lighting and camera-work, and enough mystery to keep your attention. If you like the genre in general, you'll love it."
"a-sherman-web","Null","0","1","4 February 2013"," A Suspect to Watch
","The Usual Suspects is an intelligent film that is intertwined with action, mystery, and drama that is set apart from analogous drama, action, and mystery films. It is not filled to the brim with action, nor is it filled with drama. It does not go the traditional route in the mystery, where it forces the viewer to play along with its game of 'whodunit.' Attention is caught within the first five minutes of the film by immediately giving us a taste of the mystery that is to come. It is a film that keeps its action and drama in a healthy balance whilst keeping the viewer guessing about a mystery that develops midway into the movie, all the way till the end. <br/><br/>We begin with our 'usual' suspects by first being introduced to the Dean Keaton character (Gabriel Byrne) heavily wounded and destined for death on a ship rigged to explode (Singer, 1995). The other 'suspects' are soon introduced starting with Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro). The story centers on the exploits of these five men weeks before with the culmination of these events leading up to a rigged explosion of a Hungarian freighter (Singer, 1995). Upon unraveling the mystery, an important lesson that rings true in nearly any mystery is learned regarding an important theme to this movie which is ""even with clues in the plot strewn here and there, the true perpetrator may be the person you least suspect.""<br/><br/>This may be observed by characters such as a surviving Hungarian shipmate making claims that the main perpetrator was a man named Keyser SÃ¶ze, with yet another distinct claim being made by a US Customs agent by the name of Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) (Singer, 1995). The acting of misdirection used by the culprit character is also important to note as it relates to the theme. This theme of ""The cause may be the thing you least suspect"" is similar to a theme that is of minor focus in the film Citizen Kane. A cause of Mr. Kane's death came from the recollection of ""Rosebud,"" again being something of a clue, but not what one would expect to be the culprit (Welles, 1941).<br/><br/>Certain cinematic touches and techniques are implemented to add to the films storytelling elements which don't go unnoticed. The lighting is done well to advance storytelling elements such as foreshadowing into the mystery. An example of this lighting technique is in the scene introducing the 'Verbal' character where the lighting makes Verbal's head resemble a skull (Singer, 1995). This technique subtly adds to the theme by giving the viewer a clue into the mystery. Further enhancing the quality of the film is the infusion of a motif that is present in the character known as 'Verbal' who lives up to his name (Singer, 1995). He is a fast talking and feeble small talker who further supports the theme as he leaves subtle clues as to who the true culprit may be every time he derails the topic to small talk (Singer, 1995). <br/><br/>All in all, this a film full of surprises to the point where any prediction made on the viewer's part as to what will happen next is a foolhardy and foolish endeavor. You cannot just blindly assume anything to be true as human suspicion can prove to be faulty and, of course, ""the true perpetrator may be the person you least suspect.""<br/><br/>References<br/><br/>Singer, B.

","I recently watched Usual Suspects after hearing that it was a great film and I had to watch it. So I did, and they were right it is a great film. This film has a good cast, e.g Spacey, Bryne and Palminteri. I adored Spacey in this and I think he is one of the best actors ever and really get into his roles. It is also nice to see Stephen Baldwin, playing the role of a slightly mad criminal. <br/><br/>If you took away the amazing ending, this film wouldn't have as many great reviews. The story of it is good and I personally enjoyed it. Most people( including me) just love the ending. It leaves you feeling happy, even though it's actually not that happy. <br/><br/>This is a film where you have to pay attention and not with people talking whilst watching it. It's not a cinematic masterpiece, a beautifully filmed film or even one of the best crime films out there. It is purely a great film that you have to watch and appreciate for what it is."
"classicsoncall","10","0","1","22 October 2011"," ""One cannot be betrayed if one has no people"".
","Customs Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) knew he was smarter than Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), but didn't fully realize it until it was too late. That's the brilliance of ""The Usual Suspects"", a film with a twist ending that leaves you shaking your head and going 'Whoa! well past the finale. Here's how I see it - <br/><br/>A lot of comments on this film revile it for being a story that never happened because of the reveal at the end. But that's not really the case. Following the opening scene, the picture flashes back to the police lineup that brought five petty hoods together. Well, three of them were petty; Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and Verbal Kint are much more than they seem. The emerald heist of the NYPD 'taxi service' and the ripoff of jeweler Saul Berg were real enough events involving the resources of all five criminals to pull them off. Where the story really takes off is with the introduction of Kobayashi (Pete Postlewaithe). From about that point on, and only in retrospect, do we come to understand that Verbal's story telling skills are meant to obfuscate and defy credibility. He follows up with the legend of Keyser Soze, a mythical Hungarian no one has ever seen (except one Arturo Marquez), who's reputation for fierce vengeance has become as legendary as the man himself is ethereal.<br/><br/>That Verbal Kint is a con man is unquestionable. He was pegged with a sixty two thousand dollar swindle at the NYPD lineup, enough to convince McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio del Toro) and Hockney (Kevin Pollack) that he was in their league, as long as he could convince Keaton to go along. With the disgraced ex-cop vouching for him, Kint was allowed to mastermind the 'blue and white' emerald heist without anyone getting killed. Then came his increased stature by finishing off Saul Berg during the second job. The idea that details like Redfoot, Kobayashi and the Argentinean drug deal were all made up doesn't detract from the fact that Verbal Kint/Keyser Soze had an agenda. That agenda, all the way at the bottom of the totem pole, was the murder of Arturo Marquez, a character mentioned but never seen, a character who might have known the real identity of Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>So we know Verbal made up a lot of this stuff on the fly. But what about Kujan? In one moment, Kujan tells Verbal that Keaton was Keyser Soze, and a few sentences later says he doesn't know. Did he make up the story about Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) being killed? Who would have killed her, and for what reason? Most likely Kobayashi if Marquez could identify Soze. The one thing we can come away with is that Verbal Kint, besides being a fake, is a remorseless, relentless killer, who's con man gig is the ultimate con on movie viewers everywhere. Verbal Kint was Keyser Soze, but the blast of it is - there was NO Keyser Soze - and he's become one of the screen's most intriguing characters of all time."
"barnettpep","8","0","1","13 December 2010"," Suspense with a shocking twist ending
","Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie team up to create a fascinating film that delighted audiences beyond measure with a thrilling storyline culminating with a complex and shocking twist.<br/><br/>The movie shows five known criminals Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) in a police line-up as suspects in a crime involving a hijacked truck in New York City. They are dragged into the police station because they are the usual suspects.<br/><br/>They are not found guilty but are put in a cell together. While they are waiting to be bailed out of jail they conclude the police are at fault, so they plan to get revenge with an entangled crime scheme. Dean Keaton who is a cop gone bad and a conviction is desperately trying to change his life. However, the more time he spends in the cell with the other criminals he is convinced to participate in one last crime.<br/><br/>There is the omnipresence of a criminal mastermind by the name of Keyser Soze. They all feel that they have wronged Soze in some way and must pay back. The payback involves a cocaine heist and 91 million dollars in drug money that results in a boat explosion on a California pier and twenty seven people dead. There are two survivors, a badly burned Hungarian gangster Kobayaski (Pete Postlethwaite) and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) who appears crippled. Although they feel the influence of Soze, he is not revealed and the audience is left in suspense. The dark burned body and heavy accent of Kobayaski can lead the audience to believe that it is Soze.<br/><br/>Roger a conman gives his account of what happened in a narrative inserted in the chronological structure of the film to David Kujan (Chazz Palaminteri), special agent investigating the explosion.<br/><br/>A similar movie is ""LA Confidental"" starring Kevin Spacey. This movie also has a twist at when the crook is identified at the end of the movie. The motif supports the plot showing actors in police station, crime scenes and police guarded hospital. The lighting was low-key which heightens the suspense of the film.<br/><br/>All five criminals think they've constructed the perfect pay back crime. What they don't realize is that they were all set up and that someone has been master minding the entire scheme from the beginning including bringing them all into the police station for questioning. This takes another twist and the audience can only speculate about the person who is controlling the operation."
"rob-911-162983","10","0","1","1 December 2010"," One of my favorite films of all time
","This is nearly a perfect movie. Bryan Singer's second film, from an Oscar winning script by Christopher McQuarrie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It's topped off by a fantastic score by John Ottman (I agree with the many other posters who said that it was one of the best scores of the 90s).<br/><br/>For a film with so many disparate characters, it all comes together beautifully, a credit to both the actors and the film makers. Five career criminals are brought together in a police lineup in New York City, apparently so that a man one of them robbed at gunpoint can identify the perpetrator. In the holding cell afterward, they decide to work together.<br/><br/>The film is (unreliably) narrated by Roger 'Verbal' Kint, played in an Oscar winning turn by Kevin Spacey. Not only is his character well fleshed out, but Spacey makes an inveterate liar and con man into a sympathetic figure. Gabriel Byrne, playing a disgraced former cop named Keaton, deserves equal praise for his pitch perfect delivery of every line of dialogue he utters. All of the characters have a life and a back story, even Fenster (a then unknown Benicio Del Toro). His bizarre and inspired performance allows him to make the most of his limited screen time. Comedian Kevin Pollock is a thief with a Napoleon complex, who butts heads with fellow tough guy McManus (Stephen, the most obscure of the Baldwins).<br/><br/>The script concerns these five men being blackmailed into taking down an ocean liner allegedly carrying $91 million in cocaine, which is guarded by dozens of heavily armed men. What separates this from other crime thrillers is the shadowy presence of the never seen Keyser Soze, an almost supernatural Turkish crime lord. He is represented by an Asian / English attorney 'named' Mr. Kobayashi, who forces the five anti-heroes into this nearly impossible crime. Pete Postelthwaite (sp?) injects icy politeness and fascinating mannerisms into the role.<br/><br/>What I love most about this film, aside from the brilliant build-up and off kilter dialogue, are the little moments that Singer gives to the actors. Its when the film breathes that it is at its strongest. For instance, the scene outside the police precinct where Keaton looks at each of his future partners in crime as he hugs his girlfriend Edie, or the moment in his apartment when he looks down at her from the balcony before leaving for L.A. My favorite is the image of Keaton's reflection outside the conference room where Kobayashi meets with Edie (a lovely and unknown Suzy Amis), and second to that is the moment in the van where the criminals discuss the near impossibility of taking down the ocean liner. The use of music and sound in each scene is perfect.<br/><br/>The reveal of Kint's true nature has been often imitated, but in this film it is not a mere ""gotcha"" moment as Roger Ebert seemed to think it was in his review. The entire film led to that moment. The Customs agent arrogantly stated that he was smarter than Kint and could get the truth out of him, goading him into constructing the elaborate fantasy. And as Kint himself said early on in the film, he talks too much. Ottman's editing is a crescendo which gives the final revelation all of the impact it deserves.<br/><br/>It's up to the viewer to decide whether Keyser Soze is real, or a mere story, but it's a fascinating question to leave to the viewer. This is a rare case of everything coming together just right in a low budget film. Singer makes the most out of a small budget and delivers both great action and great character moments. Newton Thomas Sigel's stunning lighting and camera work make the film look better than any Hollywood blockbuster that came out in the same time frame, a tribute to what an independent film can accomplish with the right craftsmen.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, this is a masterpiece."

I never write the review before, but this movie leads me to this review-box. I've already watch the hated-review, and I don't understand why people think different. The bad-side of the movie according to the hated-review, is the good reason to love this movie for me. And the visualization of Keyser Soze killed his family is fair enough, i thought. It showed the audiences about how Verbal cheated Kujan, absolutely not about how the camera lied down for us."
"Giddyup85","9","0","1","2 November 2010"," Great Film that keeps you guessing
","The movie The Usual Suspects begins at the end. A boat, thought to be carrying drugs, explodes in San Pedro and Dean Keaton (played by Gabriel Byrne) is shot by a mysterious man he called only 'Keyser'. The movie then flashes back to 6 weeks prior to the explosion with the help of a survivor, Roger ""Verbal"" Kint; a failed hijacking brings our main characters together in a police line-up in New York. Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), a known, hijacker; Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), a professional thief with anger issues; Fred Fenster (Benicio del Toro), is McManus' partner whose English is garbled at best; Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a corrupt cop who has gone straight and Verbal a con artist who happens to have cerebral palsy. The movie cuts back and forth between the investigation in California and Verbal's recounting of the last six weeks to detectives Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) and Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito). Verbal recounts how McManus convinced the group to join forces to pull off robbery that causes a number of corrupt NYC cops to be exposed. But the heist leads to its own set of problems. They are blackmailed by Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), a lawyer who claims to work for infamous criminal Keyser Söze and forced to work together to stop a boat smuggling millions of dollars worth of cocaine. The events that took place on the boat lead the story back to the beginning with the explosion. As most of the story is told by Verbal, as a viewer you have to have a certain level of trust in Verbal. I feel the film uses Verbal's cerebral palsy and is voice-over confessions as a means to gain the audiences trust. Before walking into the line-up scene, Verbal says via voice-over ""It didn't make sense that I'd be here, I mean, these guys were hardcore hijackers, but there I was. At that point I wasn't scared. I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for. Besides, it was fun. I got to make like I was notorious."" This voice over, combined with Verbal's non threatening physical appearance, makes him easy to believe and underestimate. I think the more recent movie 'Lucky Number Slevin' borrows from the ideas and themes in The Usual Suspects. The defining character in Lucky Number Slevin is unassuming throughout the movie and you believe he is just a victim of circumstance until the very end. Both movies also have a similar lighting configuration. Many scenes in both films are shot with dim lighting to create a feel of danger and mystery. The Usual Suspects uses a story-telling technique that was rare in 1995 and it made a huge impact when it was released. The use of flashbacks and voice-overs provide the film with the perfect opportunity to misdirect the audience and lead to a compelling plot twist."
"blackmamba99971","10","0","1","6 October 2010"," Quite possibly the best thriller to date
","One of the most imaginative movies ever. Five thief's, called into a line up only to be released by lack of evidence, only to start on a trail of the famed Kaiser Souse'. This movie held every aspect of who done it to the extreme, with characters made up from a character to cover a path from the police and the FBI. The use of a story within a story was sheer genius, throwing everyone off in the theatre for a loop. When this first was shown, no one in the theatre was prepared for the climax at the end for which it will be long remembered in the vaults of great classics. Gabriel Byrne played a perfect ex corrupt cop who is to be the corner stone to Kaiser's plans. And using Baldwin, Del Toro, and Pollack was also Fantastic. A group of men joined together with Spacey who was the real architect in creating the perfect hit squad. This movie held every flavor of deceit, corruption, a kind of camaraderie between each character for which even Kaiser himself admired. All in all one of the most important films to date. A remarkable achievement in misaligned and off the track clue finding, to revealing the real villain. Chazz Palminterri was excellent as Agent Kulyon. As well as Pete Postelwaith as the famed Kobayashi. Truly a film for all thriller buffs."
"estebangonzalez10","9","0","1","16 September 2010"," One of the greatest endings in Film
","I had been wanting to watch this movie for a long time, but I had never got around to it. I finally got the chance to see it last night and I was blown away. The movie really did live up to all the hype thanks to great performances from the cast, especially Kevin Spacey. He is terrific in this movie. I also enjoyed Benicio del Toro although his character dies way to soon. The background music is your typical 90s suspense theme, but seeing this movie 15 years after its making you can say it is timeless nonetheless. This thriller is one of my favorites along with Seven, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs. After I finished watching this film I felt the same way as I did with all those cult classic movies. I was expecting the plot twist because that is what everyone talks about all the time, but I still loved that twist it was great. I love movies that slowly build up to a great ending. That boat shootout scene was just excellent. The movie had me hooked from the opening scene, Kevin Spacey is just great when he narrates a film. Excellent film, one of my favorites from the 90s and has a good twist at the end almost as good as The Sixth Sense. Very well constructed movie and great job by Bryan Singer as a director.

","Okay, so unfortunately I'm 15 years late in my viewing of 'the usual suspects' and thus the twist had (annoyingly) been revealed to me many times before, against my will. It is this very reason that i kept putting off watching this widely considered masterpiece. Twenty minutes into the film i realised how stupid i was as the knowledge i had of the final scene in no way diluted any enjoyment of this great film. Each character is so well developed and acted with intelligent self awareness (even Stephen Baldwin was great!) that you become immersed in their world. The story becomes more and more intriguing as the film goes on, drip feeding the audience information to keep them guessing and then revealing things that audiences would unlikely guess. My only criticism would be that the twist in fact retrospectively makes the film seem geared entirely towards the twist making a lot of what preceded it feel quite irrelevant, but this is perhaps forgivable as it is a great twist, even if i didn't experience it as a twist!"
"morrison-dylan-fan","10","0","1","1 September 2010"," Who is Keyser Soze?
","For my friends birthday,I have decided to pick him up a big mix of ""classic"" films,that I really hope he will enjoy.With his birthday coming up later this week,I started to wonder if their were any films that I had left out in the mix...Suddenly,I remembered that a few years ago,my dads friend telling me about a great-sounding crime film with ""an amazing twist ending""With thankfully,having enough time to rent the film to see if it was worth picking up for my friend,Even before the film had finished,I was online ordering a DVD of this amazing film for him. Note:Due to the two time periods that the films storyline takes place in,I am splitting the films plot into two parts.<br/><br/>The plot: The past- Five petty New York criminals,who are each regularly chosen to stand in police line-ups decide to form a gang to get there own back on the cops.The first thing the gang does,is expose some very corrupt cops,who are accepting bribes from some very powerful criminals to be ""taxis"" for them,so all the criminals have police protection where ever they go.With their first plan having gone very successfully, (and also very richly,due to them stealing some cash from one of the criminals)one of the gang (Mcmanus) tells the others that they should take the stolen cash to LA,where a jewel thief that he is friends with lives.When they get to LA,the thief tricks them into robbing a ""jewel dealer"",who they discover,was actually a Heroin dealer. All of the gang do everything they can,to get the thief to reveal why he lied to them about the robbery.The thief says that he was not the one that wanted the Heroin stolen.Instead,he says the he was ordered to set up the robbery by a lawyer called Kobayashi.When they meet Kobayashi,he sends shivers down all their spines,when he tell them that he works for Keyser Soze.(Soze is a man known for being an almost mythical criminal,due to no one having seen his face for years and for a very infamous,disturbing story where,With his family being held at gunpoint by thugs,Keyser kills his family and the thugs,and then goes and every family member or friend that the thugs ever had.)They are then all told that,all of there so-called petty crimes actually damaged some of Keyser Sozes underground empire.This has,understandably,made Soze furious.Surprisingly,Kobayashi tell them that unless they steal millions of dollars worth of Cocaine from a cargo ship in an LA harbour,that Keyser Soze will kill every one that they care about.With only those two options,they all decide to go on Sozes suicide mission...The Present: Police officer Dave Kujan and agent Jack Baer are each separately investigating a massacre on a ship in an LA harbour,which has only left two survivors (though Kujan suspects that one of the gang members that boarded the ship,may have fled the scene early and could still be alive.) With one of the survivors (gang member Verbal Kint) being given a slap on the wrist fine for having a gun without a licenses,he has been given immunity by the police,since he has told them that he was one of the gang members who boarded the ship.Due to Dave Kujan only being allowed to keep Verbal in custody for two hours,Kujan realises that he has to do what ever he can to find out in those two hours what really happened on the ship with Verbal Kint and the rest of the gang... Meanwhile,unbeknown to Kujan,agent Jack Baer is at a local hospital with the only other survivor-a Hungarian man,who has suffered 60% burns all over his body.To the agents amazement,the man stars talking and,though he can hardly make out any of the words that the man is saying,the man suddenly yells out that he has ""Seen the face of the devil.""Baer quickly rushes to find a sketch artist,due to the man being the only known surviving person to have seen the face of Keyser Soze... View on the film:<br/><br/>The star of the film,that kept me griped from the opening credits,to the now-famous ending was the screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie.Whilst most writers would have either given very big sign posts to let the viewer know which way the film is probably going to go or,have built a very weak-rushed story so they could quickly get to the big twist ending.McQuarrie cleverly makes sure that the film is not held down by the heavy-weight ending.This is done by Christopher spending a good amount of the film building up the story bit-by-bit,and by looking at most of the Usual Suspects characters backgrounds and current (troubled) situations (although I do feel that Benicio Del Toro is slightly under used in the film.)When looking at the film on a second viewing,I was extremely impressed by McQuarrire dropping tiny hints of the ending threw out the whole film.Which,on first viewing seem to be some very minor moments until you get to the end,when you realise that the ending has been scaring you right in the face the whole time! While most people praise the great performance by Gabriel Byrine and the shining A-List making performance by Kevin Spacey are,understandably praised.I feel that the excellent performance by Chazz Pacminteri as Dave Kujan is sadly over-looked.Pacminteri works as a great counter- point to Spaceys great Verbal Kint,with their fantastic interrogation scenes being some of the most gripping moments in the film. Something that I now find surprisingly easy to see,is that director Bryan Singer would go on to make the first two X-Men films.Singer shows how he is able to give all of the actors great moments in the film.Even though it was only his second film,it is very clear to see that at this point, Singer knew how to make an exceptional film with interesting characters and a very well-written story Final view on the film: A very intelligently written screenplay,with great tension building and a truly jaw-dropping ending,matched by amazing performances from a stunning ensemble and some very smart and gripping directing."

It's the kind of film you need to watch twice in a relatively short period of time to truly understand the script's mastery.The plot keeps you engaged throughout and let you think about what could be the end When i first saw this film, i understood 75% of the film. I had to watch it again, to recap on what happened earlier. After the second time i watched it, i realized this is a Superb movie with a fabulous twist. It starts out just like a crime film, but evolves into mystery One thing I can surely say about it is, you can watch it over and over again and you can keep on finding key features each and every time."
"clarkm02","8","0","1","1 August 2010"," Intense action thriller
","This is a very intense movie with an interesting twist. The movie reminds me of the sixth sense or butterfly effect due to the twists at the end of the movies. You are lead to believe one thing and then completely are caught off guard to find out that it is something completely different than what you were lead to believe. The beginning of the movie begins with a massive seaside explosion resulting in the death of many people. Five ""usual suspects"" from a truck hijacking were taken in for questioning. Kevin Spacey, who plays Verbal Kint, clearly explains that they are being brought in ""on a trumped-up charge to be leaned on by half-wits"". Verbal agrees to give up much information in exchange for immunity. He is later questioned further by Special Agent Dave Kujan (Palminteri). Verbal tell him the whole story in his own words. At this point, scenes go back and forth from present time to past time. The added editing effects by the creators of the movie help the viewer to gain insight into the past and present. Essentially, this allows the viewers to put the puzzle pieces together to create their own conclusion.<br/><br/>After the five men are released, the five guys, Keaten, McManus, Fenster, Hockney, and Verbal plot to get revenge on the cops by revealing the corruption that was taking place with the police. The police were providing services for criminals that were willing to pay a lot. The men decide to get revenge by ripping off a shipment of diamonds from crooked cops. Keyser Soze eventually comes into the movie. He is a crime lord that no one seems to know. This is where the movie becomes more involved. Many question Soze's existence. Soze has a reputation of creating fear in some of the most dangerous criminals. Kujan's questioning to ""Verbal"" Kint seeks to understand who Soze really is.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, there are intense scenes of action, scenes of intense conversations. Many of the shots in the movie were very unusual camera angles. Some of the shots were very pretty and unique. The cinematographer made good use of the camera angles to say the least. In addition to this, the quick flips between scenes, especially during periods of intense action, definitely added emphasis to the action that was taking place. This truly is a great movie, full of action, mystery, and possibilities. It is a movie that I would definitely recommend."
"nunstampede","8","0","1","21 January 2010"," Not ""Out-of-Left Field"" Original, but much better paced and more convincing than any other movie like it.
","The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that is excellent without being entirely fresh and new. It does, however, basically take all of it's influences and incorporate them seamlessly into an intense, mind-bending, and entertaining plot. This might be my favorite Modern Crime movie, and sit just below the Untouchables and The Godfather overall.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is phenomenal in this movie. He just nailed this role like I didn't think he could, and by the time the credits rolled, I was convinced that no one could take his place in this movie. This movie actually has decent acting from a Baldwin, as frightening as that may sound. Aside from some really unnecessary and distracting antics in the beginning of the movie, he comes into his own and becomes a somewhat enjoyable and important part of the movie.<br/><br/>In addition to nearly every main actor having their best performance in this movie, it keeps the viewer intrigued without relying on any cheap gimmicks that have become so popular in Crime Drama film and TV. Some say that the plot develops too slowly, but I think that the pacing of this movie is just about as good as it could be.<br/><br/>It's really difficult to review this film without giving anything away, but it just about meets every requirement a crime movie could have, and then some, and although it isn't the most novel idea ever made, its convincing enough that it will keep you guessing until the end."

","There is a quote in this movie which goes like this "" The Greatest Trick The Devil Ever Pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"" . Well I would like to say that the Greatest Trick the director of this movie pulled was to thrill and shock the audience until the last frame of the movie. You will be shocked by the twists in this movie especially in the later part of the second half. Yes, it is a bit slow in the first half, but the second half more than makes up for it. The basic plot is about 5 thieves or conmen who come together to plan a revenge expedition against the police . All these 5 people are somehow linked to a criminal mastermind called Kaize Soze and how Soze finishes them one after the other but off course with a certain twist in the end is what the movie is all about.<br/><br/>About the acting in this movie, everybody's performance was top notch. But still I would like to mention the performances of Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Bryne which were exceptional. Another movie with flashback style of narration, this movie is surely not to be missed .<br/><br/>Rating : 8.5/10"

","What makes this film really great is what I look in most movies. It has an extremely good plot, great acting and a clever script. I wasn't sure about what to expect about this film at first. The title doesn't sound that great and the synopsis was not that clear. But I was blown away when the movie ended. One of my all time favorite.<br/><br/>I read in the trivia section that Al Pacino decline agent's Kujan role and that he regretted that the most. Well that should be obvious considering that this film has one of the best endings in the film history. But I think that Pacino wouldn't be as great for the role as Chazz was. I mean, agent Kujan was intended to be exactly the way it turn out to be. He thinks he is smarter than everybody else, therefore he always underestimate the rest. I think that Pacino can't do this part as genuine as Chazz.<br/><br/>This movie is truly a masterpiece. Everybody should watch The Usual Suspects before death comes.

","We've had a few good Cops and Robber shows in the last 20 years - but hardly enough. This one I'd put way up there. It lacked all the Hollywood cliché crap that tends to kill a really good script. One of the unwritten rules in judging a good piece of art is to ask yourself if it will last the test of time. If this movie was released tomorrow - it may pick up some points because the actors have gone on to higher Hollywood 'seats.' But the movie as a whole, would fit just as well in 2008 as back then. Writers often throw in ""CSI"" crap so unbelievable, or inundates us with so many beautiful babes that it ruins a good movie. Not this one. Hell, even the music was great in every respect. A 8 out of 10 is about as high I go. Since I saw ""Lawrence of Arabia"" I don't have room for 10's anymore. And 9's are reserved for the Super good ones.

","If you're after a movie that makes you think, then ""The Usual Suspects"" is for you. The clever, slick plot from Christopher McQuarrie is full of double-cross and twists, but is occasionally difficult to keep up with and perhaps the film could have been a little longer.<br/><br/>Director Brian Singer has opted for a fast paced narrative rather than drawing out the conclusion. ""Pulp Fiction"" was criticised for being over long, as are many gangster-thrillers, so Singer and his editor are determined not to let ""The Usual Suspects"" get away from them. I for one though feel that sometimes more is more, and that maybe another half an hour could have added some clarity, depth and extra intrigue. Sometimes one gets the feeling that a few pieces of the puzzle are missing, perhaps due to over editing. Not that any of this takes away from the entertainment value of this pic, but wouldn't this have made a great series in the ""Twin Peaks"" vain (not ""Who killed Laura Palmer?"" but ""Who is Kaiser Soze?"").<br/><br/>The cast is headed up by Chazz Palminteri who is good as the inspector questioning the timid but sly ""Verbal"", a strong showing by Kevin Spacey. Commendable support comes from Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Suzanne Amis, Giancarlo Esposito, Dan Hedaya and Pete Postlethwaite. Gabriel Byrne makes a marked impression as Keaton, an ex-cop turned corrupt.<br/><br/>McQuarrie's story, which is really too clever to be told in under two hours, contains plenty of intrigue as it tells of five criminals who are mysteriously brought together by an unseen crime boss who forces the motley crew to participate in a suicidal raid because they owe him. All the characters are fantastic, but we really don't get time to absorb them fully. Comedy is prevalent early on, but is found wanting as the film heads towards its conclusion. The finale itself is a complete surprise, with almost what one could classify as two endings. It's possible Singer and McQuarrie couldn't decide which was the better resolution, so they offered us both. This, I might add, is too the audience's benefit. Over all a thoroughly enjoyable piece of entertainment that will have you thinking, and keep you talking, long after you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>Saturday, January 13, 1996 - Astor Theatre<br/><br/>The title of this film hardly prepares you for what you're about to experience. There is nothing usual about ""The Usual Suspects"".<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's film of Christopher McQuarrie's story is intricately interwoven and ingeniously, teasingly presented. Even seeing this flick a second time is most rewarding. We may know the answer to the mystery, but we are able to put it all together from the beginning and perhaps appreciate much more the subtleties of the plot.<br/><br/>The whole attraction of the film is the tale itself, as it is told from the eyes of ""Verbal"", the crippled, petty thief who is caught up in a criminal subterfuge that seems beyond fathoming. Performances from the whole cast are assured, with Kevin Spacey most impressive as the nervous ""Verbal"", and others such as Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack and Stephen Baldwin giving impressive turns. Music from John Ottman is right on the money, being compelling and mysterious.<br/><br/>I still say this pic would have made a great t.v. series : ""Who is Kaiser Soze?"".<br/><br/>Sunday, April 20, 1997 - Video"

A film which has lots of people applauding it but for me, an average film-goer, it remains uninvolving and a tad too clever for its own good. I'm not against clever film making but it seemed to go out of its way to make sure that there were no sympathetic characters and a storyline which left me for dead after half an hour. The editing timeframe was unhelpful and left me struggling to equate that with the story of events in the police interview room and where that conversation would place me next.

It has a great combination of good directing, an amazing script, and a brilliant cast, not to mention the fantastic score by John Ottman. It is undoubtedly Bryan Singers best work.<br/><br/>I have yet to see a film that will stand up to as many repeat viewings. A lot of the films success has to do with the cast working so well together. The films main characters are very different from one and other, but they compliment each other too, from Kevin Pollaks humour and Benicio Del Toros crazy accent/ad libbing, to Kevin Spaceys fantastic portrayal of verbal.<br/><br/>I heard in the directors commentary that the cast also got on very well behind the scenes, and spent lots of time interacting. I think that is partly the reason why they gel so well on screen.<br/><br/>It's not unusual to get a film with a twist in it, but I don't know of any other that pull it off so well. I was lucky to have not been told anything about the film, I happened upon it when it was first released on video. I think not knowing much about this film creates the best enjoyment, the viewer obviously tries to work out who Keyser Soze is, but because so much is going on people don't think too hard about it.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects is at the top of my favourite 5 films, I'm not surprised Al Pacino regrets not taking the part of Dave Kujan."

","The Usual Suspects is a great caper movie; stylish, exciting, intelligent and all that. The problem I had with it was that it's too easy to guess the ending. By the final scenes, the upshot is that the only mystery is Keyser Soze's true identity. Then you've really only got one character out of the main four that fits. It's too obvious for it to be Keaton; the other two aren't fleshed out enough for it to matter; Kint it has to be, the only mystery is how they explain it. So the final revelation is an anticlimax. The scene where the cop pieces together Kint's lie from the chaotic evidence in the office is great, but just to have Kevin Spacey walk off with no further twist is a letdown. Maybe if it had been Fenster back from the dead, or one of the cops, or even Pete 'Nice Try at Japanese Accent but It Goes Scottish Occasionally' Postlethwaite, who might shoot Spacey from the car, or maybe even the girlfriend - and this movie is very light on females - there would have been a final extra twist to make this movie more than just good. As it is, you think this super-duper master criminal seems to have made things extremely difficult for himself for no reason. Too much like 'and it was all a dream, The End'."

Yes. The funniest scene is last one, and the most impressive scene is also last one. The director Bryan Singer gives abrupt shocking to people by psychological rages and the truth of the crime.

"Robert_duder","8","0","1","10 September 2006"," The character actors ultimate epic...sure to become a classic of cinema
","The Usual Suspects ironically calls itself that and casts itself with some of Hollywood's biggest recognizable character actors. What is a character actor exactly?? Is that truly another word for an actor who doesn't make it as a leading man or woman?? NO. I don't think so at all. A character actor is a very versatile actor who takes on a mix of roles and appears in many, many film after film popping up everywhere. Sometimes they may get a lead role, sometimes not but they don't need to be at the top of the credits to make an appearance and they play important and significant roles and get many more parts than other actors. The Usual Suspects is jammed full of these character actors led of course by the incomparable Kevin Spacey who I must say has become much, much more of a leading man now than a character actor but at the time he was the best at playing these offbeat roles. The Usual Suspects is not exactly a brain science of a film, it doesn't really offer anything incredibly unique to the ""heist"" genre of films, it's almost stereotypical and yet it has this feel, it has this quality about it that makes it an unmistakable classic. I expected from what I heard of it that it would be gritty, violent, bloody, horrifying and it is gritty but everything else kind of just fits in with most films but it still has that unmistakable must see quality.<br/><br/>Oscar Winner for this role Kevin Spacey plays Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a talkative man with a limp who is known on the street for his elaborate cons. Spacey is brilliant and psychotic and watchable and nearly lovable as Kint. This is one of his best roles and he deserved that Oscar hands down. He does a terrific job in this role. Verbal Kint goes down as a memorable character in film history. Gabriel Byrne, who I've always enjoyed in his roles plays self appointed leader of the Suspects Dean Keaton, a man trying to go clean from his criminal ways. Byrne really doesn't have great range as an actor, most of his roles are very similar but he still has a certain presence on screen and he demands attention and comes across very powerful. Benicio Del Toro plays a smaller yet definitive role as Fred Fenster, a fast talking mumbler that provides the small bit of comic relief to the film. He does well in his quite small part. Stephen Baldwin plays hot headed Michael McManus and I'm surprised this part didn't mainstream him more for big films because he has the star quality and his performance is noteworthy in this film. Kevin Pollak who has done some great work plays Todd Hockney and is kind of back seat to Byrne and Spacey but his performance is also well rounded. Chazz Palminteri does a great job playing ""bad cop"" Dave Kujan who spends the entire film interrogating Spacey and their chemistry and banter is very well done. Brilliant character actor Dan Hedaya plays the ""good cop"" half as the other cop interrogating him and although he doesn't get a lot of screen time he performs his usual great role. And finally but notably Pete Postlethwaite plays Kobayashi, a liaison between the suspects and big time mythic crime lord Kyzer Soze. He is always a pleasure on screen in small but pertinent roles and I was happy to see him. He has a dark air about him perfect for the part.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer is a brilliant director there is no doubt about it. He seems to have a way of bringing out the human in every film. He made the Xmen come to life and more recently created a whole new Superman for a new generation no matter how it was received it had the Singer touch and this is very different for what he has done recently but it still has his stamp of reality on it. The whole story boils down to tracking the mysterious and deadly Kyzer Soze through a crime spree involving assassinating a witness who can identify him. It's an ensemble cast of men without egos and it works so incredibly well from the opening scene and very famous line up to the closing twist of an ending. Now I admit I did kind of figure out the ending so it didn't really come as a shock like it should have, I think they make it far more evident than they needed to but it doesn't diminish the quality of the plot or story. It's an action crime thriller that will most certainly be a classic if it is not already. At best you must watch these to see some truly under-rated actors work brilliantly and to see a dark gritty tale that keeps you entertained until the very last minute. A SOLID 8.5/10!"

"keepitmovin2020","Null","0","1","14 August 2006"," Huge hole in the plot.....
","As I finished watching this movie a huge hole in the story came to mind. It starts the movie with the beginning when Keaton is shot and everyone else is supposedly dead (as the story is told, this is understood to be true). Next during the story, the characters are placed in a lineup; to find the people behind this boat heist (after it took place, of course). So you get what I'm saying, the whole story is following around these characters who should have been dead before they went to the lineup (at the beginning) because they all died on the ship. Explain it to me please. Good movie but not worth owning the DVD once you figure it doesn't add up.<br/><br/>Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too."

","The main actors in this movie (DelToro and Spencer) were almost both at their best in this portrayal of intelligent crime carried out with confidence by its main actors. The film-taking of the picture is again most possibly the reason it finds itself at All-time's top Crime and Thriller hits. The suspense is well-kept though it does have the potential of turning out as more if only the story had more to-be-cheered-for intelligence and suspense. The suspense is meant to reach its peak in the last 30 minutes and even more in the last ten, but I felt it needed to also arise a sense of amusement and power rather more than what was filmed.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I shall stress on the brilliance of the story-telling and draw a dividing line between that and the story itself. The story-telling truly is carried out perfectly and certainly does come second, if not next to All-Time Fantastic Movies, the likes of Godfather or Shawshank Redemption, etc., though in the 'Crime & Thriller' genre. The story again seemed to be too simplified at the end and the mystery was solved using little light-shedding which could be masterminded to have more of a sense of complication, as perhaps portrayed by the like of Sir Arthur Canon Doyle in his Sherlock Holmes series.<br/><br/>All in all, a recommendation for all ""crime-genre"" lovers and thriller-fans, though maybe a bit of a turn-down for suspense lovers."

For all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the real star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational script, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved it's Oscar.<br/><br/>It really doesn't get any better than this!! One of the greatest movies ever made, seriously. A truly unforgettable experience for any movie watcher."

","this is by far one of the best thrillers i have ever seen! If u like saw, saw2 or the sixth sense, u should love this! You think you have it all figured out until the end... i loved it.. 10/10. Kevin Spacey does a marvelous job acting his role. I never have been a fan of the bawldwins, but loved Stephen Bawldwin in this movie. Although..... the movie is very complicated and at sometimes hard to follow..... to any movie lover, you should love it. A excellent first movie for director Brian Singer. It is wonderfully acted. Wonderfully directed, and the ending is just plain outstanding. Definitely in my top 10 favorite movies. If you have the slightest idea about wanting to rent it, rent it. If you want to buy it, BUY IT!"
"andreas_14_99","9","0","1","29 April 2006"," Excellent Thriller!
","I just finished watching this movie a few minutes ago, and can without a doubt say it's one of the best thriller mysteries ever to be made. I found the plot and script both to be very clever and original. Furthermore it had great acting in general, and brilliant acting by Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne in particular. Even Stephen Baldwin delivers in style for a change.<br/><br/>As the movie goes along you get drawn into its world and about half way through you're completely absorbed by it. One starts to fit the pieces of the story together in order to find out who the mystery man is, or if there even was one to begin with. I personally came up with a few different theories, of which one, proved to be right. This always serves as a letdown to me though. I don't like to be right in the end. I love the feeling when a movie catches you with total surprise. However I cannot and will not deny that this movie was tremendously well pulled of on all accounts. A definite 10! Finally I'd like to add that if you think of the most unexpected but yet somehow the most obvious, of what's there right in front of you, you will figure out the mystery of the film before it ends... Well, hope you'll watch it and enjoy. I know I did!:D"
"nived84","7","0","1","17 April 2006"," The greatest trick Bryan Singer ever pulled off was this film
","In 1995 the Oscar for Best Picture went to Mel Gibson's Braveheart. I thought it should have gone to Ron Howard's Apollo 13, but the REAL film that should have won wasn't even nominated; Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, which was nominated for only two Academy Awards (best supporting actor and best original screenplay), which it both won. Here we have a fast paced, confusing ""hall-of-mirrors"" crime-noir/thriller that's loaded with great performances from an ensemble cast, a great score and a whooping of a twist ending that's quite literally jaw-dropping. This is a film that's truly memorable and deserves to be a classic.<br/><br/>The film starts off with what looks like five random criminals being brought in because of a bogus truck robbery. The five men then plan to get back at the cops by uncovering a corrupt service the police were providing to certain high-paying criminals. These five ""usual suspects"" grow closer to one another, coming together to pull off another job in L.A. which is where things start to get sticky. They end up getting involved with a sinister crime lord that no one seems to have ever seen or met, named Keyser Soze. Is Keyser real or is he just a figment of someone's imagination? The more the jig-saw puzzle pieces seem to be coming together, the more the whole puzzle starts to change and fall apart.<br/><br/>You'll think you're on top of it all, but eventually the rug will be pulled out from beneath your feet. The film does an excellent job of playing with your mind, and at the same time convincing you that you think you know what's going on, but it's not until the final ten minutes that you'll start to be able to pull back and look at the big picture and realize that you've been had. My hats off to director Bryan Singer (who later went on to bigger fame with 2000's X-Men) and writer Christopher McQuarrie for keeping all of this not only surprising, but fun, and exciting, without ever becoming too complicated or too confusing. But a lot of praise should also go to the fine cast as well, including Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Chazz Palminteri, Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite and a really knockout performance from Kevin Spacey, which earned him an Oscar for the role of Verbal.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen The Usual Suspects by now I highly recommend you go out and buy the special edition DVD right now, don't think about renting it, you'll just end up buying it later any way. It's a complicated, well crafted and nearly flawlessly written thriller that's exciting and puzzling to watch the first time, and fun to watch again and again. This is one of my top ten favorite films of the nineties, and one of my all-time personal favorites as well."
"leviot","10","0","1","16 April 2006"," Absolutely brilliant piece of entertainment
","'The Usual Suspects' has such a flair and a flamboyance about it, it's brilliance goes way beyond it's surprising ending. Rarely does a film mesmerize its viewers the this one does. Watching 'the Usual Suspects', you feel like you're being transported into the treacherous world of crime and criminals. You try to figure out who can be trusted, who cannot be trusted and who is just a distraction. You keep guessing who is who, and what is what, and it gives you no rest till the very end. I've watched many movies, but rarely does a movie 'get' to me the way this one did. When it finished I just sat back going 'Wow'! and I watched it over and over to pick up hidden clues I might have missed along the way. This film is not just a mystery movie, it's also a great drama, with bits of comedy and action sprinkled in. I was a big fan of Kevin Spacey before I watched this film, and after this it only solidified my opinion of him as the greatest pure actor of his generation. I think 'The Usual Suspects' ranks up there with the greatest movies of the last century, and it's definitely the best in it's genre to come out over the last 25 years or so."

It's done SO well in fact that many people seem to feel ""cheated"" by the movie.<br/><br/>To these people, I say that you have missed the point of this movie entirely.<br/><br/>The film-makers use the audience's expectations against them - they present a work of fiction so convoluted that we sit there and eat it up, they build up Spacey's unlikeable character so well that you can't help but like him, or at least feel a little sorry for him. And then the twist hits, and it leaves you thinking ""Wow - I've just had the wool pulled over my eyes for 100 minutes so well that I didn't even see it."" This is the skill for which the screenplay won an Oscar, and the skill in playing his dual role for which Kevin Spacey won his Oscar for this movie.

","Well thats what I thought and hoped, but the matter of fact that after watching it at least 5 times (a couple were interrupted viewings) since it was released I'm still pretty much in the dark. At least if you were to watch it now you'd appreciate the supporting cast of more familiar faces of benecio and pollack, at the time byrne and baldwin would have been the recognizables and spacey the newcomer. I was thinking their was more action in this, but to watch it now seems it more an episode of gillmore girls than a lost episode. It was released around the same time as Heat which i'm a huge fan of and probably a big factor to why I didn't rate this to well because for the timing issue I always think of heat when I hear usual suspects. Benecio is very very funny especially reading the card in the line up. The twist is what the film is primarily remembered for which is pretty sad, due to the very good acting and chemistry. But regardless the movie still ended up as a classic in many eyes (and launched spacey, del toro & singer)...sadly not mine, I'll give it another shot one day"

The story gets that more exciting when the mythical crime lord Keyser Soze gets involved and you are sucked in until the last minute (where you will be surprised). <br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie's script is amazing and very intricate.

There isn't a moment of boredom, indeed most of the interrogation in the police station only serves to suck you in deep into the fiendishly clever plot. Story within a story!<br/><br/>In this action-packed drama directed by Bryan Singer, a mythical hit-man hoodwinks the cops into playing into his paralytic hands, while coolly extricating himself from their clutches. Was there a real Keyser Soze?? Or was he a mere figment of the imagination? Probably both?<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey steals the thunder in a highly composed, eccentric and yet definitively mesmerizing performance. Starting from the opening lineup right up to walking out of the station, loosening the limp, and speeding away with his associate, his sombre demeanor captures the very mystery and essence of Soze's character, as also his comrades in crime.<br/><br/>With an equally fine supporting cast comprising of Kevin Pollack, Chazz Palmintieri, Benicio del Toro, Steven Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne, there is very little that can go wrong. Even after 10 years, the suspense and the minute attention to detail, keep you riveted as you watch the film for the 5th, 6th, 10th or umpteenth time.<br/><br/>Clearly, the story is everything as demonstrated by The Usual Suspects."

","Kevin Spacey won an Oscar as best supporting actor in this interesting film noir. But in fact Spacey is closer to being the principal actor in this film and his work, while good, is certainly not outstanding in my opinion. If anyone in this movie deserved a Supporting Actor Oscar it should have gone to Pete Postelthwaite, a graduate (as I recall) of the Royal Shakespeare Company, who makes a great villain with a foreign accent that can't quite be placed. I would certainly void the Oscar that went to the script writer. This movie is fine until the ending which goes beyond implausibility to the absolutely ridiculous. Many ""caper"" movies have implausible endings. (David Mamet's caper films come to mind.) But this one goes beyond beyond beyond. I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie but the ending dragged my rating down several notches. I think -- pardon the insult guys and girls -- it testifies to the youth of most contributors to this website that they are prepared to treat as a ""classic"" a movie that ranks far below gangster films of yesteryear that ended more believably. This is what used to be called a B Movie when double bills were common. It's enjoyable, but that's the most that can be said for it."

"grandmastachunk","7","0","1","24 October 2005"," A good movie, that seems great
","The Usual Suspects is a good movie. It has a surprise ending that many people think is so wonderful that it makes the movie one of the greatest of all time (today on IMDb it is rated 4th best of the 90's and 18th best of all time), but these people are wrong.<br/><br/>The movie flows well enough, having decent characters, good acting, and a decent story, though none of these stand out so much that you can't find equal value in at least one movie playing the average week at your local superplex. The main characters are introduced in an interesting enough way, and eventually we learn of the dangerous, sneaky and powerful Keyser Soze. We are to believe, seemingly until the end of the movie, that we do not actually see Soze. We probably expected to, and we saw some of his work, but not actually him. Maybe, having seen many movies with twists before, we have come to suspect the characters we have already met. Soze really could be anyone that isn't dead, it's just up to the writer to choose at this point, although certain characters make for a better story.<br/><br/>Whether we suspect anyone or not, we are told that Soze is one of the characters we have known all along, and we are told why it is him. Perhaps we are surprised, but we think back throughout the movie and see that there is nothing wrong with this, so okay, sure, it's him. Then the movie shows us several things revealing that Soze is not this character, but another character. The choice of the writer to make this character be Soze is a good one, as it's interesting that Soze was talking to the police for the whole movie, that he was thought to be a cripple, etc...<br/><br/>So there you have it, a good movie. But that's not what many think. They think it's absolutely great. I'm not quite sure why. Maybe because the cinematic devices used to reveal Soze's true identity seem so profound. Maybe because many viewers, in only a few minutes, became so completely certain that the first person suggested to be Soze was actually him that later the rug was spectacularly pulled from beneath their feet. Maybe because lots of people just aren't very smart, and can't tell the difference between something pretending to be great and something that's actually great (although everyone has this problem in some subject or another). I just don't think it was that wonderful how the writer left Soze's identity completely open, declared it was one guy, and then said ""No, it was another,"" and it annoys me how this film is seen as so great by so many.<br/><br/>It seems even less great when compared to other (albeit later) films featuring famous surprises. The Sixth Sense (114th all time, 22nd of the 90's) has a story of basically equal quality and originality, but the ending twist is so much better, if only because the viewer's nose was shoved in the truth so many times but wasn't able to smell it. Fight Club (35th all time, 9th of the 90's) is such an incredible movie without the surprise that it seems a shame that so much attention be paid to the twist, which ranks between the twists of The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense. Come to think of it, I can even say that I liked the surprising character revelation of American Pie (Hannigan's Character) better than the Usual Suspects' twist. At least it's regarded correctly.<br/><br/>Okay, I can't end on that, so I better summarize/conclude. The Usual Suspects is a good movie with a decent surprise ending, but neither the movie, nor the ending, are near as good as so many believe them to be. I suggest that those who think otherwise should give it some real thought, although it is just a movie."

","I remember seeing this film once before, I obviously didn't understand it properly and only remember bits and pieces, so I was definitely up for seeing it again to judge it more efficiently, from director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns). Basically there was an explosion on the waterfront of New York, and criminal Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Spacey) was the only witness, and FBI Agent Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) and U.S. Customs special agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) wants him to answer their questions about what happened. Through flashbacks Verbal, who suffers cerebral palsy, tells the story of how he and four other con-men were brought into custody as ""the usual suspects"" that could have carried out a truck hijack. In the lineup were former police police officer seemingly giving up crime, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), short-tempered professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), his partner Fred Fenster (Licence to Kill's Benicio Del Toro), hijacker Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal. None of the five men are found guilty of th crime after questioning, and afterwards to get some kind of revenge McManus convinces the others to take part in a robbery targeting the city's finest taxi service. After this they sell the loot in Los Angeles to Redfoot the Fence (Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene), who talks them into doing another job, and even though Keaton said the previous one would be his last he agrees anyway. The robbery goes well despite the fact that it was heroin rather than money or jewels, and Redfoot reveals the job came from lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who the five thieves meet, he says that he works for Keyser Soze, a renowned but unseen criminal mastermind. Kobayashi blackmails them due to the fact that Soze has been associated with their crimes in the past, he wants them to attack a ship on the San Pedro harbour filled with cocaine. In the present Verbal tells about the legend of Keyser Soze, a criminal feared like the devil who apparently killed his own family when they were threatened, and who no-one has ever seen the face of. Back in flashback, Fenster was killed earlier on when he dropped out, and the four remaining criminals go ahead with this job on the docks, only to realise it is some kind of trap and they are killed one by one, with Verbal and Keaton the last two alive. Of course Verbal explains that he supposedly watched Keaton being shot and burned before the explosion by the mysterious and unseen stranger, possibly Soze, but the officers aren't sure he saw anything properly. Verbal seems to be upset that they believe Keaton is Keyser Soze and may still be out there, and with his bail posted they let Verbal go with his possessions, and he limps away. The ending however is the big bang, when the police officers are relaxing one gazes at the wall of newspaper and photo clippings in the room Kint was being interviewed, and he drops his mug realising everything the conman had been saying was built up around the various words and names on the wall, Verbal as well in seen with his limp disappearing and left arm restored, and diving away with ""Mr. Kobayashi"". The final quote of the film is a repeat of the words Verbal said to the police, and where we realise he really was Keyser Soze, ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" ""And like that, he's gone."" Also starring Suzy Amis as Edie Finneran and Dan Hedaya as Sgt. Jeffrey 'Jeff' Rabin. All the performances are fantastic, including Byrne and Postlethwaite, but especially of course the mesmerising Spacey who was not a big star back at the time, only known for small roles like Glengarry Glen Ross, he deserved the Oscar, the story is clever with a witty script and some exciting gun play and explosive moments, a good old fashioned and engaging crime thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film. Kevin Spacey was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Verbal Kint was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!"

","Five men are brought into a police station under suspicion of hijacking a truck. Their names are Dean Keaton, Michael McManus, Todd Hockney, Fred Fenster, and Verbal Kint. While in jail, they decide to work together to pull off an emerald heist. After the heist, they get greedy, and meet the enigmatic Kobayashi, the lawyer for the most feared criminal in the world: Keyser Soze. No one knows who Soze is, but they fear him. As Kint puts it, ""Keaton always said that he doesn't believe in god, but he fears him. Well, I believe in god, and the only thing I'm afraid of is Keyser Soze."" The Usual Suspects is the most daring, inventive, and fun movie I've ever seen. Its brilliance starts with the acting, which is uniformly excellent. After seeing Kevin Spacey's performance in this film, he instantly became my favorite actor. He plays the cowardly cripple, Verbal Kint, who is the lone survivor of a drug deal gone wrong. Chazz Palminteri plays Agent Kujan of Customs who interviews Kint throughout the film about what happened the night before when the deal went bust. The dialog these two exchange is some of the best dialog ever to come from the silver screen. Kujan is obsessed with convincing himself that Dean Keaton played by Gabriel Byrne is dead. Keaton was an ex corrupt cop who had supposedly died in a fire, but then turned up alive a few years later. Kujan is convinced that Keaton was manipulating Kint for his own purposes. ""But why me? Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney? Why me? I'm stupid. I'm a cripple. Why me?""--Kint to Kujan ""Because you're a cripple, Verbal. Because you're stupid, because you're weaker than them.""--Kujan to Kint. Perhaps the best performance, even eclipsing Spacey's, is Pete Pete Postlethwaite's turn as Kobayashi. He is truly terrifying in this role. Kobayashi is cold blooded and has a heart of stone. He scares the five tough criminals into working for Soze. But who is Soze? That is the question that this entire film hinges on. And the answer is one that will be remembered forever. Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie combine to make this film the greatest movie I've ever seen."

","""And then, just like that, he was gone!!!"". The dialogue still echoes in my mind whenever I think of ""The Usual Suspects"". One of the greatest thrillers of all time, ""The Usual Suspects"" owes its success not just to the mind-numbing twist at the end, but also to the incredible performance of Kevin Spacey. That he is a brilliant actor is a fact well known, but it is his performance as the cripple ""Verbal"" Kint in this movie that puts him in the league of all time greats. Gabriel Byrne and Pete Pstlewaithe also pitch in with good performances. One of the greatest aspects of this movie (...which usually goes unnoticed...) is its thrilling background score. It sets the mood for this movie and adds to the already built up tension. I would rate the finale of this movie as the SECOND BEST of all time. (..Shawshank Redemption just pips it to the post..). Overall, it has all the makings of a spellbinding thriller and deserves a special place in the history of great cinema."
"SunnydaZe10","10","0","1","19 July 2005"," The big mistake
","Just because Keaton thinks Verbal is Soze', just because whomever killed Keaton had a gold lighter doesn't imply Verbal is Soze'. (it does imply Verbal killed Keaton) I do not believe the Lawyer is Soze', either. I think Soze' is a ""corporation"" created to scare thugs into submission. Maybe the reason to kill the man on the boat was because he knew this. He may have been a ""Verbal"" in the ""organization"" at one point, and decided to rat. He definitely seems to know Verbal before his death, as he screams, ""I told them nothing."" The most valid reason Verbal is not the ""head guy""- Why would he put himself in such jeopardy? It is said of Soze' that he never sticks his neck out. Now, Kujan will make it his life's work proving that Verbal is Soze'. Maybe this is what Soze' wanted. There is no one person who is Soze'. Soze' is a myth (like the devil, who he is often compared with.) The Lawyer is the most likely ""Boss"" of the ""corporation"", even though he might just be another ""employee"". Verbal confesses to killing Keaton while Kujan is yelling at him. Soze' would never confess, only a patsy. One can assume Verbal was paid a nice sum of money and now resides in a Tropical Paradise for his services to ""Soze'"". Come on, Christopher McQuarrie tell me I'm right.

","The Usual Suspects"" is a complicated puzzle of a movie that I bet you can't watch just once. The film deals with five career crooks who have big plans after they are all brought together in a police lineup. However, their mayhem is interrupted by a mysterious character named Kaiser Sose who plans to eliminate all five of the crooks after they all crossed him in various ways during their checkered pasts. An amazing original screenplay and tight direction keep up a substantial amount of tension throughout. Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Pete Postlethwaite, and Chazz Palminteri all give top-notch performances. But it is Kevin Spacey (in an Oscar-winning part) that makes ""The Usual Suspects"" work on all levels. This part put him in a higher class of actors and can be compared to Robert DeNiro's star-making job in ""The Godfather, Part II"". 5 stars out of 5."

IF anyone has seen Brave Fart, god help them, this movie is better than all those which have come before or after.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a bloodbath in the California docks of San Pedro. many have been murdered, all but two, one is Verbal (Kevin Spacey), other guy is in coma. So Kevin spacey is asked a few questions and then let go. But a further cop grills him even after he's granted immunity. So during the two incidents, he fills him up on how they got together, a gun heist had taken place in NYC, they were all grilled, verbal was the only misfit as he was a small-timer and a cripple who could not pull it off. As is the case these guys put their evil minds to work in the prison cell and rob some corrupt NY cops causing a stir turning the whole force upside down with people getting fired.<br/><br/>The gang then moves to LA, start working for red-foot. One job goes fine and the next job they are screwed. SO they ask him to give them the guy who gave the tipoff. Kobayashi walks in, and tells them about Kaiser Soze, a mercenary drug-lord of Turkey and Hungary. Its Soze's will that these guys pull off a Coke deal going down in the docks.Apparently Kobayashi knows all about their lives since forever.<br/><br/>So these guys decide the 91 Million package is too big to overlook and decide to work nonetheless and split the cash. What follows is the bloodbath. And there was NO DOPE, the deal was about a guy who could identify Soze, he was the only one. BUt he got shot too.SO the cop thats grilling him finally comes to the conclusion that Keaton ( Byrne) was Soze. Verbal cries and disagrees but cop puts himself down on him and makes him believe. Then he 's allowed to go as he's in tears.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the coma guy is talking during the whole thing and FBI gets a translator and get Skecth done of Soze, which resembles verbal strikingly in appearance, but the cop misses it as he tries to chase Verbal.<br/><br/>On first viewing you may be stumped, but the hints are all over. The golden lighter, In one Scene he's asked why he's called verbal, so he says, ""because i talk too much"" ( Soze also means talkative or verbal in Turkish, Kaizer means King in German, according to verbal, Soze was German, maybe Turkish, so the link). Even when Keaton and verbal talk in the docks during the climax, verbal easily identifies the language as Hungarian, and when he leaves the office, his cripple disappears as Kobayashi picks him up.<br/><br/>I was left speechless after the movie.

"rmax304823","8","0","2","28 June 2005"," Devil makes work for idle hands.
","This is a well-made and ambitious crime thriller, nicely acted and directed, and with a most unexpected ending.<br/><br/>I won't bother with the story since I'm sure it's been thoroughly described elsewhere.<br/><br/>The construction is a little complicated. Kevin Spacey, a small-time con man, is telling his story of a band of thieves and murderers to an investigator, Chaz Palminteri. The are multiple flashbacks and the transition from the present to the past isn't obvious. What I mean is, you will not see the pages flapping on a desk calendar while harp arpeggios strum in the background. Instead, there are quick cuts back and forth, sometimes with a time and date at the bottom of the screen to help orient us, and it works. We're never confused about when or where we are.<br/><br/>I must say, though, that the rules of film making have become a lot more, well -- relaxed over the years. Around 1950 Alfred Hitchcock was taken to task for including what critics called a ""lying flashback"" in ""Stage Fright."" They were bothered by the fact that Hitchcock used a flashback to illustrate a story being told by Richard Todd and part of the story was false, yet it still appeared in the flashback. Yes, film grammar has changed. Ain't it wonderful? <br/><br/>When I said the movie was ambitious I meant that it seemed to strive for a significance greater than that provided by the exploits of a handful of losers. The mysterious villain may or may not be real. He is said to rule just about the entire criminal world. There is nothing he can't or won't do. The movie conjures up Professor Moriarty -- or Macavity the Cat at the least, the Napolean of crime. ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled,"" says Spacey, ""was convincing us that he doesn't exist."" <br/><br/>Do the ominous shadows cast over the plot by this invocation work? Yes, kind of. We get a sense of the hopelessness of trying to pit ourselves against an irresistible power. It also drains away some of the realism that so many cop movies fuss over. If we don't believe in an arch criminal running the dark universe, then it's hard to believe the plot of this movie. In paying attention to its loftier goals the movie lacks the down-to-earth and familiar quality of stories like ""L.A. Confidential."" <br/><br/>But what the heck. It's a good movie. If it doesn't tell us too much about human nature it gives us characters we get to know a bit about, lots of colorful and well-handled action, and something of a sense of tragedy. Mephistopheles outlives everyone."

","I was really not sure what to expect going into this movie. I am pleased to say I went into it completely unbiased. I was expecting something good, but I was pleasantly surprised at HOW good it was. Going through the story would take too long, so I'll just explain the highlights and lowlights. The acting is superb. Watching the characters of Dean Keaton, Verbal Kint, Michael McManus, Todd Hockney, and Fred Fenster is a hoot, and on occasion, a hold-your-breath-or-you'll-miss-it moment. They work well together, and are completely believable as the colorful gang of criminals. It is Baldwin, however, who really steals the show, as the tough, trigger-happy, and possibly slightly psychotic Michael McManus. The character is hilarious, and as he racks up easily a third of the movie's large body count, you can't help but cheer for him. Kevin Spacey, of course, is fascinating to watch as the slimy and rat-like Verbal Kint. Gabriel Byrne is riveting as Keaton, and the others are as well. However, this is a mature movie. There is well over 90 f words, and brutal violence racks up a body count of at least 30 people. Nonetheless, if you are mature, go see this, cause it is one of the best movies EVER. Seriously."

I thought Kevin Spacey was really good, definitely worth his Oscar. I also thought the fights were interesting, especially the fated San Pedro pier battle.

","The devil in this case being director Bryan Singer and writer Chris McQuarrie. With this film, they have pulled a trick that is not likely to be repeated anytime soon. It starts out like an ordinary crime movie, with foul-mouthed clichéd criminals: the funny gay one, the tough new yawker, the experienced veteran, trying to go straight. Yet, therein lies the beauty and irony of this movie. ""No way they'd line up five guys like us in the same room"" says one character as they start to plan their revenge crime. But that is the point. They are the usual suspects, the guys you automatically know are guilty when a crime has been committed. Or are they? Is it all a trick on us? On them? Or are they pulling a trick of their own?<br/><br/>This film takes crime thriller formulas, makes you trust in them, and then reveals the truth...but what is that's a lie? The story is related by Verbal Kint, the only survivor of the whole incident. As the story grows continues, we begin to realize the truth, only to have our opinions challenged five minutes later. <br/><br/>This is an original must see. The performances are unbelievable, especially Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint.

","This movie is an American classic in many ways already. I just watched it now from the comfort of my home, and instantly came here to comment. I would call this one of the top 10 American movies made. Ever. Hands down.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is the story of 5 ex-criminals, who since having cleaned up some find their selves accused of a crime none of them appear to have committed. They begin to believe that the police simply chose them as scapegoats for the crime, so they would have somebody to accuse. Angered by this and the corruption within the NYPD, they decide to take radical action against the cops. This soon leads them all back into the world of crime, and to the shocking truth: that it wasn't coincidence that made their paths cross, but rather a set up. Their story is told by the one surviving man, Verbal Kint, who is pounded by the police, as they try to find out if he is telling the truth or a pack of lies.<br/><br/>There are far too many things to love about this movie. It has got lots of action, an intriguing, winding, mysterious plot, and probably the most shocking ending for any movie I've seen in the last 3 years. The movie also, seemingly like the much more recent Kill Bill, manages to create a world of assassins and crime, a setting that will engross the audience. However, one thing this movie has that other movies don't have is that it makes a point of evil winning. The Usual Suspects appears to be a slap in the face towards the police force in many lights, as it reveals just how they could let a bunch of vicious criminals get away so easily! I would personally recommend this movie to anyone who loves twisted action, yet suspenseful, movies...however, I think anyone who can withstand a good amount of violence in a movie will still enjoy it. And anyone is bound to love this ending, I only knew half of what was going to come, and it still left me shocked!"

","As time goes by, what made ""The Usual Suspects"" unusual may be lost on the jaded moviegoer. You must remember that in 1995, this movie told a different kind of gangster story and it had a different kind of format.<br/><br/>The spine of the movie is an interview by two police detectives with an eyewitness, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). Verbal's tale is mostly told in flashbacks with an unseen villain named Keyser Soze manipulating everyone like they were pieces in his chess game. Verbal's story and how it is told is what made this one of the most intelligent movie scripts to have been produced.<br/><br/>After ""The Usual Suspects"" was released, other films to come would copy the format of its ending, i.e., to use a montage of clues carefully laid out for the viewer throughout the movie to underscore the big revelation."
"stonehorn","9","0","1","22 November 2004"," One of the best movies ever...
","""The Usual Suspects"" is a movie about five criminals who meet in a line-up. Some of them know each other from before and some of them don't, but the one thing they've got in common is that they're excellent thieves in their own fields... The only one who differs form the others is Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne); a former thief, according to himself, who wants to go straight.. However, he is talked into joining the others in what's supposed to be one, single operation.. (By the by, this sounds very familiar seen in the history of American action movies, but this is done in such a manner in this movie that you won't give it a thought.)<br/><br/>Eventually the five criminals start wondering whether the line-up was coincidental, because they get an offer from a person called Keyser Söze - a myth in the criminal underworld - and the entire situation seems just too ""organized"" to be a coincidence. I won't give away more of the movie if you haven't seen it, so I'll just move along to my personal opinions.<br/><br/>As you might have guessed from the headline, I rather enjoyed this movie. It's got everything a thriller needs; an incredibly good story, great actors who tell the story like it should be told and a killer ending. The actors are brilliant and I love everything from Kevin Spacey's weird walk to Benico Del Toro's attempt to talk German-English (that's actually what he's trying to do, according to himself. His character is named Fenster, which is the German word for window, and hence he decided to give his character a German accent)<br/><br/>But if I have to find something not so good about this movie, it's the fact that there's a Baldwin in it. I'm sick and tired of finding a Baldwin in 9 out of 10 American productions from the 1990s. BUT, the Stephen of the kind is doing a great job as the rather hot-headed McManus, and when that's the only flaw I can think of in this movie, that says a great deal about how good it is.<br/><br/>The ending deserves an entire paragraph of its own. It is probably the only ending I have seen that has managed to change my impression of the rest of the movie. During the couple of minutes this ending lasts, the rest of the movie just gets better and better, and then when you see it again (because you have to watch this movie again right after you've seen it the first time) it's even better because of the ending. It's incredible! I won't bore you anymore now; just go and watch the movie again and be reminded of how brilliant it is!!"

The surprise ending was a bit obvious from earlier on, though, seeing as when they showed Soze walking through fire, I said to my friend, ""Isn't that Verbal?"" There were a few other hints, but when they told us it was Keaton, my friend made me admit that my belief was wrong, however, I felt that the story wasn't over yet. They didn't conclude strongly enough, it felt as if it needed something extra, and then the twist came in, and I just said, ""wow,"" as the credits began to roll. I thought that the whole cast was great. Benicio Del Toro looks great in one of his early roles. We see very similar acting by him in ""Snatch"".

","This seemingly ordinary movie, turns out to be one which grips the viewer and keeps hold of him throughout the movie. Hats off to Kevin Spacey who,i always respected a talented actor, manages to don the hat of a cowardly cripple down to the T. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it as yet, so i will restrain myself to making comments about the way the movie was made.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's direction is masterful...he unravels the plot beautifully and keeps the viewers guessing. The cast seem to be perfect for each other and enact their respective quirks realistically. Though some people may find that the movie tends to drag along at times..i thoroughly enjoyed it and was eagerly awaiting the next twist in the plot.<br/><br/>The backbone of the story lies with the aura of fear created around a<br/><br/>""merciless"" mobster who seems to make even the strongest men weak-kneed at the mere mention of his name.The narrative by Spacey on the exploits of this crime lord was the high point of the movie for me. It comes as no surprise that Spacey is so easily able to morph into any role given to him...his film credits speak for themselves.He clearly is the shining star in the movie.<br/><br/>Gabriel Byrne as the disgruntled former cop is very convincing and as expected is first on the list of suspects created by the police. Kevin Pollak as the demolitions expert and the only one who seems to have a grip on reality manages to keep the motley team under control most of the time..but Byrne is their unacknowledged leader.. And then there's Benicio Del Toro, who even though has a small role, makes an impact as the stuttering con and impulsive risk taker.<br/><br/>So if you want to watch a ""real"" suspense driven thriller of a movie, which will have you guessing right till the end...i would advise this one.<br/><br/>It really deserves it's place in the Top 250.."

However, all actors were superb, with Spacey being particularly riveting. Much of the time he reminded me of that old-time specialist in villainy- Peter Lorre.

","First off, The Usual Suspects is definitely one of my favorite movies and is in my own top 10. However, there is one huge mistake that almost kills the movie and that is Stephen Baldwin. I'm not sure what made them think that he was right for the part, but whenever he's in a scene I wince. What's he doing in a movie like this? He's without a doubt the worst Baldwin of them all and seems like he is trying to be like his brothers and act when in actuality, he's the brother who would be very good at a career in say...welding or something. In the features on the DVD he talks about his role as if it is such an honor to play this moderately important character. He was very cocky and arrogant according to Kevin Pollack. I think arrogance is fine if your an accomplished actor, but when your credits include 'Bio Dome','Slap Shot 2: Breaking the Ice' and 'Flintstones: Viva Rock Vegas', maybe you should take yourself a little less seriously. I can't attack him too much though, the scene when they were burying Fenster had some pretty good acting on Baldwins part. Remember when he yells and the fleck of spit flies out of his mouth? Wow that was talent."

Miraculously there were two survivors, a severely burned and very scared Hungarian terrorist and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a crippled con-man. Verbal is brought in to the police station for interrogation. He starts to tell how he got there and it all begins 6 weeks earlier when he and four other criminals are brought in for a line-up concerning a hijacked truck loaded with gun parts. The police don't have much evidence but the five are held together in the same cell for one night. They don't know each other, the only thing they have in common is that they are all suspects, and as they sit there waiting to be charged or released they all agree to make a heist together.

It would have been a perfect<br/><br/>ghost story if Kaiser Soze was not so absolutely alive. As it happens it is merely a perfect movie ... period. This film succeeds on every level it stands on. There is no weak link. Every<br/><br/>collaborator understood strength of the story and did their job better than they ever had or ever would again.<br/><br/>Acting -- The Usual Suspects boasts the strongest acting performance a male<br/><br/>ensemble in film history (Twelve Angry Men and Glengary Glenross<br/><br/>notwithstanding). The five principles have an astounding grasp of their<br/><br/>characters and the intricate details that make them so memorable. The<br/><br/>""supporting players"" right down to Hungarian burn victim serve the remarkably layered story as though they were the only ones who could tell it.<br/><br/>
Directing -- Look in vain upon a second viewing for clues that will lead you to the climax's revelation. So painstakingly flawless is Bryan Singer's storytelling ability that with every twist comes apprehension: ""why didn't I see that coming?"" you ask yourself. But Singer is not giving us merely a mystery with a surprise ending. He allows everything to build as the story goes on; along with the<br/><br/>building tension and the guessing is the mounting sense of almost apocalyptic doom that surrounds the characters. It oozes from every frame.<br/><br/>Writing -- Christopher McQuarrie has revealed his obsession to be the inner<br/><br/>struggles of those dedicated to doing wrong. He does not give us characters<br/><br/>that we can relate to but by God we WILL understand them. This is dialog in its purest form, not an extemporaneous syllable is spoken.<br/><br/>
But it is all three of these aspects as well as the cinematography, music and editing which create the film's most outstanding effect. Throughout the film the mystery does not seem to be real. It is otherworldy, mythic. closer to Dante's Inferno than to The Maltese Falcon. From the very beginning the events seem<br/><br/>part of a dark pattern. One put in motion by a force that no one knows is there but is leading each character into Hell. This force is entirely palpable from the first reel, before it is given a name. And that is a name that will live on in the memory of fictional film for as long as it exists."

The movie actually continue in your head, while thinking of what ACTUALLY happened, since a lot of it isn't what you think. No other movie I can come up with, has this kind of trick.<br/><br/>With all this, the movie also has good memorable quotes, like: ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was convincing the world he didn't exist. And like that: *POH* He's gone."""

","Spoiler Alert The Usual Suspects is a great film, possibly the best thriller ever made. A plot-line that is guaranteed to have you arguing with your friends for years to come. At the end we are fed Kevin Spacey as Keyser Soze, but is he?<br/><br/>The choice to shoot the majority of this film at night only adds to the suspense, the dark holding as many questions and fears as the plot and characters themselves. A bold decision by a young director, at this time yet to make a mark in Hollywood. Although Bryan Singer is now perhaps best known as the director of the (currently) two X-Men films this picture will probably be regarded as his masterpiece.<br/><br/>It gave us a chance to see career best performances from actors we would never have expected greatness from, Stephen Baldwin, Kevin Pollak and Giancarlo Esposito to name a few. Benicio Del Toro gave a kinetic performance as Fred Fenster, showing glimpses of the Oscar winner he was to become. As for Gabriel Byrne, he makes Dean Keaton one of the most truly memorable screen criminals, a fantastically understated performance that must have divided peoples opinions as to whether he, or Kevin Spacey gave the standout performance, in a film that seems to be a masterclass of characterization. Bryan Singer truly appears to be an ""actors director"". Also spare a thought, not only for the main players, but the incredible supporting cast, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Posthlethwaite, Dan Hedaya, Paul Bartel, et al.<br/><br/>They have combined to bring us one of the most intelligent, dark, and thoroughly enjoyable movies you will ever see."

","Possible spoilers<br/><br/>No matter how many times I see this film, (and this was about the tenth time I believe) I still look for clues to the final outcome, and I still have a smile on my face the last five minutes of the film.  The first time I saw this movie, it was by myself at the theater, and I could not help but exclaim, `Holy CRAP!' (to the delight of the people around me) and that effect hasn't lessened much in the ensuing decade because this film is so well done.<br/><br/>There are not many films that I would recommend to just about everyone, but `The Usual Suspects' has always been one of them.  There is intrigue, great dialogue, a brilliant screenplay and some top-notch acting, especially from Kevin Spacey, who earned a well-deserved Oscar.  In terms of the direction, there aren't a lot of stylistic similarities between this film and say, Singer's X-Men series, but because they are of different genres, they are impossible to compare.  Every time I watch this film I focus on something different to admire, and this time it was the incredible musical score - it is a great intensity builder and is the perfect accompaniment to a near-perfect film.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","The Usual Suspects stands head and shoulders above most of the films released in 1995. For a debut performance by a director, Bryan Singer covers himself in glory. His direction is studied, assured, and worthy of a ten-year veteran. Christopher McQuarrie's script is clever, quotable and so tightly written that the audience is never truly aware of the (small) plot holes that exist. The cast is superb, the script is nearly flawless, and Singer's direction is the stuff of which legends are made. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate The Usual Suspects as a solid 9."

And then My friend said, with an annoying apathy: ""the cripple did it. i don't want to see this movie again"". I rented the movie anyway, and as Kevin Spacey first appeared as Verbal the gimp, I knew he did it. As it seems now I had all the reasons to stop watching the movie, or to be very disappointed from it- BUT I didn't: The movie was so amazing, the directing was so good, the script was simply genius, and the acting, my god the acting... I was captured to this prefect, genius _______ fill in with any superlative you want. As the ""surprising"" end came, i was so thrilled, so amazed, that the fact i knew all along that Verbal was Soze didn't affect me at all, and the last scene surprised me, amazed me and thrilled me as it supposed to. It seemed like my mind chose to forget about the information i received about the end and just enjoy from every minute of this great movie.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspect is, in my opinion, the best movie ever. It has it all of the ingredients that make a movie good: Directing, script, acting, sound, and for a bonus(a great one in this case) a twist ending.<br/><br/>Even now, when i watch the film (the count is on 20 times) i get thrilled when The camera zooms in the Kujan's office, he talks with his policeman friend, and then drop the mug- that scene makes my heart beat faster, and that says a lot<br/><br/>5/5 10/10 11/11 20/20 100/100... simply perfect and a must see!!!"

Nevertheless, this movie is still pretty good as it keeps you thinking.  The story can get kind of confusing with its many flashbacks and it did seem a little slow until we're introduced to the diabolical Keyser Soze, a heartless drug lord who killed his own family and strikes fear into any bad guy.<br/><br/>From that point, you try to figure out who really is Keyser Soze.  It's very interesting to see how the story is played out and how we finally end up with the truth.

","It's rare for a film to be perfect in every way imaginable. Let me cut the suspense, this isn't one of them. However, I've never seen a perfect movie, but if I had to choose one for the title, The Usual Suspects would definitely be it.<br/><br/>After a violent firefight on Long Beach Harbor, the leads point to one man: Keyser Soze, a deadly crimelord believed to be dead or fiction. Agent Kujan (CHAZZ PALMINTERI) takes the case. He has questions and only ""Verbal"" Kint (KEVIN SPACEY), a man who once had a relationship with Kujan's main suspect, has the answers. The film takes the audience on a magnificent ride through Kint's story and his experiences with Dean Keaton, played convincingly by Gabriel Byrne. The twists and turns lead to one of the most shocking endings in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer, director of The Usual Suspects, has created a film that excels in lighting and creative shots. The scenes at the pier during the firefight are extremely eerie, due in no small part to the lighting and the ghostly wanderings of Soze. The tension is mounted upon these, accompanied by John Ottman's spectacular score. But the music is just as eerie as the silence. Singer knows when the have the music mute in particular scenes. He knows when to place the lights up or low, knows how to manipulate the camera to jerk a certain emotion from us. He does it well. It's the sign of a great director.<br/><br/>But every film has a downside, however small it may be, and this film is no exception. Fenster (BENICIO DEL TORO), one of Kint's associates, although a funny character, has no relevance to the film. Nothing he says has any importance and the movie seems to only use the character as comic relief from a rather dark and dreary movie. Del Toro does perform well with the character but the film would probably would have been more believable without him.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's performance as Kint earned him an Academy Award and the film earned countless others from lesser organizations. This film deserves to be ranked among the best mystery films in recent history. The bar has been set -  it will be hard to surpass it.<br/><br/>Rating: 10 out of 10"
"triple8","10","0","1","4 January 2004"," Who is Keyser Soze?
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:<br/><br/>Uusual Suspects is REALLY good-if you haven't seen it-stop reading this now because there are SPOILERS THROUOUT!<br/><br/>I will confess, at first glance it doesn't seem like it's gonna be a classic-I was rather bored at first-not unmanageably so but it seemed like your typical crime movie. Obviously it's not or it wouldn't be so loved-I think there's a few things here that distinguish it besides the ending-which DOES make it into the movie hall of fame for ""biggest punch in the gut ending ever!!""<br/><br/>Firstly, there's the cleverness of the whole concept-the movie teases, hoodwinks and toys with it's audience-Some people don't like the movie for that reason, they feel manipulated-while I can understand that, I don't agree with it. The whole concept of the movie was so simple it's brilliant-as the movie goes on is there a movie viewer out there who doesn't get sucked into what Verbal is saying? He cons on screen AND off screen-the audience buys into just one man's WORDS-nothing more-until out of this simple story we begin, in our heads to make up incredibly complicated scenarios to solve the puzzle.<br/><br/>Who is Keyser Soze?<br/><br/>The answer, is of coarse right in front of us. Now here is something else. I guessed the answer relatively quickly and WAS SHOCKED ANYWAY when what I had thought came to pass-I got so sucked into Verbal's verbal torrent of words that I forgot my original premise-or maybe it wasn't forgotten but just put to one side-even if this idea floats through briefly your brain there is no clue AT ALL the end will play out as it does.<br/><br/>Then of coarse, there is Keyser Soze himself, who takes on a sort of mythical legendary status in the movie to the point where the movie has made it's viewing audience crazy to know the identity of someone who's name WASN'T EVEN INTRODUCED as a character until well into the movie! The name Soze begins to take over the whole film and completely alters what everyone thought it was gonna be about.<br/><br/>The ending-Without a doubt this is one of the best twist endings of all time-not just who Soze really is, but the METHOD of how it comes out-deserves to be up there as a great movie for that alone.<br/><br/>Also-even though it's not perfect(I was actually as mentioned very bored at times in the beginning)you just sort of know your watching something that's gonna become a classic. There's just something about it.<br/><br/>It can also be watched more then once(and should be!) and rather then dissipate, the movie's intrigue does not lessen at all with multiple viewings. The mystique is still there, strong as ever and the end still sends chills down the spine. A great film!<br/><br/>I wouldn't rank this as my favorite movie of all time but I can see why it would be someone else's. It is clever, it has style, it is refreshingly different and it has some of the best acting I've ever seen. A must see if you haven't seen it."

MAJOR SPOILER !!!!<br/><br/>I remember watching THE USUAL SUSPECTS for the first time and being totally convinced the ending had satanic/supernatural overtones with Verbal being able to walk properly because Keyser Soze was indeed the devil and his reward for keeping his mouth shut was the use of his leg , but in a later conversation with my brother in laws sister she told me the ending was the coventional non pre-destination/non supernatural ending of Verbal making up the events by reading the bulletin boards in the police office . I actually thought this might have been the ending after all but still clung to my own interpretation . It`s a very ambiguous ending and I don`t believe for a moment that Christopher McQuarrie meant the ending to be so open to interpretation which means it`s not as clever as is made out . I think THE USUAL SUSPECTS is rather over rated and doesn`t deserve to be number 17 on the IMDB top 250 list"

","You know the drill: After a whole bunch of criminals die on a boat in a drug deal gone wrong, the D.A. and chief of police try to get the truth about what happened out of Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), who may not be as reliable as he seems.<br/><br/>My two cents: This movie is unique in that it started the whole recent ""unreliable narrator"" trend in movies.  The 'twist', despite what some people have written, isn't a last minute tack-on; the inconsistencies in Verbal's statement lead up to it well before it's finally revealed (the ""man with the plan"" and ""I'm a cripple"" speeches taken together are what clued me in).  <br/><br/>Aside from that, the movie's pretty standard stuff, the standouts being the random memorable lines and Kevin Spacey's performance.  Even so, it's well worth a look, especially if you like crime dramas.<br/><br/>Recommendations: Fans of ""Out of Sight"", ""Get Shorty"" and ""Ocean's 11"" will probably appreciate this the most, but fans of ""The Sopranos"" and ""Goodfellas"" may want to give this a try too."

"movieguy1021","Null","0","1","18 August 2003"," The Usual Suspects: 7/10
","Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is one of the few famous movies now that still has an aura of mystery around its ending. Meaning, of course, that I've stumbled upon it, so there was no real surprise for me about it, but I'll get to that later. The Usual Suspects won two Oscars: best supporting actor (Kevin Spacey), and best original screenplay (Christopher McQuarrie). Both were won deservedly, but it should have also won Most Confusing Screenplay and Most Stuff Happening On Screen At One Time So It Is Hard To Tell What Is Happening.<br/><br/>Five criminals, McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal Kint (Spacey), are all in a line-up, when there is usually one suspect. They suspect something, and aim to get revenge, but someone higher up is controlling them. If you understand this plot fully, please tell me.<br/><br/>Since I knew the ending, there was no mystery, but I still found The Usual Suspects to be engaging and never boring. I knew the ending, who Keyser Soze was, but not how he was involved, so that added another interesting aspect to it. The acting and chemistry made the not-quite-believable scenario that they're in. Spacey, who was really more in a main role than supporting, wasn't as good as his other Oscar-winning role in American Beauty, but he was quite good. Everyone else was very good also, and had amazing chemistry with each other (think Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid chemistry).<br/><br/>If you've read about the ending, you can still appreciate how it is unraveled (only paralled to The Sixth Sense on how it's revealed), as I sure did. Overall, The Usual Suspects is an entertaining, if suspense-less movie that I think everyone in their life will see at least once.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong language."

But then i have to think about it as he wouldnt fit in at the end...but then again it would of been wierd to SEE him die. Some people may not agree with me on this opinion but i think he should of been nominated for best supporting actor.  Anyone of those men could have been nominated but i think Fenster was the best.  Whats your opinion?"
"solongsuckers","Null","0","1","28 July 2003"," A slow burn which leads to a final fury
","Spoiler alert What I loved about his movie was that it was a mystery that didn't even really let on that it was a mystery.  Because the ""secret"" was let out by the first round of viewers and/or critics, most knew that it was a mystery going in but, as far as we know throughout the movie, Soze is a man or a myth, etc.  We don't know because the movie's depression hooks us.  The idea of Soze is a black hole that slowly collapses along the way and the movie's intensity and riveted focus on characters keeps the ""truth"" in the distance until it pounces on us in the final sequences.  Until then, it is a well shot and often boring crime drama about a group of career losers who function well enough to be successful deviants.  The movie deserves it's rating because of the fascinating character development throughout and the lightening quick puzzle fitting at the end.  The character's other then Keaton are not very deep (no Verbal is not very deep) but that is a plus here.  They are sympathetic criminals but the script keeps them as just that, criminals.  In other words, it doesn't insult the audiences intelligence, even though it does portray the criminals in a positive light throughout.  The technical aspect is also quite excellent.  Little things, such as the light bulb dangling on the boat, accompanied by a light, jingling musical score, are spellbinding.  Such moments also lighten the movie's comatose mood.  The movie's soundtrack is as dour and boring as it gets but it wears on me after awhile and helps me get into the movie's mood, aka a black hole.  This is depressing stuff and the director doesn't try to find a silver lining in any of it.  Stephen Baldwin is the movie's Doc Holliday, a flowery, yet one dimensional, nut case.  Benicio Del Toro supplies comic relief and provides his characters ""tight a**"" distinction with nice subtlety to the point that you almost don't notice it.  Kevin Pollack has the movie's coolest role, playing a character that just doesn't give a you know what and he gets to explode throughout.  Spacey is such a naturally aloof actor that his roles come off as mysterious even when they are not supposed to be.  Gabriel Byrne has a tricky dual role.  We always sense him as being reformed, but Agent Kujan never describes him as anything less then pure evil.  This duality, which is never really explored, helps fuel the mystery.  The action is slick, moody and depressed, setting up the audience for the final revelation.  About the only real words for this movie after I've seen it are, ""Whoa"" and ""Wow.""  ""Whoa"" describes the movie's slow burn that never really flames out and ""Wow"" is the admiration for the great ending which ties it all together and lets the audience off of the hook. Probably the most subtle great movie I have ever seen.  If you are looking for grandeur, don't watch this movie."

","""The Usual Suspects"" is the greatest crime thriller ever made, no contest whatsoever.  The plot focuses on a cop (Chazz Palminteri), who interrogates the only survivor of a massacre on a boat, gimp Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey).  Kint tells him of a police line-up that happened two weeks earlier, and the story starts.<br/><br/>Members of the line-up are crime veteren Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), slightly psychotic McManus (Stephen Baldwin), clever Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and smoothie Fenster (Benicio Del Toro).  Each actor plays their part so well that you don't even recognize them.  Byrne looks more lazy than usual. Baldwin looks thin, and you forget that he's even a Baldwin brother.<br/><br/>Of course, none of these performances match Spacey's.

"mhoney-1","10","0","1","15 June 2003"," One ofthe most intelligent crime-thrillers ever!
","One of the my personal best as far as absolute favorites. The events leading up to a fateful night at a Los Angeles harbor are traced from the viewpoint of a crippled con artist from Queens. You never know how much of what is said is genuine, since the narrator is of limited intelligence and naive in comparisson to his former partners. <br/><br/>After securing immunity by the D.A., ""Verbal"" Kint is coerced into telling a New York-based Customs agent David Kujan about what happened between the line-up six weeks earlier, where he met his compatriots, and the night that a boat allegedly carrying narcotics was destroyed. Kujan has played somewhat of a Javert to one of Verbal's associates, Dean Keaton, an ex-cop from New York who was trying to go straight after a career as a hijacker, and settle down with his lovely attorney girlfriend--or so Verbal paints him to be. The other three, McManus, Fenster, and Todd Hockney, create an array of decidedly different people. Keaton, always the reluctant partisipant, spars often with McManus, a psychotic given to fits of violent rage, vying for the role of leader of the gang. Fenster, McManus' partner from before, is a mild-mannered Latino who tries to stay out of the way of things. Hockney is a mechanic and explosives expert who doesn't care about anyone but himself, but tensions flare between him and McManus as well. Verbal is sort of the odd man out: crippled so that he is limited in physicality, and inexperienced in the art of hijacking.<br/><br/>After pulling off a successful job in New York, the five men travel to LA to meet McManus and Fenster's fence, Redfoot. After a job goes bad they are conronted with a mysterious attorney working for a legendary gangster named Keyser Soze. The attorney, Kobayashi, charges them with one final job.<br/><br/>The story, as presented by Verbal Kint, presents one final question: Who is Keyser Soze. Keaton doesn't believe in him. Kujan believes Keaton IS him. And it ends with a twist that you may never see coming (unless you read between the lines of the reviews posted).<br/><br/>Gabriel Byrne plays the reluctant Irish cop with conviction. Kevin Spacey's Oscar-winning (and star-making) Verbal Kint seems the most mild and simple of people. Chazz Palminteri's David Kujan is perfect to counter the image Verbal describes of Keaton. Smaller supporting roles by Pete Postlethwaite, as Kobayashi, Dan Hedaya, as a restless LA cop, Giancarlo Esposito as an FBI agent friend of Kujan's, and Benicio Del Toro's sly Fenster (five years before he won the Oscar for ""Traffic""), help to give fully-fleshed characters to Christopher McQuarrie's already-rich storytelling, and Bryan Singer's (""X-Men,"" ""X2"") career-making direction."

I couldn't believe my eyes, it was funny, violent and it wasn't meaningless either because at the end of each story there is a message of redemption. Now it brings me to Usual Suspects. I didn't really know what to expect when I first watched it because it looked like it was going to be some prison movie.  Boy, was I wrong.  The plot just kept twisting and turning which kept me on the edge of my seat.  It was suspenseful and mysterious, the whole bit with Keyser Soze, it's gold! And the ending is what made this movie.  THe film truly has THE BEST ENDING in any movie ever made.  I'm not gonna ruin it for those who haven't seen it.

It's always fun to watch it with someone who haven't seen it just to see their reaction. And of course, great performances on behalf of Kevin Spacey (who's career skyrocketed after his role as Verbal Kint) and Benicio Del Toro (whose talent was recognized after his useless role as Fenster where he basically took a guy who only had like two lines in the whole movie and actually was able to turn him into a character that people care about after watching it.)"

Few illustrate this better than Al Pacino and Tom Hanks, who won Oscars in that decade for their inane utterances while the substance-driven competition was overlooked. Next we see The Usual Suspects, a similarly touted piece that does little to hide its loquacity, and even includes a ranting narrator named Verbal Kint. Sure there are duplicated moments of Tarentino gunplay where bullets and blood fly around, but that's the limit of the movie's action. After all, just when you are about to see someone particularly irritating be blown away (i.e. Kobayashi or perhaps Verbal himself), McQuarrie pops out and yells ""Just kidding!""

It tore the film down simply because there was too much blood and shooting, I didn't feel it was needed to move the story forward. The acting is good, Gabriel Brynes does a good job as Keaton, and I thought Kevin Spacey was very good as Keyser Solze, but I think he should have gotten more recognition for John Doe in Se7en and instead of getting a win for this movie, get a win for that. I think that Brad Pitt was much more deserving of the Academy Award then Spacey for his work in 12 Monkeys.

Spacey's performance can only really be appreciated with repeat viewings. And he is just the stand out actor from an Oscar winning ensemble, including Benicio Del Toro, Pete Postlethwaite, Gabriel Byrne, Chaz Palminteri, all at their peak. The on-screen chemistry is highlighted in The Line-up Scene, where a piece of editing makes history (It was originally an out-take which was later decided worked better than the original)... you'll see.<br/><br/>This is a film that is so well written that in every scene you find yourself grinning and yearning to find something out (half of the time you don't know what you want to know, you just want to know more). And you get it. All the time there is the story about 'who is Keyser Soze?' a mythical(perhaps) crime-lord around which the exposition is set. But you find yourself forgetting this while you are taken on a thrill ride of car-jacking, jewel robbery and murder, only for it to re-emerge at the end and hit you in the face with a sledge hammer.<br/><br/>If you like to guess the endings of films and feel cheated if you can't even though you were outsmarted, then you should still watch this classic at least twice.

","Ah, yes, ""The Usual Suspects"". My expectations were high, as is was called a ""masterpiece"" and received a 8.7 rating on IMDB. But, er, unfortunately, it just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The story line is not that intriguing.<br/><br/>The events are not that intriguing.<br/><br/>And most characters are even less intriguing.<br/><br/>All the alleged ""complexity"" (such as the shifts in time) is meant to make the story more interesting, but it cannot hide the blanket of shallowness that lies over this film.<br/><br/>The film is made in such a way that the viewer should care about the well-being and fate of a group of ruthless criminals. That's at least how I saw it. But I can't and didn't feel sorry for any of them, so it was hard to get attached to the events. But the ""real"" good guys, i.e., the cops, didn't manage to get hold of my attention either (they just talk, talk, talk about things I didn't really care about), so I didn't really emphasize with anyone, which makes viewing a lot less entertaining.<br/><br/>All in all, I find it quite hard to believe that this film made it to #16 in the IMDB list. Starting out with an initial ""6"" for being mediocre, I add 2 points for the surprise ending, although it's a ""stand-alone"" scene, which cannot save the rest of the film. Further, I subtract, in total, 1 point for (a) the extensive supposedly-tough-but-actually-quite-annoying-after-a-while use of the ""f"" word, and (b) the fact that this film features a ""Baldwin"".<br/><br/>Rating from the Dutch judge: 7 (out of 10)."
"rzajac","Null","0","1","21 January 2003"," Fine for the genre
","I guess my one-line summary is ""damning with faint praise,"" as the saying goes....  But I really do want to praise this movie.  It's one of the best films I'm seen in a while; smartly written, beautifully directed and shot. The acting is great.  I have to say that, while not as stunning as, say, the ending to The 39 Steps, the surprise ending to Suspects is cool enough.<br/><br/>I am a little surprised at how high Suspects is on the IMDb top 250.  But, in defense of those who would gladly see it ensconced there, I will add that ""heroic crook""-type movies tend to put me off.  It's very hard to humanize a crook in the movies as far as I'm concerned.  I see that Suspects holds these guys at a sort of arms length by highlighting an ultimate dog-eat-dog lack of honor among thieves, at the highest level.  So that salvages it a bit for me.  But, for example, Suspects doesn't come near the humanization of criminality that The Godfather does.  I saw that the movie Heat tried to cop some of that same prestige (by showing the crooks having happy family dinners, etc.), but for me failed achieve an integration.  I'm telling you; you'll always have a hard time convincing me to let criminal elements on screen into the tabernacle of my heart!  Godfather does this, and a look at how it succeeds could be instructive.  Suspects only succeeds to the extent that it doesn't make a pretense of getting you under the skins of the malefactors in that typical time-honored cinematic manner.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie as cinematic art.  I cannot recommend it as a movie that succeeds on a visceral level.  Which means I can only recommend it in a narrow sense.  Sorry."

Some people overhearing us said that the ending didn't make sense because he was hiding when Keaton got shot. As I to explained to them, what you see on the boat at the end, is what Verbal is telling the police, what you see on the boat at the start is what really happened. And other people didn't think Keyser didn't exist at all (which in a way could be true).<br/><br/>So in the end, we forgot about the Top 100 and just talked about The Usual Suspects. One of my friends simply said it was crap, he was 'politely' asked to leave.<br/><br/>To say that this film is crap is to be quite naive, as is to say this film would be nothing without the final twist. The final twist simply adds to it, it doesn't make it. What makes the film are the fantastic performances, the great chunks of clever dialogue and the characters.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey is one of my favourite actors and rightly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this film. Verbal Kint is quite a hard character to get right, because you had to be vulnerable, but at the same time be well.....*MAJOR SPOILER, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT* Keyser Soze.<br/><br/>Anyway, I love this film, well worth getting, on DVD if you can, because there are some excellent extras including two commentaries.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Another user wrote: ""The 'twist' ending was the equivalent of<br/><br/>finding out that everything up until that point had been a dream."" <br/><br/>Others wrote similar things.  I don't agree.  Keep in mind that Kint<br/><br/>testified before a grand jury, so anything that they could check had<br/><br/>to be true (e.g. the attack on the taxi cops, and Edie working on the<br/><br/>extradition case.)  He couldn't lie too much and still have a<br/><br/>consistent story.  So I believe that his story is supposed to be at<br/><br/>least 90% true.  Kujan figured out that Kint was lying because he<br/><br/>saw the names that Kint read off the wall.  Most of these, Kint just<br/><br/>used in anecdotes to build up his character.  The only one that he<br/><br/>worked into the story was ""Kobayashi.""  So that's one thing we can<br/><br/>be sure he lied about: the man who picks him up at the end is not<br/><br/>really named Kobayashi.  We should know that anyway, because<br/><br/>he doesn't look Japanese at all.  That's one of the few clues that<br/><br/>there's something wrong with Kint's story."

","The Usual Suspects is, quite simply, a masterpiece of cinematic intrigue and suspense. At various points throughout its runtime, it is almost disarmingly comic, action-packed and insightful, yet at any given point when the film seems to be conforming to the cliches of its genre, the director is merely toying with the viewer and laying the foundations for one of cinema's most memorable climaxes.<br/><br/>The plot largely involves a police interrogation of Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) as to the events between the meeting of him and four other prolific criminals at a line-up and an arson attack on a suspected drug boat six weeks later. There is a series of flashbacks detailing how the band became implicated in the labyrinthine affairs of the fearsome criminal mastermind, Keyser Soze. This character is particularly fascinating, in spite of - or perhaps because of - the fact that he scarcely appears in the film.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects benefits enormously from a lively (and Oscar-winning) script, especially during dialogue amongst the criminals themselves, but also because of the idiosyncracies of Verbal, who suffers from cerebral palsy. There are also several memorable acting performances, notably from Benicio del Toro, who steals every scene he speaks in with his bizarre and invariably profane accent.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are many weaknesses to this film, but the fact is that the strength of the conclusion is such that the viewer would be hard-pressed to recall them. The sheer originality of Bryan Singer's artistry overshadows any such flaws [Irish-American is one thing, but Gabriel Byrne's accent is surely closer to Bray than Boston]. The director preys on the assumptions and prejudices of the audience to draw it in, and as the final piece of the puzzle is about to be placed, the folly of these assumptions is exposed in spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>I feel anything further would be a spoiler so I'll conclude. Watch this movie, fall for its charms, take the bait and be utterly bowled over by what transpires. . ."

","Shame Hollywood isn't capable of making more intelligent films like this  - instead product placement snd lowest common denominator is the name of the game. Film noir with interesting plot and good acting. I guess Spacey as the lead tells you that perhaps not is all as it seems. He seems to often turn up as a bit of a psycho!"
"mightyjabbaatuni","8","0","1","6 July 2002"," Actors, script, director all present and correct. Excellent.
","Bryan Singer is one of a new wave of supremely talented Hollywood directors. The first film that he made a major splash with was 1995's The Usual Suspects. Taking it's title from a quote from the classic movie Casablanca, The Usual Suspects was pigeon-holed on it's release as a Tarantino-esque crime movie. Unfairly as it turns out for while Singer shares Tarantino's morally ambivalent attitude towards crime and criminals there are significant differences between the two directorial styles.<br/><br/>
Singer's work with his actors is excellent, drawing top-notch performances from an unlikely cast. Before the film was released Spacey was merely a supporting man, Stephen Baldwin was considered one of the lesser talents from his family, Del Toro was an unknown and Kevin Pollak was thought of as a comic actor first and foremost.<br/><br/>As well as having a superb cast and being really well directed on a small budget, the script is superb, giving the actors more scope to do their excellent work. When Spacey took the Oscar for best supporting actor, and Christopher McQuarrie won for Best Original Screenplay it felt like a vindication for crime movie addicts everywhere. To talk too much of the plot is to murder the film, it really needs to be seen as a fresh experience, with high expectations and a blank mind."

","I have never seen a film as close to perfection as The Usual Suspects. It is the epitome of class, from the cast, to the soundtrack, to the locations, to the script. The way the characters develop and the mysteries of the enigmatic Keyser Soze adds to the complex, but fascinating story. Excellent."
"chaseylain1uk","10","0","1","20 June 2002"," Sheer brilliance!!!
","SPOILER The great thing that I realised about this movie wasn't the twist that fooled every person who ever watched it, but the fact that you can't help but fall for it.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer knows what he is doing to the audience and doesn't give you the chance to try make sense of what is going on. The film itself though is complicated and it is this that adds to the mystery of understanding it. Also the fact that you watch this time and time again and think that you understand it when really you can't get over the fact that you've been had.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives a brilliant (Oscar winning) performance as the handicapped Verbal Kint, and you are shocked by the end when you come to the realisation that he is the infamous Kaiser Sosei, a name that has intrigued you throughout the film. Though if it weren't for the brilliant script and great direction the trick which has been played on the audience may not have worked at all. On the basis of this alone I would give nothing but praise for the film.<br/><br/>There has been no film of postmodern times that has pulled of a twist so good until this film came along. The only other film I would reccomend that does this just as well would have to be The Sixth Sense."

","Although I may seem sexist when I say this ( and I probably am being sexist) but women do not usually 'get' movies like this. I sat and watched the first 10 minutes with my Mum and we were so confused, we had to switch it off. An hour later I was bored again, so I thought I would give it another go and I am so glad I did.<br/><br/>I am not going to give away any of the plot, what I will say though is that the twist at the end is completely out of the blue unlike other predictable twists such as in The Sixth Sense. Again, the acting from Mr Spacey NEVER fails to impress me greatly and I am so pleased he won the oscar for his role as 'Verbal' because he totally deserved it.<br/><br/>If you absolutely hate films that skip backwards and forwards in time structure, have lots of characters and guns, then you probably won't like The Usual Suspects.

"tsatsas","10","0","1","4 June 2002"," Usual suspected review
","Bryan singer directs Christopher McQuarrie's unique story following 5 criminals, one dope deal, one ambitious cops search for the truth and an anonymous crime lord. The Usual Suspects gave the 1990's back those masterpieces that had those amazing ironic climaxes like in ""The Third Man"" and gave a new meaning to those movies that most people may consider ""weird', when in fact they just didn't understand a thing. The Usual suspects is not your usual film, and will probably need a second viewing in order to fill in the gaps in your mind as well as the questions that hit you time after time. What makes this film so great? Well the fact the story does nothing but puzzle you the entire 102 minutes. The last 2 minutes of the climax will leave most of your questions answered and you can lean back in your seat holding your head thinking ""what a great movie that was, but I think I have to watch it again cos there was something I didn't quite understand"".<br/><br/>Another thing is about the movie is the fact that no matter how many times you watch it, you always seem to pickup something you didn't quite understand or realize. The scenes don't get boring, the action doesn't just jump in at the opening scene, the films is filled with those catchy film dialogues that are nothing but great, and the climatic twist will leave most of you banging your heads with frustration because you had no idea what was coming to you. The well-chosen cast sinks into the plot and is so well constructed and believable that you're going to hope its all fiction. Are there a few words to describe this masterpiece? I like to believe there are a few for every movie. Ironic, suspenseful, mysterious, classic and cool. This film marked the beginning of a new perspective in the crime thrillers we all love to watch, and I strongly believe that it is a classic that we can all compare other movies too."

"Aragorn22","9","0","1","21 May 2002"," Outstanding plot, brilliant actor´s performances
","It tells the pretty complex story about a big robbery. There are five suspects for the crime and during the movie, everything gets far more complicated. The story is told by one of the suspects: the cripple Verbal Kint, which is played by Kevin Spacey. Spacey´s actor´s performance is so incredibly brilliant, that one would say he´s the leading star of the movie. But no: they all play brilliant! The actor´s performances of every single one person in this movie is really outstanding. The scene where Verbal walks into the office of the police officer, sits down and looks around is great! When you´ve seen the movie, you know why! As the story goes further, we learn that there´s one person who committed the crime: Keyser Soze. He´s a mythical person, who´s almost been never seen by anyone and is very, very dangerous. From that point on, the big question of the movie is: who of the suspects is Keyser Soze? So, the movie is a really `who did it' type of movie. Normally, those movies aren´t really original, but this one..really is original. The plot is one of the best I´ve ever seen and the ending is THE best ending I´ve ever seen. The most beautiful thing about it is that after watching it once, you want to watch it a second time immediately. The second time you watch it, you see it from a totally other perspective, because you know who did it. The acting is also in a double kind of way: some scenes can be interpreted in two ways (before and after you know). So, in sum, this movie is brilliant, one of the best ever. As a matter of fact, The Usual Suspects is rated 4th on my personal `best ever movies' list. Kevin Spacey is one of my most favourite actors, mainly for his acting in The Usual Suspects and American Beauty  (and let´s not forget The Negotiator and K-Pax). To people who didn´t see Usual Suspects jet: immediately run out of your house, get a copy and watch it, if you want to call yourself a movie lover, you really should´ve seen this one!!"

But I was seeing the end coming from quite a while ago.<br/><br/>I mean, in this kind of movies with a ""mistery man"", the guilty one is usually the less predictable. So here we have a crippled man (who therefore cannot be a cruel, reckless, invincible assassin), who is the only survivor (except for the comma guy) and moreover, who is the one telling the story! I had some bells ringing over me...<br/><br/>In fact, I was quite surprised with the first pseudo-ending in which we are told that Keaton is Kayzer Soze. In the last interrogation scenes I was watching closely Kints' arm to see if he moved it, or switched his paralyzed side (he doesn't).<br/><br/>And I'm not one of those who always predict the endings. It didn't happen in other twist-end movies such as The 6th Sense, The Fight Club or The Others.

"supertom-3","Null","0","1","12 May 2002"," The greatast mystery thriller ever made!
","The Usual Suspects is a low budget master piece. With a cast of actors that screams class, and one of the most superbly written scripts, this film delivers the goods it should. Bryan Singer directs, and it is obvious this guy had a vision, he carries out the film with flairy class and creates a tense and gripping movie that come the end will leave you with your tongue hanging out in gormless dis-belief with a longing to watch the movie over and over again. The film starts out with the five central characters participating against their will in a line up, they are all criminals but are arrested seemingly on a trump charge and they need to figure out why, together in a cell they plot to do a job together, and not a job you could call in any way legal. This is in fact all being told by Kevin Spacey's character Verbal, the films actual setting is in a police detectives office as he is questionning Verbal about a slaughter on a boat where over 30 people were killed. The film is mainly told in flashbacks about the events leading up to Verbals interrogation. From the moment their first job is done things gradually build in pace and the air of mystery sets in. Kobayashi is a mysterious man played by Pete Postlethwaite, who claims he works for a guy called Kayzer Soze, a man who may or may not be a myth but who sends shivers down the spines of those who hear his name, rumours are even that this guy may be the devil himself, it turns out that all the five guys in someway owe mr Soze and are required to rob the boat of a large shipment of drugs, nobody knows who soze is but they are scared of him. The film is pure genius, full of twists and turns of which you could only guess by taking a wild stab in the dark. The music is atmospheric, and the way the film spans out is excellent, the director gives you plenty of clues as to the identity of Kayzer Soze and the film has so much depth to it and so many levels. The fact is you never quite know if verbal is telling the truth, we hear the happenings from his point of view but he may be exagerrating or bending the truth, its only the very end when things become clear. All the actors are great, Spacey was worthy of his oscar, and he really impresses here, also Gabriel Byrne is on top form too. Also I must say i'm not a big fan of Steven Baldwin, I've never been too impressed with his films especially the incredibly lame sequal to the Flintstones which in itself was lame, but in this Baldwin is very good as Macmanus the slightly nutty, gun happy criminal. Also Benicio Del Torro and Kevin Pollock have some good roles and most of the humour comes from them. This film is a must see, it has one of the greatest movie plot twists ever. 10/10"

""The Usual Suspects"" is an intellectual and superb crime thriller with plot twists and wonderful acting all around, especially by Kevin Spacey who packs an incredible acting punch in this film.

","An ex cop named Christopher McQuarrie (or maybe he's an ex-detective; I read this somewhere but I don't completely remember it) gets an idea about putting five super-criminals into a police line-up.  He takes it to Bryan Singer, a director whom he collaborated with in Singer's first film PUBLIC ACCESS.  Singer says that police lineups never have five super-criminals, they have the criminal and four people who share a resemblance.  Then he thinks about it and says, wait a minute, under what circumstance would they be put in a line-up?<br/><br/>The result, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, is an enjoyable, twisty, thriller which is fun even as it entangles you in a complex plot, and then pulls the rug out with one more twist.  Curiously, I guessed that twist, then dismissed it out of hand, and then was proven right!  It did not stop me from enjoying it. It wasn't the best movie of that year (it was tied for #8 on my top ten with THE UNDERNEATH; ahead of it were LEAVING LAS VEGAS, NIXON, DEAD MAN WALKING, SMOKE, LE CONFESSIONAL, TWELVE MONKEYS, and THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY; behind it were ONCE WERE WARRIORS and SAFE), but it was the most fun.  This had a lot of comparisons to RESERVOIR DOGS, but whereas that excellent film was an ironic take on old heist films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS plays it straight.<br/><br/>Everything comes together perfectly here; direction, writing (which assumes the audience is smart), music (which avoids most cliches when it comes to thrillers), colors, and yes, acting.  All of it is top-notch, with of course special kudos going out to Kevin Spacey.  Without ever ""indicating,"" he creates a thoroughly believable cripple, plus he is a master storyteller, plus he's convincing both when he's defiant and when he's scared, or both, and when he's...but I should stop there.

While in jail, they plan a job together that will get back at the cops. Eventually this leads them out to California, and into the hands of Keyser Soze. A mythical crime lord. The whole movie is told in flashbacks, by Kint. He is the last survivor of the group, and is relating the tale to Special Agent Kujon (Chazz Palminteri).<br/><br/>This is a movie that must be watched several times to be fully appreciated. The first time I saw it, I was utterly lost for the first half hour or so of the film. Now, after having seen it several dozen times, I still pick up little things that I've missed. Special mention must be made of Kevin Spacey's unparalleled acting in this movie, which he won a best supporting actor oscar for.<br/><br/>* * * * - classic, see it right away"

","The maximun words for a message is 1,000 words.  I would need much more then that to say everything I have to say about this movie.  So lets start. Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie has given us the best movie I have ever seen.  Directors now try to copy the film noir of the 40's and 50's. The Usual Suspects comes closest.  The acting in this is superb.  Kevin Spacey delivers the second best performance I have ever seen (behind Sameul Jackson in Pulp Fiction).  Kevin Pollack, who usually does garbage like House Arrest, but delivers a funny performance here.  Pete Pothleswaite is brilliant as Kobayashi and Chazz Palmenteri is also brilliant in his role. The script is unforgettable and memorable.  The way the scene changes is great and always keeps you guessing is convincing.  All in all **** out of 4 and is well worth it.  If you're stuck in the video store, don't go get garbage like Godzilla and Armageddon but go to the thriller section and get The Usual Suspects.  I promise you won't forget this movie.  The writing is unforgettable and the ending is mesmorizing.  Only Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit has come close to beating The Usual Suspects for best movie but this is a gem that will always be number 1."

","This movie should be watched the first time for the surprise ending. It should be watched the second time for the clues and hints in the script. And it should be watched the third time for the clues and hints in  the cinematography. And you can watch it after this just because it is a great movie. You can sense the energy and vision that went into the creation of the movie. This is a movie that doesn't follow any formulas, in the way shots are done, in the way the script was written and acted and in the way it was conceived.<br/><br/>I particularly like the flow of the dialogue. Unlike many Hollywood movies, the dialogue isn't cut line by line. (This is usually done to aid in editing.) In ""The Usual Suspects"" many scenes are shot with the dialogue overlapping, heightening the tension in the movie. The is particularly true in the interrogation scenes.<br/><br/>Great movie!"

","The Usual Suspects is not just your usual film of crims and crime and blowing things up. The show keeps you involved as more revelations come to the fore. With plenty of all the action and thrill that makes a movie great, the Usual Suspects also has a wonderfully thick plot with a twist at the end that you'll never see coming. After watching a movie with a twist, most people say it is not worth watching again. This film does not fit into that category. Although you may know the ending after the first enthralling time it is great to watch it again and see how the producer has interlinked everything that you would not have noticed the first time around. And even after watching it a second time, the film is that wonderful that you can keep watching it and never be sick of it as so many other thriller/action movies do. To date, I have watched it over 20 times and have never been bored watching it. It rates in the top 5 of my all time favourite movies and is a classic."

Those of you who are disillusioned with the movie because you can't completely grasp the plot, I don't think you realize that that's precisely the point of the movie.

"Motoko","Null","0","1","5 December 1998"," Perfection On Screen
","Why do these things happen? Why is the Academy so scared when it comes to giving crime thrillers the awards they so obviously deserve? Pulp Fiction, Se7en and Suspects. All these films shpuld have won best picture or director Oscars but got palmed off with screenplay and supporting awards. Se7en didn't even get a nomination for anything but editing. There isn't enough justice. But I'm not making my point, which is simply that Suspects is one of the best films ever made throughout the history of cinema. Full stop.<br/><br/>It is one of the ultimate (notice I'm not saying 'the ultimate') combinations of style, acting, directing, script, editing, music, and plot. from the very moment it starts with the flash of a match to its final heart stopping, jaw dropping, spine tingling finish, it hits you from all sides with magnificence. The characters are so brilliantly acted, the scenes so stunningly played and the story so cunningly told that you hardly have time to catch your breath before given some more cinematic excellence to digest.<br/><br/>Chris McQuarrie desrves much kudos for his creation. The story is so excellent and the script so wonderfully spot on that it's hard to imagine anybody making a bad film from it. But it is Bryan Singer's magnificent control over every aspect of the film that truly delivers the goods. He trusts his actors (all of which give stunningly sharp performances) to tell the audience something with a glance that others would need 15 minutes of dialogue to say. The clues and tips he throws in throughout the movie are so glaringly obvious the second time round that you wonder how you could have missed them. And all the time he never loses the focus of the story. As Spacey said accepting his Oscar, if Soze does exist then it has to be Singer as he's the one that pulls the strings.<br/><br/>And then there is 'that' ending. The ending which will have newcomers gasping out loud and veterans smirking at the cleverness of it all. The ending that 100 years of predictable cinema has taught you never to expect has finally arrived and it was worth waiting every second for. The final line simply chills you to the bone.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that it was Suspects that deserved the awards that Braveheart got. The Academy will smugly sit back and tell us that the better film won. Those that have seen know differently."

None of the questions raised by the film are answered. Not in any reasonable way. The plot is a web of lies, which saves what is potentially the biggest lie of all for the very end.

I only know one person who worked this film out.<br/><br/>I think the depth Benecio brought to the film was a blessing - It always amazes me that he has so little recognition in the long run. Every role I see him play is so radically different, the energy, character, voice, gestures. He doesnt be the character on the paper, he is absorbed into the character in life.<br/><br/>Another class performance from Spacy... well another... by this point it wasnt another, but a class performance nonetheless.<br/><br/>Bryne is another underrated actor I feel, watching his shady Keaton in this film.<br/><br/>Direction... was any needed with half the cast?

I have now seen 'The Usual suspects' about five times and it still remains one of the cleverest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. **SOME SPOILERS** It starts out with an explosion at a harbor then jumps back six weeks to explain how this event came to happen. The story is told by Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey)and the tale he tells weaves across America from a line-up in New York to a harbor in California. The film constantly throws you red herrings and as each layer of the story is added the audience is tricked into believing a story which may or may not be true. The final revelation has to go down as one of the best plot twists of all time, leaving the audience feeling confused but that's the beauty of it, we then have to go back through the story, which parts are true and which are false. **END OF SPOILERS** The performances of all the actors in this film are incredible, Kevin Spacey was extremely deserving of the Supporting actor award, but the whole cast are fabulous: Gabriel Byrnes (Keaton), Kevin Pollack (Hockley), Benicio Del Toro (Fenster) and especially Steven Baldwin (McManus) are wonderful in this movie. This film is definitly one of my favorite films and I urge everyone to rush out and watch it.

","SPOILER<br/><br/>I read some other comments, and one man declared that The Usual Suspects lied to the viewers, and that it went against the whole basis of film making. The thing is, The Usual Suspects changed the plot diagram, lied to the audience, and yet not one line spoken, not one note in the music, not one camera angle, and not one element of the story is wrong. John Ottman's music is ideal. It is subtle during the building plot, and when you know Verbil Kint is not exactly Verbil Kint, well then the music hits off once Chazz Palmentari or however you spell it drops his coffee mug, and even then it is not too epic. The plot diagram was changed since there is a climax, then a short resoultion, and then another ending. First it is Dean Keaton, and then it is Verbil Kint. And the whole time the movie is a lie. The whole point was that the movie was a lie. We saw a story in a movie that never even happened. We can't even guess what actaully happened and what Keyser Soze did. But like in the end, we know Kobayashi exists, and that there is a middleman. Pete Postelshwate or however you spell it picks up Soze outside the police department. It is hilarious, but keeps a calm tone. The camera angles and the whole style is film-noir. And the best thing about it all is that it does make sense in the end. The more you try to figure it out, the more you do figure it out. I have seen the movie a thousand times and I know what happens. You watch it a thousand times, and you will know.

"hello world","Null","0","1","2 March 2002"," Worth Watching<<","Film Review<br/><br/>This film was by a relatively unknown director called Bryan Singer, who directed other films like X-Men, the science fiction classic of 2000. However, the relative anonymity of the director did not in any way hamper the popularity or the acclaim of the film. In many ways, the style is very similar to Tarantino's films, in that the film does contain many violent scenes, and is in many ways a look at the less shiny acclaimed side of petty crime. However, there is one crucial difference: in Tarantino's films violence is both society and media is explored in a very similar way to Stanley Kubrick, while in this film, violence is used as a dramatic device, i.e. to present the audience with visually impressive scenes. The story is seemingly simplistic, and is, in a break from cinematic tradition, told via the medium of a narrator, who narrates through the action, with frequent cuts back to him as a frame of reference. However, the use of a narrator does not hamper the action, instead it highlights the events you see taking place.<br/><br/>The film is based entirely on audience expectation. A mystery is presented to us, then unravelled, but, before the final piece is in place, it shatters every thing the audience thought they knew or understood. This makes it an unusual film, as twist endings, though fairly common, are never truly effective, except in certain films, and those all follow a specific formula, e.g. Hitchcock's Psycho, among others sets up a murder where the culprit is obvious, then proceeds to make you realise that nothing is really as it seems. The murderer is someone completely different, and the confidence built up in the audience is quite abruptly shattered. The very same idea is behind The Usual Suspects. The story told seems consistent, and seems true, but there are little details. Then, when all is revealed, you feel shocked, and almost tricked, but not in a bad sense. It has been said by many classical directors that a twist ending is shallow, and fake, and is not the true ending for a film which uses a mystery as a plot device. I do not necessarily agree with this view. While it is true that many films which use twist endings are quite bad: The sixth sense is an example, some of the best films have been made thanks to them, like the fairly recent film Memento, whose twists are fascinating."

It is not a film that is easily sussed.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro and Kevin Pollock work well together and Spacey fully deserved his oscar for best supporting actor. The script is one of those that on paper probably makes you think ""this will never work"" but it does and is one of the most complex films i have watched for a while.<br/><br/>It will always be remembered for the line up scene which was in a way a mistake as the cast couldn't stop laughing at each other but it was decided that it be left in, and this, along with the boat scenes, is one of the best scenes of the film.<br/><br/>The film has a perfect ending to match a perfect build up to the climax and should definatley be watched by all crime/suspense/thriller fans everywhere!!<br/><br/>ps. and anyone else for that matter"

Sure the twist at the end might not be completely concrete, but that's part of the film's charm.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's direction is visually gorgeous, giving the film a surprisingly classic feel; plus the action scenes are given a realistic touch.  The film is nicely acted -- Kevin Spacey shines as ""Verbal Kent,"" but the real joy is Gabriel Byrne, who makes a wonderful leading man. Christopher McQuarrie is a brilliant screenwriter, as he would prove again with his masterful The Way of the Gun."

Some movies (books, plays, etc) will shoot all over the place, trying to please everybody, losing its soul in the process. The Usual Suspects is so concentrated towards a goal it is enshrouded into itself, which is what a flawless work of art should be. The characters exist only for this story, it appears; the world the filmmakers create seems at once from this world and independent from any known point of reference, which is what any good avant-garde movie should claim. On a more down to earth, technical level, the rhythm and the editing look and sound like a piece of music which start with a slow bang, let you float for a while but never linger in limbo, rather make you wonder constantly, which is also what the acting of Kevin Spacey does so well. The five main characters feel they're being controlled by somebody else, but so will you: the filmmakers are leading you where they want. Singer is a master at manipulating the different aspects of the movie and, in the process, us. Watch it more than once."

It seems in my mind that the outlook on the part in general is one of cockiness, which is actually fulfilled through many other parts.  I feel that it deserved more attention to the concern felt for the job.  We are not fully given any reason to believe that this man's attitude is based on anything concrete.

It is not a breath of fresh air. It is a 450 mph -50 artic tornado hitting you full in the chest on a scorching hot August afternoon.<br/><br/>Here are a few examples of the questions I am have been dealing with. Even after all these viewing I have still come to no concrete conclusions.<br/><br/>The simplest of which is who is Keyser Soze?<br/><br/>Verbal tells a compelling story that the audience believes right up to the end, but Verbal admits he was in ""County (jail). I was in for fraud."" and Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) tells the group ""One of Mr. Soze less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam by a cripple."" Verbal makes a life out of telling believable stories in order to bend people to his will. Other than the Police line up and the boat explosion did anything else really happen? Maybe the rest of the team (Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin)) are alive, have split the money and are hiding out in Canada. Hey its Verbal's story, is it true or another con job?<br/><br/>Or is Verbal blowing a smoke screen to get out of prosecution? Agent Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) gives a clue ""A hex sign to keep people from f**king with you back when a name meant something."" After meeting Kobayashi, Keaton says, ""The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing"" or is Verbal using the Soze legend for window dressing.<br/><br/>Is Kobayashi really Keyser Soze and is Verbal one of his cronies? The only person who ever saw Kobayashi and is still alive is Verbal. If you believe Verbal's story. Did the pool room meeting ever take place? Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) cannot be asked if she worked for Kobayashi on the extradition proceeding.<br/><br/>Soze is not Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), he's dead right.?.  Is Keaton still alive and Verbal is lying to the cops to throw them off the scent? Do Verbal and Kobayashi actually work for Keaton?<br/><br/>If you figure it all out let me know. One thing I do know is that if I ever meet Christopher McQuarrie (who rightly received the Academy Award for best screenplay) I will give him such a slap for making me think so hard. Never before (or since) have I ever put so much thought into a film."

Verbal's statement regarding the line-up, ""Besides it was fun, I got to make like I was notorious""; Verbal's shape-shifting at the end of the movie (limp removed and hand straightened out).<br/><br/> Verbal ad-libbed much of his testimony to the special agent based on data he read off of the office wall bulletin board and from the bottom of a coffee cup, i.e., alias Redfoot, Kobayashi (there was a real being but his real name probably wasn't Kobayashi), Guatamala, Quartet - Skokie, Illinois, 'orca-fat guy', etc.  What really happened during those six weeks is anybody's guess but the fact remains that they did show up at the boat and attempt to destroy non-existent cocaine, kill and be killed 27 people, and attempt to collect 91 million dollars.  Verbal killed all three of his accomplices, note the statement by McManus, ""Strangest thing"".<br/><br/> The special agent lacked imagination and operated like any other cop, i.e., ""To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated, it's always simple. There no mystery to the street, no archcriminal behind it all.  If you've got a dead body and you think his brother did it, you're going to find out you're right.""<br/><br/> A brilliant script.

","spoilers:<br/><br/>Should this movie be considered a cheap-thrill-ending movie because there is no real allusion to the ending through out the entire movie? It's definitely arguable, because any director could put the exact same ending on any movie and it would always be surprising that a complex story could be simply ad libbed. I disagree however, and think that the confusion results from an unwarranted comparison between other trick-ending movies like 'fight club' and the 'sixth sense.' In these movies, the viewer's understanding of a seemingly simple plot is destroyed at the end. The movie is actually quite complex and there is trail of evidence supporting the new ending. Only the end-perspective gained can explain everything. But in 'the usual suspects,' both perspectives (Spacey telling the truth or Spacey as Soza) explain everything in the movie. The only reason the latter explanation is chosen is to demonstrate this. Comparisons between 'usual' and 'fight/sixth' lacks the relevant similarity in movie structure."

","There seems to be little debate between movie critics that The Usual Suspects is one of the great works of the decade and, finally seeing it for myself, I found out why.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects has very little wrong with it.  Bryan Singer's direction is flawless, and it is accented by a host of outstanding performances all round.  The characters are well written with significant development, and an outstanding aura of mistrust for each other in a time when they really should pull together.  Spacey and Palminteri play a great double act as the witness/interrogator, which provides the narrative for the film.<br/><br/>The narrative itself is very well thought out, giving the audience just enough information to not leave them completely in the dark, but not giving them too much, in order to keep them guessing.  The relatively complex plot could have easily gone astray with an overly complex narrative, but that doesn't happen.<br/><br/>The films main most powerful asset does lie in the well documented ending, which superbly edits together audio and visual effects to let the audience's jaw drop to the floor with disbelief.  It is a truly brilliant piece of storytelling and film making, and will no doubt inspire a new wave of inadequate copycats.<br/><br/>All in all, The Usual Suspects is a triumph for anyone involved with it, but maybe just lacks a little something to earn it full marks.<br/><br/>*********"

","(SPOILER INFORMATION, PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE!)<br/><br/>One of the most subtle clues to who Keyser Soze might be, can be seen in one of the scenes that shows the informant who is on the boat.<br/><br/>One of the shots begins with the camera focusing on a black brimmed hat and long black coat hanging on the wall.  The camera then moves down to show the scared informant sitting on the bed.<br/><br/>THE KEY IS; the hat and the coat are presumably the same clothing that Keyser Soze was wearing throughout the flashback scenes on the boat.  The director started the informant scene with this shot to SHOW us something!!!!<br/><br/>What this means is that whoever Keyser Soze is; he must have put on the clothing after entering the room and shooting the informant.<br/><br/>
1. We know it was no one working on the boat who killed the informant and later put on the clothing.  They were hired to protect him.<br/><br/>2. We know it wasn't any of the Usual Suspects.  Keaton and the rest of the crew were all killed.  And according to Verbal, he even saw Keaton being killed.<br/><br/>3. So, the only person left that could have entered the boat, killed the informant, and then put on the black hat and coat, would have been Verbal!<br/><br/>If you were quick enough to pick up that clue during the movie, it would have been possible to know that Verbal was Keyser Soze long before the end of the movie.<br/><br/>
That's my ""two cents worth""!<br/><br/>Any thoughts?????"

One of the responses that Fenster gives is ""It will flip you, I mean flip you for real."" My jaw immediately hit the floor. The line, the mannerisms, the timing were all taken from the quasi-documentary about Thelonious Monk's life, ""Straight, No Chaser."" Check out the Monk film and you will find not only the line, verbatim, in a restaraunt scene, but you will also see most of the mannerisms that Del Toro used in ""Usual Suspects.""<br/><br/>This rather obvious homage to one of my favorite musicians made me like Del Toro a bit more.

"patrick_hodges","10","0","1","30 July 2001"," One of the greatest crime dramas of all time.
","Dark, spooky, full of shadowy images and shady characters, ""The Usual Suspects"" is, quite simply, one of the greatest crime dramas ever made. The writing is sublime, the acting magnificent and the score is top-notch, all of which contribute to create a taut, tense thriller in which five hardened criminals are rounded up and dropped into a situation in which they are not only way over their heads, but from which there is no escape.  Kevin Spacey's Oscar-winning portrayal of crippled con artist Verbal Kint is masterful and truly well-deserved.<br/><br/>The entire story is told almost completely in flashback, as Kint relates the story of the death of his partners, and the events of the six weeks leading up to it, to the police who are interrogating him. At first evasive and vague, Kint begrudgingly hints to the existence of a faceless, seemingly omnipresent criminal mastermind, who goes by the (great) name of Keyser Soze.  Soze is painted as a master criminal and manipulator who is behind every facet of the tragedy of the death of Kint's partners.<br/><br/>For those of you reading this review who have not actually seen the film, and do not know about the ""twist"" ending, I will only say this:  I NEVER SAW IT COMING.  The moment of clarity that comes just too late is probably the single greatest moment in a truly remarkable film.<br/><br/>In a recent poll by Entertainment Weekly, ""The Usual Suspects was ranked #2 (just behind ""Shawshank Redemption"") in the category ""Best Film to Watch Over and Over Again"", and rightly so.  This film simply does not get old.<br/><br/>If you are a crime drama fan, you MUST make this film a part of your library.

","===SPOILERS, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE==> One previous review faulted The Usual Suspects because Verbal Kint's story is presented as factual, not as just a story...whoever that reviewer was, you missed the entire point of the movie.  Kint's story WAS factual, all of it was true.  He only made up new names to protect himself and Kobayashi. For example, the name Redfoot appears on one poster.  If Kint had used the fence's real name, detectives later on could have found Redfoot, interrogated him to find Kobayashi (we assume that is the employee of Soze that Redfoot did business with), and in turn they could have gotten to Soze himself.  Kint also used the cork board to make up the stories about the barbershop quartet and the coffee in Guatemala, that was just to fill in useless chatter (he is named Verbal...we see even Soze has a sense of humor) and make himself look stupid and innocent to the detective.  But the rest of his testimony really happened.<br/><br/>Another reviewer said that the movie doesn't give enough hints and clues as to the ending, and listed The Sixth Sense and Fight Club as better examples of movies with surprise endings.  First of all, the Sixth Sense and Fight Club made it TOO obvious, any moron could figure out the ""surprise"" halfway through.  These movies would be absolutely nothing without the ending. Hell, they were horrible even with the ending.  As for the clues, there were a few subtle hints in the Usual Suspects that pop up watching the movie a second time.  There is Soze's pseudonym Verbal, which I have already mentioned.  Also, in the sequence where they are conducting the assault on the boat, at one point Kint is standing behind one of his friends, I forget which, and his friend is trying to determine what language the people on the boat are speaking.  He has no idea, but Kint immediately says ""Hungarian"". How would a stupid thug living in America recognize the Hungarian language? Kint knows it is Hungarian because he is Kaiser Soze, a criminal who had his beginnings in Hungary.  Another clue is when Kint is waiting in the detective's office, and the detective is talking with his coworker outside. His coworker tells him that Kint is ""protected from up high by the Prince of Darkness.""  It is curious that a stupid, gimped, small-time criminal would have this much influence.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think that The Usual Suspects is a complex, but entirely plausible story who's surprise ending enhances the rest of the story, instead of serving as the only attraction, as in The Sixth Sense and Fight Club.  After seeing the Usual Suspects once, I instantly bought it on video and have enjoyed watching the entire film again and again."

Stephen Baldwin is just great.  He's funny and plays a great criminal.  Kevin Pollack, ome of the most underrated and talented actors of our time, is hilarious.  He plays the regular wise-cracking jerk criminal full of good jokes and fresh sarcasm.  Kevin Spacey is phenomenal.  He acts perfectly for the role he is supposed to.  Benicio Del Toro is great too.  He's funny and exciting in all of his roles, of course.  And of course there's Chazz Palmenteri.  He's great as the hard-ass detective trying desperately to solve the mystery the film centers around.  <br/><br/>  The non-linear order of scenes in this movie really works out well, and is never really confusing.  Non-linear timelines of scenes always add a little spice to the film.  This one works out perfectly.  <br/><br/>  And of course the plot is just awesome.  It's a great story for a crime/drama.  Twists and turns at every corner.  Surprises, fun elements added, etc.  The action in the movie is great too.  The gun fighting scenes are good too.<br/><br/>  Last but definitely not least is the great ending.  Bryan Singer just pulls the carpet out from under you.  It's surprising and simply awesome. And the ending scenes are truly classic.  Truly.  This is just a great film that deserves to be seen by everybody."
"Bronx-Bull","10","0","1","23 May 2001"," The greatest thriller of all time
","""The Usual Suspects""is the most ingenious film I ever saw and I must say that the director Brian Singer has been clever in his work particularly.Moreover Stephen Baldwin,Benicio Del Toro,Gabriel Byrne made a brilliant performance getting their best out and giving to their characters the wright strength,in fact all the characters have a different personality but they are complementary each other.What can I say about Kevin Spacey?...Unbelievable,just say that!He deserved 5 oscars for this movie and even more he deserved an oscar for his thirty minutes role in se7en. The Usual Suspects is almost perfect in his whole structure and I appreciated the fact that it includes all the perfect thriller features in a restricted time. The plot is very complex but it develops perfectly in only 105 minutes,no pauses,every sequence plays an important role achieving the great final.When you see this movie,you have to pay attention on everything happens very carefully if you want to taste the very end better.I must say that catching several details beneath is difficult before seeing the end and maybe even after, but everything looks strange has a sense. This is my favourite movie and it creates his own genre,an original one. After this movie your vision of things will never be the same 11/10"

","'The Usual Suspects is probably one of the best American movies of the decade.  At long last a film which is intelligent, complicated and doesn't treat its audience like idiots.  The cast is fantastic, with Kevin Spacey truly deserving his Oscar.  The film is stylish and brilliantly directed with the tension rarely letting up.  The twist at the end adds a great deal to the film.  This is particularly true if you re-watch the film as it is intriguing to consider how the twist is built up throughout the film.

"Katmiss","8","0","1","30 April 2001"," UNUSUAL, BUT A REAL CHEAT
","Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" is a good thriller, but how much you enjoy it will depend on personal taste. It has good acting (especially Kevin Spacey, who won an Oscar for this role), but it gets bogged down by it's plot and the ending is a real cheat.<br/><br/>Roughly, the film is one giant enigma: ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" We find the detective trying to figure out what happened during a heist gone bust: his only lead is Verbal Kint (Spacey) who weaves a tale of intrigue, double cross and even more questions than could possibly be answered during the rather short running time (108 minutes, it should have been about 30 minutes longer).<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is all style, but very little substance. Style can be a good thing: look at Brian DePalma's best films (Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Blow Out, Obsession). ""The Usual Suspects"" has an ending very similar to ""Dressed to Kill"", but Singer can't pull it off the way DePalma did. It just can't be believed.<br/><br/>But the ultimate letdown of the film is hardly Singer's fault: he does an excellent job of directing a rather choppy and labyrinthine script and he does it with such style and grace (along with Spacey's performance) that I find myself recommending the film despite my reservations.<br/><br/>
If you like to be confused and enjoy solving puzzles (like me), you'll like, maybe even love, ""The Usual Suspects"". But even those kinds of people will be compelled to say ""ENOUGH!"" after an hour and 20 minutes of this film.<br/><br/>

"bedazzle","7","0","1","29 April 2001"," cheap-thrill ending
","I remember when I was a kid writing stories. If I couldn't think of a good ending, you know what I'd do? Have the main character wake up in a state of heartbeating sweaty relief: Thank god it was only a dream... And you know what? The usual suspects has the exact same type of ending. The reason it is cheap is that this ending could be attatched to any movie whatsoever. There was nothing tying it together with the rest of the entire movie besides maybe a few seconds of Spacey looking at the police corkboard. If you want to do a surprise ending, you need to have evidence throughout the movie to tie it together. Examples are fight club and the sixth sense, regardless of their other merits, they definitely did the surprise ending the right way. You could watch the movie a second time and get have an entirely new experience. All along you're saying, ""ohhhhh, I get it now. That's why he did that."" Usual Suspects was not a great surprise ending movie, but it did have some respectable dialogue and characters. 7 of 10."

Benicio Del Torro was very entertaining and the biggest surprise of all, so was Baldwin; well maybe only during the line-up scene, but everyone was funny in there. but the real mystery for me was Kobayashi, is he supposed to be Japanese or what? because he doesn't look it. come to think of it, the ending is kind of a stretch"

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","1","2 April 2001"," Best crime movie. Ever.
","(spoilers) The Usual Suspects is one of those rare movies that comes along and takes advantage of all of the expectations that audiences develop as a result of an overabundance of formula films. One of the things that really sets The Usual Suspects apart from other crime films is that it has an excellent story, but it is also very uniquely presented. The whole film is told in a series of flashbacks by Verbal Kint, performed flawlessly by Kevin Spacey. The script has the rare quality of being extremely intricate but also very involving, you never get lost despite the tremendous amount of detail that the story has.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Benecio Del Toro shows up in one of his earlier roles as Fred Fenster, the character that, as Brad Pitt has stated, makes it okay to be incomprehensible (Fenster influenced Pitt's performance in the excellent film Snatch). Gabriel Byrne is the perfect actor to play the part of Dean Keaton, the usual suspect who doesn't quite fit in with the rest and who is temporarily revealed to be the fearful Keyser Sosey. Stephen Baldwin makes a good criminal, and his performance is very effective. And Kevin Pollack did a very good job as well.  On a trivial point, you'll notice that Keaton's hotel room in The Usual Suspects is the same room that was used as Quentin Tarantino's hotel room in the hilarious black comedy, Four Rooms.<br/><br/>The ending of The Usual Suspects has become known to be one of the best endings to a film in years, especially because of the shock value. Not only is it entirely unexpected, but it also reveals the ingenuity of the script, especially when we realize that Verbal fabricated the entire story, using names and locations that he simply read off of the wall in the room of the police station where he was interrogated. This ending has become famous enough to be re-created in a number of spoof movies. It was very amusingly done in Wrongfully Accused, but unnecessarily done in the idiotic Scary Movie. The Usual Suspects is an excellent film. It has great performances, good direction, and a flawlessly presented story. It's too bad that it's so rare for a movie to have so much thought put into it, so it's nice to see one come along every once in a while that just seems to do everything right."

","Having seen The Usual Suspects I have been telling my friends all about it. They prefer to watch dumb action films rather than 'talking' films. The Usual Suspects is a 'talking' film but the script and directing is so good that it is an instant classic.<br/><br/>It tells the story of five criminals brought together in a line up and decide to do some jobs together after their release. These Usual Suspects do a variety jobs with great success. This is all told by cripple Verbal Kint (Oscar winner Kevin Spacey) in flashbacks. As the story builds the question is, Who is Keyser Soze?<br/><br/>Singer handles the movie perfectly and the writing by Christopher McQuarrie is first class. As for the other actors they all give brilliant support. Stephen Baldwin plays psycho McManus, Gabriel Byrne is ex-cop Keaton, Benicio Del Toro is McManus' partner Fenster and Kevin Pollack is weapons expert Todd Hockney.<br/><br/>The film has an unbelievable ending which has to be seen to be believed. The Usual Suspects is one of the greatest movies ever!"

","This movie was absolutely incredible, I own it, have seen it a hundred times, and will never get tired of it.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey gives one of the performances of his life, and is backed by an amazing cast, including Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro before he was famous, Stephen Balwin in what is definitely the best role of his career, and Kevin Pollak, who is consistently hilarious.  It features amazing dialogue, sound editing, and I won't give away the ending, but it is honestly the best thing I've ever seen.  Chazz Palminteri is perfect as the cocky FBI agent, Dan Hedaya is on target as a NYC cop, and Pete Postlethwaite riveting.  There is nothing bad you can say about this film. It's too bad Christopher McQuarrie wrote such a lackluster script for his more recent film, The Way of the Gun.<br/><br/>The plot twist that ends this movie is great even if you are looking for it, but when it surprises you, as it surprised me, it is absolutely astounding. The theatre emitted a huge ""ohmigod"" when the film came to its final 15 minutes. The audience realizes what's happened as the characters do, and thus are drawn right into the movie.  This is the most original way to reveal a twist EVER. An absolutely original story, and worth it for the great performances alone. Rent it!"

"Leonard Shelby","9","0","1","23 February 2001"," Suspects, but not guilty
","The Usual Suspects is very different from the 99% of the films which are released every year. The difference lays on the fact that this film is an original piece of art. As Citizen Kane or The Godfather, this film proves that entertainment and quality can be combined, in fact, that they should be combined. Because when we are in a cinema watching a film we expect something more than guns shooting or explosions. We want the film to make us think, and even more, to surprise us. Because this is what cinema is all about. Unfortunately most of the films try to make this by means of endings which are very hard to believe, or by making a film visually strong. The Usual Suspects is very far from all that. The script of this film is one of the most brilliant ever written, but even more important, it's original. Because when seeing this film you realize you have never seen something like this before, and probably will never see it again.<br/><br/>The film is a very intelligent and complex thriller with a mixture of characters that confuse you until the end of the film. Still you are all the time asking yourself what is happening. It is only when you see it again that you realize that not only the plot is really good, but that the dialogues are excellent. This film is probably one of the films with more brilliant quotes. At the same time the actors are excellent, especially the five suspects. All this makes The Usual Suspects one of the best and most interesting films ever."
"eye3","9","0","1","20 February 2001"," Great; could have been greater.
","This movie should have been titled ""Keyser Soze.""  Like eponymous prop in ""The Maltese Falcon"", Soze isn't even mentioned until halfway through the movie but he comes to dominate everything and everyone.  Instead, we start off with the five title characters but soon it's not their story.  It's almost as if it were the start of one move and the last half (but not the end) of another.<br/><br/>The movie never lets up in building tension and new twists.  Events pile up on top of one another until every one is caught up in Soze's net.  You can almost see writer Christopher McQuarrie bahing on the keys and then stopping & asking himself, ""and THEN what?!""<br/><br/>Still, I have to wonder about that line ""The gretest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.""  It's great but it sticks out like a sore thumb.  If that's supposed to be a film-noir throwback (the great era for lines) then the rest of the dialogue should have supported it, or a wise-crack like in the film-noir era or it should have been the unspoken subtext.<br/><br/>Whatever your opinion on that line or the twist ending, you can't deny that McQuarrie earned his Oscar nor Spacey his."

Every time I watch it, I pull something else out of this movie that I have never seen before, and I have watched this movie about 50 times. ~Alycia"

","I liked it the first time I saw it, then when I thought about it, nothing made sense.  O.K., lets say Kevin Spacey's character made up the whole thing, then how come he includes Chazz P(the cop he's talking to) in his story.  What if we all could figure the plot out?  Does it really matter? Should we waste our time figuring out a stupid, confusing plot?  At the end we're left with two great performances, (Spacey and Del Toro) and nothing else, because the filmmakers' main interests are in plot."

","Wow... The Usual Suspects is definetely the best crime/police movie ever. It's absolutely brilliant, as plot, acting, directing, editing... everything.

","In the midst of the film noir revival that seems to have been sparked by the success of PULP FICTION, THE USUAL SUSPECTS turns out to be a really, really good movie with a strong script and strong performances. Most impressive, however, is the style in which it is filmed- it truly is a work of film noir, bested only by SWOON in it's deft handling of sticky, dark subject material, unlikely and unlikeable heroes, black humor and ultimately disturbing, edgy portraits of violence and the psychology of violence. Though in color, it still manages to maintain that dark, oppressive feeling of shadows and depression so essential to films of this nature, and the ending, even if you're not surprised (or someone told you what it was before you saw the film- as happened to me)is incredibly well executed and totally satisfying."

","Let me begin by saying I really enjoyed this movie.  Excellent plot, very good acting, good dialog, a mostly consistent tone, decent direction and music.  A rare combination and hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Only two complaints:  First, Maltin makes a good point when he says that seeing the corkboard ""negates"" the whole movie.  After this, I would have loved to see the Customs agent imagine some possible scenarios with actors exchanging roles in the events. This could be intercut with Soeze's accurate recollections, as he speeds away, of those same events.  Particularly telling would be scenes of him quietly nudging the felons toward his goals, or of slipping out to a pay phone to pass news along to ""Kobayashi"".  (What is his name, then?)  The best part would be to re-enact earlier scenes in different locations with different props and different actors in the minor roles.  Oh, well.  We are left to wonder whether even a quarter of what has been told is true.  All you really have to hang onto at the end is the ending.<br/><br/>But suppose we are not so skeptical, and while taking the narration with a grain of salt, we can take the flashbacks as literal truth (albeit selective recall).  I assumed that on repeated viewings I would see all the evidence to support the conclusion laid out in plain sight.  No.  The problem then becomes how to believe that all these events could have been orchestrated short of divine or Satanic intervention.  People are hard to wrangle, especially anti-social people like our gang.  Well, the more plot you fabricate the more chances for holes.<br/><br/>I have to say this movie does indeed work like a Swiss timepiece.  Just not the kind you wear.  Still, it does motor along to a big finale.  Soeze pops his head out and the show's over.<br/><br/>Very amusing and creepy, but a little heartless, as these things usually are.

Also the plot itself is huge: An internationally feared criminal terrorist who has an unseen web of associates murders 27 people on a freighter.  Now he emerges as a suspect to american law enforcement officers who cannot even confirm if he exists or not.  Their only witnesses are a burned survivor from the ship who claims it is the feared ""Keyser Soze"" and the least culpable member of the assassination squad who isn't really sure that Keyser Soze is alive or dead. Chazz Palmenteri is great as the badge-heavy/know-it-all fed as compared to the malevolent killer in Jade.  Suzi Amis is the moonstruck girlfriend that can see no evil (James Cameron left Linda Hamilton for her?!?!) and ruins her life for her felon boyfriend.

","Surely, if you haven't seen ""The Usual Suspects"", you know of the great reputation it carries. Well, it deserves every bit of it. It is simply a wonderful combination of inventive film-making, a great story, and absolutely wonderful acting (and casting, for that matter).<br/><br/>I'm not sure I've ever seen a film where every actor in the cast was this good, especially an ensemble cast. The absolute best scenes are the dialogue that occurs between Spacey (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but has the most screentime of anyone) and Chazz Palmintieri, who is really in his element as a tough-guy cop. He never seemed to feel right in numerous bad guy roles, and he  gives a great performance here as what I would term the most moral character. <br/><br/>There are a number of underappreciated actors who are excellent here. I've always been a big fan of Kevin Pollak, and this is by far his best dramatic role. The sam can be said of Stephen Baldwin, who luckily found time to be in this this between such forgettable films as ""Bio-Dome"". It was nice to see Giancarlo Esposito, who's another guy that deserves more acclaim. Dan Hedaya, who has had one of the stranger acting careers in recent memory (remember Nick Tortelli on ""Cheers""?) is fine in a bit role. This is the only role I've ever like Pete Posthelwaite in, and Gabriel Byrne and Benicio Del Toro round are very good as main characters. I mention all these people because they were all that good.<br/><br/>The plot is original, breath-taking, and engrossing. It takes you through twists and turns you never see coming, but never takes a turn that leads to complete unbelievability (a la ""The Sixth Sense""). The plot is so engrossing that the name Kaiser Soze has become part of popular lingo, despite coming from a low-budget film. The feel of the film, from the sets, to the lighting, to the actual dialogue give the perfect film noir mood.<br/><br/>Also - the ending is the absolute coolest (the best word I can think of) you're likely to ever see. It's and ending where you see it, and just kind of go, ""Wow."" <br/><br/>This film is easily my favorite movie, and I've seen quite a few.

They are then set to hijack a boat for the mysterious and sadistic Keyser Soze, a legendary underworld boss.<br/><br/>Without wanting to give too much away, there is a wonderfully unexpected twist in the tale, better than any from any other film and it will certainly have u reaching for the rewind button.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, go and rent it now!"

"JohnnyPHreak","9","0","1","29 July 2000"," A mind blowing action thriller that will keep you guess til the end
","The Usual Suspects is one of the most fantastic American films ever made. I don't know a person who saw it and didn't like it. This film has everything in a good film. It contains action, great dialogue, amazing performances, thrills and a ending that will leave you speechless. For those who haven't seen it I will summarize the plot without giving too much away. Five New York criminals (Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey) team up to pull off a couple of jobs but get much more than they bargain for when they find out someone else is a step ahead of them. Along with the actors above this film features Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Dan Hedaya, Suzy Amis and Peter Greene. Even though Kevin Spacey won an Oscar, all of the criminals should have gotten one. They were all in the same category and no one out shined another. This is a thriller so you will be guessing throughout  the whole thing. Plus, I can guarantee you will have no idea what is going on until about the final five minutes. The film jumps back and fourth between the past and present. Although you can tell which is which it doesn't help you figure out the story any better. This film has everything for every kind of person. This has been labeled under film-noir and crime drama it's not. This is a full blown action thriller. I put this at 5 on my all time favorite films. You you haven't experienced The Usual Suspects, please do. This is a can't miss film. And ask yourself one question, who is Keyser Soze?"

","In ""The Usual Suspects"", Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Kint (Kevin Spacey) are arrested for a crime that one of them may have committed and put in a police line-up.  A few weeks later, there's bloody shootout in the Long Beach harbor and Kint is one of the few survivors of what happened that night.  One customs agent, Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) is determined to find out what Kint didn't tell the D.A..  The conversation between Kint and Kujan is long and has a plenty of flashbacks.  The performances in this movie are played to complete perfection.  A few examples would be Spacey's that earned him a Best Supporting Oscar, Byrne and Palminteri, who should have earned at least a Best Actor nomination, and Pete Postlewaite is good as the middle man Koyabashi and maybe Keyser Soze.  John Ottman's spellbinding musical score, Newton Thomas Siegel's artistic cinematography, and Howard Cummings's colorful production design set the perfect tone.  The ending is a little bit questionable, but it's still good in a way."

Kevin Spacey's character unfolds the entire film via police questioning after a series of criminal events that he and his four ""friends"" just recently took part in. However, the tempo seems to come to a snail's pace in some areas, but since that is about the only disappointing thing that I can find in the movie, I am willing to easily overlook it.

","I suppose there are two types of reactions to this film: overawed by the terrific acting and direction while disregarding the utter impossibility of the plot, or concentrating on the ridiculous plot while underestimating the fine acting.  I'd like to think that I fall somewhere in the middle.  When I saw this film in the theater I was utterly riveted by the story and the fine performances turned in the by the entire cast (I'll add my own special kudos for Pete Postlethwaite).  Walking home from the theater, however, I began to dwell on the enormous logical problems presented by the story.  Now, logical impossibility doesn't necessarily prevent a film from being great (""The Big Sleep"" even confused its writers). SPOILER ALERT Ultimately, however, the ending here is not a surprise, it's a swindle.  Since the film is told, largely, from the perspective of someone who, it turns out, has been lying all the time, the viewer is left to wonder if anything happened the way it was shown.  To some, that's tantalizing ambiguity: to me, that's about as satisfying as an ending saying ""and it was all a dream.""  It's a lazy, desperate way for the writers to extricate themselves from a story that has outrun their powers of logical thought.  Too bad--it could have been a great movie."

In fact, it was actually kind of fun knowing the twist, because I could pay more attention to the way the twist was presented.<br/><br/>However, on balance, I wish I hadn't known -- my shock no doubt would have been similar to that I felt at the end of ""The Sixth Sense.""  All in all, ""The Usual Suspects"" is an extremely clever piece of filmmaking, if a bit convoluted at times.  Spacey is absolutely brilliant, fully deserving of his Oscar."

","What makes a film good? Incredible photography? Briliant Actors? Excellent plot? The Usual Suspects has all three of them. It is funk,sexy and cool at the same time. And ladies and gentlemen, that is hard to achieve. It all starts with a explosion (which was filmed at Bryan Singers backyard)where everybody dies. Only two survives. One is a burned-out bulgarian man who can only say Keyser Soze, the other is a cripple named Verbal Kint (played masterly by Kevin Spacey). It is a little difficult interviewing the bulgaraian as he is near death so it is up to Dave Kujan, a Customs interrogator to interview this cripple. What Verbal Kint gives him is a fascinating story of 5 guys trying to cooperate with Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) as the leading character in the criminal group. What Kint does is to<br/><br/>manipulate the other suspects in the group, heist-men Michael McManus (Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and Keaton. Kevin Spacey becomes soon the real hero of the film managing the difficult but not uncommon trick of really being the leading role when technically being a supporting actor. You could see this movie just for Spacey`s performance (he won an Oscar for best supporting actor). The film has some incredible Soundbites like: ""The Greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn`t exist"". This movie will have you on the edge of your seat.

","The first time I saw this film was 4 years ago, when it first came out on video. I saw it because of the unbelievable praise it was given by its audience, about half of its film critics, and its two Academy Awards. After I finished the film I was both shocked and confused as to what had happened. It seemed to me everything Verbal had said to Dave Kujan was false, or some of it false, and the only confirmed truthful events or persons we actually see during the course of the film is the setup (or lineup), Verbal's testimony to the DEA, the death of the suspects except Verbal, Verbal's lies to Kujan, Kobayashi's existence, and of course the fact Keyser Soze is Verbal Kint (or could Kobayashi be Soze?)... This all took hours to figure out, but then I thought, the movie is rubbish..it just cheats at the end.<br/><br/>Months later The Usual Suspects was screened on TV. I gathered the will to watch it again, and I watched it with the knowledge of what happens at the end. I learned SO much more. So many little details (like the history of Keyser Soze and Dean Keaton, and their questionable past relationship or rivalry). Also, I appreciated the movie for what it is before the twist at the end: a clever, mysterious noir with great music, editing, script, characters and acting. But I still didn't fully understand the ending and its link to the flashbacks. If everything which Verbal said was shown in the flashbacks, why did Verbal admit to killing the man with the case who Keaton couldn't kill? Wouldn't that make Verbal a confessed murderer (he got set free after his testimony)? This is probably the only mysterious flaw(?) of the film.<br/><br/>After the second viewing, I watch the film every two or three months when I have the time. EACH time I learn something refreshingly new. This must be one of the most carefully constructed films of alltime. When you think about it the film was giving you as many clues as to who Keyser Soze really is as as many tricks to making you think Keaton is Soze: 1) the order of the gifts to the five guys from Kobayashi, and the way the camera never shows what was in Verbal's package 2) the tone of voice and the evil look Verbal gives in the lineup scene 3) the misleading, obviously tricky way the film always depicts Verbal as the last guy who could be Soze (the weasel/cripple character, the constant jokes (""gimp, pretzel man"") made towards Verbal. 4) Verbal's crippled hand/leg sometimes changes from left to right throughout the film. 5) ""Soz"" in Turkish means word. Word and verbal a connection anyone??<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film, you shouldn't be reading this.. But if you have and couldn't understand it, read my post and see it again and again!"

Even so,  I was still not convinced I'd figured it out right, this is partly due to the wonderful performance by Kevin Spacey, which thoroughly deserves that Oscar he won for it.

","Dear friends of Internet Movie Database, finally I've found the time to write something about my movie. That's fantastic, a perfect portrayal of my life! Kevin Spacey worked very good in my part (and I contributed  with my ehm... influence, to give him the Oscar) and Chazz Palminteri made that detective Kujan much more intelligent than the real. The other actors, especially Gabriel Byrne, are perfect1 What? Did you believed that Chris McQuarrie, the screenwriter, had invented everything? That me, Keyser Soze, I'm only an invented character? Ah, ah! That's funny! Sure, a criminal like me, the more stays hidden, the more he lives, but I'm narcissist and so, I decided to show all my appreciation for this perfect and thrilling movie.

"Andrew-162","10","0","1","4 February 2000"," ""I can't feel my legs....Keyzer""
","This movie is one of the 10 best ever made. I don't mean entertaining, I don't mean shock, I don't mean thrilling, I mean BEST. I have seen many classic thrillers, but none of them are as beautifully crafted as the Usual Suspects. Without a doubt the best movie of the 90's. The movie starts with a bang--in this first scene, which takes place ""last night"", on a gasoline soaked, dead body-ridden boat which looks like it could go up in flames at any minute. Keaton is lying on the ground smoking a cigarette. A mysterious stranger approaches him:<br/><br/>Keyzer: ""How ya doing, Keaton?"" Keaton: ""I can't feel my legs....Keyzer"" Keyzer: ""You ready?"" Keaton: ""What time is it?"" Keyzer: ""It's 12:30""<br/><br/>You hear 2 shots, and the match is lit that sets the boat ablaze. As the mysterious stranger gets off the boat, it blows up. <br/><br/>And so the tale begins. A tale of five known criminals; Hockney, McManus, Fenster, Keaton, and Kint, who get set up by the police and end up plotting a scheme together. A tale of a cop, agent Kujan, who is Keaton's arch nemesis, and wants to make sure Keaton is dead. A tale of a petty thug cripple, Kint, who gets pulled in over his head and tells the entire story of what happened after the setup to Kujan. And finally, a tale of the mysterious drug lord Keyzer Soze who no one really knows about, but who seems to be pulling strings for the 5 criminals, for a purpose no one quite knows why.<br/><br/>The problem with the public opinion of this movie is that people focus too, too much on the ending, it's faults, it's qualities, etc. The ending, which I will not spoil for you, is great, and puts the finishing touches on one hell of a thriller. But the ending is not what makes the movie great, aside from the way it is handled. What makes the movie great are: 1. The performances by Pollack, Palmentieri, Postlethwaite, Baldwin, Del Toro, Byrne, and above all Spacey 2. The incredible twists and turns through the plot 3. The scenes masterfully crafted by rookie director Bryan Singer (which shows us some of the best movie direction since the Kubrick era, especially with the line-up scene) 4. The incredible score, which makes the intensity of the movie rise with every scene. 5. The way the last scene is handled--which is probably one of the 5 best scenes in movie history<br/><br/>This movie is the best of the 90's--and probably one of the 10 best ever. See it."

","I loved this movie. The plot is fascinating. Kevin Spacey (The midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) won an Oscar for his performance of ""Verbal Kint"", which is a great part and a very intriguing one. I did not expect the end and I have sent for the movie because it is a great movie. I trust the IMDB users ratings - They are right on the nose!  I got to a point now that before renting or buying any movie I have a look at the average vote for the movie at IMDB. This movie has good performances, great script, it keeps you wondering throughout the whole movie. My favorite quote:  Verbal Kint: ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" Verbal Kint: Keaton once said, ""I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him. Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze."" My favorite scenes: When the police officer screams down the street: Look out for that crippled man. There is no crippled man? What crippled man? This is a 10 movie. It is a must see!!! Brilliant!!!"

In fact- It wasn't until I saw the film for the second time that I actually figured out All of the details...<br/><br/>The movie is really a great one. Surprising to the very end, Captivating story, well written script and good narrating by Kevin Spacey. I couldn't find even one dull moment about it and I actually saw it 5 times now (today being number 5 as it was shown on cable).<br/><br/>The story is a simple one - There was a big car loaded with guns that was stolen. 5 suspects are arrested, all of which happen to be well known villains. While spending time in the incarceration cell they begin to form a plan to rob an organization ran by crooked cops.<br/><br/>They soon find out that them being arrested together was no coincidence and that a bigger, higher power is behind everything...

In fact the shock ending in someways detracts from the rest of it and that is why I probably enjoy it more on repeat viewings. The first time I saw it, in the cinema, all I could think about when I came out was the ending. Repeated viewings make me appreciate the whole film for example the editing, particularly in the final sequence, the script ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the World that he didn't exist"" and of course the totally mesmerising Kevin Spacey.

I'll admit, I'm a sucker for a good ending and this is one of the best I've ever seen. No happily-ever-after sugar-coatedness, no 'lets end this as fast as we can' mentality coming from the script, just a brilliantly written simple semi-cliffhanger.

"BB-15","8","0","1","6 December 1999"," A Solid but Typical Mystery/Thriller
","The Usual Suspects is a good mystery/thriller. There is fine acting, the script is clever and the film is well made. While there were not that many surprises for me because the movie was fairly mainstream, I had a good time watching it.<br/><br/>The Usual Suspects works because of a great performance by Kevin Spacey and a script that has some good plot twists and hops around enough to different places and times which keeps the viewer off balance. Gabriel Byrne and Chazz Palminteri are also good in supporting roles.<br/><br/>I said before that that there were not many surprises for me with this film. This is because The Usual Suspects follows some typical plot formulas for these types of movies done in the last few years. You know that the brightest person in the movie will be a criminal, the cops are corrupt and some crook will get away with the big crime. Since 1970 this has been repeated over and over. The flashbacks didn't confuse me much because of all the practice I've had watching Goodfellas, Pulp fiction and Out of Sight.<br/><br/>
For me, I prefer the approach of The Godfather and Goodfellas with this type of film. This is mainly due to these Mafia movies being pretty well grounded in reality. While watching Usual Suspects I thought if these people were so clever, they would not be petty criminals.<br/><br/>Overall The Usual Suspects is well worth watching. It is not great but it is certainly entertaining."

My father remarked after seeing it that it must have been written by a foreigner, or be based on a foreign medium, because no American could write a movie like that. Lo and behold the screenwriter's from New Jersey, a stone's throw away from here in Brooklyn. I myself have watched The Usual Suspects about four times and during or after each viewing I pick up something else. The ending...that last twist is really the coup de grace. This movie is almost like a television series in that you can watch it again and again, and each time something else clicks, some little clue is discovered. Kevin Spacey and Chazz Palminteri are the two that should be given the lion's share of the acting credit for their seemingly endless intense dialogue always shared in the one setting."

The script on film was good, but not as joyously original as Toy Story or Carrington.<br/><br/>  Comparisons abound between this film and LA Confidential.

For example, take another movie with a surprise ending, The Sixth Sense, after you see it a second or third time, to fully appreciate the ending, you wouldn't want to sit through the whole thing once more.

","Upon the first viewing of TUS, I considered this would just be a potboiler rip-off a bunch of modern day TV cop shows. It had that cliche ('stupid police officers, foul mouthed crimminals, etc.) at first. But halfway through, it turned out to be the most taunting suspense movie in many a moon. <br/><br/> Kevin Spacey redefines his acting career in this. If he never played the role as Verbal, his acting life would of lasted for about 5 years before skyrocketing down to skid row.

If you want a fantastic mystery (well, it's not too much of a mystery because you-know-who's name gets top billing) then rent this. Watch it. But don't see it with people who talk too much. You'll miss everything. A DVD viewing should bring you back to the days when cinematic film noir was still maturing..."

","THE USUAL SUSPECTS begins with a shadowy figure murdering a man named Keaton, whom we do not know yet.  The mysterious person then sets a wharf and ship on fire.  Dozens of people are killed.  While one police team tries to get information out of a badly burned survivor who cannot speak English, Detective Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interviews the only other survivor, a shy, crippled nebbish called Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey).  The rest of the story is told by Verbal in flashback as Kujan interrogates him. <br/><br/>
Verbal starts the tale six months ago, when a truck is hijacked, and the police round up five hardened criminals, the usual suspects, to place in a lineup.  Verbal runs scams; McManus and Hockney (Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollak) are a team of armed robbers and safecrackers; I'm not sure what Fenster (Benicio del Toro) does, since his accent is so hard to understand; and Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) is a crooked cop trying to go straight. None of them gets arrested for the hijacking, but McManus proposes a team robbery while they are together, and thus an impromptu criminal team comes together.<br/><br/>Both Verbal and the Hungarian survivor think that the mysterious figure of Keyser Soze, a legendary criminal, is manipulating the five men behind the scenes, especially when Verbal tells how an emissary of Keyser Soze (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches the team and coerces them into doing a job for him.  Soze is never expressly identified on screen, leading both the audience and the characters to wonder whether he really exists, and if he does, if he might not be one of the characters we've already met.<br/><br/>THE USUAL SUSPECTS gets most of its mileage out of the device of Keyser Soze; not knowing who he is lends a lot of suspense to the sordid goings-on. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT became a huge success for only one reason; the production team remembered that the unseen and imagined is more terrifying than anything that can be shown on screen.  THE USUAL SUSPECTS takes advantage of this same principle.<br/><br/>The movie's ending is its raison d'etre; even if you have guessed the identity of Keyser Soze, you will be some distance short of anticipating all the last-minute twists that the script visits upon you.  It does leave you picking back over the movie trying to sort reality from illusion for some time thereafter.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, THE USUAL SUSPECTS isn't a really superb thriller, because the team of Verbal, Fenster, Keaton, McManus and Hockney just doesn't contain a single sympathetic character, or even a particularly well-drawn one.  The audience doesn't have much emotion invested in what happens to them, or whether one or any of them is the mysterious Keyser Soze. Intellectually, the film is pleasing, but abstract; there's nothing at stake that really matters to the viewer.<br/><br/>In the acting department, everybody is good, and Spacey and Baldwin are excellent.  Director Bryan Singer sets a steady pace, not as fierce as a De Palma, never mind a Hitchcock, could have produced, but without ever really being boring.  John Ottman's music is exceptional and Singer applies it to the scenes very well.<br/><br/>A thriller movie that makes the viewers think is a rare exception to the rule, and so THE USUAL SUSPECTS is enjoyable.  Could we please have one that makes us feel, too?<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of ****."

","with a movie planned and executed as cleanly and perfectly as the usual suspect was, it would seem that watching this movie more than once would be a tedious event. in fact, the reality is that it could be no lesser than the truth. my first viewing of this movie was admiration for its storyline and the killer ending. the second time i saw this, i admired it for the way this movie was made. it would almost seem to be an arthouse mainstream film.<br/><br/>the casting was absolutely perfect and there would be no other actor in my opinion ever, to replace the original five criminals.<br/><br/>in my mind...the five crimes all live on forever."

","I watched this film the first time with two of my friends on a dare. One of our classmates had challenged us to guess the ending before it was revealed -- a premise which has doubtlessly accompanied many people's reccomendations of this film. So we bit, we rented and we settled in.<br/><br/>About halfway through, one of us had fallen asleep (not me, by the way). It seems the plot hadn't been enough to keep him going, so he politely excused himself and drove home after being woken by a few onscreen gunshots and not knowing or caring where they had come from. My remaining cohort and I were a little more interested in the goings-on, but not by much. The thriller, as it was billed, wasn't that thrilling after all.<br/><br/>Then the twists started twisting. As the plot thickened, I noticed my friend was inching off the sofa and toward the television. Then I noticed I was, too. Suddenly this collection of seemingly unrelated incidents got pretty darn related, and we were outguessing each other for the final ten minutes of the film, in silence, motioning as friends do with that invisible sign language, ""It's him! No, it's him!""<br/><br/>Needless to say, the ending paid off, and we popped the rewound video exhilarated. Sure, we'd lost out on the bet, but at least we'd had the fortitude to make it through what turned out to be one of the most compelling films of the nineties. It didn't start out that way, and my primary qualm with the film is that it does take awhile to build up a head of steam, but what a head it ends up with."

It's because the ending will keep you up all night wondering what really happened and trying to interpret the movie for what you think it meant. Anyway, on with the plot<br/><br/>The story starts out with an encounter on a boat (Which happened the night before when the movie takes place), between Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne in a wonderful performance) and a mysterious stranger. The encounter goes like this.<br/><br/>Stranger: ""How you doing, Keaton?"" Keaton: ""I can't feel my legs...Keyser"" Keaton: ""What time is it?"" Stranger: ""It's 12:30"" The stranger then pulls out a gun and you hear two shots.<br/><br/>
Flash back to 6 weeks ago when Keaton, McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benecio Del Toro), Hal Hockley (Kevin Pollack), and Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Kevin Spacey) are all pulled in to be questioned for the hijacking of a truck full of armed weapons. Since they all have had a history of hijacking, detective Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri) questions them for the crime. When the 5 are held together in an isolated room, McManus proposes to them a huge hijacking gig that requires 5 guys. Eventually, they all agree. Then flash back forward to present day, when there are only 2 survivors in a huge boat explosion. One is Verbal, and the other is a hungarian in a coma. Verbal is granted immunity for his testimony, but Kujan still wants to have a little chat with him. He eventually gets his way, and Kujan forces Verbal to tell him the story of what really happened. Since Keaton has been Kujan's nemesis for years, his main motive in grilling Verbal is to make sure Keaton is really dead. As Verbal tells his story, a gigantic story of crime, betrayal, and blackmail unfolds, and the name Keyzer Sozé comes into play when the other survivor wakes from his coma and starts shouting Sozé's name. While detective Jack Bear questions the survivor, Verbal tells Kujan the story of Sozé, who Spacey says is a ruthless criminal who can not be caught (""Keaton always said that he didn't believe in god, but he was afraid of him. Well, I believe in God and the only thing that scares me is Keyzer Sozé."")<br/><br/>
This ensemble movie could not possibly be better acted, scripted, or directed. Though the ending leaves some flaws in the story, it is extremely satisfying.

If you've never seen it, don't let anyone tell you what happens, because this is one of the best endings you will ever see.<br/><br/>I cannot think of anything remotely lacking in this movie.  The acting is incredible.  Kevin Spacey gives an incredible performance as the quasi-lead (the story is told from his perpsective, but he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), and the ensemble cast is great.  Gabriel Byrne pulls off the dignified, gentleman robber well.  Stephen Baldwin is in his element, the best he's ever been, as a raging phsyco (makes you think, huh?).  Kevin Pollak is outstanding as the cool guy, and Benicio Del Toro fits in right as a sort of Jekyll to Baldwin's Hyde.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also excellent, with a lot of character actors you'll remember from other movies turning in performances of a life team.  The plot is second to none.  It goes slow enough to let you think you've got it figured out, with enough action to keep you interested, then simply pulls the rug out from under you with a spectacular ending.<br/><br/>The last five minutes of this movie are among the best in American cinema.

","If only one movie was chosen to be placed in a time capsule to represent the 90's, it would be this one! Not only the movie but the script and the soundtrack would be in the time capsule! Not since Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, has there been such a great ensemble cast. (With the exception of L A Confidential. Which was released after this movie.) Suzy Amis, Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Pollack, Pete Postletwaite, and last but not least the Superb Kevin Spacey, all turn in stellar performances! The movie has the feel of a 1940's film noir classic. And the mood is set deeply by the moving soundtrack scored by John Ottman. The film name comes from the classic line delivered by the late, great Claude Raines ""Round up the Usual Suspects"", from Casablanca. Christopher McQuarrie's script takes you on a roller coaster ride from the point of view of one of the five suspects brought together for a police line up. The line up hatches a plan for a heist as they wait to be released from police custody. From that point on we are led through a labyrinth of intrigue, danger, and mystery! All of them fear one name, ""Keyser Soze""!!! You can almost smell the sweat when the men are blackmailed in to working for him. One simple job and they will be even with him. Or will they? The story is told by cripple Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, (played by Kevin Spacey) as told to FBI Agent Dave Kujan (played by Chazz Palminteri). The scenes between these two are a joy to watch. The chemistry flows across the screen. No matter how many times I view this movie, I am always left spellbound by their performances, the story and the delicious ending! Kevin Spacey won an Academy Award, too bad they don't give one for best ensemble cast. I won't reveal the ending, but I do have to say that no matter how many times I view this movie, I still get chill bumps! No one acts better with physical prowess than Kevin Spacey. It is said that he actually glued his fingers together to bring realism to Verbal's disability. Let's just say Spacey is the premier actor of our time! Who is Keyser Soze? Rent, no better yet, buy the movie and watch it! ""And like that.....(phfft)...You'll know!!!!"

"PopMuse","10","0","1","20 August 1999"," One incredible film...
","One of the best crime dramas ever, period. This movie is even more impressive considering its Brian Singer's directoral debut. Although he employs a few techniques from the tired box-of-suspense-tricks, they never seem cliché with this screenplay, and Singer wields them brilliantly. The one scene that sticks out in my mind is when Keaton sees Edie working in Kobayashi's office, and they abort their operation. The camera focuses on Keaton from behind the glass, while Kobayashi's reflection is cast over Keaton's image and John Ottman's stirring score plays. Beautiful, just beautiful. The plot is so thick you could cut it with a Ginsu, and it's delightfully confusing to the point where even after its ending (the best suprise of any movie in recent memory, though Ottman probably spills the beans about 30 seconds too early by teasing us with a quick clarinet) you'll be impatiently rewinding the tape to see it again, and you'll enjoy the dramatic irony even more. The screenplay is stellar, and the acting... well, the acting is uniformally excellent with no weak links sticking out whatsoever. The secret to this movie is to see it once, sleep on it and allow yourself to get even more confused, and then watch it again for answers. No movie has as much replay value this one. On balance, if you like dark drama (this is not quite noir) with a hint of evil conspiracy and lots of twists, served on a plate of suspense, the Usual Suspects will not disappoint. It is the Sgt. Pepper of its genre."

"shattenjager777","10","0","1","29 March 2004"," A mountain of praise for a more than worthy film
","""The Usual Suspects"" is the prototype for crime thrillers everywhere and does it perfectly.  The opening scene immediately pulls the viewer into a world that is somehow not the real one and grabs his or her attention completely--something that will not let up throughout the rest of the film. We get clues to the shocker ending (which I consider the best surprise ending in Hollywood history), something of Dean Keaton's (Gabriel Byrne) character--we can even tell he's something of a Byronic hero, something of the idea of Kaiser Soze--a perfect example of how the body cam imply the character without any dialogue (I know he does have some, but the sense of the character that we get is before that), and preparation for the film's climax all in one small scene.  It's no wonder Christopher McQuarrie wrote the entire script to reach this scene, as it is perfect.<br/><br/>McQuarrie's script is an absolute wonder to behold.  The characters are all wonderfully vibrant, alive, and separate from one another; the storyline is full of wonderful twists and turns everywhere; the dialogue is wonderful (including a grand total of one pop culture reference); and the ending is unbelievably great.  I don't think there's an uninteresting character, unnecessary scene, or out-of-place line (except for the one pop culture reference) in the entire film, and that must be credited to director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely superb.  Stephen Baldwin seems out-of-place in his somewhat annoying performance of Michael McManus.  Kevin Spacey is of course brilliant (and how in the world he's a supporting role, I don't know) and Gabriel Byrne every bit as good in multi-layered performances--having to portray multiple emotions in single shots in order to make the plot work* (I'm avoiding spoilers, so you'll have to watch it to see what I mean). Kevin Pollack was a surprise scene-stealer as Todd Hockney, who is very much the opposite of Pollack's other major role, Lt. Sam Weinberg in ""A Few Good Men.""  Chazz Palminteri and Pete Postlethwaite gave wonderful smaller performances as well.<br/><br/>*SPOILER EXAMPLE:  Look at Spacey when we first see him in Sgt. Rabin's office--is he just looking around bored or is he calculatingly looking for things to use in concocting his later story?  SPOILER ENDED<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's direction is wonderfully unobtrusive.  Rather than load the film up with Oliver Stone-like odd editing, he just gives us some strange angles (especially in the interrogation by Kujan) to show us some small details and otherwise keeps it rather simple.  Singer knows that his actors and screenplay are going to put the film across without him doing much and so him doing much will just make him get in the way.<br/><br/>In all, a wonderful masterwork.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Just be warned that there is a TON of swearing, but it's a near-perfect film."

","Who's Keyser Soze? That's the question everybody's asking in this dark, film noir which led the way for other movies like L.A. Confidential, Snitch and The Rat Pack. Writer Christopher McQuarrie introduces us to five low-life criminals who come from all walks of life.  Stephen Baldwin is the hyperactive, resident hot-head, McManus.  Comedian Kevin Pollak is the cynical explosives expert Todd Hockney; the terrific character actor, Benicio Del Toro plays Fenster, the slack-jawed hustler but the men who steal the show are Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, a crippled, little man who is interviewed by Chazz Palminteri as to the whereabout of the infamous former cop, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne). McQuarrie explores the themes of friendship, death and avarice. Certainly a film worth much more than it's many Oscar nominations."

"J.J.-7","10","0","1","19 June 1999"," crime classic is not good just for its great ending
","""The Usual Suspects"", in the words of one reviewer, like good wine, improves with time.  Time meaning repeated viewings.  In my case, that means about 17 times.  However, I believe too many people do this to look for clues which hint towards the 'answer.'  Not to say I didn't do this too, but the ending does NOT make the movie, and the excellent direction and editing by  Bryan Singer and John Ottman respectively, along with the performances should be 'studied' as well in repeat viewings. Without giving away the ending, I'll try to explain.  Singer does an incredible job balancing between the present and past so that the dialogue-based film (with little action at all in all present scenes) never seems long-winded.  I've read Christopher McQuarrie's final script and read articles about the film, and Singer edited the script well so the film keeps its fast pace.  His direction is especially good in the famous 'revealing' scene.  Singer is credited by McQuarrie for thinking of using earlier dialogue combined with camera shots for maximum effect and density of ideas. And there are some great ""low shots"" (those who've seen it know what I'm talking about).  Ottman edited this sequence beautifully , along with other scenes, especially on the pier. Though I've taken some credit away from McQuarrie's Oscar Winning script, I still love it.  He keeps the very large cast of characters multi-dimensional (Tarentino and Altman are two of the very few who did it better in other films).   The conversations between Spacey and Palminteri are awesome, (""And like that... he's gone"" ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist"") and of course the story is incredible. Last, I saw this at first because it had Kevin Spacey and it had good reviews, so naturally when I re-watch it I really appreciate his layered, multi-emotioned, Oscar-winning performance.  The casting of comedic actors in the three supporting criminals, especially Del Toro, who is great, is effective.  Byrne and Palminteri give great performances. British actor Pete Polstelthwaite gives my favorite, and most memorable performance of the chilling Kobayashi. If you haven't seen it do so, if you have, do the same."
"Fortune-2","Null","0","1","17 June 1999"," A brilliant movie
","Yes, this movie is full of obscenities and violence.  Yes, it does have a confusing plot (I'm still not sure I've got it all, after 5 viewings). However.  The acting performances given by all of the Usual Suspects are amazing (especially Kevin Spacey, aka Verbal, ""the gimp,"" etc.), and Bryan Singer outdoes himself in his wonderful direction, artistic and gripping at the same time.  The writing gets better with every viewing--some truly classic one-liners and realistic dialogue as well.  But what keeps me watching this movie is the ending.  I won't spoil it, but those of you who have seen the film know what I'm talking about.  One of my favorite movie endings EVER (especially the last, split-second camera shot, the last two words spoken, and the cello chord at the very end).  The ending makes repeat viewings almost necessary.  For me, the second viewing was better than the first, because you realize what great acting and dialogue adds to the movie. See it a couple times--you won't be sorry."
"Movie-12","10","0","1","15 June 1999"," Great Film that could have been Greater. **** out of ****
","""The Usual Suspects"" is like a giant across movie landscape. Throughout film history no other thriller has so thoroughly captured an audience's attention and then massacres their predictions of something they never knew to begin with, then placing them into a state of wondering just what has happened here. I'll tell you what, I see over one hundred movies a year and this is one of the best, most imaginative and involving I have seen in my life.<br/><br/>The movie begins on a gloomy night in the past, featuring a boat heist gone wrong as an injured man named Keaton lies on the cold hard cement. Then, slowly and quietly, a misty image appears. He walks up to Keaton and shots him twice with a gun in his hand. Now, the story beings, so read carefully.<br/><br/>Six weeks ago: five men are arrested, they include Verbal, Hockney, Fenster, McManus, and Keaton. They meet in a hilarious police-lineup, and decide to plan emerald robbery. Keaton, at first unsure of himself turning back to the face of crime, but then later on chooses to be included after all. The heist is pulled of perfectly and leads to another where a drug dealer named Saul is killed, but the robber is successful.<br/><br/>However, after the five men's success is at its top, a mysterious, tall man appears calling himself Kobayashi and explain to them that the notorious Keyser Sose demands that they do a boat heist docked in San Pedro Harbor, which turns out to be an extremely dangerous mission in which no one believes that all five will live, but those who do will inherit immense rewards. Fenster is resistant and is then found brutally killed on a beach. The rest then plan to kill Kobayashi and his men, but he again gives the upper hand on the four men and blackmails them into doing the robbery against their will. One survives.<br/><br/>That man is Verbal, a cripple, who tells though a police questioning and flashbacks the story above, to a cop named Kujan. He explains who Keyser Sose is: At first we meet him as just a clam shadow smoking a cigarette as he kills a man helpless and confused. We then here about him in a legend, a man  who would rather murder his own family than has them live another day in sorrow. Later we see his towering power and reputation, a murdered man on a beach, an accused killer freed by high stakes agents, a boat filled with professional mercenaries found burned with nearly everyone killed. Then, alas, we see him for a last time, as a man who has been in front of our faces the whole time, and in the end, slips right though our fingers, never to be seen again.<br/><br/>Keyser Sose is a brilliantly achieved villain, perhaps one of the most inspiring ever developed, but we never actual see his face, only in the end? So how can we care about someone whom we never see. No body has ever seen God, but everyone fears him.<br/><br/>The dialogue is explicit, detailed and profane, wonderfully written and order. The characters are not your typical movie people, but realistic low lives, who break many rules of act breaks, antagonists protagonists and present day formula. This is a near flawless film.<br/><br/>Near Flawless? Yes, there are a few unanswered questioned aboard ""The Usual Suspects."" For instance, Why don't we see Fenster being killed? Or why does Kujan let Verbal go after admitting to killing Saul? Or why don't we see Keaton's girlfriend being killed? So many important events are only talked about, never seen.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacy needs to be nominated for best actor of the century and most certainly is on my list for the greatest performer in a leading role of all time.<br/><br/>""The Usual Suspects"" is a movie that I believe everyone, age appropriate, should experience. While sitting in my lazy boy screening this movie I felt something. Something that only people who are emotionally touched by movies feel. It is a feeling in which for two hours your life stops, and the experiencing of another begins. The chemistry between the viewer and the film itself here is indescribable. This movie will continue to haunt us forever, not just because of the great script it had but also for the better script it could have been."

","This film takes a mystery and turns it every which way but loose. It takes all 105 minutes to soak this movie in, and even then, a second viewing only enhances the experience. Expertly directed, brilliantly written, and extremely well cast, ""The Usual Suspects"" is the product of a film maker carefully studying and recreating what does and doesn't work when keeping an entire audience suspended with curiosity.  If this movie is a valentine to the classic film noir mysteries of the 1940s and 1950's, then we could use a few more like it. As a treat, rent it along with ""L.A. Confidential"". That way, whenever people say, ""they don't make 'em like that anymore,"" you'll know that they do."
"HAL9000-16","10","0","1","28 May 1999"," A Masterful Crime Thriller
","Not only is The Usual Suspects 1995's greatest film, but it is also the 2nd greatest film of the 1990's, next to Saving Private Ryan. It is also one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. It is an exciting, brilliant crime thriller with a powerfully, fascinating, Oscar winning screenplay, on target direction from Bryan Singer, superior ensemble work by the leading cast members, and an excellent suspenseful musical score.<br/><br/>The film is about what happens when five career criminals are brought in for a line up by the NYC cops. They decide to make use of their time by bringing down a few corrupt NYC cops, and then flee to L.A. One of the members' fence gets all five of them hooked up with another job, however they soon become entangled in a deadly mysterious mission organized by an unknown mysteriously evil crime lord who calls himself Keyser Soze, and for the rest of the film the viewer is left on the edge of their seat trying to figure out who this mysterious Keyser Soze is.<br/><br/>Another bonus for this film is the acting. Gabriel Byrne gives an excellent performance as the hardened career criminal trying to go straight, or is he? But, the film really belongs to Kevin Spacey in an Oscar winning role as the talkative cripple, Verbal Kint.<br/><br/>Nothing is quite as it may seem in this mesmerizing crime thriller masterpiece, and if you love crime film as much as I do, then The Usual Suspects is a must see."

","Plot (no spoilers): Five men are brought in a framed line up. Police guestions them, and no-one will talk. They decide to do a little ""f**k you"" to the police. This story goes to the past, told by Verbal Kint, a cripple member of the gang. There are one name that keeps coming up:Keyser Soze, a Hungarian criminal, who's the Devil himself.As the story goes, we learn what this man has to do with the story... I admit it- at the first time I saw this film I didn't really understand it.(You know WHY did something happen or WHAT exactly just happened) All this because of one reason-I didn't follow it from the first minute and didn't think about anything. I thought that by watching it I could spend one boring afternoon doing nothing.That was my mistake. To understand ""The Usual suspects"" you mustn't lay your eyes off the screen. Everything (well ALMOST everything) in this film has a meaning. So,as I said I didn't get it very well at the first time so I watched for a second time. The film goes on and you find yourself watching every second of the the film-and loving it. The actors are great-especially FANTASTIC Kevin Spacey(he got Oscar for this role) who plays Verbal Kint. Film's dark music fits to the movie perfectly-actually everything in this movie is perfect.10/10 One of my favorite movies ever."

"Sickfrog","10","0","1","14 August 1998"," The Best Film of 1995
","This film came out the year after ""Pulp Fiction"" altered the view of film -goers across the country. So, for about the next year, any film that came out which included extreme violence and humor was immediately deemed a rip -off of the film. And so, ""Usual Suspects"" was written off by a large audience as simply being an imitator of ""Pulp Fiction."" However, any person who has more refined artistic sensibility can see that the comparison was almost completely ludicrous. ""Usual Suspects,"" a precise mystery-thriller -drama, hardly has any resemblence in mood, plot or genre to ""Pulp Fiction. "" And as for those who may say that the film is a ripoff of ""Casablanca,"" it is obvious to see that why the film does pay homage to ""Casablanca"" with the title, once again, mood, plot and genre differ vastly.<br/><br/>   What ""Usual Suspects"" does offer is one of the most well-executed mysteries seen in modern cinema. Kevin Spacey's character is the key to this execution. Having the story told from his perspective allows him to deliver the events exactly as he wants them to be accounted. The way this film manipulates the audience is simply uncanny. And when it not only shocks you once, but twice in the end (though I won't say how), you know that this film was one of the best cinematic experiences that you will have in your life. <br/><br/>   Truly, Spacey's intricate performance must be viewed multiple times. I have seen the film maybe four times now, and I still keep stumbling upon little nuances here and there. There is not one bad performance by all of the principle actors in this film. A personal favorite is that of Benicio Del Toro as Fenster, a hilarious performance that gave the film its best quirk and certainly leaving you wishing that you got to see more of this character. <br/><br/>   And so, without a doubt, I will state that I think it was a monumental err that the Academy did not nominate this film for Best Picture, and even if it was, I would call it a great mistake if the movie had not won. I would also like to express my distaste at the fact that this film was not even in the qualifying 400 films list for AFI's Top 100 Films list. It certainly deserved the honor."

This is precisely the type of film that you may want to see more than once. Not to mention the interesting audio commentary from the director and writer, certainly two of the easiest guys to listen to, as they point out the errors and short comings in the film which you probably didn't notice because you were enjoying the film so much.<br/><br/>The performance by Kevin Spacey is truly Oscar worthy, and it was pleasing to see him receive it. All of the other cast members delivered excellent performances as well.<br/><br/>The moment when the audience discovers who Keyser Sose really is at the end, is arguably the best part of the film. It's the sort of resolution that you always hope for and often do not receive, but in the case of ""The Usual Suspects"", the ending is a big pay-off. Part of what makes that possible is a captivating story line and excellent acting. I never hesitate to recommend this film to anyone, and I've never had to apologize so far."
