"LikeAn_Angel","7","112","132","14 February 2008"," Dialogue laughable...Dancing beyond incredible
","As with the last user who commented, the reason for this score was purely the dancing. Now, to be fair, the acting abilities of the two main characters was average...even above average at times...though not stellar. However, their dancing was freaking SICK. I've seen a lot, and some of this freestyle was off the charts incredible. The only reason that I went to see this movie, in fact.<br/><br/>Briana Evigan (Andie) is an amazingly talented dancer. Her acting was actually not that bad, I was pleased. Robert Hoffman (Chase) was the typical charming, blond-haired and privileged pretty-boy...with an edge. His dancing was phenomenal, they were both exciting to watch. Their chemistry together was enough to make it hard to tear my eyes from the screen. If the trailers entertain you, and you're a fan of dance see this movie. Though the plot is weak, and the dialogue laughable, the dancing is enough to make spending your $8 on the ticket more than worth it."
"GibMart7","6","76","102","16 February 2008"," Dancing Makes The Movie
","I actually thought that the movie was pretty good. It's not as bad as the reviews that it's getting, just don't go in expecting to get an Oscar performance. The storyline was a little all over the place. Typical teen dance movie. BUT the dancing is amazing couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Robert Hoffman did a decent job, he really lays the charm in throughout the whole movie. The dance scenes make the entire movie. Ethnically, it is such a diverse cast of people, there is someone for everyone to identify with. The soundtrack is insanely good also. By the end of it you will be quoting lines and wanting to dance for sure."
"debikal","7","51","67","23 February 2008"," See it for the dancing!!
","The story lacks substance, but I did not see the movie for story... I saw it for the dancing and the dancing was great. I love all dance movies though. This was definitely the movie with the best dancing, but not necessarily the best storyline. Take the Lead was a better story, but the dancing could not compare. The new characters were cool too. They had pretty good chemistry. The movie kept me totally entertained the whole time even though it was totally predictable. Like I said the dancing was what I wanted to see and I was not at all disappointed. The last 15 minutes of the movie made it definitely worth an hour and a half of my time. If you like dancing you'll love it... if you don't then you won't!"
"petya_89","8","53","71","26 February 2008"," It's not that bad!
","Alright, it doesn't have what it takes to get the Oscar.... BUT I personally liked the dancing scenes, actually I was amazed by them ...! In my opinion the movie deserves the 8 points, after I read how hard was the shoot of the last dance .. in the rain... and after I saw the movie and the great dances I think this movie deserves a High opinion... <br/><br/>I would recommend it to people who want to get away for an hour and a half.. I enjoyed every minute of it.... the actors had some weak points, but all in all they did a good job to present the protagonists in the movie and they did a GREAT job with the dancing scenes!"
"sampodog","8","43","58","18 February 2008"," Way better than I expected!
","I certainly didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I figured the dancing would be fun. My expectations were exceeded, WAY exceeded. Sure it has a predictable plot and it's nothing more than a right-side-of-the-tracks/wrong-side-of-the-tracks love story (Pretty in Pink, West Side Story, Romeo & Juliet, etc.), but the dancing was really incredible. I'm way older than the target audience and yet I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>If you're looking for groundbreaking plot, acting, or directing, you won't find it here. But the acting/directing was just fine, and the dancing was stellar. If you're concerned with the acting, I guess that would be like going to an action movie and judging it based on the acting rather than the action."

","A rebellious street dancer named Andie, part of Baltimore's most intimidating dance crew, the 410, who is given a chance to attend the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts. She finds it difficult to fit into her new school life while keeping her friends from the 410. Determined to prove her skills, she assembles an eclectic crew of classmates that includes Chase, the schools best dancer, to compete against the 410 in the premier underground dance battle in Baltimore, The Streets.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed Step Up, although the plot was clich√©d and predictable, but the dance moves were good. Now picture that, times TEN! Anyone crazy enough to see this movie for the plot should not see this film. Why would anyone see this movie? The dance moves.<br/><br/>There are double the dancing sequences and double the greatness! I was won over by it. The charming two leads and the lovable characters add as the cherry on top. The plot? There's nothing there. Been there. Done that. However, if you set your expectations right, you'll be surprised to turn out that you like this movie.<br/><br/>Obviously, if you're an older person, you may not like this movie as much as if you're a teen. Of course, the demographics for this movie is to attract teens. All in all, this is about a notch or two better than the original, but plotwise, it's the same. Watch this movie for the dances. Not the plot. Otherwise, the piece is entertaining."
"asznballa10","6","54","78","20 February 2008"," Best dancing ever seen but horrible acting and script
","A movie like step up 2 or almost any dance movie for that matter typically has poor writing/script and nothing beyond decent acting. the whole point of these movies is to take your breath away with dance moves and step up 2 does just that. trust me when i say this, the last scene of the movie is one for our generation, one of the best dance scenes in any movie, creative and different it will shock you. i thought stomp the yard had good dance moves and it did but this movie actually outdid that movie. i normally do not like dance movies, i did not like you got served, one of the worst movies ever made possibly, i did not like step up 1, etc. it starts slow to be honest and in the beginning it's nothing that you or i haven't seen before but everything comes together in the end and its great, the last scene and the dancing is what makes the movie and worth the price of admission."
"LeonardMonichi","5","27","38","23 March 2008"," not bad at all!
","I didn't expected this movie to be much fun, but it was! The story obviously wasn't that great and the ending was predictable. But this movie didn't pretend to be ""intelligent"", it never tries it! The story is told clearly and there aren't to much unnecessary scenes. The dancing is good and there are various funny scenes! Everything a entertaining mainstream movie has to have. The acting is mostly OK, no major problems found, although there are a lot of stereotypes used in the movie (the handsome white guy, the envious ex-girlfriend, the ""Looser"", the ""bad"" black guy,...). But which movie doesn't have them? I also like the soundtrack, a lot of good tracks can be hear with great dancing performances. This movie deserves 5 out of ten points!"
"britt46","8","77","126","18 February 2008"," wow,,,
","You guys over analyze...sit back and enjoy a great movie. I guess you have to have a passion for dancing to enjoy it but if you don't then just don't ruin it for anyone else. We don't sit here and make fun of your little horsey movies or little car movies, everyone has their own likes and dislikes and if you enjoy dancing you will enjoy the movie. The actors/actresses are portrayed as very skilled dancers in this movie and you eyes will be glued to the screen. Both Step Up movies have GREAT choice in characters because the lead roles in both films are gorgeous. Both girls and guys. I am a big fan of dancing movies in general, and these two both top my list. Ignore the bogus comments. Definitely worth watching."
"darkloveforever_101","6","43","68","17 February 2008"," Moderately fun film
","""Step Up 2 the streets"" is a movie that is for a fun, ""no-thinking"" outing. The sequel to the popular ""Step Up"" was obviously not as good as the first (sequels and prequels never really are) but it was a fun film to watch.<br/><br/>There was a few good comedic scenes, and the street dancing really was incredible, especially at the end of the movie. This kind of movie is obviously going to be a little bit predictable and cheesy, but still- it's fun to see with some friends on a Saturday night.<br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack really helped improve the movie; there were many excellent, cool songs playing throughout the film, such as ""The Way I are"" by Timbaland and ""Low"" by Flo-rida ft. T-Pain.<br/><br/>If you give it a chance, you may enjoy it. It depends on whether or not you enjoy feel-good, funny dance movies. If not, then don't go see it! The final verdict: Step Up 2 is a moderately fun film."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","4","4","19 December 2008"," The Usual Story But Oh the Choreography, Oh the Dancing and Oh the Energy!
","'Step Up 2: The Streets' follows a typical storyline of an 'underdog' striving to make it and in the end overcomes all obstacles and succeeds. The dialogues are passable, mostly the typical lines. But, what makes it so entertaining is the incredible dance sequences, amazingly choreographed and superbly performed by the actors/dancers. The film is full of energy and excitement. Break dancing (well, dancing in general) is something that has always intrigued me so the film kept me engaged throughout. The acting is adequate. Briana Evigan is a talented dancer and not a bad actress either. Her other cast members dance well too. The soundtrack boosts of adrenaline guiding and giving voice to the dance moves. In spite of the done to death storyline, I enjoyed this one. Anyone interested in dance should watch this."
"MMcCSLH","Null","12","16","20 February 2008"," Predictable but still enjoyable film
","I did not see 'Step Up' so I will not base this review on the back of the first one. Somewhat in the same vein as 'Honey', 'You Got Served' (sic) young oriented dance movies, I found the same general feel to 'Step Up 2'. A range of mediocre acting, phenomenal choreography and dancers, simple and predictable plot and morals of the story.<br/><br/>Predictability <br/><br/>1- Ballet is boring, it is (usually) depicted as bland and too 'classical' in a film of this genre to young folks. The main character Andie is essentially a street non-professional hip hop dancer, does not know how to interpret the classical music she is given by her teacher, thus continues to do the style of dancing what she normally would to hip hop music; its cute and funny. Later on it shows that all forms of dance make one great versatile dancer.<br/><br/>2- Stereotype main character is a White girl. Not too many complains here, because I was surprised to see they did not make it known or emphasis that fact that she was white, who was enthusiastic about hip hop and street dancing. She was just there along with all the members of the '401 crew'.<br/><br/>3- Mean black people. This one never fails. We have the angry high tempered black male of 401, and the supportive black girl (Felicia) that always stands behind her friend, but later loses her patience and finally is fed up and gets an 'attitude' (whether constantly covering up for Andie's absences was necessary or not is objective).<br/><br/>4- Foreign accent student of any ethnicity. Jenny Kido has funny one liners, although the humor mostly depends and derives from the broken English of said person -- basically doesn't really have any real dialog throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>5- Cute Hispanic girl who from time to time speaks Spanglish. Missy whose family is almost painfully stereotypical, said a few phrases in Spanish in the beginning of the film, and wears stand out looking clothing.<br/><br/>This was the first movie I ever saw where I subconsciously knew what was happening next during some moments envisioned in my head, it seemed. Still, 'Step Up 2' was better than what I expected it to be."
"labsjoao","1","32","64","15 February 2008"," Atrocious acting mixed with thin plot and countless clich√©s...
","I can not begin to describe how awful this movie was. Even worse than its predecessor, Step Up 2 manages to be even more predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen from the first ten minutes. The script was ridiculous. The story could not have been more clich√©. The movie tries to have many subplots but it fails to achieve an enjoyable storyline. The movie paints a very unrealistic college and street dancing life, and that is fine, but the problem is that this movie tries too hard to make it seem real.<br/><br/>They attempted to throw some humor in this god awful hideous picture when they portray an Asian foreign student and ridicule her for her accent and lack of correct English language. There was some cool dancing but honestly, it wasn't nearly enough to save this movie. The low rating says it all."
"RebeccaWood","6","4","5","29 February 2008"," It accomplish exactly what it was supposed to...
","I would write about the plot here, but seeing how there isn't really one, I find that pointless. This movie is basically about one thing: Awesome dancing. If you walked into this movie expecting anything else, then you walked out severely disappointed. I, thankfully, expected this movie to be a strenuous two-hour music video, and, it having gone above and beyond my expectations, walked out completely satisfied (in fact, I saw it twice). <br/><br/>Step Up 2 presented some of the most amazing street dancing sequences that have ever appeared on film. The final dance literally had me leaning forward in my seat, as if I were watching a high-intensity fight or chase scene. <br/><br/>And come on. I've heard a lot of complaints about the acting. I thought the acting was not too bad, especially since they initially had to find really good dancers...that happened to act. Comparably speaking, I wouldn't say it was any worse than, say,the acting in Jumper, which was fairly horrendous at times *cough*Jamie Bell and Hayden Christenson. <br/><br/>Basic summary:<br/><br/>Highlights: The video that the new crew makes for the streets. <br/><br/>The characters Moose and that hilarious Asian chick. <br/><br/>Latino dance scene <br/><br/>And, of course, the final dance scene.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because this is a film quality grade, and, as a film, it wasn't spectacular. However, Step Up 2 accomplished just what it intended to do: create an awesome excuse to show off amazing dance moves for almost two hours. In fact, it passed with flying colors."
"pregnantreplies","7","16","29","14 February 2008"," Yes, horrible acting but stunning dance moves
","This movie gets a 7 in my book, and sure some of you may find this overtly and outrageously generous but I'm commending solely the power of the climactic dance scenes. This movie, just like Step Up (towards which I have similar feelings) has some of the most atrocious acting I've ever seen, and the ill-placed jokes were slightly less than totally idiotic. The tried-and-true method of uncanny coincidental run-ins is getting a little worn, also. So if you manage to ignore this crucial mistake, I promise you may actually enjoy the vibrant twists and turns of some of the best choreography I've ever seen in a dance film."
"sarahalub","2","10","17","20 April 2008"," step up 2 the script
","Its a film about dance...but unlike the 80's, where films about dance were, although not that great, loved due to their element of campy fun, (I'm sure 'Footloose' wasn't intended to be a groundbreaking reflection of the struggles of American youth)step up 2 is actually just a really bad film, which happens to be about dance. Kind of like when they make a really bad film which happens to be about rapping, or a really bad film which happens to be about gangs...its in that vein of things.<br/><br/>The first problem lies with the fact that this film is actually called 'step up 2 the streets' and lacks punctuation in the main film title (very thankful for IMDb to actually use the initiative to include a hyphen). Anyways the 'film' itself is crying out for one key ingredient...a script. They say that there's only a certain amount of story lines in the world, this film very much backs up this theory. I wonder, where have i seen this scenario before? Save the last dance? you've been served? Honey?...no seriously my mind's gone blank...where could a dance-off/turf war/love story combo have possibly been included in a movie before? curious.<br/><br/>Apart from the storyline/characters/dialogue epitomising everything I could possibly loath in a movie neatly rolled into one, its the reverse racism in this film thats my main problem. Did the makers not think 'hmmm...we might offend young black men by portraying them as controlling, criminal, aggressive members of society who's only purpose in life is turf war..but hey, why not take the risk'...which they did, and unbelievably enough it also manages to be racist towards everyone..young white kids too... by making the entire cast look like illiterate baggy-trouser-wearing ridiculous-hand-gesture laughable-one liner idiots.<br/><br/>The horrific use of slang is mind-numbingly awful, and the wardrobe guys really didn't need to make everyone look so er 'bright'. Plot itself involves young, poor white girl from the hood with a black legal guardian (powerful!), and her story..in the world of dance. oh did i mention there's a turf war? not a social reflection...just a bit naff.<br/><br/>Dancing was good though."
"sancorana","4","10","17","18 February 2008"," Painful
","Okay, I really wanted to like this movie. I loved Step Up, and I was hoping that this movie would at least come close to the same level. But...it really didn't. Chemistry between the leads was missing...in fact, chemistry between any of the characters was lacking. I am still not sure why they cared about each other at all. Also, I felt like there was no point to the movie except to string a bunch of dance scenes together. There was no real growth on the part of Andi, or the other characters. Maybe originally this movie was intended to show how someone from the streets could fit in...but I never saw Andi struggle. The dialogue was clich√© and boring, and the minor characters, while perhaps intended to add humor and depth, did nothing for me.<br/><br/>And then...the dancing.<br/><br/>A lot of people have been raving about the dancing in this movie, and saying that it is the only good thing about it. However...it was ALL THE SAME. There was hardly any variation when it came to style, except for maybe five seconds of a mediocre ballet student. I felt like I was looking at the same dance over and over and over again, with the moves slightly reshuffled. The one exception was the final dance, which I did enjoy watching. At least the original Step Up combined different types of dancing to some extent; that was completely lacking here.<br/><br/>In short...stay at home and save your 12 bucks, and if you're looking for a dance movie, go back and watch the original movie again. This isn't worth it."
"practicallypeach","2","8","13","23 April 2008"," Pretty Bad film
","You seriously have to be into this low brow stuff to like this movie. And it's not even the content that dumbs this movie down. But both the message and the characters are stupid. I'll start with the message. The message is to be yourself and not conform to what other people think and feel. You know why I have a problem with that? It's because when you go to get a high education it's ALL about conforming. That's why you go. To understand someone ELSE'S rules and follow them so you can be successful in someone else's world. Because this is not YOUR world. Right now this is a white man's world and that's not going to change any time soon. If you don't want to conform that you don't have to. But don't try and change an entire organization that was perfectly content with the way they ran things before you came along. 6 or 7 people should not change how an organization of thousands of people operate. That's just reality. This is a dreamers movie. <br/><br/>I also don't care for the characters. You've got this white girl with this chip on her shoulder who can dish it out but can't take it. She feels she can make fun of someone and joke around but when someone does the same to her, she goes all ""you ***hole"" on us. I hate that. Girls shouldn't behave that way. If you want to talk smack them be prepared for it to come right back at you. She is part of a group of ignorant teenagers with bad style. The ring leader of this group is violent but can't do anything by himself. He's got to have his friends by his side before beating on someone, which is cowardly and stupid. <br/><br/>You can't hold respect for these characters. They are all shallow and idiotic. Honestly only teenagers can identify with this movie. But mature, educated people know that this type of attitude about life will land these characters exactly where they dance: the streets."
"HeartOfSky","5","42","93","13 February 2008"," Great dancing... AWFUL script
","The only reason I could offer a rating of 5 was for the dancing. The storyline was awful, clich√©, and a pathetic example of a movie sequel. Every encounter/experience on the part of the girl were just circumstances that served to validate her point of view. Anything that offered a growth opportunity was either not included in the script or edited out. Where the first film was a yet another film hybridizing formal and street dance, this film paid no respect to formal dance and seemed to even discredit it.<br/><br/>This movie failed for me just like almost every porn flick that tried to employ acting and a plot along with the action. LOL"
"helmutty","5","6","9","7 March 2008"," Step up 2
","It is just okay for a dance movie. In dance movies, the plot is not a thing to look out for, it is the dance moves. Step up 2 features cool dance moves but the plot is so simple. But it is a dance movie, we should be watching it for its dance moves not some good plot. Step up 2 features some of the most coolest dance moves. When I was watching it, I was wondering how did they do all the moves. The dance moves are amazing. Though the dance moves are amazing, I felt the plot is boring.<br/><br/>The story: it is really simple. Andie is a girl who street dancing at a so called club called The Street. She then is sent to Texas, she enrolls at MSU where they don't accept her type of dancing. She gathers a group to impress an underground street dance competition. I don't even bother about the story plot. It is simple, nothing you cannot understand. The dance moves is well done.<br/><br/>Overall: You like dancing movies or you are looking for cool dance moves, this should be watched. Basically, I have nothing to say about this movie but only rave about the dance moves. Other than watching the dance moves or hot people dancing, there is really nothing more in this movie."
"cerasea","1","7","11","19 April 2008"," Disappointed & Disturbed
","I think it's in ""fluff pieces"" where stereotypes are particularly dangerous. The movie claimed that it wanted to showcase how dance and hip-hop transcend cultural and class barriers, but the plot only served to highlight and exploit these divisions. I hold the writers more responsible for this missed opportunity than the director, though. A few simple plot changes would have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves. It's easy to believe that observations like this will only fall on deaf ears, but I hope more people (in audiences and in the movie industry) will be less naive whenever another studio decides to mass-market such ignorance."

","""It's Not Where You're From. It's Where You're At.""<br/><br/>Considering the fact that I haven't see the first one (nor do I want to) I really have nothing else to compare this movie too, and because of this it stands alone. Step Up 2 the Streets brings not only the best dancing I have ever seen on screen (aside from White Nights I guess), but what it does is it proves that even with a moderate script you can still present something remarkable with the right kind of characters and good pacing.<br/><br/>The whole concept about following you're heart is a load of bull and has been done many times before, but it was, however, never mentioned in the film, which I was very pleased about. To a reasonable extent, I enjoyed most of the characters and the talented actors that really developed their characters. I can imagine it being extremely difficult to finds actors that can not only act but have incredible dancing abilities. It's because of their talent that I can over look the fact that a lot of them look older than their character's age.<br/><br/>What I mean about good pacing is that because I watched this movie at three o'clock in the morning I never once felt that something felt out of place or that this was more dancing than story, or vice versa. I was kind of tired and if any film can keep me up long enough to watch the whole thing, then it will have my praise. <br/><br/>WARNING SPOILERS ( FROM ANOTHER MOVIE)<br/><br/>I remember the first time I watched Jeepers Creepers, which I watched around the same time as this film. I was about half way through when the monster was finally in the open, and it turned out to be some indestructible monster with wings. It was after that that I decided to stop the movie at wait until morning to finish the movie. I didn't have that problem with Step Up 2 the Streets.<br/><br/>I give it too the critics that the ending was it's weakest point and had the potential to conclude with a better punch, but that wasn't a big problem because I found that I didn't want the end too come because I was so in to the story of these characters and the fantastic variety of dancing.<br/><br/>I would just recommend to watch this movie with an open mind. Try not to right away hate or love anything about it until the movie ends, and then ask yourself, ""was this movie worth watching?""<br/><br/>***/**** Stars<br/><br/>Step Up 2 the Streets (2008) Rated PG-13 for suggestive material and brief violence"

The story begins with a middle class girl called Andie-Who-Is-Motherless-And-Talented and her friends which are street dancers. Of course, Andie, who is nice and modest but full of talent in dancing, is getting into ""art academy""(or whatever it was) and meet a Nerd-But-Talented-Guy-Who-Likes-""Cool""-Music with a really long name that calls himself ""Moose""(sp?). Of course they became friends. Then, to make it more clich√©d, she meets the Cool-Talented-Sexy-Guy, and at that moment I can bet they would end up together. Then we get to see the Cool-Beautiful-Girl-Who-Is-Really-Talented that wants the Cool-Talented-Guy. Of course our sweet heroine will have a CatFight with her on the Cool-Talented-Guy. And then, the teacher who is Taugh-But-Professional helps our Andie. Most of the kids in my class saw this movie before, so at the last second of the lesson, they wanted to fast forward and see the cool dance at the end. Then, we saw Andie orate about nonsense to a bunch of boys and girls about street dancing. In short, another wannabe realistic and clich√©d film. A waste of time."

This movie definitely beats the likes of Honey (obviously), Center Stage, Save the Last Dance, Save the Last Dance 2, Take the Lead, and Step Up 1. My friends and I, who were all dancers, went crazy at the movie theater. The acting wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, and the dancing is sick. Freaking sick. You'll want to just bust out into dance as soon as it starts happening in the movie. The end dance sequence is absolutely phenomenal.

","Let me go into this review, saying halfway through, I almost decided to just up and leave without wasting time on even getting a refund. They can keep my money i just want my time i wasted on this back.<br/><br/>Lets start off by emphasizing on the plot and script....Horrible acting by both parts. If this was a musical on ice they would have better luck looking like they know what they're doing. There's almost no acting to be seen, its almost as if they purely practiced their dancing and nothing else. The main actress seems to rely more on anatomy than ability, however the leading man seems to somewhat have a grasp on pretending to act at least.<br/><br/>As for story, same ^&*^ different day. I really wish people would stop remaking and ripping off the classics, and this one is a prime example. I would only watch this movie again if they paid me.<br/><br/>So in a nutshell, the acting abilities of the peoples (main characters) is near nilche. THe dancing, is descent but really, who watches a movie just to see dancing, at least dirty dancing had the swayze. I really feel the worst over the leading actress as you would hope she has a spark of talent, more than she demonstrates, so sadly her career will be based purely on what people find her attractive.<br/><br/>I would rank this 0/10 however it doesn't have that option. Wait till it hits TV and then record it for one of those lonely nights, when you think the world cant get any worse. I will have to add this to one of my top 10 WORSE films of all time."
"butterflybabyeva","6","6","10","19 February 2008"," What I Expected.
","When I paid my 10 dollars to get into this movie, I would have been stupid to expect Oscar winning performances by the cast and an award winning script, which is why I wasn't too disappointed when the acting wasn't all that great and the script wasn't too great either.<br/><br/>But what was I there for? The dancing. And did the dancing live up to expectations? As a whole, it definitely did! You see, I thing Evigan was very disappointing, being the main character and she was not even close to the best dancer. Her performances looked VERY choreographed, even when she was supposed to be free styling. I guess she was just the only one that really looked like she didn't know what she was doing. Sure, she could shake her booty with the best of them, but her dancing wasn't as convincing as the rest of the cast's.<br/><br/>Other than that, the dancing lived up to all my expectations! Robert Hoffman really impressed me with his moves, seeing as he hadn't known how to break dance before hand. He was really good.<br/><br/>And when it came to comedic timing, acting, and true to the core dancing, Adam G. Sevani (Moose) was this movie's saving grace. You'll have to watch it to understand what I mean.<br/><br/>So, basically, in a nut shell, if your expectations aren't set too high when it comes to the acting and the script, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this movie. The dance moves will rock your world, and I think that anyone who loves a bit of exciting dancing will enjoy this movie as much as I did!"

","I was so excited when I heard there was going to be a sequel to Step Up and I was even more excited when I heard Channing Tatum would make an appearance in it but I quickly realized upon seeing it that it does not compare to the fist one. The dance moves are great but the actual story is predictable and clich√©. The movie was short and when it was over I was waiting for something more! The highlight of the movie for me was the character Moose played by Adam Sevani. Moose is the lovable nerd who is hiding some mad dance skills. I also enjoyed seeing Cassie in her first major acting role and I like her song ""Is It You"" that is on the soundtrack. I am glad I saw this movie because it was fun and i love dance but I do not think it was quite worth the price of admission. Thank you for reading!"

","Dancing is my pet-peeve.

It's not about killers, drugs... it is just about a real passion in nowadays life, and it feels good for a time...<br/><br/>And don't look for ""sexy"" moments as the french title suggests, because the movie could have been produced by any churches so much it is soft."

","I went into this movie with very low expectations. It was a way for me to get out with some friends, and most likely something I would have never seen otherwise. However, I came out surprised an in awe. The acting was bland, but the dancing more than made up for it. The choreography was amazing, and my jaw dropped during the final dance scene. --Aside from the dancing, the characters could have been slightly more interesting. Tucker (Black Thomas) was slightly frustrating with his predictability of racial stereotypes, along with most of the 410 Crew. Outside of the 410, Moose (Adam Sevani) had the whole theater cracking up. The remainder of the characters were all pretty predictable. Chase (Robert Hoffman) and Andie (Briana Evigan) shared some chemistry, enough to make it believable. Step Up 2 highly surpassed my expectations, but not enough to make me see it again. I would recommend a rental rather than pay for the ticket."

","Don't be fooled this movie was incredible. I won't tell you that I was laughing the whole time but there were a few good things in this movie.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum (Tyler Gage)played a real minuscule part in the movie. Even though it was small it played into the back story and where the story was headed. Briana Evigan(Andie)plays a girl that is having a hard time dealing with her mothers death and even harder time dealing with life at home. Joined up with a crew she is an extraordinary dancer that has the opportunity to go to school and better herself. Robert Hoffman (Chase Collins) is your usual spoiled brat that wants to be street. Though to some this is so beyond the norm where I come from this is normal behavior. Overall the movie was good although Black Thomas (Tuck) took the street thug dancer thing way over the top.<br/><br/>Step up 2 was definitely a feel good movie. If you like good dancing seeing new moves and hearing good music, hell if you like underdog movies, at all this one is for you. The dancing was incredible and the script wasn't all that great but when going to see a movie like this who cares. Definitely worth the $8 and the time."
"john_shaftman","1","6","12","21 March 2008"," Rude & Racist and a Disgrace to Black Culture..
","Being a black street dancer from Harlem New York since the 1980's, I found this film offensive. The film was a poor effort by middle class kids who are desperately trying to fit into the urban dance street culture of black youth. The black actors had a very out-back roll to that of a film extra and were portrayed as the spoilers in this movie. It was the worst effort I've ever seen by any film make who dares to call themselves a film director. The film was poorly written, degrading and very discriminating towards black people and it would appear that the director did the best he or she could to push the black actors to the back. It is a dream for the middle class kids to be a part of or be involved in such a culture and for the film maker to somewhat attempt to even try to merge a black mother into being a mother to a young white girl was a poor shot at trying to blend the girl into such a culture. This movie does not deserve the right to be called a movie. It's more like a cheap series on the scfi channel and a weak attempt of a culture take-over by the some kids who idolize black music and urban dance culture. A big minus -10 for this poor so called film."

They didn't take enough time to elaborate what could have been an amazing movie. And that's a proof of inexperience behind the camera also. The Dance shots was not too accurate; they went by too fast. And the dance moves were not too interesting; you could tell that they were amateur, except for Adam Saveni, He was good and deserved the credit. He saved the movie. And Cassie was in the movie, but you can't really tell why! What was the point of her being in it? Her character was not well developed."

You couldn't be further from the truth. This is not a movie. This is the essence of the movies altogether. Forget about The Lord Of The Rings, forget about third rate actors like Daniel Day-Lewis. I'm actually quite surprised that this movie didn't made it to the Oscars. Well, there's no complete happiness. The music is great. I thought they're gonna play stuff like 50 Cent and Missy-Elliott and then bang! say hallo to Cradle of Filth, mother fathers :) The soundtrack is epic. And the dancing... well normally I'd be annoyed if in a 90 minutes movie there was like 30 minutes dancing. But in this particular one if the dances were like a minute shorter the whole magic of the movie would be lost.

For a teenager, I like to think of myself as having pretty good taste in movies most of the time. This, not having been my choice, took me out of my comfort zone a lot, since it had virtually little or no substance (and more than a few potentially offensive stereotypes, as with the Asian girl, and especially the black and Hispanic characters). There is nothing to spoil, because you will probably be able to predict every single thing that happens, whether or not you have seen many films of this nature. Of course, that's hopefully not why you bought the ticket. You came to see amazing hip-hop routines matched with all the hottest new dance tracks. This certainly delivers on that, though you have to wait awhile for a completely uninterrupted step sequence. In short, a good easy way to spend an afternoon with a friend or significant other, but it's just as easy to spend $7.15 to rent the DVD or go to see something else."

"dancing_queen_1187","2","2","3","17 June 2009"," Step Up 2 Crashes Down
","Being a dancer, I'm drawn to dancing movies. ""Step Up"" came to theaters almost three years ago now, and although it didn't bring the finesse that my favorite dance movie ""CenterStage"" had, it held an enjoyable character of its own. Although I know Step Up 2 has been out for some time now, Ifinally decided to give it a go. That was my first mistake. The second?Leaving it on after the first ten minutes. Not only is it generally just a poor movie, the dancing was lacking too. Stomp the Yard completely Stomps this movie in the dancing department, although the acting is about the same. The only thing that I enjoyed in this film was the special appearance by Channing Tatum, and that's only because his chiseled features and gorgeous eyes entrance me every time.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Let's start with the terrible acting. Briana Evigan plays the part of Andie, a rebellious teenager, who's mother died at age 16 and is on her last chance living with her late mother's best friend (seem familiar?). Her last chance to stay in Maryland, as from the previous Step Up, is attending the Maryland School of the Arts. Robert Hoffman plays Chase, the preppy boy-band, blonde-haired dancer. Supposed sparks are supposed to fly between Chase and Andie, but obviously I missed the cue, because I couldn't even see a sliver of heat between them on-screen. A romantic scene between the two during an evening party had the words cheesy and clich√© written all over it, which left me cringing. After Andie is kicked out of her own crew, her and Chase randomly decide to start one. Soon, a group of wanna-be dancers meet to work on a routine for the big competition ""The Streets."" After they realize they suck, they start re-working their routine. In the meantime, Andie's ex-crew gets word of the new crew, and trash MSA's studio, which gets Andie expelled. It was a good decision by me, although it was far from the right reason. The crew falls apart, and the usual ""I'm sad and miss you"" montage of Andie, Chase, and the rest of the crew ensues. The next thing you know, the crew's back together at Andie's door the same night as The Streets competition. After arriving at the infamous underground competition, they're told they don't belong there, it's a competition for locals only, and that they should go home. And, as predicted, Andie gets up and starts in on the heartfelt speech, which was almost heartbreaking to have to put up with. Pretending to act ghetto, she pleads to the crowd to let her crew dance. And, as predicted, they suddenly change their minds and cheer her on as they all rush outside in the rain to watch the final crew dance. The final dance had some interesting choreography, and the rain added a cool twist, but again, I was left lacking excitement. It was clear that some of their moves were stolen from past seasons of the hit Fox reality show, ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" which I'm sure was input given by producer Adamm Shankman.<br/><br/>Step Up 2 lacks creativity, a good plot-line, original choreography, talented actors, and just about everything in between. To quote my favorite show, FRIENDS, ""Well, the lighting was all right."" If only that were enough to make a movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>If producers are going to continue with this ""sequel"" fad, they better be darn sure it's going to blow the original out of the water. Then maybe it'll stand a chance for it to actually be just as good as the first. Hopefully producer Adamm Shankman will keep that in mind while they're working on the newest sequel, ""Step Up: 3-D."" I sure don't want to torture myself watching another disastrous dancing movie again."

","Andie (Evigan) joins a highly sophisticated school and once entered in an extremely difficult dance class, her friends and dance group the 410 turn their back on her.<br/><br/>Though labelled as Step Up 2, this 2007 music drama is not a direct sequel to the previous fan winning picture. Having never seen the original, comparisons will be short here but in full honesty, I flicked this film on for a light hearted viewing knowing full well it was classed as a casual flick and starring some attractive young stars with some modern day hit singles, it was sure to be popcorn entertainment, but no.<br/><br/>If you have seen the trailer for this Jon Chu picture you will have noticed some eccentric dance moves, some visible drama and heard Flo Rida's previous smash Low. All fine elements combining for a good trailer and promising picture but don't let this take you for granted.<br/><br/>Step Up 2 is a film made purely for profit. There is no point, there is no deep meaning, and sadly there is hardly entertainment to speak of. Encoded with chart singles and upcoming stars, it is a vehicle forward for the cast and crew. <br/><br/>Starting off with a bizarre dance battle and we see sullen central character Briana Evigan lose a dance battle and is forced to go to school and she is instantly an outcast who brings her own flair and instantly likes the hottest most talented guy and blah, blah, blah. It's your typical story with modern music and stereotype gloss over, a film for ""the hood"" or ""the chavs"" was an accurate review given by the critics, which is reasonable enough.<br/><br/>There is too much slang to make out what was proper English, the clothes are all hoodies and awful tracksuits aimed to represent the difficult culture when all it does is make the characters look baggy and scruffy rather than emotionally strained as the shabby script seems to depict them. <br/><br/>The acting is terrible, complete stone faced twitter that expresses little emotion. Adam G Sevani brings the odd spark as appropriately named Moose but the leads are a very basic form of Romeo and Juliet, who obviously don't know it.<br/><br/>If there is one reason to watch this, it is the dancing. When looking at classic music dramas such as Saturday Night Fever we see an era of classic and surprise. Here the dancing justifies the modern culture, break dancing away from the normality and past into a brand new phase of life. The choreography is superb and the rain dance sequence, though ruined by the most ridiculous inspirational speech ever to grace cinema, is otherwise a shocking surprise to this otherwise faulty and flat picture."

I was however pleasantly surprised: <br/><br/>The story line wasn't quite as tacky as I had thought it would be and it did have its own unique style.<br/><br/>Although the music and acting wasn't nearly as good. At times it seemed a little overdone! It seemed as though the script and the actors were trying to way over dramatise everything and it kind of spoiled the intensity that made Step Up such a brilliant movie. I think over dramatising it made it a little monotonous and confusing because it left the audience wondering ""Ok so what exactly is the issue here"" or ""Wow is everything just wrong in this world"". <br/><br/>Overall though, I would say it is worth watching but I would recommend you thinking of it as a movie of its own and not a sequel as I believe it will make it all the more enjoyable to the viewer. It is definitely a bit of a feel good film, in a slightly corny way. But NOT at all comparable to the original if you ask me."

Step Up wasn't so well written itself, but at least it look like the product of a filmmaker. This looks like the product of a hack.

","Saddled with a screenplay that wouldn't earn a passing grade in a Cinema 101 course, ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" is an urban fairy tale about an orphaned crew dancer (Briana Evigan) from the 'hood who is accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But can she find a home with the assortment of geeks, preppies and classically-trained arty types who attend the school? And can she succeed as a student without turning her back on her ""homies"" from the old neighborhood? Or will she be forced to form her own crew from dancers at the school to compete with the Big Boys out on the streets? <br/><br/>You can write the script yourself, but the key selling-point of this sequel to ""Step Up"" - sort of a mash-up of ""Fame,"" ""Footloose"" and ""School of Rock"" - is clearly not the storytelling but the dancing. And in that respect it delivers the goods. So ignore the predictable plotting, the tinny dialogue, the corny inspirational speeches, the wafer-thin characters, the obligatory montage sequences and the amateurish acting, and simply revel in the moves, street-dance or otherwise, that permeate the film. It's not much in the way of compensation, I know, but at least it's better than nothing."

","I am not at all Hip-Hop fan or anyway they call Ghetto style stuff or anything which has poverty attached to it and I am not sure why I picked this movie at all, may be had nothing else to do. This is great movie, makes me wonder someone is thinking.<br/><br/>These type of ideas make me salute Adam Smith for making world aware of capitalism and value of Chaos as solution for difficult issues. No one can imagine what type of dancing will be liked by crowd and once it has been around for 200+ years then it gets in classic form and I think this was the point director was making. Movie could have been much better except dancing which was awesome in the back drop. Girl and the guy were perfect and I will not 2nd guess if Bollywood copies this concept though this is not at all a phenomena today in India but capitalism has brought chaos, hence many new forms will sprung up. Keep your mind more open and watch this movie seriously and enjoy having quality time spent over other block busters. This movie has actually changed me if you don't dislike these kind of sentences."

","This movie is all about the dance, it has much more dance sequences than Step Up, Save the last Dance; and they are stunning!<br/><br/>The story is a bit predictable, the typical ""girl from the neighborhood that comes to a fancy school..."". The acting is OK, the main actress (Briana Evigan) did a good job and I really liked Adam G. Sevani, as Moose. The male lead (Robert Hoffman) for me was the weakest on the main cast.<br/><br/>But... The dancing is AMAZING! The coreographies are great and really complex. The dancers are awesome (for example Robert Hoffman who was the weakest in acting, his dancing was amazing)!

","Great dancing... too bad they could afford the choreographer, but skimped out on the good actors, I know I shouldn't have watched this film, I didn't like the first Step Up movie, what in the world possessed me to watch the sequel? My friends and I were bored and needed a movie to watch and since a couple of my girlfriends are just die hard fans of the first Step Up, they were dying to see the sequel. I think this was just a horribly written movie and so badly acted, it's the same plot recycled from the first Step Up, only this time it's with the girl who's the trouble maker and the guy is the preppy rich kid. They just couldn't do anything original or even classy... as much as I enjoyed the dancing, there were some incredible moves, this was meant to be a movie, not just a tutorial on how to dance, good dance moves do not make a good movie.<br/><br/>Andie is apart of a dance crew who not only dance great, but they also cause disruption in society and are wanted by all the police. Andie's guardian gives her one more chance to straighten up and sends her to a preppy dance school where she meets the kids who dance ""properly"". But when her crew finds out where she's been going, they kick her out, but a preppy dancer encourages her to start her own crew and invites others, but the teacher gets angry when the streets are threatened and damage school property, the teacher threatens expulsion to anyone who is apart of the street dance.<br/><br/>Step Up 2 the Streets is definitely for those who enjoy these dance movies, but for me, nothing stood out any different from any other dance movie. This is a rental or just a skip, I feel bad because I didn't want to see this movie, but I will give it it's chops for a great ending dance sequence, these kids were absolutely amazing and their timing was on, I can't believe how well it was performed. Over all this isn't by any means a horrible movie, but the acting and story just make it a non watchable film, just fast forward to the dance sequences, that's the only entertainment of the film.<br/><br/>2/10"

","I think that this movie was awesome but this script kind of killed it but overall I think most people will like it. At first when I had seen the previous to it I thought Andie was going to be Tyler's younger sister the one that we saw in Step Up. Probably if it had taken the point of view from Tyler's younger sister from Step Up one it might have been an excellent movie. But yeah I just cant wait until this movie comes out in DVD to go buy it.The music was incredible and off the hook especially the one played at the end in the final dance scene. I think that they should have focused a little more on the chemistry between Chase and Andie. Both Robert Hoffman and Briana Evigan prove to be great actors since there mostly focused on Dancing then Acting. I would like to see Briana in more dancing films because she proved to be a great actor and overall I think she is a very gorgeous and nice looking girl."

","First of all, why does Channing Tatum (who plays lead role as Tyler in part one) appear at the beginning of the movie and then he disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the movie? I thought he was going to be the main guy again; Wrong. Robert Hoffman appears as Chase Collins, the lead role, and to be honest, his dance moves were not all that (to put it nicely). Secondly, I thought it kind of disturbing that the writers portrayed the 410 Dance Crew, which had an African American leader and more people of color, as violent and ""Bad"" - I've never met a dancer, whether street or not, to have the kind of anger and violent tendencies that the leader of the 410 Crew exhibited. Third, everyone knows, (or do they?), that African Americans invented hip hop, rock, jazz, etc. yet, you have two Caucasians as the lead roles, and to be honest, when it comes to dancing, they just can't cut it like African Americans - period. The African Americans that were in this movie were in the background and weren't allowed to display the kind of dance moves that REALLY make people take notice. So, to be fair, I give it a 5 out of 10 because it had some decent dance moves and I can tell they worked hard on their ""dance moves"". The acting was okay."

That being said, I expected way more awesome dancing than I saw. The space between the opening dance and finally was really only dotted with cool moves. However, the opening (which you can mostly see through the previews) and finally dances coupled with the music were fantastic.

Step up 2 the Streets works, especially if you liked the first one and are not a cynic about what this all meant cinema wise (including a very lame spoof called Dance Flick). But what this is most notable for is the introduction of Moose (character). Someone you'd think was there from the beginning and is a big part of the Step up franchise, just got into part 2, but since then is an integral part of it all.<br/><br/>The story is as predictable as the others are, but with new leads in the male and female department and other song and dance routines you do get something fresh out of it.

","After Channing Tatum broke out, they decided to make this into a franchise. The sequels would grow increasingly tiresome, I just felt with every sequel they would rehash the storyline from the original, but in different ways, but this one is actually decent for what it is. The gorgeous Brianna Evigan takes over the lead in this one, and does a solid job. Her bubbly, yet defiant personality was a treat to watch. I'm surprised her career hasn't taken off like I expected. Robert Hoffman lacks Channing Tatum's charisma, but he made for an OK, if underwhelming lead. He & Brianna lack the spark that Channing & Jenna Dewan have. The dance scenes are fairly good. Around the beginning of the film, Channing Tatum has a quick cameo at a dance club of sorts, and to be honest the movie could have used him fully. Overall though, I had an OK time with this movie<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: It won't turn your world upside down, but if you enjoyed the original like I did, I'm sure you'll find things to like about this one.

","Andie (Evigan) is adopted by her mum's friend following her death and facing a life of petty crime and delinquency, decides to try-out for enrolment at the local school of Arts. Accepted on a dance ticket, she finds the adjustment difficult with perfectionist and conservative headmaster (Kemp) unwilling to bend his rules to accommodate her raw, impoverished style. Rejected by her old crew for becoming part of the establishment, she teaches her new peers to compete for the street dance wars, but risks expulsion, ridicule and the support of her adopted mother in the process.<br/><br/>Actor-crooner Greg Evigan's career lives on vicariously through his husky-voiced daughter Briana playing her first lead role with confidence and skill, while English ballet dancer and actor Will Kemp has an essentially non-dance role as the stiff headmaster, learning a thing or two from the next generation. The cast are fashionable and age appropriate for their roles; nothing special, the emphasis is on the moves and the last act is the best in that regard.<br/><br/>There's a bit of romance, drama, a Kleenex moment or two, plenty of gyrating mid-riffs, plunging necklines, jealousy, vandalism and fisticuffs topped off by a rain-drenched, headlight lit dance off.

","Step up 2 is a fairly good movie to watch, except the fact that it's clich√©. The movie has an amazing dance choreography which will leave you dumb founded. I should say that all the dancers & performers who have been involved in this movie has done a great job, but acting wise not so good maybe because that's the way the story is made. Like i said before, the story is clich√©. Surprisingly, it's actually quite inspiring seeing how great & talented these dancers are. I'd rate this movie into 3 categories story,acting,dancing. Story : Not so good. Acting: I'd say good because the story is meaningless and what more can you act?. Dancing: Great. Highlight of the movie since the movie is all about dancing,It's mandatory that the dancing is at least good. Summing up, It's a good movie to watch if you're a person who is into watching chick flicks but not saying this is a chick flick or if you like watching dance/musical movie then this is a perfect movie for you to uplift & warm up your mind"

","The first film was a good excuse for great choreographed street dancing, the story is obviously not as relevant, but the good news is there came this sequel with more great moves, possibly better ones. Basically in Baltimore, Maryland, Andie West (Briana Evigan) wants to be a big street dancing star being a member of the 410 crew, and they without permission or illegally use school premises to do their stuff. Andie is allowed into Maryland School of the Arts (MSA), with Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman) persuading Blake Collins (Will Kemp) to recruit her. Being involved in illegal competitions at The Streets, Andie is expelled from the school, but by the end she has her education secured with a great performance, her friend Moose (Adam G. Sevani) gets a kiss from Sophie (Cassie Ventura), and Andie gets with Chase. Also starring Sonja Sohn as Sarah, Danielle Polanco as Missy, Telisha Shaw as Felicia, Black Thomas as Tuck, Channing Tatum as Tyler and Christopher Scott as Hair. Okay, I will be honest, there wasn't much story I was paying the fullest attention to, it was all the dancing, including in a club with trampolines, and the brilliant choreographed routines that are to watch closely, so for that, a good romantic dance drama.

The story in this one is super ridiculous and weak compared to the first film, not saying the first ""Step Up"" was good or anything. None of the characters was even really memorable in this, except maybe the character Moose. It would have been a better film with the new crew that gets made has more dancing in it, in competitions. The dancing at the end of this film is actually pretty cool and is done pretty well and is entertaining to watch. Just would have been better if it had more of that stuff. The dancing outside the competition, was pretty entertaining to watch as well, it was just slick, fast and cool. Although the story is pretty weak and ridiculous for these types of flick, you can't really expect much in that department.

","""Step Up 2"" takes place in the same area the first one did. It centers around young street dancer Andie, who is roaming with a gang of street dancers known as the 410 who have been terrorizing the community.<br/><br/>Fed up with Andie's antics, her caretaker threatens to send her to her aunt's house in Texas if she doesn't shape up. With the help of her friend Chase, she gets into the prestigious dance school that the first movie centered around, and they try to polish her dancing skills, but she has street dancing in her blood.<br/><br/>She gathers the 'unknowns' - students in the school that the higher ups feel have no dancing talent - and forms her own street dance crew to go against the 410, and a dance battle ensues.<br/><br/>Sure, this movie has nothing to do with the Oscars, but it is an enjoyable film, 95% in part due to the fantastic dancing. It takes a lot of grit, determination and dedication to be such fantastic dancers, and these kids got the talent. That's what makes the ""Step Up"" movies - as well as other movies of this genre - so successful, and enjoyable."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","10 April 2008"," A remotely linked sequel, with even more dances
","People who have bought tickets to see ""Step up 2"" are very likely those who have watched ""Step up"". They won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>If you still remember Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) from her first one, there is your continuity, as an older-brother-figure advising our new protagonist Andie (Briana Evigan) to meet her stern but well-meaning guardian (late mother's best friend) half-way and attend the Maryland School of Arts (MSA) and stay away from the street dancers' gang the ""410"". What follows is pretty well paint-by-number ¬ñ dilemmas, frustrations, friendship, romance, be-yourself, understanding, reconciliation, culminating in a climatic showdown of a street dancing contest between the 401s and an offbeat group ""MSA Crew"" organized by Andie. Upbeat ending ¬ñ all by the book.<br/><br/>Critics all seem to harp on the limp plot, weak acting, uninspired characters, because that is what they expect other critics to say. I don't think the movie is really that bad at those things. But I do agree that all these are beside the point. It's the dancing that we come for.<br/><br/>Talking about dancing up a storm..... don't these guys and gals have energy, and moves. But while the first ""Step up"" was a cross over between classic and modern dances, this one is all street dancing (except for one salsa number). And there isn't much music to speak of other than rhythm and rap. But if you are in the right mood (i.e. feeling like thirteen or fourteen regardless of your biological years), the dance numbers can double your pulse beat in 10 seconds flat. The final climatic number, performed in the street in torrential rain, is something to behold.<br/><br/>Briana Evigan has an easy, winning charm that makes her instantly likable. Robert Hoffman (probably not related to the other two with the same name, great actors both) has a very handsome face and a disarming disposition. The assemblage of the odd balls loser-types from the MSA is great fun, especially Adam G. Sevani (""Moose"" in the movie""). But again that's all beside the point. All you need is three little words: they can dance. <br/><br/>And believe me, they can."

","i wasn't expecting this after the first movie. i thought it would be a love story mixed with dance again. but this one blew me away! after watching it i just wanted to dance like they could. it was an amazing dance movie. Briana evigan surprised me with her ability to take on a role this good, i thought she was just a good dancer but future dance movie directors should go and look for her. Robert Hoffman(the urban ninja) was amazing with the complexity of his dance moves. and as usual his role of the pretty boy who's got it all was assumed again. not to be judgmental i am a huge fan of Roberts, hes an amazing dancer and comedian. and his charm and looks add to it to make his just perfect."
"Babyblue_jt_04","8","2","5","19 February 2008"," Best dance movie...maybe ever!
","I have seen this movie twice already and can't get enough of it. There's nothing surprising or even unique about the plot - really, it's just an inversion of the first movies' plot. In fact, if you start thinking about some of the plot issues too hard, you'll notice some definite flaws - not to mention that some of the funniest lines and scenes (which can be seen in some of the music videos and promos for the film) got lost on the cutting room floor. It's really not that distracting, though and the acting, for the movie being what it is, was actually quite engaging and well done. But, really, who goes to a dance movie for the plot? No one - you go for the dancing and this movie is just brimming with some of the most incredible dancing I've ever seen done by some of the best dancers. Every single one of them is AMAZING. And the final dance scene really is a excellent as you've heard."

"DICK STEEL","5","2","6","15 March 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Step Up 2 the Streets
","The opening just might inspire the return of the flashmobbers, a fad which picked up for a short time in Singapore (of which I did participate in one), and then faded into oblivion. From the get go, it seemed like a unique idea, until you realize it's all staged to gain street cred in this Youtube age, performed by ""crew"" members of reigning street dance champions 410.<br/><br/>But Step Up 2 retains much of the superficial facade of the original movie, with the setting in the same elite school, only with a different cohort. From what we've seen in the first, those snobby arty farty dance kids no longer hog the spotlight, as it is firmly on a group of misfits who are here to replace the loss of the previous two leads Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum, although the latter did land a guest appearance to cement the excuse for a sequel, as well as to pass on the troubled teen mantle to Andie (Briana Evigan).<br/><br/>Whatever troubles these teens have, it's all secondary to the purpose of making the movie. Sure, you have the outcast who don't look right and get prejudiced against, a typical younger brother trying to step out of the shadows of his more illustrious brother who's now school principal, and some might even deem it condescending to have an Asian character who speaks in a funny accent. Too many characters here and all of them turn out to be one- dimensional and cardboard. But all that camaraderie building aside, which is what is formulaic glue, the main draw is undoubtedly the street dancing moves.<br/><br/>I'd bet everyone in the audience, who are mostly teenagers into free form dance, will lap up all the moves that the cast put on display. And there are plenty of set pieces for one to gawk at. However, in my own personal un-dance-like opinion, the dancing here pales in comparison to the first. What made the first interesting to watch, is the fusion of two different schools of thought, and having them come together for an explosive finale which was worth the wait. Here, it's more improvisation, and even then, you can't help but notice the very individualistic styles that stand out on its own, never for a minute trying to blend in with the rest of the crew.<br/><br/>Coming together for the expected finale was also very staged and forced, and in no way given the story development, can they pull off something like that. Even so, instead of one coherent act, you get many disjointed short sequences being force fit together. Not very effective, or interesting to sit through unfortunately. So I am going to state that Step Up 2 the Streets is strictly meant for street dance fans, otherwise this makes the first movie look like a class act of its own."

"maroontimes81","3","1","3","20 July 2008"," Predictable, unrealistic, main female character counts steps, but JabbaWockeez, Moose, and Mari Koda save the film!
","I love hip hop--the music, the breaking (along with other forms of dancing), and the culture, but I have yet to see a hip hop movie that I really loved. The reason why these movies always fail (""Honey,"" ""Save the Last Dance,"" ""You Got Served,"" ""Step Up,"") are because the movies either fail in acting skills or level of dance. I enjoyed ""Step Up"" solely because of Channing Tatum's excellent dance skills, but the girl in that movie looked like she was counting every single hip hop step. In ""How She Move,"" the issue was that the music directors kept playing music during the stepping scenes and stepping is supposed to be so powerful that you just listen to the body music, also an issue in parts of ""Stomp the Yard"" (although I loved the latter film). I was not at all surprised when I wasn't moved by this film. The lead female character, like so many others, looked like she learned hip hop dancing yesterday right after her model shoot. I'm not saying this to be facetious, but the problem with Hollywood movies is they pick what they think people will find attractive rather than skill level. I watched Briana Evigan dance, and almost every move was followed by some video girl pose or hard concentration on her face. Miss Prissy (of ""Rize"") is a good example of how a female whose background is in hip hop usually looks when she dances. The grit in the female dancers is ALWAYS missing in these movies, but it's replaced by pop star poses. I hate that! If we get past her character, which could have been left out altogether and focused moreso on Chase Collins (played by Robert Hoffman), this movie might've worked. I have seen him on ""Wild n' Out,"" and I think he has phenomenal skill. His acting skills are cool too, but I also wasn't buying Evigan's acting. The first half of the movie, especially with the 410 Crew, sounded like they were reading straight from the script. No emotion; just words. That made me think of ""You Got Served"" again, which had to be the worst acting I've ever seen. ""Breakin' and ""Breakin' 2"" also had bad acting, but the dancing was so tight that I didn't even care.<br/><br/>This movie also had more clich√©s than a little bit: 1) a guy and a girl sitting in a tree kissing (Are you serious? And who climbs trees with a dress on?); 2) a guy and a girl kissing in the rain; 3) the entire crowd in the final scene going out through what looked like a storm and not one person put up an umbrella (Sistas are NOT trying to get their hair wet; ask one sista you know right now to go stand outside in the rain and see how she looks at you); 4) no reason whatsoever that Moose should've been a nerd nor was that character developed enough; 5) Andie's crew went to the club to show off their new moves but they acted like they were new to the neighborhood, which doesn't make any sense considering Andie used to be in 410 Crew and Chase frequented this area and danced in the very beginning of the movie (How do you make someone look inexperienced who has experience from years of practicing?) Pros: The el train scene at the beginning of the movie kicked this movie into high gear, and I was immediately entertained. I loved the dude (Alfred ""Black"" Thomas) who plays Tuck, although I wish he'd take that scowl off his face every once in awhile. I checked him out in ""Stomp the Yard,"" but I got to really admire his dancing in this film. I always enjoy watching Channing Tatum because he dances so tight and puts a little stank in his moves, almost like he's also influenced by traditional African dancing with the popping. Robert Hoffman was ridiculous as usual, and I'd like to see a dance off between him and Channing. I wish Mari Koda played the female lead because she killed her role in this movie. It's about time that movies started incorporating the Asian influence in hip hop; I know Japanese people who live and breathe it harder than the average person in the club. Everything about her dancing was polished. However, the person who really caught my attention was Moose (Adam G. Sevani). That cat was SICK! If I saw him walking down the street, I wouldn't peg him as a hip hop head, but everything about his moves told me he's been dancing for a long time, and if he hasn't, he sure fooled me. To put it plain, there were a couple of girls that I took notice of, but overall, the guys outshined them in this movie. And I was so amped to see the JabbaWockeez. They are one of the best crews I've ever seen in my entire life.<br/><br/>Would I want to see this movie again? No. Will I buy it? Nope, renting it was fine. But I still have faith that someday there will be a hip hop movie that I can go ""That's it! That has all of the elements--great acting, excellent dancing, and an unpredictable plot."" At least I hope so because this movie plot was about as recycled as the blue bag program."
"henner028","3","1","3","9 July 2008"," Doesn't Even Compare to the First Movie
","First off let me just say that this movie was not horrible, but in my opinion it didn't even compare to the first Step Up movie (which BTW I would absolutely say is one of my top 10 movies).At first I couldn't believe that they were making a Step Up 2 without the two lead roles in the first Step Up ( HOTT Channing Tatum and the GORGEOUS Jenna Dewan)that made the first Step Up movie such a success. I saw the movie Step Up 2 with a bunch of my friends when it first came out, HOPING that it would be as good as the first one.BOY WAS I WRONG. I gave this movie 2 stars truly based on dancing. And even that wasn't all so great! All the dances looked the same and they all looked like they were trying to hard, or showing off- unlike Channing which unlike him it looked like it just came natural! Watching Hiphop after hip-hop after hip-hop just got boring and The storyline was absolutely horrible and the two lead characters had no chemistry whatsoever. Now that I'm thinking about it I probably would have never seen this movie if I hadn't been for Channing Tatum in it. AND I BET THAT NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SAW THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IF IT HADNT BEEN FOR CHANNING TATUM IN THAT ONE SCENE! In my opinion no one can touch Channing Tatum's dance moves and at least in the first Step Up movie they had variety of ballet and hip hop dancing. I can honestly say that after seeing the first Step Up I immediately said ""I HAVE TO OWN THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT"" and with Step Up 2 I was very disappointed and also a bit annoyed that they would even think about making a sequel to a movie that didn't need one.And if they were to make a sequel it should have definitely had Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan in it. So If you want to see this movie do not go into it hoping for it to beat out the original Step Up, but go into it to get a good listening of music. As most of you can probably tell by reading this I am ADDICTED to Step Up (the original) and the Hottest actor on earth: Channing Tatum. Sorry, he just is amazingly gorgeous. Female FACT.<333 One last thing I have to say * Channing Tatum is hot as hell and ya'll are stupid to put a semi good looking guy as the male lead in the sequel!* HOPE I HELPED :]"
"winterbabylover","10","1","4","20 April 2008"," great movie
","i loved this movie. it has to be one of the best dance movies i've ever seen. i don't agree with some comments made about it. I thought all parts of the movie were excellent including the acting. the end dance scene was probably the BEST dance scene i've ever seen in a movie. If you want to see a movie that has excellent dancing, a great cast, MORE than decent acting and gives you a great feeling at the end of it, see this. The dancing in this movie just makes you want to become a professional dancer, all the dance scenes are really enthusiastic and gives a great energy and vibe from it. Even though its a movie, it projects all this through the screen. To anyone that thinks this is a bad movie, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, however if you have not seen this, i would like you to take not from this comment. Great movie."

","Step Up 2 The streets was such an amazing movie. The dancing was so cool the way they did it. The dance scenes that they did were in all different types of areas. There was also a love story to it a little bit. The love story was very good though and fit right in with the story of the movie. I thought that it was better than the first step up because it was very different and wasn't the same at all. The acting in it was pretty good as well. I didn't think that their would be much of a story to it but their was. It made you want to get up and clap and cheer for the dancers in it. The dancers in it did a great job dancing as well, and learning how to dance. The end of this movie had very long dance scenes as well and seemed like it was never going to end which was a good thing.

","I won't include a synopsis. I will say this film was worth the watch, although unless you're a dance fan, maybe wait for the DVD release. An easy film to view - not taxing on the grey matter at all, and I don't mean that as a criticism. It was great fun. At times, laugh out loud. I was surprised how good the acting was overall. The main players were (gorgeous!)and believable, if not a little clich√©. The character 'Moose' deserves a special mention. Yes, it's cheesed up to the eyeballs in parts, and at times I wished they'd just cut to more dancing, but this was not enough to spoil the overall enjoyment. The film really comes into it's own with the awesome soundtrack and amazing dance routines. I don't normally watch films like this. I'm glad I did. Made me want to go out dancing."

And yes the storyline is rather predictable but to be honest, so are most films in this genre. <br/><br/>The dancing was different to the first Step up hence the title ""the streets"" and it was refreshing to see more diverse choreography, particularly the final dance scene.<br/><br/>Not to be missed were the surprising comic factor and of course the amazing soundtrack.<br/><br/>Definitely one to watch if you like dance films."

","So once upon a time my little sister tells me to see Step Up, as I myself am a pro dancer and she assumed I would like it. It was showing in-flight so I stayed up and watched it. Afterwards I was angry because I would've rather slept for the 2 hours.<br/><br/>So I get invited to see Step Up 2 at an advance screening and expected the worst. As soon as I recognized BBoy Crumbs in the first scene I knew the dancing would be good. And it was. The producers did their homework with casting proper dancers, there are some world famous BBoys (breakdancers) in this movie (Crumbs, K-Mel, Machine). Not to mention some great Poppers & HipHop dancers. (including a cameo by the Jabbawockeez crew) The acting is a bit cheesy as you would expect, but we do end up feeling for the characters. The plot is quite silly and very predictable.<br/><br/>If you like street dancing, see the movie for the choreographed scenes.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7/10 If you don't like dancing 4/10"
"eve_dolluk","6","1","4","21 March 2008"," Watch the film for the dancing and energy
","OK to start out i'd give the story a 3 and the acting a 2 out of 10. The story is pretty much in the same vain as Sister Act 2 or Bring it On. I have to admit that the best parts of the film was the dancing scenes the rest was just fodder to support this. Having said that there were a few amusing one liners thrown in. For the main part the acting was corny wooden and cringe worthy but if you can try and ignore that (its quite hard to do) then you can enjoy this film. The dancing is great and full of energy and the final dance is brilliant, probably the best I have seen and the hairs stood on the back of my neck. Not since Flashdance have i been inspired by dance from a film. If you like dancing or want to watch some good dancing then this is worth watching. If your looking for anything else then please avoid."
"jemps918","6","1","4","16 March 2008"," Entertaining and enjoyable; even to non-hiphop fans
","Entertaining and enjoyable; even to non-hiphop fans (like me), if you're eager to see something fun and new. Step Up 2: The Streets does not pretend to have a major plot and achieves its goal of delivering a good number of well choreographed dance teasers to keep you patient for the grand finale, even with the incredibly blah dialogue.<br/><br/>This version will obviously be compared to its predecessor Step Up, which was unexpectedly delightful. The plot is still trite but while the former focused on second chances and the chemistry of its likable leads (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum), the story in Step Up 2, focused on an issue (encapsulated in the movie's tagline: It's not where you're from. It's where you're at), however, the cast, albeit obviously talented, lacked the charisma of the former movie's stars.<br/><br/>Andie (Briana Evigan) is the usual rebel without a cause, with a way-fierce underground dance crew 410. To connect the first movie into this one, Tyler (Tatum) returns as her pseudo-big brother who sets her straight by beating her at a dance-off. Andie has to stay in an uptight school for the arts and runs into resident boy-band looker Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman), who also happens to be the director Blake Collins (Will Kemp)' brother and ex-boyfriend to the school's triple threat (sings, dances and acts) Sophie (played by singer Cassie Ventura). Teen drama ensues culminating in the street dance contest.<br/><br/>Evigan is charming enough and talented because she doesn't dance self-consciously. Hoffman is great but his face just isn't as handsome as Kemp, who was brilliant but seemed too young for the role. Cassie doesn't get to showcase the wunderkind she was supposed to be and just has a few snivelly moments of longing. Of all the comic relief characters painfully included, the season of the cool nerd has truly arrived as Moose (Adam Sevani), a David Spade-ish character, gets to be the hip geek. Sadly, the Asian stereotype is still unbroken, with Jenny Kido (Mari Koda)'s character of weirdo with the accent. Well, at least they didn't make her a karate kid, cello prodigy or a math whiz."

This sequel makes a little note to the first one, reprising his role in a guest shot by Channing Tatum as Tyler Kage from the first one, but other then that this movie stands on it's own. It starts with Andie(Briana Evigan) is a member of a dance group called the 411, and can't seem to stay out of trouble, but is giving one more chance when she gets an audition, and ends up passing a school for the performing arts, during that time she meets up with Chase Collins(Robert Hoffman) an another aspiring dancer, in which they start out rocky, but gets better has it goes on. But school takes up too much of Andies time, and her crew dumps her. But Andie and Chase try to put there own crew together. But taking the schools most talented outcasts, and making them into a team. But will they make it? You'll half to see the movie to find out.

","If you are a teenager and you have already seen Step Up, then you already know about the sequel Step Up 2 The Streets and I am damn sure you have already seen the trailer...well the wait is finally over. The second part meet us again with the infamous Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and his already grown up sister Andie (Briana Evigan), who is trying to put the troubled teenager in the right path by arranging an audition for her in the Maryland School of Arts. The following events are teenage movie by the book . There is the coolest guy in the school, Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman) that happens to be the brother of one of the founders of the school and the best dancer there as well. He is a street dancer in disguise who finds a mutual friend in the face of Andie. Andie is a talented brake-dancer, part of a street crew, which compete (surprise!) on the streets, and is torn between them and the school she have to attend in order to prevent being sent to some aunt in Texas. There is a spark between her and Chase as you might guess. The characters are a bit shallow, the plot is as predictable as Sunday morning and as good as the acting is it does not seem convincing at all. The reasons the characters follow and the way they develop are not quite clear. Andie's character seems like a rebel without a cause, because the battle they are trying to win has already been won in the first Step Up movie. It is not all bad though. There are a lot of other fresh new faces and a witty dialogue here and there and absolutely breathtaking dancing sequences . The first 10 minutes in the movie and they are dancing it off on the underground train. Throughout the whole movie the weepy little dialogues and little moral conversations are conveniently tucked between outstanding dance routines. They are vivid, dynamic and different. This is a dance movie and when it comes to that it delivers one hundred per cent."

I'm sorry, next time Hollywood will just have everyone get shot in a drive by, nope, wait, you will STILL COMPLAIN! You work in Hollywood than, people are so much more eager to whine than compliment. Stereotypes are annoying too but yet again, I'm sure you would still complain if it were white guys (calling them idiots or something) or if the black guys were all rosy (calling them idiots or something). If you haven't caught on, Hollywood has those options to choose from and they choose what they believe is the lesser of grievances. To the movie, I thought it was great and inspirational. Sure, clich√É¬©'d (once again, what isn't these days, w/ almost 7 billion people its hard to avoid) but awesome. The dance scenes were beyond beautiful. Gotta love Mr. Hoffmann too, he is a very talented dancer, go him!

The movie is great! But not as good as the first one,inspite of more dancing ;]"

","This is a great story but I cannot help but recognize that in the trivia they failed to mention a slight but also obvious trivial note. What is it you may ask well if any of you are Channing Tatum fans like myself you must have also seen the 2006 theatrical release ""She's the man"" a funny comedy starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Bynes. Anyways in that movie Robert Hoffman plays Amanda's boyfriend in the beginning and in the first ""Step up"" movie Channing Tatum plays the lead male and in ""step up 2"" Robert Hoffman plays the lead male. Luckily a movie expert such as myself can be so certain of these things that I can notice them even before anyone else. Hopefully you found this as interesting as I did."

","To start with most of the comments on this movie -and most of the other dance movies- are harsh just because -i think- they are compared with really good movies. We can't compare this kind of movies with ""decent"" movies (when i say decent, i mean movies which are made as a form of art and has any concern of winning a couple of awards, or at least trying to highlight something). Most of these dance movies are made to entertain, and i think we all should consider this while we're criticizing. After that's said, Step Up 2: The Streets didn't give me what I've expected (but that's probably because I overrated it in my head). I wanted to see a better film and much better dancing than Step Up. However as a movie it was much below Step Up and dancing didn't really passed it either. Plot was predictable and everything. I must say this doesn't mean the movie wasn't good (remember I'm not thinking of it as a classic or anything).. It was good alright, it was fun and jumpy as it should be.. It made me and everybody leaving the theater want to dance.. And I think that is the point of the movie anyway.. So it has done it's purpose.. I totally recommend it to people who are interested in dancing (particularly street dancing)you would LOVE it (i know i did). But it would be foolish to expect the best movie of the year (it can be the funnest.. maybe). As a last word: if you want to see a fun movie this is for you.. but if you want a great movie with great acting, light, script, direction, etc. go search for something else leave this for the dance lovers."
