","Not as bad as some people made it out to be. Great acting by most...even Nargis Fakhri isn't too weird. The script was criticized as weak by many, but I think it requires a certain sympathy on ones part to really understand the characters and their feelings and actions."

","Rockstar is a film made once in a lifetime. Hats off to Imtiaz Ali for story, Ranbir Kapoor & Nargis Farkhri for scintillating performances, A.R. Rahman & Mohit Chauhan for great soundtrack & background Music.<br/><br/>Rockstar is a must watch film. It'll leave you feel-good hangover of itself. This Movie shows how Love Stories should be made. This movie has something, which is hard to see in other Hindi/Bollywood Films. Something which would make you think about the whole movie even after so many hours of watching it. Watch it deeply and you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>I loved the movie and enjoyed it thoroughly after so watching so many movies this year, I'd say Watch it Again, if you've seen it once...<br/><br/>Verdict: Don't Miss it!!!<br/><br/>Acting & Performance: 9/10<br/><br/>Story: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Music: 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"
"vaibhav_bhandeo","10","80","100","12 November 2011"," A New Star Is Born - RockStar
","First of all, Rockstar is not a mere love story, for those people I saw drawing conclusion that this is just an extramarital affair which is justified by Imtiaz Ali, it's much more than that.<br/><br/>When the character of protagonist was getting built, it was told to him that it would be pain that would get the star out of him; movie is journey of making of a Rock star who goes through pain of separation, depravity from society which makes him someone he was never meant to be but finally a Rockstar. A true blue eyed boy who was always away from any sense of pain in his life until he falls in love and tore apart life of his and love of his life Heer.<br/><br/>I am although not a big Rock music fan but got food for thought for those posthumous rock stars that lost their lives to depression and drugs. This film gives gray shades of their tainted life which is always open to so much of public scrutiny which perhaps helped me to recon with their hysterical behavior.<br/><br/>It starts with a young lad trying to make big in music but who doesn't have soul to sell himself as a serious artist. He has shown a way through love and betrayal and he fancies his chances with the most admired girl of the town, little does he know that this would embark an endless journey of pain for both which would see it's penultimate end being both leads battling for their survival literally.<br/><br/>I don't wish to discuss movie dynamics in length as this is not about how the script has been written with/without conviction. The real sense of conviction in this movie comes through Ranbir Kapoor, he lives the character of Jordan and gives performance of his life time. Not in for a second you would think for the entire movie that he is a movie star, you would watch him struggle through his pathos. Kudos to him for pulling this off with such great ease, I couldn't imagine anyone doing this role and leave the same impression. Nargis who is the leading lady in this movie, looks no less than an angel in movie and gives a performance for which any new comer can feel proud about especially against such a strong character played by Ranbir Kapoor.<br/><br/>Of all the loudest praise should go to two people, A.R. Rehman for his genius music and to Mohit Chauhan, this movie is as much a milestone for him as it is for Ranbir Kapoor. Both Mohit and Ranbir jells so well that it's hard to believe that actually Ranbir's voice is backed by a singer, it's a compliment for both of them. Every song stands out and they all are superb.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this journey of making of a Rock star. This movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist; it's about how much pain it goes in making a real Rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldn't ground his foot correctly. Movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero Jordan who don't have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music, a picture perfect depiction of a rebel Rock star to the core.<br/><br/>Watch it, if you are in for dark movies. Don't expect any Bollywood masala but an intense tide of emotions throughout."
"vikas_rawat","10","114","146","12 November 2011"," 'Rockstar' leaves you with a feel-good hangover of itself, that is hard to digest at first watch.
","Love stories have always been Bollywood's thing. A trifle here and there might have changed over the years, but the formulaic love story, the one that we've all grown up on and savored, always takes you by the hand, guides you through the film's ups and downs and leaves you at an ending. But when you have a story as new, as fresh and as free-falling as the one in Imtiaz Ali's 'Rockstar', then these are times that herald a new change in today's Bollywood.<br/><br/>The story goes something like this. Janardhan Jakkad(JJ a.k.a Jordan), a Delhi simpleton, has always wanted to be a rockstar. His friend/mentor and college canteen manager, Khatana, gives him a 'get-your-heart-broken-and-you-will-be-a-rockstar' solution. JJ automatically aims for the prettiest chick on campus, Heer, sure to have his heart broken. But what follows is a story that goes from a simple one of fame-mongering to a love story most unusual. The chapter of Jordan and Heer never seems to end and their complexities take them on a path that would ultimately destroy their lives.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to characterize the movie with a single emotion. It is so beautifully layered that it will take repeated viewings to form a consensus within yourself as to WHY you love the film. Just like its soundtrack, 'Rockstar' is a movie you will have to allow to grow on you. The film can best be described as a heady cocktail of love and fame and how each has an effect on the other. It's the free-falling nature of the story that gives it a feeling never before experienced in Indian cinema. The movie borders on self-indulgence every once in a while but wonderfully balances it out with realism.<br/><br/>The music, composed by A.R. Rahman, is in many ways a character in the film. Every phase of Jordan's life is characterized by a song which magically sets the tone for the next few minutes, till the next song or sequence comes along and changes the mood. The music, in many ways, drives the film. Its very obvious now why Imtiaz Ali replaced usual collaborator Pritam with Rahman. Without the type and scale of the music Rahman has given for this film, 'Rockstar' would have been very handicapped. The music truly forms the soul of the film. Also, from the snow covered mountains of Kashmir and Himachal and the dingy discotheques to the old-architecture of Prague and the various concert venues, the film looks beautiful in almost every shot, thanks to ace cinematographer Anil Mehta. The right variations in angle, color and focus gives the film a biographical feel where the scenes portray an emotion as much as the actors in them do.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the performances. The film has few characters and each of them are well-defined. Aditi Rao plays the journalist Sheena, who tracks Jordan's life and though she has precious little to do, she plays her part. Piyush Mishra as the shrewd record company owner Dhingra, is the quintessential greedy man in the film and does well too. Kumud Mishra as Khatana, Jordan's old friend and manager is perfect and brings in a certain sincerity and authenticity to his part. Shammi Kapoor as the shehnai maestro Ustad Jameel Khan is absolutely charming every time he appears on screen. It is hard to miss the glint in his eye and these being his last shots, will always be what 'Rockstar' will be remembered for. Now for the two lead actors. Nargis Fakri is unfortunately, the weakest link in the film. She obviously has a lot to learn in the acting department. She blatantly disappoints in scenes where she is required to do more than just look pretty, and ends up as the cold dish in 'Rockstar'. Nonetheless, she does look good in every frame and with better acting, could go places. With her current form, she will find it tough to make a mark.<br/><br/>However, 'Rockstar' completely belongs to Ranbir Kapoor, who has clearly gives this film his all. He plays his part with utmost perfection and with a depth that is so rare in Bollywood these days. Through the film, it is Jordan, and not Ranbir Kapoor, that we see on screen. He earnestly brings out the character transition from JJ to Jordan with such ease, that this could very well be his career-defining performance. He's clearly left his contemporaries WAY behind. Ranbir Kapoor, as of now, owns Bollywood.<br/><br/>Having dared to make such an experimental film, director Imtiaz Ali is truly the new-age doyen of Indian Cinema. His refreshing take on love stories, from 'Jab We Met' to 'Love Aaj Kal', continues with 'Rockstar' which will be remembered for a long time as the first movie of its kind. Truly original and truly inspired from all the right sources, Imtiaz Ali is the new age phenomenon of modern love in cinema.<br/><br/>Truly magical and spell-binding, 'Rockstar' leaves you with a feel-good hangover of itself, that is hard to digest at first watch. I'd give it a 4/5.<br/><br/>Don't miss."
"Theonlydev","10","18","21","19 November 2011"," Excellent piece of work
","Jordan is sitting among prostitutes and strumming his guitar as they sing together -- when his manager pulls him out onto the street. Soon, a crowd engulfs them and starts chanting Jordan's name, their voices drowning the sound of the manager pleading with the musician to get his act together. ""This is what I have always wanted,"" Jordan says, looking at his screaming fans. ""But I am not happy inside.""<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar is a bittersweet journey of a man, an artist, from being an everyman to a superstar. But while Ali uncovers layers off Jordan the iconic musician -- each layer as fascinating as it is intriguing -- he keeps the core of the character, Janardhan Jakkad, alive. He hurts like anybody else, falls in love like anybody else, and also has to deal with moments of sheer frustration.<br/><br/>And all of it finds release in music. Music is Jordan's identity; it's what makes him rich and famous. But to Jordan, that's incidental. In the end, his artistry is what connects him with himself. For a Hindi film viewer, that is a fascinating story to watch unfold.<br/><br/>Then there's the opening shot, a tribute to India's original Rockstar, Shammi Kapoor. From there on, it's a tumultuous ride – one with its highs and lows, one that has anguish as also love, one that has pain, but also a sense of fulfillment. And a brilliant finale -- not a conventional one, but effective nonetheless -- which leaves you feeling like the characters themselves: incomplete but content, like an effective crescendo that leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>The music itself is a delight. Each AR Rahman number is lilting, and woven beautifully in the story, the high frequency of songs not hindering the storytelling but enhancing the experience. Lyricist Irshad Kamil does an outstanding job, penning words that reflect the lead character's state of mind and complement situations aptly.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali, in trademark fashion though, isn't content with Focussing on the complexities of a troubled musician; he gives us a dose of romance too, and a generous one at that. Estrangement from family, lack of fulfillment in life, and self-discovery apart, what really drives Jordan's music is his relationship with Heer (Fakhri, beautiful but awkward). Volatile as the affair is, it's also what keeps Jordan sane, and Heer alive.<br/><br/>For about 15 minutes in Rockstar, the narrative tends to resort to 'Bollywoodism'; true love having the power to cure a terminal illness (almost), for example, doesn't exactly fit with what the rest of the film has to say. The story tends to meander a bit post-interval, but Imtiaz makes it work eventually, interweaving the fantastical romantic part of the film with the more gritty, dark bits deftly. In the end, how much you enjoy Rockstar will largely depend on whether the balance between the tale of a broken, discontented musician and the more conventional love story works for you.<br/><br/>It did for me -- though I would have preferred the former -- but you can't deny Imtiaz credit for his mastery over the romance genre. No contemporary filmmaker has dealt with man-woman relationships with as much dexterity. His films often tread a similar path (the lovers are usually confused, meet at different points in life, and there's always the 'other man'), but his fresh approach to each story is what makes them immensely watchable.<br/><br/>With Rockstar, Imtiaz goes beyond his own tried-and-tested format, his ambition to narrating a more complex story coming through. This is probably his most personal film, and his honesty as filmmaker is hard not to be affected by. Hopefully, he goes the whole hog next, ditching the genre he's adept at to trying his hand at something entirely out of his comfort zone. Rockstar is also Imtiaz's most technically polished film, and he benefits from the association with cinematographer Anil Mehta and editor Aarti Bajaj.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor has been Hindi cinema's Next Big Thing for a while now. With Rockstar, he lives up to the hopes pinned on him to deliver big. Ranbir revels in Jordan's complexities; another actor may have found it to be an obstacle. The character arc undergoes constant transformation and he adapts suitably. It wouldn't be an understatement to say that Ranbir's portrayal of Jordan may go down as one of Hindi cinema's most accomplished performances by a lead actor. Just to see him work his magic on screen, Rockstar is worth a watch.<br/><br/>But while good acting is always an incentive, it's a director's vision that makes a film truly watchable, and Imtiaz makes Rockstar stand out from what the mainstream churns out every week. And brings back the one aspect sorely missing from Hindi films lately -- music."
"ssvikas","8","36","46","13 November 2011"," Ranbir's stellar performance nearly makes up for the movie's flaws
","Even if you ignore his surname for a moment, Ranbir Kapoor is arguably one of the most naturally talented actors in today's Bollywood. In addition to this, his good looks ensure female fan following, read: rake in more moolah. His 'Rockstar' may have just been his most intense and splendid performance till date. <br/><br/>'Rockstar' begins at a concert in Rome and someone scuffling with ruffians. It is soon revealed that the 'someone' is Jordan, a major rockstar, labeled a bad-boy by the media and someone who hardly smiles. Cut to his college days, there's the simple Janardan Jahkar or JJ strumming his guitar and singing for the local audience and his days in the college canteen gorging samosas and idolizing Jim Morrison.<br/><br/>When his well-wisher and canteen manager Katana, played impressively by Kumud Mishra tells him that a true artist needs to be driven by hurt and anguish, JJ curses his simple and incident-free life. Just to get his heart broken, he chases the college bombshell, Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri). Eventually, it turns out that under the prim and proper exterior Heer is thrill-seeker and the two become wild friends. <br/><br/>What begins as a fun-filled friendship takes different shades as the time passes. On one hand, Heer drowns into depression without our hero, whom she re-christens as 'Jordan'. And, Jordan's yearning for her company brings out the performer in him.<br/><br/>In what is probably the best portrayal of what goes on in a creative head, the story brings depth and makes its audience feel for JJ. Despite the negative publicity he gets as Jordan, he's a simple guy who yearns for love. Noticeably, it is only after his tryst with Heer that his motive in life changes from chasing success to something else. During the process, success merely becomes a byproduct he is least interested in. <br/><br/>Director Imtiaz Ali plays around with the story's chronology. It is likely that the editors too may have actually lost track in between. Repeated scenes, songs and too much of flash-back or forth gets annoying after a point. The restlessness among the audience was very apparent as the movie seemed to go on forever. <br/><br/>Talking of performances, Ranbir surely has a line of awards waiting for him. Nargis Fakhri, the American with Pakistani antecedents who plays the leading lady is truly beautiful and has been a Kingfisher calendar girl; but not as gifted with acting skills. The film also marks Shammi Kapoor's last screen appearance as he plays an Ustaad who recognizes JJ's talent. Aditi Rao Hydari plays a small role as a Journalist.<br/><br/>AR Rahman's music is integral to the story and songs have already become runaway hits. 'Sadda Haq', 'Kun Faya Kun', 'Jo Bhi Main', with Mohit Chauhan as the Rockstar's voice and 'Katiya Karun' give the album an eclectic blend of rock, desi flavor and Sufi mysticism. Again, some more awards are in the waiting here.<br/><br/>Cinematography too is well done, especially the jerky shots and quirky angles that capture the actors' emotions effectively. Be it the by lanes of Delhi, picturesque Europe or Breathtaking beautiful Kashmir winter, the excellence with the camera is undeniable. The realistic costumes complement the camera work. <br/><br/>The dialog is very smart and the first half evokes laughter and stands up ably as things turn serious in the second half. You may blame the script for some of its flaws, but asking for perfection when portraying emotions and out of the ordinary relationships is a monumental challenge. So, to say, it's a job moderately well done.<br/><br/>So, should you be watching this movie? The answer is a resounding 'Yes'! Granted, the story gets a little lost in the second half, but the rest of the goodies will make you overlook its flaws. The movie is powerful enough to keep you thinking much after you are out of the movie hall. If you still haven't seen it, go for it!"
"monty_elvis","10","20","24","15 November 2011"," Honest
","Not every movie needs to have tadka, it's a movie which is pure from heart and honest. It doesn't speak about anything other than attraction which can't be explained.<br/><br/>Sure it has it's flaws but if you can look over them and watch it with a warm heart, it stays with you well after you have left the theater. <br/><br/>Hats off to Imtiaz Ali for daring to break the shell. Jab we met was fun to watch and a good movie, but Rockstar shows how much depth can be reached in a romantic movie without even saying the L word even once.<br/><br/>Everything said, watch it if you appreciate good cinema and not because you are looking for a stereotypical complete Bollywood package."

"raxx111","10","34","48","14 November 2011"," Typical Imtiaz Ali style movie
","For me it was the most awaited movie for this year, especially after listening to the awesome songs. First of all the music, Rehman and Irshad Kamil did fabulously well. The music and songs were totally different from the regular bollywood style.<br/><br/>Ranbir was terrific and this was truly his best performance till date. He looked so natural that sometimes you feel that you are watching a live shot documentary or something.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali's direction as always was very good. He has a different style of making movies and this movie is a great example of that. Though my personal favorite from his lot is Love Aaj Kal.<br/><br/>The only loose part in the movie was Nargis. She was not up to the mark and some very good scenes and situations got spoiled because of her poor acting skills. And especially when pitted against the flawless Ranbir she looks pathetic to say the least. So, without disclosing anything from the story I'd say its a great movie and you surely can't afford to miss it."
"gurkirat1989","10","46","67","12 November 2011"," It is about a young successful musician how he become successful along with ups n down in love.
","Ranbir is committed in his disturbed Desi rocker avatar and his abstention from any intoxicants makes him an idol who wouldn't corrupt his worshipers. Nargis blends divine beauty with lips that jive like she's in the movie, 'Finding Nemo'.Watching 'Rockstar' once is like watching it many times over, thanks to the repeated montages that sporadically recap the film. If you thought being stabbed once was bad, here's what a knife set can do.<br/><br/>The film drives home an unscientific hypothesis that people who've endured sufferings/ heart break/ loose motions etc will reach their creative best. By this logic, each person in the audience will be blessed with superhuman creativity as they step out after watching 'Rockstar'. Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! go n watch out u cant miss :D :D"

"rancidgrillz","7","56","86","11 November 2011"," A Movie that makes you think about it even when the lights are back on!!
","FILM: When you think about a film by Imtiaz Ali, you only see an entertainment tag to a film, and also very good script writing. But seeing the promos of Rockstar made me think what Imtiaz is up to now. After giving a great film like ""Jab We Met"" and a mediocre film like ""Love Aaj Kal"", I was expecting a cheesy Love Story with a good entertaining factor. I won't say this movie doesn't have any cheesiness, but yes it's in a very low dosage. People going for just entertainment will actually love half of the movie. People going to see a Romantic flick will love the whole film. There are some very good comic punches in the film, and some very humiliating parts too. I won't use any spoilers, but yes the first half is full of comic scenes.<br/><br/>ACTING: Ranbir kapoor is at his best here. After giving a great performance in Rajneeti, this guy has shown his serious part again, in more of sadder way. Nargis Fakhri is very good to look at, most part of the film you will just look at her and won't even hear what anybody is saying, but when you see her talking, the jaw just falls down, she does not have those acting skills at all, it's like the start of ""Katrina Kaif"" again. But she has a great future ahead of her for sure. Kumud Mishra and Piyush Mishra never disappointed in their acting, both did a great job, especially Piyush Mishra.<br/><br/>DIRECTION & CINEMATOGRAPHY: Now the direction was really top notch in this movie, it was particularly flawless in every aspect. Imtiaz has a tendency to deepen the character development, and he has done this with great enthusiasm. The character Development of the ""Rockstar"" is very good and keeps you on your seat. The Cinematography was also great, from the walking sides of Delhi University to the scenarios of Kashmir and Prague was immensely intriguing.<br/><br/>STORY: The Story of the movie had some parts that all Hindi romantic have usually, for a time you would wonder of a ""Yash Raj"" film being shown. But the turn of events and the whole movement of the story were good. The only problem being that the whole movie was a ""drag/stretch"". This movie if made shorter, would have gained more audience.<br/><br/>MUSIC: I would say the music (by A.R. Rahman) is damn good. From ""Jo Bhi Main"" to ""Tum Ho"", the scores are really beautiful, and stays in your head for a very long time. Sadda Haq already being the favorite among the youth has a good adrenaline rush factor in it. The movie being pretty much mediocre, the music actually makes the movie very good.<br/><br/>VERDICT: I would go for<br/><br/>FILM: 7/10<br/><br/>ACTING: 7/10<br/><br/>DIRECTION & CINEMATOGRAPHY: 6/10<br/><br/>STORY: 6/10<br/><br/>MUSIC: 9/10<br/><br/>OVERALL: 7.5/10<br/><br/>The movie has been given a great artistic touch to it, which is hard to see in a Bollywood film. Such that it makes you think about the whole movie even after 24 hours of watching it. Give it time to indulge in your mind, it will actually get to your soft spot, and you would say, ""The movie was really sad""!!"
"neilvincentck","Null","42","64","11 November 2011"," Soulful!
","Rockstar is a beautiful painting on a canvas. It's a journey through the soul of a musician; mellow and bitter sweet. It's not a feel good movie or even an actual tale. It has gaps as glaring as a 30 foot wide goal post but Rockstar has a soul and that keep you fixed to the screen long after the goal! <br/><br/>I liked Rockstar for three reasons; AR Rahman, the visuals and Ranbir Kapoor. A R Rahman has weaved magic and the music would be stuck in your head long after the movie; 'Saddha Haq'is raw and full of energy and will gets your fists pumping in the air. The visuals are simply scintillating; there would definitely be more Indians holidaying in Prague and Kashmir now. Anil Mehta deserves the kudos for the cinematography; Kashmir will take your breath away but the lapses quickly bring it back. Rockstar has great humor! <br/><br/>It's refreshing to see Bollywood have well written clean and neat humor. It's funny and does leave you in splits! The ideology that only pain begets music is a little retarded though! The movie progresses at its own pace with the music and visuals. Rockstar is not a statement or even the tale of most rock stars; it just is.<br/><br/>AR Rahman music is alone worth going to the film; soulful and very Sufi in nature. The 14 tracks in the movie are simply a testament to the genius he is. The rawness of the music has an addictive aura to it and will mesmerize you. <br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor, I must say has matured into a fine young actor; with élan and crisp he blends the several layers of his character seamlessly into one. He's not acting, he's living it! Imitaz Ali has definitely grown as a director since Jab we met & Love Aaj Kal. Rockstar is loosely based on a friend of his, but he manages to pen it right. This is definitely not his best work but it pulls through. <br/><br/>What you will find hard to digest is the logic used that leaves you numb. Aarti Bajaj could have edited Rockstar better to make it edgy but you would not want to change that because you would risk hurting the soul of Rockstar. <br/><br/>Nagris Fakri is the new Katrina Kaif and has done an outstanding job considering that this is her debut. Shammi Kapoor spoke with his eyes and what a tribute it was to him. <br/><br/>Rockstar is no 'Dabaang' or 'Singham'; not a movie for the masses but it appeals to you. RB has the charm to keep you stuck to the screen. Frankly, Rockstar could be the perfect cure for the Ra One hangover. It's not a great movie, but it will suffice to rid of the week! It's a half baked chocolate cake. Who cares; it's chocolate anyway! Baked or half baked!"

"comedevil","9","11","14","14 November 2011"," An emotional and powerful journey.
","Even though the Indian film Industry releases countless big budget films every year, only once in a while there comes a movie like ""Rockstar"" which moves away from the usual story and casts an impression on the viewers.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali has created such a masterpiece this time. His story is a fresh take on romance and pain and he has shown he is one of the best directors around.<br/><br/>The story revolves around 2 characters Janardhan Jakhar a.k.a Jordan(Ranbir Kapoor) and Heer(Nargis Fakri) and their feelings towards each other. The special thing about this movie is that despite being a love story, the lead characters never act as the clichéd lovers..they never said ""I love you"" throughout the movie and still their love was so intense and powerful..The self inflicted pain of 'Jordan' is the soul of this movie and moves the audience.<br/><br/>Ranbir has done a remarkable act and has again proved he is an exceptional actor in the film industry. His transition from the innocent and confused 'JJ' to the ruthless, shattered 'Jordan' is flawless. The audience were in awe of him throughout the movie and rightly so.<br/><br/>The music blends with this movie perfectly and most of the time lifts the movie to higher levels. The voice of Mohit Chauhan along with the expertise of AR Rahman is just superb and this duo will be in demand for a long time. The joy, enlightenment, pain and suffering of 'Jordan' is portrayed very well through the songs. And this is one of those movies in which you feel that the songs weren't just forced in the story.<br/><br/>Despite everything being so good there was one shortcoming, Nargis. The model turned actress had weird expressions in few scenes in her debut film. This created some funny moments in the first half but she did a convincing act post interval.<br/><br/>One thing which the director couldn't balance was the pace..The first half was expanded into few years showing the pair's love and relationship but post interval they didn't do that, and stuck to a straight and small period with longer scenes. This gave most of the general audience an idea that it was slow. If the story in between intervals was balanced in terms of the time span, more people would have appreciated the whole movie.<br/><br/>This an emotional, and an intense journey of a simple man who goes on a path of self destruction. A Must Watch, this movie needs deep understanding and appreciation."

","Rockstar is one of the best movie of 2011. It has the much needed thing called a ""STORY"". Movies like this release once in a blue moon. The movie is directed by Imtiaz Ali . The cast has a young actor Ranbir Kapoor supported by débutant Nargis Fakhri. The music is given by the Oscar winning musician A.R.Rehman and songs are sung by Mohit Chauhan. <br/><br/>Janaradan Jakhar (Ranbir Kapoor) – his friends at Hindu College call him JJ – is a rotten seed for his ultra-conservative family. So all he receives at home is scorn and ridicule. <br/><br/>The owner of the college canteen, where the young man whiles away his time day-dreaming over endless plates of samosas, tells him he cannot be the path-breaking musician that he wants to be until he experiences genuine pain and heartbreak.<br/><br/>JJ finds both love and loss in the form of the rich and statuesque Heer, a Kashmiri girl who blows hot and cold, as he mutates into a rockstar, Jordan. A rebel is born.<br/><br/>Read more at: http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_Review.aspx?id=673&cp Nargis Fakhri as the seemingly straight-laced but 'wild at heart' girl who decides to give vent to her repressed desires before her imminent wedding also hits the right notes.<br/><br/>Nargis Fakhri as Heer has done an excellent job.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor, as JJ, makes a go for it with infectious intent. He gets the lingo and diction right; the gawky gait is delightfully apt.<br/><br/>AR Rahman's outstandingly lively and eclectic musical score presents a wide range of sounds blended into a harmonious whole. <br/><br/>Ranbir's Shammi Kapoor act on a boat on the Dal Lake (he sings Chand Sa Roshan Chehra) is probably worth the price of the ticket, if the recently deceased Bollywood icon's cameo in the film isn't. <br/><br/>Moreover, writer-director Imtiaz Ali's sensibility ensures that Rockstar, for the most part, steers well clear of the clichés that usually hound the average Bollywood love story.<br/><br/>Though there are many flaws in the movie but Ranbir with his performance covers it up. <br/><br/>verdict - Awesome movies guys just watch it. ratings - 9/10."
"saba2115","8","4","4","12 November 2011"," Imperfect Love of Perfect Lovers
","I have to say that watching this movie ALONE in an empty movie theatre added several dimensions to the whole experience of watching ROCKSTAR. <br/><br/>My first comment is to Imtiaz Ali-- What were you thinking, bro? To actually have the gumption to create a love story around the idea of ethereal and eternal love as envisioned by the great Sufi Master Rumi in the land of DABANGG and BODYGUARD? Did you really think that audiences (read THE COMMON MAN) would throng cinemas and multiplexes to get a taste of sublime love?<br/><br/>For sublime love is the thread that binds this beautiful bitter sweet tale together. It is a love story written in the idiom of NorthIndian/Kashmiri/Sufi culture, of dargahs, of spirituality, of Delhi University Campus insider jokes, of the topography of North India, especially Kashmir and I fear the film could be condemned with the ""E"" word--elitism. <br/><br/>The starting point of the story is a young ordinary low middle class callow youth who is a wannabe singer, strumming his guitar to ordinary lyrics hoping to make it big. He is accused of being shallow by his mentor and advised to seek out ""PAIN"" in order to light the creative spark, that divine glow that accompanies great art. Unbeknownst to him, his casual and frivolous flirtation with this search for angst leads him into the deep end where he has to come face to face first with true love and then with the inevitable pain that comes with it. <br/><br/>The dialogues are fabulous. So is the cinematography. The snow clad mountains of Kashmir and the misty mornings of New Delhi, the green fields full of flowers in Prague place the story in the here and now when in truth the story could belong to any era, any century, any epoch. The universality of love, the self realisation that comes with it, the realisation that this life is but a dream is what the movie is really about. The essence of the story is not in the physicality of love but love beyond the here and now, beyond right and wrong and love for the Creator who was there when there was nothing else.<br/><br/>See what I mean when I ask Imtiaz--what were you thinking, bro? <br/><br/>And now for the piece de resistance-the music, the lyrics, the singer. <br/><br/>If there were any doubts being expressed by the hoi polloi about A R Rehman's diminishing creativity well then, here is his rebuttal. <br/><br/>The music is earthy, rooted in our traditions and culture, and designed to rock. It's astonishing how Rehman is able to dive into the musical traditions of the Punjab to create the ""Saada Haq"" and ""Katiyaan Karoon"". Irshad Kamil's lyrics, if you take the time to listen to the songs and understand the words, are beyond compare. Mohit Chauhan's voice is eminently suitable for all the songs. My favorite is ""Naadaan parinde, ghar aajaa"" Listen to the lyrics and cry. <br/><br/>We have been enjoying a lot of junk food lately. Now it's time for some haute cuisine."
"rangdetumpy","Null","8","10","21 December 2011"," An awesome piece of Art by Imtiaz Ali
","Indian cinema has matured and specially Hindi film with new directors pouring in with new ideas. Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Vishal Bhardwaj should get special mention for their brilliant coming of age films. After Rockstar, Imtiaz Ali should be added to this category of filmmakers. Romantic cinema is immortal perennial but never ever it has been witnessed in such creative, symbolic, real manner as in Rockstar. Rockstar is journey of Janarthan, a regular north Delhi brat who dreams of becoming Jim Morrison. He even tries to match his initials with the famous singer and tries to change his fate. Alas! He couldn't succeed in making a mark when a college canteen owner (who becomes family for Janarthan later on) Khataria tells him that through pain comes music. Janarthan took his word too seriously thus involving in a web of suffering and success all revolving around Heer, a lady who becomes life for Janarthan rather Jordan. The movie is a journey of a young ambitious boy from his being Janarthan to Jordan and in a symbolic manner raises several questions about independence and democracy. Imtiaz Ali is a fabulous story teller and his previous work reflects those but with Rockstar he goes a level higher. The film will bring polarizing reactions from cine goers but they can't ignore it. Probably one of the best romantic cinemas ever made. Ali is almost flawless in his execution. With a semi non-linear narrative Ali goes into the psyche of Jordan merging his scenario pre and post success. The scene where Jordan cries in front of Khataria that he doesn't need all the fame he wants to be Happy – sums up Jordan's strive with his impression. The rebel has been created in a thought provoking manner raising questions to establishment. The rules set in the society, the willingness to live freely, how power has destroyed the regular course of nature – all these ideas have been embedded subtle in a brilliant love story that is natural unlike loud melodramatic blockbusters of regular Hindi cinema. When Jordan is almost losing Heer forever there is a scene which shows Jordan in a bath tub looking at his guitar on fire which reflects the life of present youth who tends to burn (loss) everything one loves in course of success. There are many more such brilliant sequences which show Ali's craftsmanship as a director. With able support from Anil Mehta the camera work is probably the best of this year. Ali didn't compromise for commerce and gave a surreal feel to the real proceedings. Kudos to Aarti Bajaj for her apt editing and making the film a work of art. Coming to the acting department, Ranbir Kapoor rocks. He camouflaged himself as Jordan with élan. Rockstar will prove how fine actor he is. In fact the new brigade of actors should take acting lessons from Ranbir. Watch his transition from Janarthan to Jordan, his success his failures his love his despair – Ranbir's expression deserves awards and accolades. Teaming up with fabulous actors like Piyush Mishra, Kumud Mishra (who was last seen in brilliant ""That girl in yellow boots"") Ranbir showed extreme maturity. In a sequence where he tore down a contract and made hysteric gestures towards Piyush Mishra deserves standing ovation. Those dialogues showing Ali's angst against consumerism deserves mention. Nargis Fakhri as Heer is serene beauty. Any boy will fall in love with her. As an actress she needs to improve but then she isn't bad either. Piyush Mishra as the opportunist Dhingra simply rocks as usual. Kumud Mishra is surely to catch attention of other directors. The ensemble cast provides ample support in their brief and significant role. Lastly how can one forget the original Rockstar Late Shammi Kapoor in a significant appearance. As a successful classical Sahnai (flute) player he is mind blowing. And how can I forget about Rehman's music in the film. Each of the songs are mark of a genius and brilliant in their own space. With awesome lyrics from Irshad Kamil the musical score elevates the movie to another level. ""Nadan parinday"" is one of the best written songs of recent times and ""Sadda Haq"" had all the power to be the youth anthem. Simply brilliant album in every sense. Overall Rockstar is a outstanding work of art that might not appeal to every many but sure to be the next Kagaz ke Phool in the long run; though Rockstar is already a Hit. Thankfully a genuine honest effort deserved its box office report. A classic in the long runRockstar Rocks!!"
"Rehan7","10","8","10","15 November 2011"," Un-Indianised, simply brilliant
","Lately i have had to go through the trauma of watching some rubbish, money motivated Bollywood flicks such as the prolonged ""bodyguard"" and the hideously scripted ""Ra-One"".<br/><br/>However, Rock-star is just on another level. It is the most gripping Bollywood film of the year. It reminds me of movies like ""Rock on"", ""Dil Chahta hai"", ""Rang de Basanti"". Because this like them is not a clichéd story, it is out of the box and very very different from the monotonous chocolate-love flicks.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was that there were no non-sense songs, all the songs made sense and were perfectly timed. The music by A.R Rehman is absolutely brilliant. Apart from that, it is very well directed, the way the director has played with the time-line is marvelous. The time-line keeps the viewer glued to the screen. For instance, the start of the movie is showing JJ or Jordan at a massive concert and then suddenly you see him as a struggling visionary artist during his college life trying to imitate famous Rock-stars.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie basically is a love story, but an extremely gripping one unlike most Bollywood love stories. You see how Jordan becomes the star he is, due to this love story. That is what makes it so special, 2 plots working side by side complementing one another i,e him becoming a ""star"" due to his passionate ""love affair"".<br/><br/>The facial expressions of both ""Ranbir"" and ""Nargis"" add to the spice. You actually feel they are in love. The intensity of their relationship is very evident due to the acting. Nargis despite not having her own voice has done an outstanding job and Ranbir Kapoor has stepped up a notch from his other brilliant performance in ""Rajneeti"".<br/><br/>It is one of those epic movies, you cant afford to miss. If you are a fan of wonderfully scripted biographies then this one is definitely for you. However if you enjoy over the top action, stunts or illogical comedy then don't watch it.<br/><br/>My recommendation to all purists out there, do watch it. I cant believe the rating of this movie is only 7.6 which is most likely to drop.Through all this i have learned one thing, Through this movie the Indian cinema has shown signs of maturity however through the rating the public has not.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor and Nargis take a bow !! extremely brilliant performance !"

This movie is not about making a right statement to society and not to follow the footsteps of protagonist; it's about how much pain it goes in making a real Rock star that makes everyone feel on the cloud when he couldn't ground his foot correctly. Movie is dark in nature and this is about an anti hero Jordan who don't have sense of righteousness and he vents out his anger in form of music, a picture perfect depiction of a rebel Rock star to the core.<br/><br/>Watch it, if you are in for dark movies.

"emilyhill-48756","10","3","3","18 October 2015"," A journey of Desire, Passion, Fame, Pain, Destruction
","Music by Oscar winner A.R. Rahman carries a convoluted love story written and directed by Imtiaz Ali.<br/><br/>Delhi boy Janardan (Ranbir Kapoor ) and exotic Kashmiri girl Heer (newcomer Nargis Fakhri) meet as students in a Delhi college. Heer dubs him ""Jordan,"" and the name sticks. Jordan is a bit of a nerd, but he has music in him; the one thing he's missing, according to an old friend, is angst. ""Nobody can make great art until they've experienced real pain,"" says his friend. When a family misunderstanding ends up with Jordan thrown out of his family's home, he seeks refuge at Delhi's Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, sleeping on its floors with other city outcasts and eating the simple, free food from its kitchen. Gradually, the charity he experiences there and the power of its Sufi music change Jordan, and — guitar in hand — he learns to hone his craft by playing for whatever audience will have him, be it a shrine full of Muslim worshipers or a Hindu gathering, random listeners on the street or even the prostitutes in a local brothel. These scenes are the absolute high point of the film, sparked with Rahman's inspired music and convincing guitar and vocal performances by Kapoor (with the dubbed vocals of singer Mohit Chauhan ). Technical aspects are well handled, especially Anil Mehta 's camera work capturing the grand vistas of Kashmir, Dharamsala, Delhi and Prague (the film was shot in association with the Czech Republic's film commission). Guitar wonderland Orianthi Panagaris (This Is It) lends her blazing licks to the film's background score as well. One incongruous image sticks in the mind. During the film's most blistering rock anthem, Jordan sings to an audience of Tibetan refugees in Dharamsala, the Dalai Lama's home in exile. The careful viewer will note that a banner in the background that reads ""Free Tibet"" has been digitally blurred out — at the orders of India's censor board, reportedly bowing to Chinese government pressure. The song Jordan sings in the scene, ""Sadda Haq,"" speaks about freedom and truth. Director Imtiaz Ali has not spoken out publicly about the issue, but young Indians have been vocal in appreciating its irony. Real piece of cinema!<br/><br/>~Emily"
"anasuget","10","3","3","3 April 2015"," Deserves 11 out of 10.
","This review speaks for itself. I have never turned to any site for posting a review about any movie but here I am, not being able to resist myself. This movie revolves around a great skeptical of filial love, passion, compassion, Sufism, hatred, subtlety, utter skill and flamboyance. If you ever wanted all of the aforementioned things in one package, yes then this movie has the blend of everything on offer. The song Kun Faya Kun has it's own credibility. Just perfectly placed where some would think that there was no use of that song well you might have skipped the plot then. Jordan finds himself in a position where his complicated friendship is on a verge of extinction. His relation with Heer has turned to addiction and he is sorting that out. He has niggles with his family and he couldn't resist them, soon made to leave the home, where his aspiration of becoming a ""Rockstar"" is fluctuating history. As things are not turning out right. Just as this all happens, the song Kun Faya Kun plots itself being depicted with onus that when there is nothing, even then there is God. The music is jaw-dropping but why it qualifies as the best is a) Versatile b) Each song shoots the movie plot accordingly and perfectly c) Each song is a masterpiece in it's own peculiar way As a protagonist, Ranbir (Jordan) was told that he needs to have that undue pain and depth in order to be a great artist but then as he proceeds with his pre-mature bond with Nargis (Heer) he founds himself in a tangle with love oozing out from his emotions. He had caught himself in love which led him to dismal, later on when he wasn't able to be with her causing pain to gather him inevitably. During this phase, he finds himself as a well renowned artist but that only happens because he suffered pain meanwhile. All in all, what a great movie! A must watch. I never get tired of watching it over and over again."
"bobbysing","8","3","3","2 January 2012"," It rises above the level of entertainment and is like a smashing mirror on our face making us realize our own filthy self.
","ROCKSTAR is a winner all the way in the first half and the viewers are sure going to enjoy all the proceedings in its first hour with an intelligent direction, entertaining performances, perfect cinematography, realistic dialogues, believable characters and soothingly supporting soundtrack. Narrated mostly in flashback mode, the film is about the journey of a Rockstar who is basically suffering the consequences of his own indecisive character. <br/><br/>Taking an inspiration from the real-life story of the famous & charismatic Rock-music Icon Jim Morrison, the script takes you inside the complex character of a popular STAR who majorly gets famous for the wrong reasons. The Ranbir-Nargis pairing looks ravishing on the screen with the traces of ""Geet"" from JAB WE MET in the characterization of Nargis. The writers beautifully explain the need of ""Some kind of Pain or Heartbreak"" in order to become an artist in a lighter mode, which later on takes a realistic shape in Janardan's life. The transformation sequences of Janardan becoming the famous Jordon are a treat to watch, especially the qawaali at Nizammudin Dargah and all in-studio scenes of Ranbir along with Piyush Mishra and the great Shammi Kapoor. So till the interval point, ROCKSTAR is totally an entertaining venture with something thrown in for all kind of audiences both in the major and the smaller centers (like the adult movie sequence).<br/><br/>But all the commercial problems start post intermission where the film takes a drastic turn towards becoming a more enlightening experience than an entertaining one. And that's where most of the viewers are going to find it difficult to grasp as that is nothing compared to anything ordinary or easily understandable. In its second half, ROCKSTAR mostly talks about the inner conflicts of a big star and her beloved who are not ONE at the moment due to their own lack of will of taking the right decisions at the right time.<br/><br/>Moreover, the last 30 minutes of the film and its purely enlightening climax, might be equal to the phrase of""Upar Se Nikal Gayi"" for many viewers particularly in the smaller centers. Because this very part of the movie takes it to another spiritual level where one gets to see the bitterness in the words ""SEX"" and ""GUILT"" clearly before his eyes, quite shamelessly. And in all probabilities of the world, where people don't like to get serious or listen to something about their own real life in a film, this abrupt and open ending of ROCKSTAR will not be taken sportingly by majority of the audience as well as critiques.<br/><br/>Musically, the track ""Saada Haq, Aithey Rakh"" explains the inner clash & tension of a true artist perfectly. It is well supported by a brilliant camera-work equivalent to the International Standards, a superlative musical arrangement by the maestro (including the singing part by Mohit Chauhan) and some truly great lyrics by Irshad Kamil, which pump up the blood flowing in your body and you feel like standing and saying""Saaaaaada Haq, Aitheeeeey Rakh"".<br/><br/>However, as a true die-hard fan of A.R. Rahman I would humbly like to say that I was really expecting a lot more from this soundtrack of ROCKSTAR. No doubt, it has got the few gems in the kitty but when it's the musical score by Rahman, of a film called ROCKSTAR, made by Imtiaz Ali, then its unarguably logical to expect something extra-ordinary in its each track. The songs other than ""Saada Haq"" and ""Kun Faaya"" need repeated listening to become likable and one can only relate with most of them after watching the film.<br/><br/>In the performance department, this has a flawless, award winning act from Ranbir Kapoor going far beyond whatever glimpses you may have seen in the promos. Therefore this has to be the movie which Ranbir should feel proud of and only one man would be the happiest person to see this from his heavenly abode..his grandfather, the Legendary Showman Sh. Raj Kapoor. And I am sure that if he was alive today, then without thinking about the box office result of the film, he would have announced a big party calling every single person of the Industry to share this fabulous achievement of Ranbir.<br/><br/>Nargis Fakhri as Heer gave me much more than my expectations. Therefore even though many friends may have some different things to say about her but I hugely cherished her performance undoubtedly and also must say that Imtiaz does have a special eye for beauties having a foreign link. So I am all game for seeing more of Nargis Fakhri very soon. Further, I simply loved watching one of my dearest legends Shammi Kapoor coming alive once again on the screen in a truly adorable cameo with his enigmatic presence. Piyush Mishra as the Music Company owner is as usual, fantastic along with another great supporting performance by the actor playing Ranbir's friend-manager. Aditi Rao Hydari becomes the victim of a wrong kind of suggestive characterization but Shernaz Patel does well in her short role. Technically ROCKSTAR excels in its Cinematography by Anil Mehta with perfect capturing of all On & Off stage sequences. The same can also be said about its styling and the dialogues, especially in the first half of the film, which straight away remind you of your own college days.<br/><br/>So with ROCKSTAR, Imtiaz takes you onto the journey into the mind of a Creative Musician depicting his inner pain, love and hate in a splendid way. And in the process he insightfully reveals the truth that Yes, its a blessing to be a Creative as blessed by the Almighty. But at the same time, its also very painful to be there where you are given a different eye to look through everyone like a mirror and can feel the pain like nobody else."

","In his quest to become the icon of a generation, the bold and awkward college student, Janardhan Jakhar embarks on a journey facing resistance, friendship, dejection and love. Such a metamorphosis takes him from the samosa 'hangout' joint on Delhi's streets to the international stage upon which he passionately performs songs of love, independence, defiance and public outcry for his rights as Jordan. As a young, reckless rockstar, he makes foolhardy decisions, behaves erratic and immature. Yet, when he holds the guitar, his music resonates deeper into his heart and this journey through realizing pain is the premise of the movie. Rockstar's length, mostly unnecessary in its numerous songs and scenic escapades is Imtiaz Ali's indulgence in story-telling where he is relentless. Adroitly crafted to capture every aesthetic element, Rockstar has its beautiful face in Nargis Fakhri, soul in Rahman's music and heart in Ranbir Kapoor's mature acting. <br/><br/>Janardhan's early days with a guitar in hand did not start off too well. He needed inspiration and he was advised to find that in love's parting gift of pain. Foolishly, he tried to convince the college sensation Heer (Nargis Fakhri) who wasn't too happy with his approach. However, the two end up being friends as they find a common ground in culture-defying thrills and youthful mischief. After her marriage to a 3rd party in Prague, newly Christened Jordan is left with his goals of becoming a Rockstar. Facing resistance and abandonment from his family, Jordan lives in the confines of the Hazrat Nizammudin Dargah and joins the sufi singers as well as Hindu bhajans till one day, being fed up, he arrives at Khatana bhai's (Kumud Mishra) home. Almost as an agent, Khatana brings Jordan a break-through with Dhingra-owned Platinum Records to sing in an album which launches him to stardom. With a lot of cajoling, Dhingra lets Jordan join the company's tour of Europe in Prague where he meets Heer and they resume their fun-filled adventures based on her hit-list of things-to- do. An intimate moment between the two spurs the tension in Heer and yet, they continue to meet through Jordan's continuing tour till an awkward moment arises when he breaches her home's security to say his good-bye. For his insolence, Heer rants at him and then he is incarcerated upon his arrival in India. Dhingra takes advantage of all the negative publicity that arose upon Jordan's return with a new album and series of concerts. Thus, in the wake of restraint, a rebel is born in the form of a Rockstar. <br/><br/>Even though the film's music failed to generate a buzz, it finds listeners when it blends into the story-line to beautifully crafted moments that express the emotions. This impact is best experienced in Jordan's dejected, angry and commanding Saadda Haq. In what turns out to be the most powerful song that translates a character's emotions into music, Saadda Haq is a rebel's theme. AR Rahman, Mohit Chauhan and lyricist Irshad Kamil produce this foot- tapping, fist clenching rock anthem that would resonate with many of the youth. Naadan Parindey by Rahman has the longing for freedom and sanctuary whereas Aur ho reverberates the pain and helplessness in the end. Jo bhi main brings out Jordan's amateurish sentiments on his path to creativity. While the other songs provide some meaning to each scenario, they add up lengthy minutes to the film's duration, thus subsiding the overall impact. On top of that, Rockstar is a melancholic movie. After his return to India, Jordan finds out about Heer's terminal illness and while he spends quality time with her, improving her condition, the inevitability is always looming. Add to that, Jordan's reckless endeavors that doesn't find favor with anyone. His carelessness and lack of focus dampen his ambitions. It's when he gets on stage that the magic occurs but that's doesn't happen too often. <br/><br/>In the acting department, Ranbir Kapoor has driven the movie. Portraying Jordan's immaturity, naivety and rebellious nature, Kapoor brings sincerity to his performance that was required by Imtiaz Ali's comprehensive characterization. He also pulls off the Rockstar persona very well and his defining moment would be Saadda Haq (Rakh saala!). Nargis Fakhri reminds us of Katrina's early days. Dialogue delivery is amiss but her sheer beauty is appalling in both delicate and intense scenes. Her angelic smile overcomes every sadness and warms every heart. Piyush Mishra as Dhingra is so seriously funny! He is a gifted theater actor of whom we need to see more of. Kumud Mishra plays a strong supporting role, correcting Jordan's foolhardiness and re-aligning him to his career which proves quite challenging but he portrays that with realism. Always a delight to watch the Late Shammi Kapoor even if it is for a total of 2 minutes. His calmness and charm have always been unique in his latter years and he commands the screen when he is present. <br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali has been among the leading directors of contemporary Indian Cinema and with Rockstar, he showcases his talent in detailed writing, characterization and visualization. The finesse in his work is in the details and he takes you through a lot to notice all of it. The length of the film owing to these details is its major folly. <br/><br/>Rockstar may not live up to expectations if there were big ones. Unlike 'Rock On', it won't guide you to living life to the fullest nor will it show you any dark side to the business. All it does is portray the creation of music through the experience of pain. That very journey is what Jordan undertook and rose to unprecedented levels. <br/><br/>Perhaps, even as a film, Rockstar will remain in the field that is beyond the ideas of right and wrong.<br/><br/><ul><li>7.778 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

Many people will differ from me on this that they felt post interval portions or climax weak or the narration of the movie was not good but I TOTALLY DIFFER AS I FELL THE POST INTERVAL, CLIMAX, NARRATION ALL was just AWESOME.. <br/><br/>Specially the INTENSITY of the LOVE story was just mindblowing. beautifully wriiten mindblowing love story i would say IMTIAZ ALI have did it once more.. He is one of the best director these days. His Story of the movie, his direction is just TOO GOOD.<br/><br/>MUSIC<br/><br/>MR. AR RAHMAN has did it once more.. He has given one of His best music so far.. THE MUSIC OF ROCKSTAR IS JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD..<br/><br/>When the music released it took several hearings to grip as most of AR RAHMAN's music do but once it grips on u , u'll fall in love with the Music of ROCKSTAR.. The music arrangements, the compositions, the lyircs, the vocals, everything is just BRILLIANT. Similarly, the BACKGROUND MUSIC of the movie totally goes with the movie and is great too..<br/><br/>Lyrics By Irshal Kamil are just Too mind blowing .. He has given one of His best too. And Mohit Chohan has done a Brilliant job as vocalist as his voice totally suits JORDAN 's character.<br/><br/>Sadda Haq, Jo Bhi Main, Tum Ho, Hawa Hawa, How can one choose all are too good including the instrumentals. and after the picturization of songs one love the songs more.. specially the picturization of Hawa Hawa and Aur Ho is on the top.<br/><br/>CAST, ACTING & CHEMISTRY<br/><br/>RANBIR KAPOOR as a Rockstar (JORDAN) totally Rocks.. He has given his career best Acting without any doubt and is surely an award winning performance. His emotions, his dialogue delievery, his body language, his anger, his love, his Music, is just MINDBLOWING.. <br/><br/>NARGIS FAKHRI ,what i find by IMTIAZ ALI, Her screen pressence is so cool and sweet. she has acted very well as a debutant. her emotions and her love is too good. just her dialogue delievery was weak which was a some what let down but still she has done a great job. <br/><br/>The CHEMISTRY and Love story and the INTENSITY between RANBIR and NARGIS is Brilliant. they rock throughout the movie..<br/><br/>SHAMMI KAOOR in His last movie is totally likable and He has done his part very good.. the JUGAL BANDI scene is a treat to watch.<br/><br/>KUMUD MISHRA is very good in his role so as ADITI RAO in her role suits totally and have done a great job.<br/><br/>PIYUSH MISHRA is very good to.. his Massage sceen is too enjoyable..<br/><br/>SHERNAZ PATEL Is good so as MAUFID AZIZ.. <br/><br/>The casting of the movie is brilliant..<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>Only at few places the movie dips a bit and gets slow but those are to be avoided as remaining movie is a TREAT to watch..<br/><br/>Sadda Haq, Tum Ho, Nadaan Parindey, Phir se Ud Chala, Jo Bhi Main Kehna Chahun...<br/><br/>Rockstar totally rocks.... Awesome direction..Beautiful intensity of the Love story.... Music just Brilliant,, and RK a true Rockstar.. Luvd every bit of it.. ROCKSTAR..!!<br/><br/>RATINGS = 4.75/5. (Many will not agree with me on this but in my opinion this rating is justified.. <br/><br/>Rockstar is year's 3rd best movie after ZNMD and NOKJ).."
"nisarg16","Null","3","3","16 November 2011"," A touching story with a bold treatment, imtiaz's treads uncharted waters
","I believe good directors are great Narrators. That is what enables them to breathe life into a mere series of scenes. And when the story being told is their own or perhaps very close to them, they break the surly bonds of commercial success themes and formulas. Movie then becomes a ruthless pursuit to expose and convey the most naked emotions buried within the story. Many times such an attempt becomes an awkward experience for us as a viewer. Sometimes it turns into a masterpiece. Rockstar is the latter.<br/><br/>This movie, too, is a signature imtiaz Ali movie where he yet again explores the most famous four lettered invention called ""Love"". However, this time its portrayed as an unverbalized camaraderie between a Jim Morrison idolizing artist, yearning to be a Rockstar, and a College sweetheart soon to be married off into affluence. Janardhan Jhakar (Ranbir K), is searching for a heartbreak to happen as it will fuel his creativity and hence his dream to be a rockstar. He bumps into Heer (Nargis Fakhri), believing getting dumped by her should seal the deal. But mindless fooling around soon blossoms undetected and before they know has grown into a chronic tumor of love.<br/><br/>By the time they realize this its too late. Though it may seem formulaic, Imtiaz's treatment of the subject is very unique. So much that it transcends from a Raw human emotion to borderline supernatural and yet seems very beautifully plausible. People complain about a slow second half have missed the point. I guess they were waiting for something to happen while missing to savor some of the most beautiful unsaid portrayals of love.<br/><br/>Imtiaz experiments with non-linear editing in this one and has done some really cool stuff. Its like a novel which tells you in the first 5 lines that the protagonists dies in the end and grips the reader wondering how did that come to pass. The Cinematography too is brilliant and has produced one of the most memorable scenes of Bollywood cinema. At least for me. To top it all off is a shell of fresh and innocent humor which helps the movie remain easy going and yet not loose its depth.<br/><br/>Ranbir has arguably done a marvelous job, for his role is that of silent anguish, which can easily become one of a chronic constipation in the hands of a clumsy actor. He has also done one of the most close to reality portrayal of a guitarist within Bollywood and should be given credit for that.(looking at Rampal in rock on). Nargis is a Newcomer and is just that, a novice, however she is as beautiful as she is delicate and portrays her character well enough.<br/><br/>Last but not the Least, A R Rehman, trademarks the soundtrack with Kun Faya and cranks up the distortion with Saada Haq. (it has liberal sprinkling of guitar riffs and some good ones at that). Orianthi lends her gifted talent to this song. The Music is a true soul of the movie.<br/><br/>With a climax which can send jitters into many Bollywood directors this movie is definitely a feather in imtiaz Ali's Cap.<br/><br/>A Must watch by me, but then I am a sucker for Imtiaz Ali movies, hence a Pinch of salt is advised."

","I just finished watching the movie the 4th time in a month. Just because i am an intense person and i like intensity in life. i loved the movie because of Ranbir's portrayal of intensity. Ranbir is brilliant. no words for his praise. Music is outclass. Direction and editing is wonderful<br/><br/>BUT .....<br/><br/>Imtiaz, the director, chose the absolute worst option for the lead female. The intensity in the female role was nearly as important as the male one. there was a lot of room for emotion and acting. but Nargis Fakhri ruined it. she can not act. she is horrific. In scenes where everything is intense, Ranbir is on his peak of emotions, music is outclass, this young lady will make you laugh. She has ruined every scene she has been in the movie. She should never be allowed to act in front of the camera after this. She is better of a model.<br/><br/>Had it been any good actress, (and there are plenty) who should have complemented Ranbir, the movie would have been even better and much more popular than it is now..<br/><br/>8/10..<br/><br/>*continues to shake his head*"

"kadhalyaanai","9","4","5","18 November 2011"," Rockstar: To that ordinary person inside every STAR
","First up i want to say as a gleeful child i sat in the theater and wanted to give as much chance as possible to like ROCKSTAR because i was mesmerized by the sheer musical brilliance of ARR. That being said even if i went in with a hate mood its difficult not to like this IMPERFECT MASTERPIECE, imperfect not in the way it was handled but its an Imperfect story about an Imperfect man inside every STAR. First Half: There are three main things for a life to sustain. A creator, a soul and a body to host the soul. And thats where ROCKSTAR is blessed in having a brilliant director in Imtiaz as its creator, a soul in ARR and the surprisingly perfect body to host in Ranbir! People who didn't like Ranbir for the rich spoiled kid he is must realize if he has this much acting talent he can be as much spoiled he can be! :) The story is simple! ""Its the life and lies of Janardhan Jakhar"" a.k.a JORDAN. Its how a innocent guitarist who wants to make big goes throe PAIN and when he becomes popular that same pain engulfs him so much that he doesn't know how to handle it! Credit has to be given to the director for creating two wonderfully unique halves that are so diff from each other! The first is about the wonderfully tender relationship between Janardhan and Heer. Its so innocent and realistic that the first half flows as faultless as a river! About the heroine Narghis Fakhri i agree she has been the real letdown in this film but her acting was not bad as such she was shown up by the Beast of an Actor opposite to her who was living the ""Role of his Life"" in Ranbir! Second Half: Now coming to the second half the half which many did not like. It speaks up about the ordinary guy in ""Jordan the Star"" wanting for thing to be as simple as it was when he wasn't a star! Its complex i agree and it glorifies a lot about Infidelity which is still ""The Unspeakable"" when it comes to Indian Cinemas! But its brave its new and it definitely touched me! I have seen countless movies brilliant till climax and faltering in it and when dealing with a movie as complex as this i could see Imtiaz coming up with 100s of ending for this but in the end he played to safe made it a musical tribute to that Janardhan Jakhar inside JORDAN. Advantages of having an open ended climax is that it lets us decide what we want and in the end keeps everyone happy but being brought up with Bollywood the Indian inside us wants the director to end it one way or other another reason why open ended climaxes rarely work in Bollywood! Coming to acting of other cast its difficult to single out anyone in particular because every frame was so dominated by Ranbir but Kumud Mishra ( Katana Bhai) pips over Nargis just because of the chemistry he shares with Ranbir! (Odd to say a third person has more of a chemistry with the hero than heroine but thats the sort of unique film this is!) Now i conspicuously avoided mention about the music till now because the sheer f**king brilliance of ARR deserves a separate paragraph. Now titling a movie ROCKSTAR everything could go wrong with the music but ARR showed us how everything can be made right with it! How every gap can be filled how every untold story can be told and how an untold climax can be ended! Now i surprisingly had the privilege of watching this movie is ESCAPE with English subtitles and that for me made all the difference from making this a nice film to a Masterpiece! Starting from the summary of the hero in ""Jo Bi Mein"" to the mild subtle variations of ""Katiya Karun"" as the lead pair's relationship to the beautiful parallelism in ""Hawa Hawa"" to the wonderful connection between coming of age song ""Sadda Haq"" and the climax song ""Naadan Parindey"" to the haunting back ground musics of ""Tum ho"" and ""Aur ho"" ARR has lived and breathed life in every frame of the movie! I have seen countless Indian movies never have i seen a theater full of audience sing along with every song! Only the brilliance of ARR turned the usually etiquette filled Sathyam audience into a maniacal Rockstar audience! I read in an interview with ARR that he and Imtiaz spent 3 years in conversation about this movie and its music and this kind of movie deserves that depth! As the end credits roll on we see the lead couple romance in all the places they have been since the start of the movie and to have that vision of how to end the movie when beginning to shoot shows Imtiaz's vision! This is that kind of movie which i can type endlessly about the story plot but i cannot do justice to that movie experience you get sitting inside the theater! VERDICT: Another Indian Movie that is too futuristic for its generation, too complex to understand and too Imperfect to be Loved! Another Movie i hate to see get flopped but destined for it anyway! A movie to be watched in a theater worthy of handling its musical nuances and with an open mind. (and with English subtitles for no obs like me!)"
"DICK STEEL","Null","13","24","11 November 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Rockstar
","The draw for me toward Rockstar is A.R. Rahman, the musical maestro responsible for countless of Hindi film classics, and of late piquing Hollywood's attention as well, being a recent frequent collaborator on Danny Boyle's films. For a film being named Rockstar, and with the promos banging on Rahman's music, one can expect plenty of rock tunes created just for the protagonist with even Rahman himself stating the soundtrack would be heavy on the guitars. But despite Ranbir Kapoor spotting various looks as seen in the trailer, the title served to be a misnomer as to the kind of film this is. Sure it has a rock star element to it, but Imtiaz Ali's film gets pared down toward the inevitable sappy romance genre that somehow didn't manage to blast itself away from formulaic clichés.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor has now become a little bit more selective in the roles he chooses to play, and you can see why his Rockstar Janardan, or Jordan, character appealed to the actor. There's the challenge here in portraying two sides of the same coin, starting off as Janardan the student with aspirations of becoming a musician, lugging his guitar everywhere he goes and sharing the joy of his music to just about anyone he sees, never mind if they reciprocate that love, and especially not the authorities for his busking all over the place. Attempts in talent contests always ended up in ridicule, until a friend provided him some honest advice along the lines of how successful musicians excelled in their craft - experience, and more specifically, pain.<br/><br/>And Janardan can be a little bit dim-witted and misguided too in his attempt to achieve fame and glory - that ultimate recognition would be to have thousands salute you when you raise your middle finger instead of getting thrown in jail - though an added incentive to be successful would be to stand on his own two feet outside of bullying family members and to get himself out of a cushy job in the family business he has no interest in participating. Taking on that advice of experiencing pain, he goes all out to woo the hottest girl in college, Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri), the unattainable, serial heart breaker with an attitude as bad as how good she looks. But fortunately for Janardhan his awkward courtship routine tore down the icy cold walls Heer puts up, and in private they share tremendous moments of friendship and bonding through the many shenanigans they find themselves in, culminating in his visiting Kashmir to see her getting married to a rich man (Moufid Aziz) and whisked off and migrated to Prague.<br/><br/>Some may argue that Pain as a catalyst is something quite far-fetched, but trust me I know, it's the emotion enough to want to break down walls and cross boundaries, experimenting without fear. Janaardhan becomes Jordan the rock musician, with his creativity fueled by the breaking of his heart, of loss, longing and just about every negative emotion that comes along, thanks to his new found muse Heer. Music becomes an art through which he can express his feelings, and soon the music production houses come knocking, with Jordan's indiscretion with Heer becomes fuel for gossip and with that comes publicity, turning him into an overnight sensation through his bad rocker demeanour, growing worse day by day each time he cannot attain Heer.<br/><br/>And here's where Imtiaz Ali hit all the right notes in the first half, building upon the tussle between the artist and his muse, one sensible while the other constantly throwing caution to the wind, since we are all well aware of the thin line of adultery the couple is treading upon, with each secret meetup building in intensity, fighting urges and resisting temptation, witnessing the creation of pent up potential. Imtiaz Ali had crafted a wonderful first half before the interval, with comedy, drama, romance, music and even a cliffhanger in the first scene to allow the narrative to come back to later on. But all efforts in setting everything up, seemed to have primed itself for a hard fall, as post-interval the story seemed to have lost direction once it had the two lovers push the boundaries of their emotions, lapsing into the clichés that plague many romantic movies.<br/><br/>Stuck with a narrative that didn't want to go anywhere except focusing on the taboo romance between Jordan and Heer that went on in such great lengths it will rival that seen in Twilight, thank goodness for A.R. Rahman's music that took over since Jordan becomes an established performer (Sadda Haq being the best of the lot by the way), with the narrative given a massive boost from the songs. One cannot fault Ranbir Kapoor as he took on possibly the most challenging role to date playing a meek young man transformed into a hardened rocker hell bent on getting his romantic life the way he envisioned, such that you'll really feel this transformation and the pain, though self-inflicted, he has to endure. As a newcomer, model Nargis Fakhri is extremely believable as the face that men will go to war for, and let's see if Rockstar will open more doors for her in Bollywood. Look out too for the bit role by the late Shammi Kapoor, though one may prefer an extended role, but the scene which he and his grand-nephew Ranbir shared in the passing of advice, is nothing but priceless and what Rockstar would be remembered for.<br/><br/>Rockstar is like a comet, akin to the longevity of many rock acts these days, starting off very brightly, but knowingly and inevitably trailing off as it went along, unable to capture and sustain its initial payload, and faded off with nary a whimper. A rocker this is not, but rather an infatuated puppy in disguise. Such wasted potential, so set expectations low even though the first half of the film careens it stratospherically for you."

","I always thought that Quentin Tarantino is the only filmmaker who deserves to be worshiped. Enter Imtiaz Ali ~ he has literally rocked the art of direction with Rockstar. The no-holds-barred, convention-breaking display of raw emotion took my breath away. Great job rejecting formula!<br/><br/>Ranbir is flawless: a fitting heir to Raj and even Rishi Kapoor. (remember bobby?) Imtiaz Ali and Ranbir should split the credit for Rockstar, 60-40%<br/><br/>A R Rahman: I guess this is what won me. The music is extremely original, peppy yet passionate, and memorable!<br/><br/>On the flipside, the babes (especially Nargis, who's arms and ostrich neck flail wildly out of sync 'with' her dialogues) are passable and even irritating (though I would definitely date whoever the hell the sidekick chick was)<br/><br/>All in all, a must-watch. I have walked this planet for 31 years and no other movie has given me such extensive goosebumps."

"anustup_eb","Null","2","2","16 November 2011"," 'Rocking' passion play
","'Rockstar' is not about A.R's music as most of the media noise would make us believe, its neither about Ranbir Kapoor's undeniable bursting on to the scene as one of THE Most Talented actors of this era. Its something much more than that. Its about that Indian cinema finally showing glimpses of coming of age in its choice of subject, treatment of the central theme and being able articulate and embody the central theme in extreme subtlety. 'Rockstar' presents itself in such a pristine form of story telling and scripting, with songs such mesmerizing interwoven with the tale that you are simply carried away very subconsciously in what the film attempts to tell. It was very natural that the film became an insignificant story interspersed with super-hit songs -With A.R Rehman as its music director doing anything but would have been madness. But, thank God!! Imtiaz Ali has been completely 'mad' in making this film and has avoided all aspects of box-office economics which has made Hindi films one of the most maligned of creative arts of the modern era (and rightfully so!). Technically speaking , the most fascinating character of the film has been in its harmony and homogeneity- the story goes through cycles of past, present and future - how the protagonists Janardhan Jakhar aka 'JJ' (Ranbir) and Heer (Nargis Fakhri) come close through a curious cycle of casual, adventurous, no holds barred relationship into a vice like grip of mutual attraction leading to the destruction and renunciation of their lives in spite of reaching and touching the heights of success and glory defined as per the rules of the order they so much hated to be a part of. In Indian cinema never been a human relationship between man and his woman depicted with such an intensity and to a degree that truly transcends all the normal and accepted rules of attraction and passion. We have read the epitomes of true love which ultimately destroys - 'Romeo Juliet', 'Othello' etc. But they have been always what they are- glorified in theme in their inherent selfless sacrifice. But 'Rockstar' is different. The love between Jordan (Ranbir) and Heer is so intense, all consuming, unattached and bereft of worldly meanings and strings that seeing them it reminded me of the all consuming passion of Vincent van Gogh in 'the Lust for Life' or that of Paul Gaugain in 'the Moon and the Sixpence' for their painting. Maybe Imtiaz Ali has been inspired by these characters from these books only. When Ranbir follows Heer to Prague subconsciously through his musical tour and they begin on a whirlwind of a passionate relationship which they had longed craved for and Heer finally realizes that social dictum called for a cease to it and she asks -' Do you want my life to be ruined?' , JJ simply replies 'Yes, I want you to be tormented bereft of me'. Such a bold dialog devoid of all pretensions of selflessness and glorified sacrifice in love has never been used in Indian films where individuality has always been martyred on the gallows of social conformity and glorified selfless sacrifice for love. This pureness of love which makes JJ want Heer in all her capacity, he even wants her mental peace and soulful existence on his behalf has such a primitive yet pristine touch to it that you feel that this is not a film but an epic. Another bold theme applied how physical acts and temporal love complement and build on each other- the union of the two has been a taboo in Indian society and films. The scene where just before her marriage ceremony Heer asks JJ to hug her and hug her tight represents the intensity of the attraction that she has started to develop so well and with such subtlety. Also, the interplay of dialogs between the two protagonists with Heer in a bridal dress, where each party is trying both to cloak and expound his attraction for the other are such refreshingly honest and passionate that you feel that you are sitting on the bridge thats binding these two human beings together. However, my most memorable scene is towards the end where taunted by the world, tormented by their parents and press, rock star JJ and Heer close themselves in between a bed sheet and Heer declares this is 'their' world which no one would dare interfere- this had such an old world romantic feel tinged with a revolt not towards society or parents, for a change, but towards the shackles human beings have put on themselves in pursuit of their happiness. I feel this is the central theme of the film which has made me like to such a huge extent- its harping on individuality and sense of freedom which has always been a taboo in a 'land of culture and social mores' that is India. Nargis Fakhri's ethereal beauty has been also a major contributor in adding the very essential sublimeness and reason behind the central theme- it helps numb the audience's rationality, the presence of which would have robbed the entire story of its surreal, soulful feel. Her acting skills, especially in the lost and forlorn state when she comes back to India from her husband's home in Prague, have been amply exemplified (although her Hindi needs an improvement!). In short, 'Rockstar' has been Imtiaz Ali's ode to individuality and passionate attraction towards life. Audience would either love it or hate it. If you ask me, they would mostly hate it as Indian society is not mature enough to to admire individuality. Imtiaz Ali has reached the pinnacle in 'Rockstar' after his excellent displays in 'Jab We Met' and 'Love Aaj Kaal', both films treating romantic themes in their own unique ways, but with this last film he has raised the bar to a level which even he might find difficult to cross later."

","Rockstar is the type of cinema which is the result of intelligent film- making and out of the box thinking. This is a genre which has never been explored in its right approach. This is a musical in its true sense , music completely drives the story forward and is in no way enforced into the film just for the sake of entertainment. In the movie we are shown the unexpected journey of a boy becoming a Rockstar. The journey is particularly about a series of events which shape up the negativity in life of Jordan/Janardan Jhakkad as the top of the world Rockstar. Film is filled with some hilarious moments , great amount of adrenaline pumping and soulful music that goes with the story , amazing soundtrack and a wonderful love story that connects to the heart. Great performance by Ranbir as The Negative Jordan , Shammi Kapoor Ji suits the role of a shehnai maestro and Nargis is beautiful as Heer. Imtiaz Ali's direction is one thing to watch out for and hats off to the writers for the amazing transformation that takes place in story. A.R Rahman is a maestro , a perfectionist , the lesser said the better. Mohit Chauhan as the voice of Jordon does an amazing job."

","When the Rockstar's trailer was released. I was blown away by the frames that speak louder than everything else. Kudos to those who edited and reedited the trailer with such a sharp mind that one wants to watch it over and over again. I have gone through many interpretations of the trailer to satisfy my curiosity; I expected (as usual) something vibrant from the film.<br/><br/>The film starts with rock concert where people are celebrating the 'Rockstar Jordan'. This Rockstar, who kicks some cops and gates, comes on the stage, and then first cord of his guitar takes you to the flash back. Janardan Jakhad (Ranbir Kapoor) is the ordinary youngster who fascinates about big Musicians. He wants to make it big with his guitar but as they say, college and confusion comes together, he is not sure how and what to bring out. Rockstar is all about the 'look within' process, an ordinary guy conveys his 'look within' process through the music. Love of his life triggered that process. <br/><br/>It's about the chaos that surrounds you, you always try to make meaning out of it and unfortunately we end with our own interpretation which is backed by the conscious ego. Jordan is not the different, He is very true with his 'own' that people starts relating with it. We always comfort the idea of 'be yourself' by being in fascinating moment. You will be astonished by the thought that Imitiaz Ali wants to say which slowly grasp your mind and makes you part of it. The heart of the film is Ruby's poem about a place where 'unconditional love' exists.<br/><br/>The film offers a lot of metaphors that makes you part of it. Janardan can't sing and play his music in jammed environment of studio, but effortlessly he composes his music with Shehnai maestro (Shammi Kapoor) who recognised him as a free spirit. How anyone can controlled your 'within' when you have at urge to bring it out. <br/><br/>'Jok bhi mein keh na chaho barbad kare alfaz mere', this is nothing but desperate attempt to connect with yourself.<br/><br/>This film tries to organise the definition of the Love. This film conveys that love comes with no restriction, responsibilities which are difficult for someone's appetite. Imtiaz Ali brings his signature madness of 'Jab we met' and 'Love Aaj Kal' in this film. But he has forgotten to fill those plot holes, where this Rockstar randomly meets his love of life on the street of Prague. (This sequence reminds me recent disaster 'Mausam' where randomness was constant) and the TV reporter who out of the blue wants to find about this Rockstar. Imtiaz Ali used non-linear story telling format to organise the story but unfortunately that weakens what he exactly wants to say. People will watch it again and again because of AR's music that calms you and makes you thoughtless for a moment. Ranbir had a chance he has proved it. Ranbir conveys character's emotions and metaphors. He switches his roles perfectly as a troubled Rockstar who yelled at reporters every other time and as a lover who doesn't give damn about anything else but his love. As we all know Imtiaz's love for firangi gal, Nargis Fakiri fails to synchronise herself with her co-star. Imtiaz Ali surprisingly avoids melodrama and come with the ending that will allow you to fetch your own interpretations. This kind of ending that doesn't give full stop to storytelling and story viewing experience.<br/><br/>The movie that itself talks about beyond the wrong and right, I don't want to judge this movie on the grounds of film-making rules. <br/><br/>This is my love for this kind of cinema."

","A first of its kind movie made in Bollywood. really intense acting by ranbir kapoor, who definitely proves himself and got bigger than the KAPOOR legacy. looked fantastic in every getup and costume, everyone was more bizarre than previous one, but still suit him very well<br/><br/>no comments on music as A.R.Rehman is far from reviews. Every Song is weaved in the storyline so beautifully. <br/><br/>Somewhat disappointed with nargis's acting but hats off to ranbir<br/><br/>for his marvelous performance. locations are also beautiful. and above all a stunning entry of a rock star which is the starting scene of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall a movie with a different perspective and POV of obsession and love."
"akhaurysaurav","7","2","2","12 November 2011"," movie stretched for too long..but worth a watch..
","Rockstar starts with an energetic song with an outstanding cinematography.. you instantly fall in love with the movie and your expectations rises.. the only problem in the movie was that somewhere it felt that the movie is being stretched with no actual results.. For people who are fed up of those same old bollywood style of romance timing would find that stretchy part a bit predictable... and quite boring as they would want to see more of that powerful and fully crazy rockstar than a love story which seemed a bit similar to JAB WE MET at places.. <br/><br/>Now the best part of the movie is A.R.Rehman's phenomenal music and Ranbir kapoor as the rockstar ""Jordon""... Ranbir truly lives his character.. He gave meaning to the songs by embedding emotions in them..I am not a fan of ranbir..and i wont be exaggerating if i tell i hated him.. but after seeing this i apologize.. an outstanding performance and not even for a moment you'l feel that he hasn't justified his character..Jordon was full of attitude and yes i liked that a lot.. the music of the movie binds you to your seat overshadowing the lengthy love drama.. People who are madly in love will definitely love this movie.. and those who are fed up of all those romantic melodrama will still love the rockstar part of the movie if not entirely.. My suggestion: Have a go.. and watch the movie.. definitely not the best movie..but still you wont be disappointed.. not at least after the mindless and baseless movies like Ra.One and Bodyguard.."

","First things first.. Movie is for intelligent moviegoers those who can appreciate the dark side of life and have tasted struggle. Movie is not for those who are used to spoon feeding and useless unfunny comedies. A very well made neat and clean (though few scenes shows the colors of Jangli Jawani that we all have within) movie and pro-fuses inspiration with its acting, direction, music and expressions. Story till ""Arsh"" from ""Farsh"" is so smoothly picturized like Teachers or JD flowing through food pipe and just giving its kick slowly. It will take you deep in its own world of music and inspiration that you would stop longing for break. Intelligent screenplay in first half makes its mark, causes delight to mind and treat for heart. A true depiction of artist(not star) or kalakaar comes into second half which shows the rigidity of director in the form of ""Jordan"" Negative. Expressions of Jordan show that true director like Imtiaz knows the struggle and pain of human life. Yaa second half is somewhat abrupt for the audience and is not so easily digestible and few can find it neat shots. Last half an hour is like nonstop rock show and music takes the all spirit and screen, tries to overtake duologue's and screenplay. Ranbir along with ""A. R. Rahman"" takes movie to different heights and world where nothing is right and nothing wrong, just only soothing and eternal sound which touches the right chords of soul. Rockstar Rocks"
"achraj","5","10","19","12 November 2011"," No offence, except music, movie is a garbage!!
","The movie kicks off with a scene from the life of Jordan the rockstar who manages to escape a brawl and gets on a bus to finally reach the stage show. As he begins to sing the movie plummets through moments of his past and we come to face the simpleton Janardhan Jakhar (Ranbir Kapoor) who wishes to emulate Jim Morrison. But he isn't the ideal material as he has no heartbreaks and thus Janardan begins the search for pain. His unusual journey brings him to Heer (Nargis Fakhri).<br/><br/>All hell befalls on the boy and overnight he is thrown out of his house only to emerge years later as the novel singing sensation. What follows next is the story of love and loss for the protagonists as a Jordan tries to find solace in the hectic and somewhat unforgiving life of a celebrity and a torn man.<br/><br/>The story – 4/10 For most parts Imtiaz tries to tell a story of a love-struck boy who morphs into a singing sensation almost subtly by virtue of his pain. Yet he overlooks a very crucial element while creating the angry rockstar. It is true that pain strengthens the mettle of ordinary men and has the capacity of metamorphosing him into a tough nut but an artist's vessel isn't only composed of pain, it must also have space for the love for his work. Through most parts of the movie we see Jordan in pain and we see him complaining that how much he doesn't want to remain in the hollow tinsel town of fame and yet not once does he praise the power of music that provides him with the opportunity of self-expression. Jordan is thus an incomplete rockstar just like the story itself.<br/><br/>I went to the theatre with the hope of seeing the role of music in the life of an ordinary man. I went with the thought of witnessing a legend in making but all I was offered was a remade dish of Devdas. The movie perhaps would have been more aptly title as a Rockstar's Love Story because it talks more of JJ's love life rather than the experience of rising to a position that bestows a man the power to enthral millions with his voice.<br/><br/>The story is also a tad overdrawn and though there are moments that move you in the end it's not really enough to carry forward the legacy of cinematic expression of rock musicians that Rock On gave us.<br/><br/>The direction and technique – 3/10 Once again the cinematography works wonders for the eye. There are scenes that incite you with nothing but visual brilliance and while some actually mesmerise you to the spot. One scene of a fully clothed Ranvir in the bath tub with a flaming guitar and a water line obstructing that in his line of view will stay with you for many days to come.<br/><br/>Imtiaz's treatment with sequencing is a tad experimental for Bollywood and it often jumps beautifully between spots on the timeline while synchronising the events lucidly. Sometimes however this can become a little confusing to follow and it has created a problem in the overall flow.<br/><br/>On the whole however barring the need for a vehement editing to shorten the excessive length the director has put up a strong front when it comes to visual story telling.<br/><br/>The acting – 6/10 There is one big reason to go watch Rockstar and that reason is living. He is none other than Ranvir Kapoor. It seems that this Kapoor has a bottomless pool of talent from which he keeps on pulling out more and more. For Rockstar, Ranvir is said to have worked very hard but you can't see that on screen. On screen he is not an actor but a man who lives in the celluloid reality. If he shines astutely as the naïve Janardan then he fights, frets and chafes with a genuine misanthropic fury as Jordan. He holds the guitar not as an accessory but with the reverence it deserves and displays the various moods of the character with an effortless grace. Kudos to the actor he has evolved into and I hope he delivers such mindblowing charisma in years to come as well.<br/><br/>Nargis as Heer is pretty and lovely but at times unconvincing on her own. Yet whenever she is coupled with Ranvir she gels with him perfectly (wait till you see them kiss! It's kind of too real to fake).<br/><br/>No complains about the rest of the cast but you will probably not be able to recollect anything about them after the movie as the entire space is taken up by the 'Negative Rockstar' and his muse.<br/><br/>The music – 9/10 You can't put A.R. Rehman with a musical movie and not expect something special. Yes if Ranvir is the crown then Rehman is the gem of Rockstar. He entwines hard melody with sufi undertones to create such convoluted feelings of reverent pathos and powerful joy that you cannot help but be deaf to all else in the world around you.<br/><br/>Ya if Rockstar is worth watching then it is because we have ears to go with the eyes. The tracks have already aroused a lot of buzz and the music that comes with it is an apt garnishing for the entire mellifluous offering.<br/><br/>Thumbs up Mr. Rehman, you rock! So can this Rockstar rock your world? The duo of Ranvir and Rehman sure can and they do so with a lot of attitude (and a certain middle finger showing by Ranvir!).<br/><br/>Directions - 3/10 Acting - 6/10 music - 9/10 story - 4/10 movie = 4.5/10"
"jeethjohnp","5","15","32","12 November 2011"," Rock on Ranbir...Imtiaz please put up a more apt title for your next movie...
","Imtiaz Ali tries a Jim Morrison with an Indian back-up story to add it all up. But when the back-up story takes a free-float equation with horrible acting from the female lead even rock-n-roll, sex, or drugs won't help the story to take a flight. The starting sequence takes a tremendous leap and sets everything on fire. From there the movie leaps to a flashback. The flashback is a sine wave to be precise where crest is when Ranbir fills the screen and trough is when Nargis takes over. Post-interval the director gets a grip on things but still falters here and there but in the end gives up for regular rom-com commercialization. Even the sequences where Ranbir goes all crazy and shouting I just can't understand how he must have reached that point when the relationship that he had with Nargis showcased in a shallow manner. The only factors that makes this movie watchable is Ranbir Kapoor and music By ARR. Ranbir shows great maturity in some of the sequences. But I feel he has more potential."

","Rockstar is about destiny. A human dreams to achieve a goal. Then s/he pursues the goal through various queer alleys of life. Touching the goal realization comes that the goal has been changed and/or lost in course of pursuit. Either s/he becomes aimless or sets in another pursuit for something missed in the obsession of previous goal. Then pursuits go on. The human keeps wondering from a goal to another goal. Thus her/his destiny is defined. Rockstar is not about becoming a rock star; it is about shaping destiny of a common man with trendy passion of becoming a rock star. He used every means he knew, and suggested to him by his critics - sympathizers, friends, mentors, snobs, judges and arrangers of competitions and shows - time and again. When he was summoned music barons he abstained from taking opportunity towards accomplishment of goal. Because he, following dictates his consciences, preferred to attend a friend's wedding as previously he tried to use her as means of achieving his goal. Though ambitious to be a rock star, the common man was simple, honest, peace-loving person. He was not really in love with the beauty of college campus, who was referred, by boys, as ""heartbreak machine"". Actually wanna be rock star wished to experience heartbreak in order to become a rock star, thus using the beauty to achieve his goal. Beautiful girls are habituated in facing loads of lovers since adolescence and by the time they are in college they acquire maturity and style to crack a whip on emotions of the lovers. So wanna be rock stars endeavors ended as soon as it began in pursuit of a heart break. Only the descent entity within the wanna be rock star became conscious in the girl's presence. The sobriety of the girl recognizes the sobriety of the boy. They became friends. So he prefers to be at friend's wedding instead of attending music companies. The association with wanna be rock star make the girl discover a boy free from taboo, machismo, chivalry and social dictates with whom she enjoys freedom. Obviously, the girl fall in love with the boy. The boys realization came much later. After, he had first been forced to join family business and learned to keep himself engulfed in chores and consequently, he had been humiliated and uprooted from his home by his brothers, he was blessed with idol hours to sing aimlessly and endlessly listening songs at a shrine, his grief from shocks of uprooting was healed; he found a way to earn by singing at religious and social ceremonies; again got spotted by the music producers and earned favor of and recommendation from an renowned classical musician who spotted him singing at shrine at his first album was released with some reservation from the producer. He became eminent, alone and in moments of enjoyments he started remembering the days with girl, started longing for her and seeking consolation by association of girls from surrounding crowd and lamenting in secret for bereaved love. Then the first chance to be close with his love again made him compromise with the material world. Then he achieved his love though taboo already tore the girl's life. Their life became an turmoil. The girl dipped to fatality of death in grief, repentance and struggle of suppressing love to honor social dicta. The boy scattered his love in substitute. He became popular for his art and an eyesore for all in business with him - his only relations in the world. He lived an arrogant life crying for freedom from all rules, overwhelmed in grief of unaccomplished love, death of unborn child in an unsympathetic fraudulent world bound by rules, negotiations, compromises and betrayal. Rock star is a commentary of humiliations on a journey to artistic freedom. In portrayal of the characters by Mr. Ranbir Kapoor, Ms. Narghis Faqri, Piyush Mishra and Kumud Misra are remarkable. The music is beyond any appraisal. If the trailers came up with the scene of guitar burning, viewership would have been enhanced. But a wrong promo cannot make a film failure. Human can fail, but humanity never fails. The film may fail but the message it carried is an eternal success."

","Ten-on-ten to Ranveer & Mohit. Imtiaz kept things upto expectations and Rehman brilliance can't be doubted. The movie takes off quite well with well organized sequences and keeps its grip as it progresses. Nargis was a sophisticated and high-class version of Jab We Met's Kareena. She kicks off full throttle with Janardan, to create the most entertaining moments in the movie which go quite natural with there character. The second-half of story turns a bit complicated and music again keeps the hold. But, things keep going on weaker and ultimately it somewhat bends on the lines of typical bollywood drama, not deviating from the theme. Heer's details sometimes are unnecessary, and Jordan's character is irritating sometimes. <br/><br/>Had it been made a little shorter, it would have been a perfect work. A good watch. Go for the music which is best in the recent past and Ranveer's performance."

","Imtiaz Ali's 'Rockstar' is A Good Attempt, that deserves a viewing. I just loved the way Imtiaz executed the first-hour, but, I felt, the second-hour, was not as effective as compared to the first-hour. But, Ranbir's outstanding performance manages to hold you even in the second-hour. He delivers the performance of his life!<br/><br/>'Rockstar' tells the story how a timid Janardhan Jakhar, transforms into Jordan, a Rockstar. During the course of his career, he falls in love with Heer, who plays a major part in his life. It's a tale of love, passion & destruction. <br/><br/>'Rockstar' begins wonderfully and the journey of Janardhan Jakhar, a timid budding artist, and his romance with Heer, is simply superb. Imtiaz has handled the first-hour beautifully and he executes the light-moments, with greatness. However, the second-hour, isn't as effective. Also, I thought, the final 30-minutes, to be depressing. <br/><br/>But you just can't overlook 'Rockstar' because of some minuses, over-here, luckily, the pluses manage to overshadow the minuses. Sure, the writing material could've been tighter & lighter in the second-hour, but there's no denying that Imtiaz has made a well-made film in all respects, and he deserves immense praise for making a film he believed in. Music by A.R Rahman, like always, is spell-binding. All the Songs are wonderful & memorable. Cinematography by Anil Mehta is excellent. Editing & Art Design, are mention-worthy. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Ranbir delivers the performance of his life. His transformation from a timid nobody to a youth sensation, is simply remarkable. He stands out from scene A to Z. Debutant Nargis Fakhri, does a decent job. Aditi Rao Hydari is passable. Kumud Mishra & Piyush Mishra are fantastic in supporting roles. Shernaz Patel is good. The Late/Great Shammi Kapoor is wonderfully restrained in a small role. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Rockstar' is a well-made film in all respects. Imtiaz delivers a yet another film, that stands out, with true merits. Recommended!"

The music of the film also disappoints; you get random snazzy guitar solos, which serve as distractions.<br/><br/>This film basically highlights what is wrong with the Indian film industry... low quality, meaningless entertainment films are so rampant that a dramatic, drab film will be called a masterpiece by everyone.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a 1/10."
"paul-jose05","4","7","17","13 November 2011"," Does not meet expectations
","You have your expectations set before watching an Imtiaz Ali movie. You tend to start comparing his work with some of the earlier movies. But i was fairly disappointed with Rockstar. <br/><br/>Direction: I didn't see much of Imtiaz's talents when it came to direction. Some of the scenes were so dramatic it reminded me of the acting of the 80's. I think bollywood has come a long way from then. The audience doesn't get immersed in the character. When you come out of a movie like Rock star, you feel a little unbalanced. Not knowing what to derive of the movie. Where are come scenes where the crowd is looking directly into the camera and the audience loses the connect.<br/><br/>Acting: Ranbir stood out throughout the movie. His acting skills are surely commendable. His co-star on the other hand Nargis, tends to ruin the whole movie. She does not have the intonation required to express certain feelings that is very much required in a bollywood movie. She seems very artificial in almost all scenes and i ended laughing at some of her dialogs. She has a very long way to go before she can act in main line. She should stick on to modeling until then.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Anil Mehta, does very good work with the camera. The scenic beauty of Himachal, Delhi & Prague are beautifully captured.<br/><br/>Editing: The editing was very very average. Some scenes end very abruptly. There are a few scenes where the crowd in the background is starting right at the camera.These are some basics that needs to be taken care while directing but it was also left unnoticed while editing as well.<br/><br/>Music: The main highlight of the movie. The orchestration is very powerful. The high and the lows are placed beautifully. Rehman has provided excellent music apt to the movie. The movie can easily fall in the category of a musical with little effort.<br/><br/>Rating: Overall - 4/10<br/><br/>Acting - 6/10; Direction - 6/10; Cinematography - 9/10; Editing - 5/10; Music - 10/10"

","Rockstar is one of those movies that start with vibrant air around it but slowly and sadly fizzles into a self-indulgent drag. I got a feeling that the makers, primarily Imtiaz, tried to make a movie which they wanted to be remembered as an urban cult in years to come but it falls hopelessly short of that. Irrespective of the box-office returns, Rockstar will always remain an attempt that just pretended to be cult but never came close. Three prime reasons for it falling way short: One, for a love story (especially a tragic one) to work, you need a solid lead pair with great acting credentials. Rockstar, sadly, has just one good actor in Ranbir Kapoor (this could well be his best performance till date). Nargis, apart from trending on twitter and being made a butt of all jokes at the time of writing, would make Katrina Kaif look like Meryl Streep. OK fine, she wasn't that bad too, but bad enough to ruin the movie. In the hindsight, an Anushka Sharma would have done wonders to this film. Two, the 2nd half is way too incoherent, too aloof, too Kashyapesque. You don't seem to connect with the movie and u don't care after a while. Simply put, I just couldn't feel the pain and anguish of the protagonist. There are moments in the film that touch you but not enough for you to have goosebumps on seeing him tear his lungs out in 'Saada Haq'. Third, like a scourge plaguing the Hindi film industry, the script is nondescript. Well, there is none to be honest. It's a collection of sexual/asexual innuendos. A movie doesn't have a script when you cant summarize the story. High points - great visuals, out of this world music and vocals and, of course, Ranbir Kapoor. My rating 5/10."

","Welcome to the Imtiaz Ali brand of Hindi cinema; recall Jab We Met and Love Aajkal Entertainment, high on aesthetics and drama full of emotions and love. Enter Ranbir Kapoor, the most gifted young star with solo hits and excellent track record; recall Raajneeti, Wake up Sid and Rocket Singh. Add to it Nargis Fakhri, an attractive and fresh foreign face and recall the success of Katrina Kaif and Giselle Montiero. Add to this the last appearance of Shammi Kapoor and fantastic music of A.R.Rehman you book the tickets in advance, buy pop corn and enter the theater with very high expectations.<br/><br/>Rockstar is the story of Jordan or JJ, a small time singer wanting to make it big on rock music scene and his love story with Heer, the classy girl from his college. It's a tenderly told anecdote of complexities of human nature and its frailties when it comes to choosing between wrong and right or love and celebrity. Interestingly, at no point, unlike other love stories, Imtiaz wants the audience to portray high moral values of the lead pair. In fact, they have imperfect personalities resulting into a flawed relationship with no possible explanation and that's what makes the whole deal realistic. It is packed with some power house performances by the lead characters and some beautifully crafted scenes like the one where Jordan leaves his contracts and is found sitting among prostitutes in a red light area singing to them and says that's what he always wanted. One of the strongest points of the film is the fact that music has been artistically entrenched in the story and last but not the least, humor is genuine and amusing.<br/><br/>But the question still remains; does it deliver as per expectations? the answer is no. Mainly, because it's fiction and fiction demands more logic than reality, biographies or documentaries. The treatment, despite being poetic and beautiful, keeps the focus on one person's personality, making it look like a true story of a real life character which its not. At several points Imtiaz Ali deviates from logic taking creative license granting which varies from genre to genre. Ra.One loving audience would give more margins than Love Aaj Kal loving audience. Imtiaz develops the character of JJ with utmost detail and sincerity but falters a couple of times in framing his career path and his rise. While first 45 minutes of the film are fast and eventful, it starts becoming slower as it progresses and second half hardly moves the story. Also, the pair's reunion scenes leave much to be desired.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali's experiment with Nargis Fakhri also falls flat. Nargis has serious dialogue delivery issues and goes over the top on quite a few occasions which are not Imtiaz Ali film traits. Her age also shows when she is playing a college student etc. Female lead of the film being bad can be perilous, however, the rise of the inexplicably charming Aditi Rao Hyadri in supporting cast saves the female side of the show. She is natural, beautiful and has excellent screen presence. All the more reason to look for her pairing with Ali Zafar in London, Paris, New York as her next. Piyush Mishra does an incredible job as you would expect from a man of his talent. Other supporting cast is also very good, especially Kumud Mishra as JJ's agent. Shammi Kapoor is in a brief role but is unforgettable. Graceful, respectable and heart warming. Very convincing indeed.<br/><br/>The film totally belongs to Ranbir. What an absolutely wonderful performance. Just a couple of years in the industry and he is already in a league of his own, much ahead of Imran or others. I hate to admit that he is even better than my personal favorite Shahid Kapoor and his results are also showing the same. It was a complex role but the ease with which Ranbir has carried it can give Aamir Khan run for his money. The image and persona of a rock star fit Ranbir perfectly and he pulled off the attitude and music in style. Champion, I'd say. Impressive.<br/><br/>One more impressive unit member is Anil Mehta behind the lens. Fantastic camera work from the veteran. He has bettered his previous best Lagaan and HDDS by a huge margin. Light treatments in on-stage performance scenes is remarkable. Close-ups are detail oriented.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali the writer has written beautiful character sketches but hasn't left much in the story. Several ends remain open when the movie finishes. It appears as if he had a much more vivid picture of the script in his mind than he was able to tell the audience. As a director, he has handled the film with sensitivity and understanding but leaves the screenplay loose. He does get out best performances from his team but probably deliberately, gives a bit of a documentary touch to the film in the middle hour. Duration could also be shortened by 15 minutes or so. Alternatively, that time could have been used to give a view of Nargis's background or history which was virtually absent in the first half. There are weaknesses in how he handles the medical issues lead characters face.<br/><br/>Despite the points mentioned above, it still is a beautiful film and worth a watch. In most likelihood, it's the kind of film that will grow on the audience in multiple watches and has in it to become a long run cult classic. On a stand alone basis, its much better than several films produced this year, however, if you ask the questions like is it as good as Love AajKal or Jab We Met, definitely not as those were very universal movies and this will suit select audience. From Imtiaz's perspective, its more like his directorial debut film Socha Na Tha which despite being a beautiful film, lacked the excitement. Imtiaz's next should be a step further not backward."
"deebejac","9","1","1","6 May 2020"," A MUST WATCH MOVIE
","When people criticize about Bollywood not being 'Artsy' with its production and forcing unnecessary songs to its content; well Rockstar is the movie he/she should watch. Rockstar is a Bollywood romance drama set in the soul of music. Directed by Imtiaz Ali, the movie had some promising roles by the cast; Ranbir kapoor, Nargis Fakhri, Kumud Mishra,Aditi Rao Hydari, Shammi Kapoor to name a few.
There were various aspects that I absolutely loved about the movie.<br/><br/>ACTING : One thing that everyone will mention about is the performance by the cast of movie. Ranbir kapoor connected with his audience not as an actor but as the shy boy jonardan as well as the rock star he was in the stage. If he pulls out his guitar in public and starts to sing calling himself the Jordon or Jonardan , It would be totally believable. The role was totally justified. We could clearly see the 'dard' in his eye. Talking about the leads who could miss the love of his life Heer Kaul by the very talented Nargis. The character stayed in our heart and prayed for the character to stay a bit more in the screen. We felt for them.
Talking about iconic characters, Khatana ji from the cafe is not to be missed out. What a great show he put up by his skills. A Proper guardian, Adviser, a friend, he meant a lot to jonardan. No one can forget ""the samosa' incident.
There were many iconic characters other than them but these three remains my favorite of all.
STORY : Many stories are written, narrated and forgotten but this is that story that remains embedded in the heart of the audience forever. This story showed something that most fail to. How love is eternal and forever. It showed us love doesn't mean only to have the person and his body but to fall for the soul. It shows the continuous struggles, jonardan had to keep up his singing career and and his never ending love for Heer.
DIALOGUES AND LYRICS :
Words are really strong and you will know it if you watch the movie. The iconic monologue ' Yaha se bohut dur, galat aur sahi k par' still remains my favorite. Not here to give much spoiler, watch it and you know it.
Songs from the movie apart from the magical voice of the singers, the lyrics are just beautiful. Just perfect for a romantic hopeless like me
DIRECTION:
Come on its Imtiaz Ali !!!<br/><br/>Though some may say the character of the rock star jonardan was very aggressive and portrayed a wrong image of the rock singers among the audience.That's the part it gets tricky. Yes! the character could have been muted down a little but it would have destroyed the true essence of representing pure characters on the screen. Though it portrayed more aggressive side but it surely justified it.<br/><br/>To sum it up, It is one of the most beautiful pieces of Bollywood that will take one to a roller coaster ride of emotions."

","Somehow missed watching this movie for a long time and I am glad I did at least now. Rockstar is easily Ranbir's best. Witnessed some hair raising brilliance in his acting. Did he even act or he lived his role? Pure, raw and as real as it gets, Rockstar will make your heart heavy and haunt you for days.
AR Rahman's music needs no mention. Simply out of the world, the strings adding to the intensity of each frame and moment.
Nargis fakhri, really can't put a finger on what's lacking. Awkward, maybe. But still, that too passes, considering her character. And no error is glaring in front of Ranbir's mind blowing performance.
The movie starts with Rumi's poem - "" There's a place between right and wrong doing. That ground - I will meet you there"". What wonderful lines to set the mood of the movie!!"

","If there is one thing to be said about Imtiaz Ali, it is that he understands love. In ""Jab We Met"" he showed how love works like a medicine; healing, encouraging, giving meaning to your life. ""Rockstar"" explores love as a drug; the pain and pleasure of an intense love, the darks, the depths. Even with the parallel editing that makes this film even more beautiful, you never loose connect with the main character Janardan whose only aspiration in life is to become a ""Rockstar""; but at what cost?<br/><br/>The film leaves you in a visual hangover so strong, that it was hard for me to get up even after the credits ended. The film earns credits for Ranbir's brilliant acting, awesomely written script, music, cinematography and styling. And for the cynics who have to pay attention to each and every flaw, please, you have to give an artist his space. After all, as the movie's final message states, its not about what is right or wrong; its about love."
"subhendu-r-mishra","10","1","1","15 January 2012"," Awesome music.. Excellent Acting by Ranbir and good story.
","This is one of the best Hindi movie that I have seen. <br/><br/>A.R. Rahman's music rocks. Especially Sadda Haq, Nadan Parindey and Jo Bhi Main. Also watch out for the special jugalbandi of Sehnai and Guitar that is filmed on Late Shammi Kapoor and Ranbir. <br/><br/>Ranbir is brilliant in this movie. He makes you feel the agony of the character. Nargis has also done a decent job. Also all the supporting characters fit well to the movie. <br/><br/>The filmography is also excellent. The scenic beauty of snow covered northern India well captured. <br/><br/>As a director Imtiaz Ali has done a brilliant job. This two step forward from his previous movie ""Jab we met"". I am now a big fan of him. <br/><br/>Overall its a must watch if you are a bollywood fan."
"apoorvmania","8","1","1","8 December 2011"," A musical extravaganza & definitely a fantastic work of art !!
","Imtiaz Ali, a great director, has definitely tried his best and even proved himself in this movie to take his advancements to the new genre of movies. Keeping in mind the mental condition of today's youth who sometimes feels rebellious regarding the dos & don'ts of the world, own goals, failures and pressures from family to divert the direction of his life away from his ambitions. The movie's trailers had already created an image of the lead character i.e Janardhan Jakhad(Ranbir) as a rebellious, rude-'Rockstar'. But behind every success story lies the pain and definitely struggle, pain and agony the character faces. The movie starts with Jordan(Ranbir) having a small street fight in the a European Country and then running wildly to the Czech Stadium crowded by his fans waiting for him to come and rock. He arrives and while he reaches the stadium, flashbacks from his previous life start...it arises a lot of excitement and curiosity among the viewers for his previous life. Then starts the story wherein a young simple Delhite(highly impressed by Jim Morrison) faces various types of situations(some intentionally created by himself) for one goal i.e. to become a Rockstar,, and then there's the entry of Heer(Nargis Fakhri) who is the the most talked about girl of the college, they meet and all this carries on as a musical ride. AR Rahman is truly master of his work. the synchronization of the music and the storyline is extremely perfect. If one is focussing only on the story , he may not enjoy as much as the one who shall if he flows with the music and try to feel what the character feels. There are points where there's comedy, excitement, love, fun, love and several other myriads of feelings all enlivened by the perfect blend of music by Maestro- AR Rahman. This is perhaps Ranbeer's best performance as if now, however on the contrary Nargis Fakhri was able to add that charm to the movie but the acting part was not at all as per the expectations. There are different looks which have been experimented on him and all of them suit the various situations. Screenplay is undoubtedly contemporary with almost real life like situations, however it gets a bit slow on the later half. The pain is clearly visible in the eyes of Jordan in the 'Nadaan Parindey' the climax track. Mohit chauhan and AR Rahman have done a really great job in creating the tracks of the movie which keep on swinging around in the mind of the viewers even days after they have seen the movie. Its also like a tribute to legendary actor Shammi Kapoor who played Ustaad Jameel Khan, the one who recognized the pain and resulting rage in Jordan and gave him a chance to perform and launch his album. Overall an 8/10 movie and of course worth watching and even collecter's edition for music lovers"
"vibhordhawan","7","1","1","4 December 2011"," Musical Bonanza
","People may call it a CHITRAHAR but I really liked the way songs become the essence of the movie. And it is expected out of a movie which is on a rock star. Though songs vary from classical to Indian Rock but the songs are awesome all of them. A R Rehman is at his best with the variety and the freshness of the songs which become an instant part of the play list. Apart from that acting of Ranbir Kapoor is mind blowing. Never in the his career have I liked his acting as much as I do in this one. <br/><br/>Nargis though very beautiful is a sort of blemish in this movie with a pathetic acting display. The plot is okay but the best part is the feeling of Indian Rockstar which is like a fictitious figure and very well portrayed. I will give 5 star to the songs and additional 2 stars for the acting of Ranbir."

","After the dud that was 'Love Aaj Kal' (IMHO) that followed the brilliant 'Jab We Met' and under-appreciated 'Socha Na Tha', Director Imtiaz Ali brings what one could call 'an experimental love story'.<br/><br/>'Rockstar' is an unforgiving film about the journey of a musician through eccentric ecstasy and depressive reclusiveness riddled with heart break that eventually destroys him.<br/><br/>Janardhan Jakhar (Ranbhir Kapoor) spends his college days at talent contests getting ridiculed or sitting in the canteen admiring Jim Morrison (and his middle finger antic). One day the canteen manager, Khatana bhai (Kumud Mishra) proclaims that to be a real musician you have feel raw pain like true love and subsequent heart break. So our hero goes on his way and tries to woo the prettiest serial heart breaker in college, unavailable Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri). In his unique, slightly daft way of proposing, JJ carves a path through Heer's cold shoulder 'burger off' stance to unveil a wild friendship involving R- rated films to shady discos, to JJ going to Kashmir for Heer's marriage.<br/><br/>Heer falls in love with JJ (relabelled as Jordan), gets married and is exported to Prague while JJ joins the family business, gets disowned by his family, moves in with Khatana bhai after spending couple of months at a shrine (Nizamuddin Dargah). He then gets signed by Platinum records, a music company owned by Dhingra (Piyush Mishra) on the recommendation of Ustad Jameel Khan (the late Shammi Kapoor). A musical trip to Prague, healing of depressed Heer through wild trips to stripper-bars to back alley clubs and a romantic escapade threading on a fine line ensues, ending the entertaining first half. Post interval, everything goes wrong with a slow build up to a long but abrupt end. What was Imtiaz Ali even thinking when he put that video hotchpotch and quote (by Rumi) at the end?<br/><br/>The concept to start with had the foundation for some astonishing cinema. Unfortunately the story (written by Imtiaz Ali) didn't build on that foundation thanks to some avoidable love story clichés that stretched the film run-time into the 'yawn' category. With some tighter editing by Aarti Bajaj, it could have made the transitions between moments less of a visual roller coaster. Talking about visuals, cinematography by Anil Mehta was top-notch. From the streets of Delhi, to the scenery in Kashmir and Prague to the concert venues; everything looked great adding to the aesthetic value of the film. <br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali is an extraordinary film maker and excels at one thing: character development. Even though some of the smaller side characters were ignored, most characters had wonderful depth to them; something several movies this year failed miserably with. The skill with which the character of JJ is handled makes you live the journey alongside him. Fabulous!<br/><br/>Throughout the film, it is JJ and not Ranbhir Kapoor you're watching. He embodies the character so well that you forget you're watching an actor doing his job. The effortlessness with which he portrays the changeover from JJ to Jordan shows why he is the future of Hindi cinema. He is leagues ahead of his generation of actors.<br/><br/>Opposite him is Nargis Fakhri as Heer. One wonders (yet again) what Imtiaz Ali was thinking. Looking pretty doesn't qualify a person as an actor, acting does. And she clearly can't act. Shaking her head like a bobble-head while blurting out flat tone dialogues; it reminded us a lot of Katrina Kaif when she had started out. Here's hoping sense prevails and she either goes back to modelling or joins an acting school before doing anything else.<br/><br/>Support from Piyush Mishra as a classic greedy man was entertaining while Kumund Mishra's simplistic portrayal as Khatana was perfect. Shernaz Patel as Heer's mother Neena Kaur and Aditi Rao Hydari as the journalist (tracking the life of Jordan) 'Sheena' play their parts well. Shammi Kapoor didn't have much to do but it was hard to not get mesmerized by that glint in his eyes. The scenes he shares with Ranbhir Kapoor felt nice.<br/><br/>Music and soundtrack by A.R. Rahman is what defines this movie. Every moment in the film had a song to set the tone with. Breathtaking rapports with the visuals entwine you in a completely different world. The production value and scale that A.R. Rahman brings to the intensity of the music in a film, no one else can compare. Mohit Chauhan as the voice of JJ/Jordan compliments Ranbhir beautifully.<br/><br/>Rockstar as a musical journey excels with some fantastic acting and mesmerizing music. On the other hand, as a love story it not only falls short of expectation but drags the whole film down. Unfortunately the story is about a musician in love so neither can survive without the other. So overall it's a bit of a mixed-bag and one feels that with better editing and casting, this could have been so much better. Irrespective of it all, I'd recommend it as a theatre-watch thanks solely to Ranbhir and A.R. Rahman."

","The legendary Bob Dylan would have been proud.<br/><br/>The ace singer and guitarist loved to lament the state of things with his acoustic ballads. However, he was also a moody personality, with little reverence to the managers who fell to their knees, or to the star-struck fans, who rushed at him from all corners. Only difference is that Janardhan Jakhar, aka Jordan, does not lament the state of things. He cries his heart out and with his guitar, sets the stage on fire with his profound agony.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar is the beautiful , moving story of this boyish, impulsive and romantic performer. It is the story of how a simpleton, who struggles to pose up with his beloved companion- the guitar itself- in front of a jeering audience, transforms as the wild-eyed, angry musician, who has everything for him, but there is something amiss in his life and he complains out aloud.<br/><br/>And we listen as well. 'Rockstar' benefits largely from its lead actor, a boy growing up into a man, while retaining that youthful essence and vulnerability firmly in place. Ranbir Kapoor had fascinated us with his idyllic idealist roles in 'Rocket Singh' and 'Wake Up Sid'. But here, his role is not that of the simple, happy-go-lucky youngster. Here is a musician who finds an exquisite melody in his pain. It is a person, who seems to be a man willing to forge his own path, determined for his free will. Yet, beneath the surface, there is an impulsive boy brooding over loss of first love.<br/><br/>And Ranbir does it all with such convincing ease, that it is hard to believe how smoothly it goes. From the Simple Simon,sweater clad avatar, who says the wrong things at the wrong time, to an infuriated and melancholic lover boy, Ranbir acts with a dazzling blend of emotions, expressions and confidence that makes his arc so believable that we eventually side up him.<br/><br/>A problem is the female lead in the film. As Janardhan/Jordan's love interest, Nargis Fakhri's Heer is a character that holds potential. Like Geet in Jab We Met, Ali has written a girl who is both free-spirited and vulnerable. However, while I did not expect Kareena Kapoor's credibility and chutzpah, I also did not expect it to be so flat as well. Nargis Fakhri is undeniably pretty, if one can overlook the upper lip pout. However, when it comes to stun us with some sharp histrionics, we get all pomp, no show. Sure, she smiles gaily, as she watches the B-Grade film sleaze in a seedy theater, or gulps down the bottles of 'Desi Daru' with Jordan. But her dialogue scenes seem contrived and strained. And of course, her simpers and sobs further ruin the impact.<br/><br/>But Ali makes up amply in his supporting cast. Piyush Mishra is alternately funny and vicious as the music industry tycoon, who exploits Jordan's talent and anguish to the fullest. Kumud Mishra has a nice turn as Jordan's understanding mentor Khatana. And yesteryear's rock and roll legend Shammi Kapoor has an unforgettable duo as a venerated musician, who finds that Jordan has It. Ali even lets the two Kapoors dominate the frames in a number of sequences, most notably in a mesmeric duet, the legend with the Shehnai and the younger star with his faithful guitar. <br/><br/>Ali has been a master in experimenting with tried and tested formula in his own credible and warm approach. 'Rockstar' is no different. While it is a predictable story, Ali has the ability to make us feel for its characters. Ali keeps most of the characters extremely life-like and believable. He also pens layer cakes of dialogues that are spiced up by ribald humor, naiveté and earthy simplicity as well. There are times, where he grapples with the more mushy and melodramatic moments. However, he amply makes up with his sharp eye and deft hand for detail and nuance. The film surprises and delights us with its nice, neat observations of its characters- from Janardhan playfully doing rounds with black glasses to Khatana's clavicle smeared with talcum powder, as he answers a questioning reporter and from Piyush Mishra's big wig to the pseudo-helpful recording artist, who punctuates, as a music director corrects Janardhan's renditions, with sounds of Oomph, Taahh! As a result, we end up believing in the film despite its more contrived moments.<br/><br/>The writer-director has showed a penchant for beautiful and show-stopping song sequences as much as for images that capture the ups and downs of young love. Here, he is aided by veteran cinematographer Anil Mehta, whose work spans from the landscapes to the anguish and longing in Jordan's face, and from the excited crowds to the softer and impassioned moments of intimacy. And, miraculously, composer AR Rahman is back on scintillating and superb form. The ace composer has made a worthy comeback with rhythms and melodies that celebrate young love, echoes pain and disillusionment and also voices inspiration and salvation. It is a beautiful work of music and Ali uses it fully to stir and captivate us. You can feel the thump of angst for free will in 'Sadda Haq', feel the mood for mischief with 'Katiya Karoon', feel invigorated and enlightened by the Sufi ballad 'Kun Faya Kun', set beautifully in the Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah and moved to tears by the epic finale of 'Nadaan Parinde'<br/><br/>Rockstar may not be a perfect film. Its world is a mix of fantasy and the real world we live in. While Ali cooks up the blend expertly, he does struggle at times. At the same time, it is also a film that, all of a sudden, tugs you in into its pain and passion. And while it may be a bit idyllic like most of the love stories , it is worth watching for Ali's heartfelt, nuanced filmmaking, music that wins our hearts and an actor who conquers our souls."
"abhitaliyan","8","1","1","23 November 2011"," Rockstar - FlickyFriday Review
","""Jo Bhi Main Kehna Chahun, Barbaad Karen Alfaaz Mere"" – Janardhan Jhakad aka Jordan<br/><br/>Who would have thought before the release of this movie that these brilliant lyrics by Irshad Kamil will slightly sum up the tad flighty second half of 'Rockstar'. Unlike his earlier ventures Imtiaz Ali departs from his pragmatic approach to day-to-day-life 'love' in Rockstar and renders a story surrounding supernal romance.<br/><br/>Janardhan Jakhad (J.J) aka Jordan is a Hindu college student. He is dorky, he has insatiable fondness for cafeteria samosas, his fashion sense is passé and he is often inarticulate about his feelings. He is also a budding musician & Jim Morrison fan but he can't seem to find his niche. Enters Khatana Bhaai, owner of the cafeteria with know-it-all personality, he advises J.J to find some pain and agony in his life because all the great musicians according to him had one thing in common which was gargantuan amount of suffering in their personal lives. According to Khatana Bhaai, JJ's life devoid of any romance & heartbreaks has been far too easy for him. J.J then sets out to get his heart-broken but in a rather easy & comic way. When he hears that soon to-be-married Heer Kaul of St. Stephen's college is a serial 'heartbreaker', he professes his undying love to her hoping to get his heart broken. But things take a different turn and they eventually end up being good friends after this whole saga. So begins Jordan's bittersweet journey from an ordinary Jat boy of old Delhi to becoming self-destructive Rockstar of Nation.<br/><br/>First half of the movie was quite enjoyable with a romantic comedy flavour to it. But problems started cropping up in ambitious & unpredictable second half which was intoxicated on tragedy & other- worldly love. Transformation of Jordan from innocent & warm musician who just wants to hang out with Heer for ""gandh machana"" to angered & agonized Rockstar was not at all smooth. I don't have any qualms with Imtiaz Ali adapting Non-Linear screenplay, it was refreshing actually, a welcome change from routine Bollywood movies. But, its execution somewhat fell short of ""Wow"" factor. Even so second half quite easily managed to keep head above the water thanks to some beautifully composed shots, brilliant acting by Ranbir Kapoor & soulful music by AR Rahman.<br/><br/>Opening sequence of the movie showing bedraggled Jordan making his way through to the jam-packed stadium was majestic. Anil Mehta did an exceptional job as cinematographer. Direction as expected was refreshing from Imtiaz Ali but definitely not olympian as it was the case with Jab We Met. Ranbir Kapoor & Nargis Fakhri looked terrific together. Ranbir completely immersed himself in the role to give us the performance of the year and of his career also. Nargis Fakhri's dialogue delivery was a let-down. She looked amazing & convincing as a Kashmiri girl but barring 2-3 sequences in second half her dialogue delivery was flimsy. It kind of acted as a drag for the entire movie. Editing also could have been better; 2nd half needed some 10-15 minutes of trimming. As is the hallmark of Imtiaz Ali, fabulous amount of attention was given to details. Now coming to the strongest point of the movie: Music. I don't think I need to tell you how awesome & pertinent music was. Mellifluous music carrying the weight of story on its shoulders, this important facet has been missing from bollywood movies lately but Rockstar marks its much awaited comeback. Rockstar is AR Rahman's best & most complete album after Rang De Basanti (2006). My picks are Kun Faaya Kun & Jo Bhi Main.<br/><br/>In the end, Rockstar is a brave effort about ethereal love which transcends everything from reason to morality with a superb 1st half and an average 2nd half. Rockstar is not a regular Bollywood outing by any standards and we must congratulate Imtiaz Ali for that. Watch it for the livewire acting performance by Ranbir Kapoor, Inspired Cinematography and bewitching music by AR Rahman.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.5/10.<br/><br/>http://flickyfriday.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/rockstar/"
"csingh-2","8","1","1","21 November 2011"," Rockstar - Something different
","This is an interesting film to start off with. The opinions are as contrast as they are extreme. Here's my two cents' worth ( if I had a nickel for every time I offered my two cents' worth...well, I should ideally have seven hypothetical cents).<br/><br/>The movie is clearly an experiment. And as we all know, experiments can go either way. I would give Imtiaz Ali (the director) full marks for his courageous attempt to narrate a complex story in the chosen fashion. I'll admit it was a rather refreshing change to see a romantic/musical tale be told so differently.<br/><br/>I won't go into the details of the story since the movie has been out for more than a week.<br/><br/>The film, as the name suggests, is almost like a musical. There's no doubt about it. A.R Rahman (and Mohit Chauhan) plays a vital role in making the film what it is. It is surprising how unsurprising it has become that he outdoes himself every time. Yes, I am a huge A.R Rahman fan... but then again, who isn't? 'Sada Haq', 'Jo bhi main' and 'Tum ho' in my opinion are the 'creme de la creme' of the soundtracks of the film.<br/><br/>This brings me to the next best thing about the movie - Ranbir Kapoor. After already having established his acting prowess in films like 'Rajneeti', 'Wake up Sid' and 'Ajab Prem ki Gazab Kahani' he steps it up to the next level. He is almost as good as Nargis Fakhri is bad. I want to say more good things about his acting but you get the point...<br/><br/>Surprisingly for an Imtiaz Ali movie, the quality of the film does drop in the second half. The narration becomes a little sloppy and the films tends to stretch just a tad. The ending is a little obscure but overall, I don't believe is a deal breaker. Despite its drawbacks and unconventional style, Rockstar works. Definitely a one time watch.<br/><br/>Rating - 7.5/10"
"saytosandeep","8","1","1","17 November 2011"," MY REVIEW: one of the most poignant piece of bollywood cinema
","Imtiaz Ali understands the love stories to the core but this time he makes two mistakes; first he casts Nargis who need acting lessons and second he allows his indulgence to allow movie to go for extra half an hour. Don't start thinking, that you should avoid this movie. Imtiaz gives his golden touch to first half of the movie and plays the master stroke by casting Ranbir Kapoor as the central protagonist. Rahman's rocking music and Mohit's golden voice are the integral parts of the story and help the movie whenever direction and editing falters. But above all, this movie belongs to Ranbir Kapoor who gives more than a riveting performance. As J.J he is lovable and as Jordan he is irresistible. He makes you feel the pain of being in love in every scene he is in. The movie is packed with witty dialogues and soulful moments. Far from perfect piece of cinema, this is one of the most poignant piece of bollywood cinema. Go and experience the Rockstar from the hands of Imtiaz Ali who keeps on exploring the different dimensions of love."

","Love, pain, struggle creates true artist – movie revolves round this thought. Story starts with an ordinary guy who just want to make big in music, guitar was his childhood passion... as story starts we see a stupid boy namely JJ; camera revolves around some characters for introduction – one of the primary one is canteen guy "" Khatara Bhai "" his role is kind of booster to JJ but in a very typical Haryanvi style - on his advice which is also the base theme of movie that - real music comes from a broken heart JJ goes to woo the hottest chick in college ... Heer ... (full credit goes to Imitiaz Ali and his casting team to get this ""life is beautiful"" kind of gal in movie; Yes she is beautiful, charming and with sexy lips but the best what makes her special in movie is her freshness...she did justice to what she was suppose to do best – ""act"". Once introduction is over story begins – story in a movie is something which is hard to find nowadays some successful examples are – Dabaang, Ready, Bodyguard, Singham etc list is lengthy Lets go on  Now with all the voodoo!!! thing happened between JJ and Heer eventually they become good friends strange !!! more over they began to like each other fell in love but were numb ... now this part of movie when Heer and JJ were doing all the crazy things together - is captured in camera nicely , just before Heer's wedding she asked JJ to hug her - the chemistry between these two were visible from that seen onwards... I must say cinematographer did a superb task here...hats of Anil Mehta sahib. Nargis was more special after interval where she was asked to do something more with her acting... shots were intense, no songs no fancy clothes just pure act... to know more about movie go and watch it out for yourself The movie was so beautiful that I wished to see more; some scenes are breathtaking and could connect directly with you, there were goose bumps often while watching especially during the song - ""Nadaan Parindey to Ghar Aaja"", songs are weaved nicely to make your experience a complete one; AR Rehman is successful to create magic yet again, some incredible numbers are Khun Faya Khun, Nadaan Parindey, Sada Haq and almost all. Rehman songs are like old wine ""the later the better"". After a long time I watched something which I can really remember for almost a week now, and that's what counts the last movie so special was ""Rang De Basanti"". Some more were there after that like – Guzarish comes on top of mind. There is also a positive aspect from the movie – the nurturing bands in India especially on Eastern Side will get boost up and can make their own history like Jordan. India should get its own Pink Floyd, Jim Morrison and Led zeppelin; Indian versions would be more soulful than western ones. I crossed my fingers. Great movie by Imtiaz Ali and one of the best of Ranbir Kapoor - 20 years down the line he will be proud of doing ""Rockstar"" Regards, Rockstar Fan - Abhishek Roy."

"karthikananth87","7","1","1","15 November 2011"," ROCKSTAR - Ranbir's entry to the elite league
","A lot of us were really looking forward to watching this movie mainly because of A.R.Rahman's music. The Mozart from Madras had the world taken by storm by providing an album that encompassed music from various genres and feel.<br/><br/>The Question: Did the movie live up to the expectations? My Answer: Kind of....<br/><br/>POSITIVES!<br/><br/>A.R.Rahman's music was already a mass hit...but the background score was stupendous.... Mohit Chauhan's voice was the perfect choice for Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor).... The 'Sher-o-wali Ma' track reminded me of the freshness displayed in the ""Iyappa"" track from the movie Boys (Tamil). Also, all the songs in the album have been given to perfectly match the on screen situation.Whether it is the freshness in Phir se Ud Chala, Joy in Katiya Karun, Darkness in Aur ho, Desperate Hope in Nadaan Parindey or Anger in Sadda Haq...... A.R.R proves that he is a class above the rest.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor definitely!! The Kapoor kid has issued a stamp of authority with his mature portrayal of Jordan....a character that previously goes through many transitions due to the high's and low's of his life..... from a simpleton musician Janardhan Jhakad (JJ). We see 2 very different Ranbir Kapoors in the movie. Also, he carries simple scenes with natural acting rather than supreme overacting displayed by many of his current competitors. He could have screamed a little less at times...but still...on the whole...a performance worthy of a filmfare award.<br/><br/>Camera-work and Cinematography was great.....Superb locales and unique shots have become a common criteria for films to focus on, in order to cut competition... but the camera-work for songs like Sadda Haq, Nadaan Parindey and Phir se Ud Chala showed that the entire unit was soaking in the nectar of music composed by Rahman. That translated on to the visuals and the viewers were in for a treat. Most importantly, when Jordan performed on stage, the cinema audience felt that they were a part of his concert. To achieve that amount of realistic connection is commendable.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali has to be given credit for writing this story and attempting to make a movie like Rockstar. Lets face it...it ain't the run of the mill Bolly masala.....neither does it have a widespread target audience. So if Rockstar manages to recover it's cost and make decent profits, everyone will be pleasantly surprised..... But Imtiaz Ali made this movie for it's true meaning and essence.... kudos for that.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES! (Well i did answer ""Kind of..."")<br/><br/>Nargis Fakhri did have a new look ..... but honestly the audience gets an overdose of her....her character 'Heer' seems to stall the flow of the movie....Though Heer (in the movie) is responsible for the creation of Jordan the Rockstar, character Heer is mainly responsible for compromising the script and screenplay (mainly in the second half). SECOND HALF RULE! It is an universal but unsaid law....""IF A BAD MOVIE HAS A GOOD SECOND HALF, THINGS MIGHT WORK, BUT IF A POTENTIALLY GREAT MOVIE HAS A POOR SECOND HALF (Even in relative comparison), THAT AFFECTS THE AUDIENCE ADVERSELY! "" The First half of Rockstar is mind blowing....and the 2nd half just does not sustain the same amount of steam.....things move back and forth.....the audience lose the flow..... the main attraction in the second half is the video of Nadaan Parindey....Also, the movie ends in a weird manner that can be left to the audience's perception...<br/><br/>Direction, Editing and Screenplay missing a few tricks ...... Ali and gang have attempted a different narrating style and the movie tends to move in both directions. Also, songs are edited in portions....tracks used in different places....this formula works well in the first half , but loses itself in the second....can leave many people in the audience confused and irritated. <br/><br/>OVERALL VERDICT! Rockstar is definitely worth a watch but don't go with too many expectations. It could have been great if the second half had more focus and structure. I am giving Rockstar 4 on 5 (Actually 3....but 1 point for A.R.Rahman's genius contribution) Ranbir Kapoor is here to stay!"

","So,Rockstar is finally out and its with flaws but still its fabulous. Lets talk about flaws first. Imtiaz Ali have written his most innovative script so far but it got few holes like he could have made the storytelling little bit smoother in the first half but its OK we can manage with that. The other thing i complain that why Imtiaz choose Nargis Fakhri to play the lead actress. She is breathtakingly beautiful, no doubt about that but she just don't know how to speak Hindi and how to behave desi. To make it simple, she is the only main drawback of the film.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about what makes Rockstar a memorable movie.I know movie is a result of teamwork but the three man who makes Rockstar a fabulous film is Ranbir kapoor, A.R Rehman and last but not the least Mohit Chauhan for giving his beautiful but rocksolid voice to Jordan the Rockstar. Its all and all Ranbir show throughout the entire movie and Rehman's soulful music to make Ranbir's character express his angst. This movie cannot be done without A.R.Rehman. Its Ranbir's best work so far. Those who have not seen the Rockstar yet, just go and watch it for Ranbir kapoor aka Jordan aka Janardhan Jakkad and believe me you will come out of the theater with Jordan in your mind and heart.

"Abhastiwari","7","1","1","13 November 2011"," Rockstar : A different and good watch
","Story of struggle and passion of of a wannabe rockstar, from college to the big stage. First half of the movie is fun-filled and entertaining. The second half of movie is a bit monotonous according to the demand of story. Story narration is quite impressive at most of the time, apart from the switching between present-past, this switching was much good in 'Love Aaj Kal'. Ranbir Kapoor has done fantastic job, a true rockstar starting from the innocence in the opening reels to the arrogance in the end. Actress, Nargis Fakhri has also done true justice to her role.Just go for this movie for entertainment with no expectations as hyped. <br/><br/>Why to Watch: Ranbir's acting , Nargis Fakhri's acting and beauty , A different angle to love story <br/><br/>Why not to Watch: Not upto the much hyped expectations."
"user-107-982434","4","7","18","14 November 2011"," Its an average lovestory without any proper story!!
","I will not prefer you to see Rockstar in theater. It's one time watchable movie, but not in theater. Rockstar is a slaw movie without proper story. There are few punches in movie that will make you laugh, but its not enough for a complete movie. Music of Rockstar is outstanding. Hats off to A.R. Rahman & Mohit Chauhan for tremendous music. See detailed movie review from Daily Bhaskar.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor proves himself to be the apt choice for the role. He carries the entire film on his shoulders. He induces life in his character and matures from an dumb college boy to a hard-hitting rockstar. Nargis Fakhiri shows spark in her performance, although there is scope for improvement. Shammi Kapoor leaves an indelible mark in his small but pivotal role. Kumud Mishra as Jordan's well-wisher and PR, plays his part well. Piyush Mishra is hilarious as usual. Shernaz Patel as Heer's mother looks convincing."

","I was looking forward to watch this since the trailer was released and yes, I found the film very entertaining but only up to a certain extent. The weak storyline, confusing screenplay,confusing narrating style. unanswered questions, bad climax are the minus points of Rockstar.<br/><br/>The film shows more focus on physical attraction and s*x rather than love.<br/><br/>The storyline is weak and its difficult to find the logic of what's going on screen.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali's direction is decent in the movie. Rockstar is nowhere near his past two films Love Aaj Kal and Jab We Met.<br/><br/>The only plus points of the movie is Ranbir Kapoor's palang tod acting and A.R. Rehman's rocking music.<br/><br/>I noticed many people going out of the theater before the movie finishes, which is very sad! The movie didn't connect to many audiences and the emotional scenes can't bring tears!<br/><br/>so its just an average movie and you will find it beautiful to watch. i have given all the 5 ratings to ranbir kapoor. really he did a great job! nargis has to learn a lot. other characters are just normal."
"chintan709","4","6","15","14 November 2011"," ""bROCKenSTAR""
","Watching the promos I wanted to watch this movie for nothing else but Ranbir. Knowing Imtiyaz's track record (except Love Aaj Kal) I was even more interested in Rockstar. Ranbir's look, the portrayed theme of the movie, Kun Faya Kun (this song made me feel that Rehman would have put some of his long anticipated magic in this movie), etc. were enough reasons to take the risk of watching a mainstream Bollywood movie. (I must mention, it was a fierce battle for the tickets over the weekend)<br/><br/>The start was good Ranbir (Jordan/JJ/Janardan) in angry, aggressive, wild look walking through equally feral crowd and a concert about to begin. Just pumps adrenalin through your veins. As expected, the movie goes in past: a simple, innocent guy trying to make his career in singing, but something, some fire/reason/passion missing in him is not allowing him to achieve it. ""Only a heart with deep grief can awaken the artist in you"" he's told. So he TRIES to fall in love with the 'heart breaker' in college. He and Heer (Nargis) get really close and he brings out wildness in her. They do all the crazy things before she gets married to a rich guy in two months. Watching Joshili Jawani, drinking Desi Daaru and other stuff tows you in a very beautiful part of the movie. Jordan misses his audition to be with Heer. He goes to Kashmir to attend her wedding where their wild stuff (Gandh Machana) continues. The day before her wedding we see Heer falling for Jordan. You expect them to sprint which they don't. Despite all this, his innocence keeps him away from pain. Then the movie gets really exciting, the flow of past and present and Jordan's career buildup and his transition into a singer are portrayed spectacularly.<br/><br/>Jordan's career takes him to Prague where Heer is settled after marriage. However, she is ill and undergoing treatment. As decided during Heer – Jordan separation, they continue their ""Gandh Machana"" in Prague too. Heer finds her life back, her health improves and they again land in a situation to make a decision.<br/><br/>It was Interval and I was very happy to come for the movie. It seemed like a right decision. I'm thinking, 'The movie lived up to the expectation. Movie has good flow, awesome acting by Ranbir, Nargis is bearable. This movie is better than Ra.One.' However, there's a saying in Formula1, ""It ain't over till it's over'. After the interval, the movie starts its open fire on you when you are least expecting. Escape routes are closed and you have no way except to tolerate the incoming.<br/><br/>All the expectations and excitement built in first half are destroyed one by one. The series of Jordan's fights with media, police arrest him, he has legal issues (surprisingly, nothing much happens to him) because of his carelessness and he comes out shouting and singing; only to again land up in same situation. Heer comes back into his life and he tries to improve her health with his magic touch which stops working once he gets her pregnant as that's too much for her already weak body! Story just takes a complete halt and scenes seem to be repeating in this half. A series of unnecessary songs to fill up the time don't even let you sleep. I don't like to spoil the movie watching experience by revealing the climax. But this movie has no climax.That's the suspense for you!!!<br/><br/>There is nothing in the movie that justifies the name Rockstar. However good Jordan's look and Ranbir's acting OR his attitude, it doesn't hold the movie together as there's not much to emote after a point. In the promos, Jordan seems to be a revolutionary, a person fighting the society and its cliché's to live his life in his own way. In the movie, he's just a pathetic, careless 'loser in love!' Many in the audience heaved a sigh of relief as it ended and left the auditorium as fast as they could. Overall, absolutely pathetic movie! Better to watch online, that also STRICTLY for Ranbir's work. 4/10 – only for the first half! ""bROCKenSTAR"" it is!!"

"Herag","3","5","12","8 December 2011"," Badmash Movie
","This guy, Ranbir Kapoor, can't act. He has one facial expression that alternates between a retarded or smelling a gas leak for most part of the movie. He is not even good looking, in fact bordering on ugly as compared to Abishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar. I have no idea what the directors see in him to waste a movie with him. The story is contrived and ridiculous. The music of A.R. Rahman is the saving grace for this movie that has been overrated-as usual from RK fans. The debut actress is pathetic. She will do lot of justice to the art of cinema..by staying away from it. This is another movie, that shows, that the Indian film industry will never recuperate from the sorry state that is in right now. The newer actors have no clue about acting, nor have they inherited the acting genes.<br/><br/>These actors are the worst looking and worst actors in recent times. The movie is about going thru pain to achieve good music..it would have been good story, only if it was written well and acted well but with the latter day Lila and Majnu's, it is a pathetic and a disjointed jargon. The direction is half baked and primitive.The dialogs are written by a high school drop out (are you dying? or when are you dying!) For heaven sake shape up or ship out. This movie sucks big time and waste of time for any one looking for good cinema. Rating of 3 for the music and supposed to be the last appearance of Shammi Kapoorji on the celluloid. The director should find a day job as gaffer since he knows the inside out of film making."

","Plot, cast, storyline, music, songs everything great. but directors/editors are just under what dilemma made this movie, nobody can understand? Why our BOLLY people looks so obsessed with foreign location and European mentality? There is no sense as where to put what song? no connection between storyline and songs.<br/><br/>There was lot lot opportunity to make this movie as one of the long remembered blockbuster.<br/><br/>The questions one would ask him/her self and director would be? 1. What pain did Ranbir really had that lead him to sing painful/rebellious songs? 2. What the bloody hell was he missting in his life? He had Heer whenever wherever and whatever way he wanted? 3. A sheer absence of great platonic love.<br/><br/>4. Background score at certain level is just nonsense. no connection of words with situation.<br/><br/>5. What society did wrong with him that lead him to sing SADDA HAQ? Which HAQ was he asking for? 6. He seemed to became rockstar because of press reporters only.<br/><br/>7. What kind of message/lesson did he receive at Hajrat Nijamuddin.<br/><br/>First 45 minutes great. Ranbir falling in love with Heer(Nargis Fakri). Heer refuses his love because of family or pre-commitment and social reason (sanskriti etc). Ranbir performs at some unusual locations with refusal pain where stopped by society/system. Ranbir shares his modern ideology being NASTIK (not believing in GOD but in working for good cause). Taking up some issues also concerns current affairs corruption, women rights, youth rights, freedom etc. in his way of protesting? Turning youth by his songs in crowd then movement. Ranbir also experiencing some injustice in society by police, bureaucrat and then decide his way of performing and awareness of (arroganceGIRI). Heer dying of some disease and their family being reluctant to take fruitful action. Ranbir coming to rescue but stopped by Heer(unwillingly) and society. Ranbir falling down of pain pain then some miraculous happen people support help him come out and take some bold steps forward and saving her life. A global acceptance of his ideas can also be shown as there is international support.<br/><br/>I really had great expection from thie movie, but surely did failed. And all the songs of this movie are absolutely boring. And Atif Aslam was best if he would sing but Mohit chowhan is absolutely bogus. A fully bakwas movie. The worst movie I have ever seen in 10 long years..."
"rajatsethi","4","3","6","17 December 2011"," Disappointing
","The director was unable to keep the user captured for the entire period of the film. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. The actress Nargis Fakhri was a joke in the film. I wasn't able to relate to her acting at all. Even the good scenes were cut short because of her incompetence.<br/><br/>Ranbir on the other hand was quite good, better than his most roles I guess. His acting was good but his co-star was just wasn't able to match him. Some of the scene which were meant to be serious looked fake and comical.<br/><br/>Over all the film was a disappointment, it could have been so much better. Especially as the plot was worthy unlike so many Hindi movies."
"zabikhan09","6","3","6","14 November 2011"," New way of story telling but its all about Ranbir !
","The film leaps dispense with starting with a concert in Rome and then flashing back and forth to fill in the back story of Jordan -- named thus by his ladylove. It is a simple, unspectacular tale, sometimes even predictable. Sometimes the patchiness shows. It's a stretch.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali to take a love story and present it in a manner that's completely different from the clichÃ© Bollywood. Romance, under his creative vision, becomes a multi-layered and presented in unique way.<br/><br/>The film's crisp and beautiful cinematography makes the screen light up to dreamy sights and the enumerable chopper shots allow a great vantage point to take in the stunning landscapes of Kashmir and Prague.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor has evolved as an actor and gets into the character perfectly. It is he who holds the movie while Nargis Fakhri is good as fresh face but her acting was disappointing.<br/><br/>The movie especially the second half is Boring and is stretched... kept at bay by AR Rahman's grand music, lovely soundtracks.Soundtracks were melodious rather than ROCK which a rock star should actually be singing.<br/><br/>Watching 'Rockstar' once is like watching it many times over, thanks to the repeated scenes and flash back that recap the film. If you thought being stabbed once was bad, here's what a knife set can do.<br/><br/>Watch it if you are a Ranbir kapoor fan and want to experience a new way of story telling."

","'Rockstar' movie directed by Imtiaz Ali is not a great work from his all work. I am giving this movie 2/10 after considering various factors.<br/><br/>1. Storyline of this movie is vague and looks really patchy. 2. Director was failed to produce act from Main actors(mainly Nargis and Rabir at some extent). 3. Theme of the movie is unpredictable. While watching this movie I was unsure whether its a Comedy, Adult Comedy, Suspense, Subjective, Melodic movie. 4. In lots of scenes, they were not able to convey any message or meaning. 5. Rabir as an actor has done a well job, but some scenes it looks like director is over expecting. 6. Songs are not so melodious. 7. A.R. Rehman has been repeating the same genre songs which are based on prayers in mosques. 8. The choreography is not novel.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is not a entertainer but a killer. It takes you to a ride with lots of sudden stops and falls. So be prepare to watch with nothing in mind. I would be say not a one time watch when you really want to get entertained."

But love story is not the only thing that this movie offers but it is hell of a ride of a jouney of life of a 'Rock star'.<br/><br/>The lead character (Ranbir Kapoor) is confused and puzzled in the beginning like the previous movies and a failed singer/ guitarist looking for fame and success but doesn't know how to get it, until he receives an advice from his friend that every great artist has a story, a story of pain behind his success. That exactly is the concept of the movie and the rest of the movie gives the details of how he fell in love and felt his shares of pain to become a 'Rockstar'.<br/><br/>How the story unfolds sometimes makes the viewer confused and many of the people don't get the concept of the movie and don't relate to it. The first half of the movie unfolds his college life, his desire to become a rockstar and also his new friendship with Heer (Nargis Fakhri) in humorous manner which later gets pretty serious and complicated as Heer is about to marry. The second half unfolds more about his music life after Heer leaves his life and he is thrown out of home. Music becomes his way of expressing himself and love story gets more and more complicated when meets Heer in Prague during his music tours.<br/><br/>The director has surely woven the love story like no other but script is not very strict, so much things keep happening leaving the audience baffled and thinking ""what this movie is really about?"" Imtiaz Ali has tried to give so much in one movie that it gets a little hard to digest In other words the the movie doesn't unfold very smoothly.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor surely looks like a rockstar and has done the job the perfectly well, it showed all the hard work he had done learning with A R Rahman in his studio. The scene where Ranbir (JJ) yells while while getting beaten really looked genuine and really sends shiver down your spine. All other actors also did well, the loose end being the debuting lead actress Nargis Fakhri.<br/><br/>The music given is excellent as expected from A. R. Rahman and is on par how much is needed in music based movie like this and vocals of Mohit Chauhan really brings out the pain of the rockstar.<br/><br/>The movie loses its direction a little bit after the interval but overall the movie is worth watching not just as an entertainer but also as a one to be inspired from.

But exceptions are found when A R Rahman comes. <br/><br/>Next comes to Imtiaz Ali. I think he did research properly in musical movies to come to action of this movie. As he is not typical like any other director of Bollywood, Rockstar proves that also. He is very talented indeed and with another musical talent A R Rahman, he blasts. <br/><br/>And I became a fan of Ranbir Kapoor who is from a cinema background family, his father is Rishi Kapoor. His Jordan look in this movie is just awesome. He delivered successfully the thinking of A R Rahman and Imtiaz Ali as well as great singing of Muhit Chauhan.<br/><br/>I didn't listen Muhit Chauhan so much but in this movie, I totally enjoyed. I searched for other music of him and found that he sings very well.<br/><br/>I would like to rate as 1. Music 10/10 2. Film 7/10 3. Acting 8/10 4. Story 7/10"

""That Away from right or wrong, there is a field. I will meet u there"". But actually this movie depicts ending on user's choice. If anyone wants to feel that Heer is not dead. So he can. That in the end.<br/><br/>Ranbir was sad when he left her in coma in the hospital. Here is the time when song starts. Then he blames himself for her condition. And became careless and the scene comes of Puking and Burning Guitar as his hopeless felling due to blaming himself. Then at the end it is showed that he met with Heer on stage. And after that the climax line shown after flashbacks. That they will meet there.<br/><br/>But according to the other ending option. Some people can interpret seeing Heer on stage as Ranbir's assumption. And may be she still in coma but her soul still needs him as reference to movies relating to the soul traveling while in coma. ;-) <br/><br/>But although. It is confusing. And despite of any ending. This movie is great great and great. No movie could stand along this."

The ending was sad, but Ranbir acted so well and not even for a second I was bored while watching the film. Each and every song was setting in heart. Imtiaz Ali is the master of making such a marvelous story and then portraying it. Well lets focus on Nargis Fakhri, she was stunning!

","Movie is awesome but i am quite disappointed by ending, I expected Heer recover since she cannot live without Jordan, her blood count was increasing so seeing her in coma made me upset and strange, could have been a happy ending, can the Producer REMAKE movie for happy ending just like I Am Legend. Its a nice movie showing how a star gets hard time becoming famous and wealthy but on the same time how much big sacrifice is given, specially when its your love you can live without. Rest life is nothing but pain. I really love to see its remake of ENDING and happy one.

","This shows that storytelling does not have to be in a format or pattern and yet you can be sssooo effective. Imtiaz brought us an immensely fresh style of storytelling. And his creative vision was well supported by the rest of the team members. Ranbir- He well operated the character and fit himself into it perfectly. He is so troubled as Jordan and so innocence as Janardan. He displays the transition to his character so well. He's defined an emotionally troubled Rockstar. A R Rahman- I think he was there with Imtiaz when he was writing the film or working on the plot to be more precise. Because songs and background scores don't give a feeling that they are an added feature in the story, instead they breath in it and make it ssoo Powerful. Anil Mehta- Cinematography is just so in sync with the scenes that it does magic for the viewers. Editing, singing, acting by the rest of the cast were all Marvelous. It was a delight to watch Late Shammi Kapoor as a Shehnaayi player. His dialogue delivery still had a charisma. And how can we forget that 'Tareef karoon kya uski' track performed by Ranbir...So beautiful. The climax was icing on the cake. A grand salute to the Captain Imtiaz."
"apoorvsaxe","9","0","0","15 February 2013"," A misunderstood movie!!!
","When the movie got released, many complained that they didn't like it for various reasons. But mainly coz of its so called abrupt ending that they didn't like. I think it was misunderstood and even a bit mis-realized at the very first place. <br/><br/>Don't know somebody has thought of it or not, but the blame for this comes down on two things -<br/><br/>1)Strong role, weak actress : the whole life of Jordan was revolving around this girl he loved. She played the strongest part in his life and the film's story. This role required a lot of conviction and expertise of an accomplished actress. But what we got instead, a new comer calendar girl who was a new joinee into kindergarten acting school. I believe that was the biggest mistake made by Imtiaz. Selecting Nargis Fakhri for such an important role that was the basis of super-strong performance of Ranbir and his music (one of bests of AR Rahman). Nargis tried her very best and gave a pretty decent performance for a new comer, but, infront of these very strong people, she looked completely out of place.<br/><br/>2)Marketing: Sadda Haq, yes this song was great and all. But using this song as the prime weapon of publicity was a blunder b'coz the movie was a love story and this song set the mood otherwise. I heard many people saying that we expected that Jordan would be a rebel against the corrupt system (in the League of Rang De Basanti). There are no 2 thoughts about it, it was a very personal and intimate movie, but in contrast, Sadda Haq was a totally rebellious and crowd-pulling song and not apt for marketing the movie. Also, the whole movie was thought of to be presented as Jordan(Ranbir) being the sole driver of the story. But in fact, he was driven by Heer(Nargis) at each step. And as I already said, she was no match to what the role demanded. The movie would have been so better if they would have got an accomplished actress instead of a newcomer. With Ranbir, AR Rahman, Imtiaz Ali and Mohit Chauhan, bars were already very high for this movie, why don't they seriously thought while selecting the main lead actress also, i don't know. They should have given equal weightage to lead actress too. Then the ending would have been more clear and satisfying. B'coz movie doesn't end with Jordan's life, it ends with Heer's life and explaining ""when and where"" Jordan and Heer will live happy together, forever.<br/><br/>Still after these flaws, it is 1 of my personal favorites of all time. And i give it 9/10 (minus 1 for Nargis). This is what we call ""one step behind the true perfection"". But apart from these reasons, it is truly a great effort by Imtiaz and and i would like to congratulate Ranbir n Mohit for this particular movie."
"silvan-desouza","6","0","0","4 September 2012"," Good but could be much more
","Imtiaz Ali gave us refreshing SOCHA NA THA(2005) and JAB WE MET(2007) and then LOVE AAJ KAL(2009) Obviously the expectations post it shot up ROCKSTAR is a hatke film, it shows the life of a Rockstar modelled on Jim Morrison. The film starts with Ranbir Kapoor with long hair being bitten up and then enters a stadium and picks up the guitar and then we go into flashback where Ranbir is a wannabe Rockstar who wastes time around, then he meets Nargis Fakhri. The romantic scenes may seem a bit unreal but are entertaining. The film does get confusing throughout when several scenes seem like suddenly cut and pasted or perhaps some reels are missing but thats not the case. The pre-wedding scene, the drunk scene is funny too The change in personalities(similar to JWM) is well handled though Ranbir suddenly meeting her in Prague does seem a bit unrealistic.<br/><br/>My problem with the film is it's discontinuity which was perhaps intentional, Another is perhaps more focus on his musical career then the love story, Also several scenes do seem filmy like the pre-climax But there are several brilliant scenes in the film and though one misses the andrelaine rush when the film commences.<br/><br/>Direction is superb Writing does have some flaws. Music by A.R.Rahman is the biggest asset, the best thing is all songs have Mohit Chauhan singing for Ranbhir Kapoor unlike normally in Hindi films where even Rockstars have different voices. Jo Bhi Main is superb, SADDA HAQ, Tum Ho, Aur Ho all are magnificent. Sheher Main is good too Camera-work is flawless Dialogues are superb<br/><br/>Ranbhir Kapoor lives the role, his Jatt style, his expressions, the way his character transforms are all flawlessly portrayed by the youngster He got all the awards last year and truly deserves Nargis Fakhri however doesn't impress, the role required a seasoned actress but she is terrible and a pain to watch especially in the second half. Her several scenes are ruined by her though it's partial to criticise her as she is a first timer but yet a big disappointment. Her voice is dubbed annoyingly too. Shammi Kapoor who died few months before the film released looks pale and sick throughout but has his charm still. Aditi Rao Hyderi is good, Piyush Mishra who won rave reviews for GULAAL does a great job, Same goes for Kumud Mishra who is fantastic Shernaz Patel is good Moufud Aziz is okay"

","Imtiaz from his usual self diversifies into passive evolvement stirring the protagonist to exemplary pinnacle through this artistically overwhelming narrative. The journey from Janardhan Jhakar to Jordan is subtly captured with neatly etched characters, slick editing and a finely crafted script. Looking at the intricate detailing and contrasting patterns of Ranbirâ(TM)s character, it would be a tough choice to find an alternate calibre to breathe life into Jordan. Though with the initial revelation of 14 tracks from the maestro stirred some question marks, Ali seamlessly nurtured the amalgamation turning every subsequent frame into a finely woven poetry. From the raw innocence of an aspiring college boy to the ingeniously interlaced affair eventuating a pain stricken dogmatist star, Ali sways with ease in sketching precise screenplays for his unusually conventional characters. A far riskier and jagged terrain than his blockbuster jab we met , Rockstar certainly celebrates Ali's doorway to sensible cinema."

","First of all,i found it rather funny, to Janardhan acquiring a name Jordan! How does it matter ? He remains the same ,uninhibited young guy, changing his hairdo's and dresses, according to the moods and the phases in his life. i, especially , disapproved of that huge mess of beard, and that funny topi, as if he is one sophisticated gazal singer.<br/><br/>Jordan's idol is Jim Morrison,but in this Hindi version of rock, i didn't feel any of the passion, or the lust, which is so synonymous with Morrison. Though Rehman has put in a good effort,one simply can not identify with this kind of a mix, as rock. Rock is rock, and Elvis or Michael were the embodiment of rock, standing the test of time. Rehman's music is like a bouquet of different attractive flowers, but it fails to make one integrated impact. Can any one remember the tunes or the words of the music score,except a very few ?<br/><br/>Is this also an unhappy ending love story ? Well, most of the part, both Jordan and Heer are totally confused as to the nature of their relationship, and the viewer does not get the feel of that craving.<br/><br/>i would say, frustration is the theme of this movie, where most of the characters are damn frustrated,over one thing or the other, be it Jai, or Jordan's mentor,or his audience,or even the press !<br/><br/>The script takes the support of Heer's progressive illness, retreating miraculously in between, and finally Heer succumbing to it, just to give that touch of the movie Love Story,from Hollywood, not Bollywood !<br/><br/>Basically, because of handling the love part on different levels, it has lost it's grip, and ends up without making any deep impact,or a truly tragic end ..<br/><br/>Though pleasing to the eyes due to different beautiful locations, this movie predictably falls short of all the expectations, and sadly, easily forgotten.<br/><br/>Ranbir has tried his level best, Nargis is no Julia Roberts, just another fresh face, with a mouth, wider than usual, and Shammi is sensitive in his cameo. <br/><br/>Lack of focus, and ambiguity of the plot line,has given a big blow to this movie. And with due respect to Rehmanji, i would still maintain, that he is an intelligent mixer,or should i say,remixer, for whom, the lyrics are absolutely secondary, or even they are meaningless mostly,to suit the tunes; That's why i would always bow my head to the lyricists and the musicians of yester years only !<br/><br/>See it once for curiosity, but don't get frustrated,if your expectations aren't fulfilled !"

"saish746","8","0","0","11 March 2012"," Rockstar Ali
","Imtiaz Ali knows how to start a movie and holds the audience till the end with all the conviction. His research on some iconic figure like Johnny Cash and Jim Morrison was complete which he loosely spun around his college days from Delhi. The Director from Patna had all the right flavors of a college and canteen. Rockstar is more of a story about the fall from the Rise that never was. The movie is well portrayed like the tastes of Devdas or DevD pitched around with guitar instead of alcohol. The subtleness of drug and alcohol is remarkable with Ali's direction. Ali, known for usual Bollywood romantics has come out of his age and getting perfection. although he missed on some minor glitch but the package is delivered.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a flashback and goes to Delhi university where you find a devoted music lesser known artiste, so naive and gullible that he actually goes out to find a heartache and comes back to canteen to eat a plate of samosa. Janardhan aka Jordon aka JJ played by Ranbir kapoor is a jat but has mannerism of a Bihari, must be inspired by Ali's college days. The movie soon goes out to Kashmir and Himachal with superb camera of Anil mehta. The lighting and original locations were shot perfectly. However there was no closeup shot of the protagonist to capture his emotions. The director (may be smart enough) to ignore this and focus on the frame rather than close-ups. The movie rolls down to trips to strip clubs and red light district. Like always Ali's heroines are over chirpy and ready break the stereotype roles. Pakistani American Nargis Fakri is very fresh and delight to eyes. She has got expressions which Katrina misses, and can go beyond her status. Nargis is very easy to the character both as exquisite and fragile. She was also easy with the philosophy of Ali and did full justice to the character. I must not be surprised if I see her one day as leading lady of Bollywood. Her ducky lips so unique that you may not notice the bad dubbing for her mouth delivery. Ali de-focused all other characters, esp Piyush Mishra. Kumud Mishra did suit the role but the movie was more about Ranbir and his muse Fakhri. Shammi Kapoor looked very justifiable as a portray of Ustaad Bismillah khan and his eyes were so good. Indeed a great tribute to the legendary actor. A movie about a Rockstar is incomplete without the superb music department. AR Rahman stood tall on the giants of Mohit Chauhan,Irshad Kamil. The music was blended with the movie so tight that it flow together. ""Sadda Haq"" is an example of true rock and so is the ""Hawa Hawa"" of lost Czech legend with superb mix of impulsive lyrics. Irshad provided the soul to the Rockstar, while Rahman did the rest. It's one of the best from Rahman in recent times. Mohit is good with different moods and he definitely rose to new genre.<br/><br/>The movie has some not so good explanation about why Indian media will hunt a lesser known artiste and I have not seen any Rockstar with so much fan following in India and abroad who sings in Hindi. The chemistry between Ranbin and Fakhri was just shown sparking with a sleazy movie invite. The theft of Rs 5 lakhs was never satisfactory to throw out Ranbir from the ancestral home.<br/><br/>The opening lines of movie was right on the spot to set the expectation."

","No Ranbir snorting cocaine, no blurred-skin-make-love scenes with Fakhri, no breaking guitar on the stage and no family regretting the decision to throw-out their maverick kid. Yeah it was disappointing because Imtiaz Ali repeated scenes one after another and like our innate expectations there were no happy endings. Lastly, why on earth should the movie be called Rockstar, when it definitely looks like a love story more than an evolution of a legendary musician?<br/><br/>Rockstar isn't an ordinary fare by any measure barring the rather explicably missed transition of a Delhi boy from being a complete asshole to being Jim Morrison. It's a biographical of sacrifice, love & loss from the eyes of a musician, a real eccentric one. Yes, it's not a happy story, it makes you hate the guy, then love him, then hate him some more. By the end of it, you realize that your own emotions towards him are as frivolous as his mood swings. What makes Rockstar a real winner for me is undoubtedly the blend of the story with Rahman's genius musical stroke.<br/><br/>""He set out to conquer the world without knowing a dime about it and in return he lost everything he had. Now he pleads himself to return home – Oh Naadaan Parinday Ghar Aa Jaa!""<br/><br/>Rockstar has been shot like a dream with those hair-raising scenes bathing in sepia, slow- mo shots, the mystique love of Prague and the subtle yet perfect use of documentary-ish footage.<br/><br/>In North India, we have a popular term called ""Ainvayee"" which quintessentially means out- of-context. Believe me, there are no ""Ainvayee"" moments in those two hours and more than thirty minutes. This is what makes us Bollywood aficionados keep the faith.<br/><br/>In good taste, the Kapoor scion is a wand of acting genius. Never in the movie has he made himself look awfully bigger than the situation or his co-stars. His pain, his trauma, his fighting his inner demons is as real as it gets. To quote Neetu Kapoor & myself, Ranbir Kapoor is to Raj Kapoor what Sachin Tendulkar is to Don Bradman.<br/><br/>""I have all there is to ask for but my heart is filled with anxiety and a burning sensation"". Not to forget, Nargis Fakhri who is a million times more gorgeous and a better actor than Siddharth Mallya's Girlfriend. She is totally smoking. By the way, whoever thought of casting Shammiji & Piyush Mishra, needs a Patiala pat too.<br/><br/>At last, a humble mention for Imtiaz Ali. You have created what a bastard child of Yash Chopra and Anurag Kashyap would have made. Here's a double toast to you and the writers who made sure that there are no dialogues for the obvious.<br/><br/>""Poetry & music only come out of broken hearts.

","Rockstar is perhaps the most misunderstood movie I know of, in Bollywood. Ranbir Kapoor's acting is among the finest ever seen. The movie is artistically edited to be chronologically not in-order. Flashbacks are inserted where it is meaningful. It does get a little confusing in the second half, but this is where you are supposed to sink in a decade long love story. The movie gets very dark in its story, but has been executed very carefully. Perhaps, this section can be improved, but the movie must be taken for what it is. It is engaging throughout and can be watched multiple times.<br/><br/>The storytelling centers around Janardan's tragic journey to become Jordan. Ranbir is believable and honest in his role as a young, small-town and foolhardy college student from Delhi University as well as the agonized rockstar a decade later. He adopted the persona and dialect of his character with great flair. His slow transition from Janardan to Jordan and his absolute love for Heer, is an act that deserves many accolades.<br/><br/>The music of the film is genius work. I would label the album as ""originally Indian rock compositions"" that fit very well into the situations and the story. The lyrics are amazing and each of the songs have a purpose.<br/><br/>I don't care if the movie can be improved or not. I enjoyed it while I watched it, and I enjoyed it even more afterward. The movie stays with you and grows on you; there is more than one interpretation possible. I have watched such movies in Hollywood which inspire discussions - like Inception, Butterfly Effect, Memento, The Matrix, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Minority Report and others - but none of these are predominantly a love story. Besides, very few in Indian cinema have created the same effect in its audience."

His main source of advice is a small shop/canteen? owner. His words of wisdom are that every good artist has some type of pain inside; a broken heart. So from there Jordan sets out to get his heart broken. The series of events start out comically but in reality the unraveling of his life is set into motion.<br/><br/>The main moral of the story is to be careful what you wish for.<br/><br/>Performance wise Ranbir Kapoor is awesome. He has no problem playing a dorky guy in the beginning and then a rebel in the second half. He is fast becoming the next big superstar of Bollywood. Nargis Fakhri is the latest non-Indian actress Bollywood has to offer. She looks good in the movie but acting wise is OK. She seems slightly better than the other import (Katrina Kaif) because she is at least able to display more than two emotions. I am pretty sure Imtiaz Ali would have preferred Kareena in this role but was unable to do so since her and Ranbir are cousins.<br/><br/>A movie called Rockstar has to have good music, and AR Rahman delivers with the best soundtrack of the year.<br/><br/>Overall the movie has a decent story and excellent acting from Ranbir Kapoor but is a bit too long and at times starts to drag."
"shubhamjain1012","Null","0","0","29 December 2011"," A movie that hits you hard
","An intense movie, that can be churned out only from the mill of bollywood. Imtiaz Ali breaks his own barrier to paint this masterpiece. While his earlier films Jab We Met & Love Aaj Kal showed that he holds tight grip on Romance as a genre, he goes a level up by adding the dark side to it in this movie. The result, a movie, with all its imperfection, that takes you to the journey of making of a ROCKSTAR.<br/><br/>Take a bow for Ranbeer kapoor, a.k.a Jordan, the main protagonist of the movie, as he brings the character to life, and not for a minute you would feel that he is a reel character. The sheer authenticity that he lends to the character, will make you believe that he has come into his own as an actor.<br/><br/>A.R Rahman, like a master craftsman, provide a music that will sweep you of your feet. The music is the soul of the movie, and is intermittently knitted into it. It sets the mood and the tone, for the scenes to come.<br/><br/>The weak point of the movie is the acting of Nargis. Though she is serene, she is unable to match the intensity of the movie and her lover Jordan. Had this part been done by a stronger actor, the movie would have been a dynamite.<br/><br/>You would feel that movie could have been improved with slight twist in treatments given to certain scenes but taking nothing away from the director, I will laud him for his audacity and effort to bring such a dark romance."

","If you were drawn to the theatre by the catchy posters and the perfectly hummable music or even the ""new look"" Ranbir, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The cast seems designed to cast/propel Ranbir into limelight. Shammi Kapoor with a cameo would be happy to see another Kapoor join the league of great actors that we know the Kapoor-stable has produced Ranbir is brilliant in all roles he has depicted – the Jatt college-goer, the troubled artist and the pained lover Nargis sure has a long way to go before she establishes herself; her dialogues appear fake – sometimes with no emotion and at other times, over-dramatic. I was left wondering why Aditi Rao and Nargis didn't swap roles<br/><br/>The cinematography leaves little scope of improvement. Shots of the lake in Kashmir to the customary European buildings and orange rooftops, from frozen jungles to the European meadows, the movie has it all captured in its best form.<br/><br/>The screenplay and direction is non-linear. Very few directors have successfully captured non-linear movies. Imtiaz Ali does it brilliantly. The movie shifts from one flashback to another to present without warning. Probably maintaining consistency of Ranbir's look was the motive. The motive was well served – despite rapid shifts in time-lines, the movie appears seamless.<br/><br/>The story is not that great but then I suppose it was not meant to be. No pretences here – its just a troubled rock-star's love story<br/><br/>And why haven't I talked of the music – well, there is little I can say about it You have to listen to it to know more. It will suffice if I said, ITS MAGICAL!! Rahman came into the industry with the magical Bombay – this definitely takes that bar far beyond any other in recent years. Oscar or no Oscar, the music is definitely you will take back with you. I'd be shocked if you leave the hall not humming one of the many tunes from the movie Mohit Chauhan has done it again Kun Fayakun, Naadan Parindey are absolute gems. Saada Haq is as rebellious as can be – sorta imbibes the image of 'rock' And when its Rahman, you gotta expect a mixture – there's sufi, folk and even a Czech gypsy tune (Hawaa Hawaa)<br/><br/>Overall, the movie could've been shortened by half an hour or so and still would have achieved the same level of appreciation. If anything, the stretched second half could have been done away with. But a definite must watch"

I was completely immersed in the depth of the story, It was something really really special to me. Strongly recommend this film, Ranbir Kapoor's acting was phenomenal, He has a great future, ever since I saw ""sid"" and his performance I started Liking his acting. His acting is so genuine and natural. Mostly It doesn't feel like its a movie, but real life. I am sure many people do relate them-self to these movies, and hats off to Ranbir Kapoor since he selects such good stories. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie Starting till end. A.R is the backbone, I love his music."

","Imtiaz Ali's movie on all accounts. It draws many similarities from his previous movies like Jab we met and love Aaj Kal. The problem of many Hindi filmmakers is they don't know how to end a movie. First half of the movie is very good and fun to watch but in second half it's only the songs which holds the attention. The music of movie is tempting me to watch it again but equally opposite is the effect of few scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>Instead of his previous associate Preetam, this time he has gone with A R Rahman. And this is the decision which has made this movie a real Rockstar movie. A R Rahman the hero behind the scene who has proved once again why he is one of the best music director out there. He has created the magic once again.<br/><br/>Performance wise Imtiaz Ali is able to extract good performance from every actor. Ranbeer Kapoor has got into the role very well and has shown that he is the best fit for that kind of roll. The on screen chemistry between Nargis Fakiri and Ranbeer Kapoor is great. Nargis acted well in romantic scenes but could't handled emotional scenes."
"jawsnnn","9","0","0","6 December 2011"," A love story that does not make you cringe
","The different thing about Rockstar and with all Imtiaz Ali movies is that it almost purposefully subverts all the accepted rules of movie-making and still comes up as a story that never shocks you, only lulls you into accepting what is happening on the screen as something that just is.<br/><br/>It starts with the simple fact the there is a marriage in the story and the people being married are not the lovers. This situation has been done to death in umpteen films where the ceremony is interrupted at the last moment by the lover, who is then handed over the bride by the sacrificing groom. In this film, we don't even get to see the marriage. It happens off-screen somewhere in the middle of the several flash backs and flash forwards, where you do not care. When the leads meet after some years, and the love story begins in earnest, you stop caring for right and wrong and start wondering how this will all end. There are several such minute shocks in the movie. From the detailed character roles, to the length of Ranbir Kapoor's hair which serves as a faithful barometer of his connection to the physical world. From the lilting musical score, to the tastefully shot locales - this is an Indian love story told in the language of the world.<br/><br/>I must also add a note on the actors. Virtually everyone in the movie is overshadowed by the towering performance of Ranbir Kapoor who loses himself in this one. He gets almost everything right - his mannerisms, wardrobe all suggest a man who has stopped caring what the world thinks, and his dialog delivery is still steeped in innocence of a small town boy who speaks his English with a tone. Nargis Fakhri starts out very rough, stumbles then redeems herself in the closing shots. Others glint and shine throughout the movie, but this one belongs to Ranbir Kapoor.<br/><br/>I gave it a nine, as this is not a perfect movie. But as far as romantic movies in contemporary cinema go - this is by far the best one in recent years."

","I was waiting this because of A R Rahman but i found movie a classic love story. Imtiaz Ali again craft an excellent Love Story however again his hero and heroin love arouse after the marriage of heroin as in Love Aaj Kal. Beside this another thing is again heroin is too bold for the south Asian culture. But the story, direction, acting and above all music make it worth to watch again and again. Jangli Jawani (wild youth). Ranbir is maturing day by day and Nargis did marvelous job considering her first movie. The passion showed is great. Overall a good romantic musical flick. The treatment, tempo of the film is nice and you will not find dull moment. Shammi Kapoor's presence is added point."

","Sadda Haq, Itthe raq..!! Crowd cheer in excitement, a Rockstar stops singing and starts talking.. He says he is searching for Parindey (Birds) which flew away when the forests cut-down into the urban buildings around. He asks the crowd ""Do you know where are those Parindey..??"" And not only the crowd on screen, but also the crowd in Cinema Hall responses ""NOOOOOOOO"". And he continues with Sadda Haq..!!<br/><br/>Yet Another successful attempt from Imtiaz Ali and its wonderful. In spite of having some boring and dull moments, movie doesn't disappoint you for sure. Movie is having 3 leads, Ranbir Kapoor, Mohith Chouhan and.R. Rahman..!!<br/><br/>Janardhan Jakhar (Ranbir Kapoor), a talented musician. Having taken Khatara bhai's sermons on art and pain a bit too seriously; lost, confused, mildly stupid, vaguely asexual Janardhan (JJ, in short, Jordan later) goes around looking to get frustrated! Tries to get failed in love, a gorgeous girl Heer Kaur (Nargis Fakhri) dancing at her college auditorium, dil todne ki machine of college, he fails in even that. Then he get to know that girl, Oddly, they do make for great friends. As Heer desires to fulfill all kinds of crazy needs to be fulfilled before her marriage, Janardhan and Heer start finishing the list of desires, like a Light porno 'Janglee Jawani' in Delhi Chandni Chowk's street theater, Desi Daaru and all. Then Heer gets married, moves on. Janardhan gets thrown out of his house by his brothers for using family business money to enjoy time with Heer. The boy finds enough frustration in his life to produce his expressive music is spotted by a shehnai ustad (Shammi Kapoor, as Bismillah Khan).anardhan is by now the incredibly famous as Jordan who is negative personality for public. Will he forget his love?will he move on with his celebrity life? <br/><br/>Movie is totally soulful, it expresses you the pain of an artist as well as a lover, the touchy moments succeeds to bring emotions. Love failure follows a tribute to the Devdas. Movie is more like a tribute to old bollywood love failure movies than story on another Jim Morrison.<br/><br/>Movie is filled with excellent performances, Ranbir Kapoor in one of his best roles, he is a perfect Rockstar, perfect lover, perfect Idiotic 'Gawaar', Perfect love failure, perfect arrogant negative personality. and we are seeing him as one upcoming legend of Bollywood for sure. Shammi Kapoor in his last role which is a decent cameo. Nargis Fakhri was giving over-dramatic expressions but succeeds to bring a good chemistry between Ranibir and Herself. Kumud Mishra as Jordan's adviser turned manager is impressive. Everyone else in the movie gives a very good performances, maybe the credit goes to Imtiaz ali.<br/><br/>There are lot of Hilarious Dialogues and also some easily predictable conversations which are obviously dull. Some moments of the movie falls dull and some parts in second half you find boring. The twists and turns in second half gets confused in some parts and loses its plot, but still it manages its pace. Some of scenes are shot multiple times in different character's view, which confuses sometimes.<br/><br/>But overall the movie goes in fast pace and without a doubt, first half is more promising than second. Anil Mehta's cinematography is brilliant as he captures the beauty of Kashmir, Italy and Delhi. The beautiful locals makes you wait to blink. A.R.Rahman's music makes this musical more strong and enhances the experience. Perfectly suited voice of Mohith Chouhan makes you the real feel of Rockstar performed by Ranbir. Die hard romantic fans will love this one like there is no other movie. Its a treat for Ranbir fans as well as non-fans..!! Watch this one for him and A.R.Rahman, these two are real Rock-stars..!!"

","Rockstar is an entertaining musical love-drama and could have been a cult movie for years to come with some crisp editing in the last 40 minutes..<br/><br/>The beauty lies in the direction as director' manages to show love blooming in scenic north India. the songs are paced/shot in a manner than is endearing and most important story moves ahead with songs which clearly is a winner....( u don't get bored of any song at all)..<br/><br/>Rah man music is magical and while Sada HQ, Jo Bi main and Katya are chart busters, the real gem fr me was Au ho (reminiscence of Dill Se another rah man movie of 98..)..Irshad ' lyrics gives life to the songs and Mohit chauhan ' voice from the heart is a treat. Under rah man garb, irshad ' words and mo hit' voice, only thing left for imtiaz was the soul and ranbir enlivens rock-star in style...<br/><br/>Nargis does a good job in the 1st half but while audience could relate to her joys, her mischief, her love in the 1st half some cant empathize with her pain in the 2nd half which is where the last 40 min disconnects a bit. (which is why its closer to 8 and not a 9 the rating) <br/><br/>what made rock on an epic was the pace which was consistent and the end which was fulfilling..nevertheless this movie is for all music and ranbir fans..an Indian treat to be enjoyed .."
"achyutaghosh","8","0","0","23 November 2011"," Everything rocked in Rockstar!
","It is difficult not to like Rockstar. The movie itself transcends many genres- biography, romance, and musical, and yet retains Imtiaz's trademark connect with modern day youth. It begins when a simpleton is told to find pain to succeed in music, who takes it as a joke at first, and in it search, finds his muse. The intensity of the relationship between the main protagonists and their portrayal by Ranbir and Nargis knocks the stuffing out of other purported Bollywood romances. Their chemistry is sizzling, and both do a stupendous job in making their changing relationship- platonic at first and then intimate, believable.<br/><br/>The good in the movie is essentially the people behind it. In Nargis, we have an actress who in her very first outing has displayed that god gifted ability to mix sincerity with spice, and us ooglers have an equally ravishing alternative to Katrina. And what a Rockstar we have- Ranbir in probably his toughest assignment yet, plays the titular role with élan- people up North will vouch for the originality of his Jat accent, and he actually gets better as his role becomes multidimensional in the second half- that of a person unconditionally in love with someone unattainable, and a musician trying to find his place in the sun. And then there is this delightful cameo by the first rockstar of Bollywood. AR Rahman's score is worth a million hearings itself- and it would not have been so unless Mohit Chauhan was not singing, oh what talent, what talent (remember Silk Route, anyone?)<br/><br/>And then there is Imtiaz who has this rare talent of making ordinary things look extraordinary. The movie itself is a labor of love- like Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Khamoshi, Imtiaz Ali has poured his heart out to make a love story that satiates himself i believe, if not necessarily the audience. I don't know why i like Imtiaz- is it the Jamshedpur connect, or is it because he makes simply beautiful films, which makes you want to be a part of them? In Rockstar we have gorgeous locations- from Hauz Khaas, to Prague, to Kashmir, the scenes stay will stay in your mind for ever. <br/><br/>And yet, it is not without flaws. Unlike Jab We Met, I would not look forward to a second viewing, partly because of the movie's inconsistent pace, a 10-15 min shorter version would have made it a lot tighter, and I definitely wanted more of the tub thumping soundtrack because all the songs do not feature in the movie. However, as a musical, and as a love story, Rockstar remains a stellar effort."
"dsa_ca","6","0","0","23 November 2011"," Searching for India's first so called Rockstar
","India does have an underground rock culture, but it has not been able to generate a mass appeal that rock music enjoys in the west and rightly so. India is the land having its own traditional music culture and if there is any place for another music culture in the commercial music industry, it has been hijacked by the pretend to be anything industry Bollywood. It churns out music that appeals to vast majority of people but does not create music stars as they are not photogenic for an image obsessed industry. Hence even a musician's music and voice has been legitimately hijacked by publicity whores of Bollywood. <br/><br/>Speaking of image, rock music artists somehow have etched an image of him standing with an electric guitar on stage with rest of the world swooning or jumping over whatever tunes the musician spews out or in case of Bollywood's latest offering 'Rockstar'; India's latest teen heartthrob standing with a guitar in his hands pretending to play it and spew out some catchy music sung by none other than A R Rehman. Nothing wrong with it and largely effective even without providing concession to Bollywood over details of the art form they are pretending to show exists in India. <br/><br/>Rockstar is directed by India's commercial film-maker Imtiaz Ali, who won the license to make whatever he wants jackpot when his rom-com movie 'Jab we met' became a blockbuster and middle class India's favorite go- to movie. Thankfully, he has not miss-used his freedom like Sanjay Leela Bhansali and has been able to keep a semblance of depth in his work. The movie about a rockstar (stage name Jordan) rising from the abyss of India's lower middle class is a delight to watch mainly because the characters have been rooted in reality. His inspiration to be a rock star and his rise as a musician has moments of truth and go a long way in diminishing the gap between reality and fiction.<br/><br/>But one very important of the movie fails to lift itself above fiction. Nargis Fakhri's Heer as Jordan's love and reason for many angst ridden songs efficiently fulfills her goal to turn her character from fiction to farce. As the movie focuses its complete attention on the romance between Jordan and Heer, it desperately tries to cling on its hope on Ranbir Kapoor's performance and Rehman's yet another perfect score. But Nargis never really is able to act her way through a very important character in the film and evaporates all hopes of making this a memorable film of 2011. <br/><br/>More blame has to be taken by Imtiaz Ali for his casting fetish for fare skinned foreign born models who are never ambitious to become an able actor. They use this golden opportunity to further their goals to maximize profits for being fair skinned in an increasingly insecure middle class India. But if Imtiaz had any short term goals for the film, I guess they have been achieved with the satisfying box office run. As far as India's Rockstar is concerned he also is lost after a little while into the second half of this movie. Rehman though composed some impressive array of tunes does not really gets a grip of the rock culture in India as it won't have a mass appeal. But rock music becomes just an excuse to confirm the super star status of Ranbir Kapoor. <br/><br/>Whereas the movie is concerned, it is not at all the farce that was achieved in 2008 with 'Rock on!!' and is far more polished than that misguided middle class dream wagon. 'Rockstar' has its moments in the first half and has its disappointments in the sad final reel.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/"

One of those things what make this movie watchable was the awesome music of this film which was associated with every mood of the movie and the biggest boost of this movie was music only. Ranbir kapoor was good in this movie and when I say good it means only good and I guess this movie required more intense and experience actor to make this movie awesome.

Is glorifying a self destructive behavior is lying close to your heart? Is inflicting a very unpleasant moralities into the family audience (so called) is staying close to your heart?

","Nice movie. First half is amazing.. Second half is a bit of a drag but the movie has a lot to offer, must watch !! This movie has received a very different treatment. The direction especially in the first half is very different from an average Bollywood movie. Imtiaz Ali is a seasoned campaigner and seems that he has used all his experience here. The first half movies very quickly and leaves the audience asking for more. This is not an everyday movie, the story keeps in shuffling in the time lines. People looking for a weekend retreat to take their mind away from their busy schedule might regret watching this movie.<br/><br/>The romance between Ranbir and Nargis is captured beautifully and the excitement of Nargis' forthcoming marriage in the movie adds more spice to an already sizzling couple.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor has come off age in this movie. Definitely a very professional and mature performance. Nargis Fakhri's performance is average at best. Considering the fact that this is her first movie, she has done a fair job. Besides that, she looks hot.<br/><br/>Little bit of editing in the second half would have done the movie no harm. Reduce the length by 20 minutes and take away the pregnancy issue and you have a winner.<br/><br/>I guess having outstanding music for a movie called Rockstar is a must and who better than Mr Rehman himself. The music lives up to the expectations and is beautifully blended in the movie."

","OK I watched Rockstar on the 1st day and couldn't wait to write a review. There is absolutely no doubt that what hits you first about this movie is its music. Taken care of by the maestro himself A.R Rahman is at his best in a genre that he hasn't worked much on. The soul pumping, heart touching sufi rock soundtrack alone makes this movie worth a watch!<br/><br/>But it only gets better from there. Ranbir Kapoor shows great maturity that will remind you of the way he carried himself in Rajneeti. His acting is near perfect and could easily put any of the Khans to shame. However a part of the credit should go to Imtiaz Ali since he has taken great thought and care to define the character of the male protagonist. The character continuously transforms throughout the movie and Ranbir plays it with so much ease that you will hardly notice it. Nargis as an actor looks like an amateur straight out of high school but considering the fact that its her debut you can probably spare her.<br/><br/>Now coming to the plot you will have to say that its not really the best of plots but then again the movie tries to capture a lot more than just a simple story. What it tries to show you is a journey that a simple, crude Janardhan takes towards transforming himself into a Jordan with his give-no-sh*t attitude. So even though the movie times in at 3hours and which definitely feels stretched you do feel that the movie could have had a little more to offer. That is probably the only blemish on an otherwise spectacular artistic movie. Definitely worth a watch!!"

What a shame, the legend Shami Kapoor ended his career with a horrible movie. I give it 3 because Hindi Movie rating on IMDb seem to be jacked up and hence to level it off I gave it a 1, else would have given it a 3!

To me, it seemed very cliched and I had a hard time caring about the leading man and his 'plight'.<br/><br/>Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor) is a nice guy who wants to make it big with his music. Unfortunately, he seems to be getting no where...until a friend advises him that to be a great artist you need to suffer and experience life..and he's always had it too easy. At this point, Jordan acts very creepy. He sees a lovely dancer, Heer (Nargis Fakhri) and begins stalking her unmercifully. So what does she do? Yep, she decides that he'll be a fun guy to hang around with...at least until her upcoming wedding. So the pair go slumming and have a few laughs. Weird...huh?<br/><br/>Some time passes. Heer has married and Jordan has suffered enough that he's gotten noticed and is finally an up and coming rock star. But, as you'd expect, Jordan is smitten with Heer and cannot enjoy his new-found fame. So, he makes sure to go to Prague on tour....because SHE is there. The pair once again pick up where they left off, but Heer seems very ambivalent. At times, she seems to want Jordan and other times she pushes him away. Ultimately, he seeks her out at her home and is arrested for trespassing.<br/><br/>
The trespassing charge is all over the media...and Jordan's popularity multiplies as he's now seen as a 'bad boy'. His off stage antics all contribute to this image and he's pretty much a prima donna...difficult and unpredictable. Again, this improves his image and he is now amazingly rich and famous. But he still doesn't have Heer....and he's miserable.<br/><br/>Time passes. Heer apparently is dying and Jordan drops everything to be with her. At first, she rebounds and appears to be getting better. But can his love alone cure her illness or bring him what he really wants? Take a wild guess.<br/><br/>My biggest problems with the film were that it all seemed so very phony and contrived...he tries to become angst-ridden and eventually does. Additionally, Jordan became so obnoxious during this journey that I also found myself no longer caring about him, his music nor his lady. The film seemed to be angst just for the sake of angst....and I just think that there are many better Indian films out there. Sure, cliches are the norm in Indian romantic movies...but likability...that's what this film lacks....at least for me."
"lethalweapon","4","2","5","6 October 2012"," Not worth the hype. An average movie with a jagged plot line
","Disappointed. Not that it is a bad movie, but it definitely doesn't justify the hype and praises it had gathered. It's the story of Jordan, a socially awkward wanna-be musician who cribs about not getting the right opportunity or the harrowing/ painful circumstances of life that would bring out the true artist in him. On the way, he meets high class socialite, Heer, who is engaged to be married and taken away to Prague.<br/><br/>The story then focuses on the atypical love story that takes the characters out of the typical Bollywood comfort zone.<br/><br/>The movie is poorly constructed. The severely jagged plot line tries to go back and forth in time without rhyme or reason, and further fails to develop the characters properly. Jordan's ascent into rockstardom is skimmed through... No, it's ignored almost completely. It would have been disappointing if this ascent just happened off-screen, but it's actually worse - The character change within Jordan - (from a meek dreamer to apparently selfish and indifferent) - seems to predate his stardom, and with that attitude, success in the music business is NOT something to skim over. The rise needs an explanation.<br/><br/>Especially when you consider that his passion for music is not really highlighted in the movie, you can't just gloss over his growth as 'And then suddenly, he becomes a star'. It doesn't flow well.<br/><br/>The music score of the movie has also been applauded far and wide. Personally, other than maybe a couple of songs, I didn't feel there was anything special about that either. I am tempted to say don't watch the film, but apparently, a whole lot of people liked the movie, so you may too... Maybe it's just not a movie for me."

","This is probably my first Hindi movie review. I don't claim to be an expert in Hindi movies as I only watch 4 or 5 a year. I prefer watching a movie after reading it's reviews. I am not a fan of masala movies. I like Hindi movies that are different. I enjoyed movies like 3 idiots, Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, etc, because they're not the usual Hindi movie story. Rockstar is not the typical movie story, and hence I was excited to watch it. But about the half way mark it fell apart. Started off as a comedy/drama/friendship story, with a hint of love story, but then it spiraled into something totally different. It's like 2 halves of the movie were made by 2 different people. The last 30 minutes of the movie seemed a little pointless. I won't add any spoilers here but the roller coaster ride of the second half of this movie made me want to just turn it off. But I thought there would be some point to it in the end - there was none. So I'm not critical because this is not the usual Hindi movie because I knew full well it would not be - but perhaps I expected more from the acting, story, a better pace, etc. On the positive side the camera work and music is excellent. The rest was very disappointing."

He don't even know how to act, now coming to this movie, its total rubish, movie starts with this guy janardan who later becomes rockstar. HE wants to suffer in pain so that he can become a rockstar? as no artist can become artist without tasting pain in his life? I haven't heard anything about this stuff? all artist suffer from embarrassment, pain to get going in life? I dnt understand what the writer of this movie has written. STupid plot. Now he goes to taste pain and embarrassment by proposing a girl in public. She thinks he is a stupid, he takes her for ride to KASHMIR.

"shiraz_a","5","1","3","21 November 2011"," Music overshadows bad writing.
","What this movie is missing is proper characterization. We see the outward reaction of characters, but do not know what they really think and feel. Flaws are in writing. Material/content is just not there to handle the story properly. Music was an essential part of protagonist's life, but apart from songs (that come and go) nothing has been shown related to musical journey. <br/><br/>There is another idiot on the horizon, and his name is Janardan aka Jordan. I say 'another' because not so long ago there was Shahrukh in Ra-One playing a character so dumb that it was shocking to accept him as a Software Engineer. What is wrong with these stories? Why one feels the need to put all logic and common sense aside? On discovering that pain is essential in creating a great artist Janardan shamelessly (read idiotically) tries to get rejected from a girl he doesn't even know. Only a top-class moron would think in those terms that somehow magically he would feel depressed after being rejected by a stranger and hence inspired to create more passionate work. There is always passion in music and if you know music you know pain. Show me a person who doesn't know what pain is and I will show you a liar.<br/><br/>Another baffling point in the story is that Heer's condition miraculously improves whenever she is in Jordan's touch. Her 'mysterious' (don't know whether it was physical or mental) illness begins to fade. Now the ultimate solution to overcome and successfully handle this crisis would be for her to get a divorce and stay with Jordan. But for some unknown reason nobody, and I mean nobody, not even the two passionate lovers, Heer's husband, her sister or parents mention it. The surprising part was that her husband is shown to be a reasonable man and instead of her being dead from a 'mysterious' illness he should have suggested her to be with Jordan. I guess they didn't want to be together, for there seems to be no other logical reason for this blunder. The truth, however, is that this blunder is created by the writers.<br/><br/>This is the only Ranbir Kapoor movie that I have seen and to be honest I am impressed. He seemed to have worked hard on his character and it shows clearly on the screen. Nargis Fakhri wasn't as bad as others are saying. As a new comer she acts a little tense and mechanical at times but still acceptable. She should improve with experience.<br/><br/>The music has to be the stand-out point of the movie. A.R. Rahman has created magic for ears. The movie falls short of high expectations from a director who made 'Jab We Met.' Don't be disappointed once you are inside the theater because it is still watchable. And even if you hate everything about it, there is always Rahman."
"ghoshi-kol","7","1","3","15 November 2011"," Rockstar is hardly rocking. It's just a love story under the disguise of the title Rockstar.
","Rockstar is an A.R Rahman and Anil Mehta(cinematographer)film. Ya, Ranbir the entitled rock star, Jordan is hardly seen as a rock star in the film as for most parts he is seen hankering after his girl friend,Heer(Nargis Fakhri)while the latter either reciprocates or rejects his love.So first of all the film's title doesn't seem apt in this case. As far as the rock star effect is concerned Imtiaz should have taken some inspiration from Rock On! but ALAS! Imtiaz's originality becomes the biggest flaw of the film that had a promising premise. Rockstar begins on a feel good note but after all the friendly moments between JJ and Heer gets over the film derails leaving the audience to bear the high dosage of a boring and disjointed script. Secondly, the running time (160 mins or so)is not new in Bollywood but Rockstar sadly seemed to be deliberately stretched that can leave you sleeping.<br/><br/>But the saving grace of the film is Rahman's soulful compositions about which there is no complaint. But recalling the lyrics of the songs become difficult. Sadda Haq is rocking and well choreographed and so is Hawaa Hawaa while Kun Faya Kun is soulful and Katiyaa Karoon is fun. Anil Mehta manages to hold the audiences intact with breath taking views of Kashmir and Prague. <br/><br/>However music and cinematography cannot conceal the loop holes in the plot as the treatment of the script was too amateurish something unexpected from Ali who gave us brilliant Films like JAB WE MET and LOVE AAJ KAL.Sadly, Imtiaz annoys this time.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor's performance shows a lot of earnestness but emotions hardly connect with the audience.While he is brilliant in most parts but at times his performance drops heavily.<br/><br/>Nargis Fakhri was a disaster.She looks stunning but where is the acting. Dialogues seemed to have been forced through her. Shammi Kapoor was stunning.The rest of the cast was just okay.<br/><br/>Characterization seemed to be a big problem in Rockstar. While developing Ranbir's JJ as a modern Devdas Ali ignored Heer completely and both JJ's and Heer's character lacked the effect that Aditya,Geet,Jai,Meera or even Harleen Kaur had created.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a decent or average watch. It hardly connects. A story trying to be Devdas fails in it's attempt.<br/><br/>ACTING: 6/10<br/><br/>DIRECTION: 4/10<br/><br/>STORY: 4/10<br/><br/>MUSIC: 7.5/10<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: 7.5/10 Overall I rate the film 5.5 out of 10."
"harjotsandhu","7","1","3","14 November 2011"," A great movie...NOT....
","I was very excited and wanted to watch the movie ever since I saw the theatrical trailers while watching ""Bodyguard"". Looking at the trailers it seemed that it would be a story of an anguish ridden Youngster who is wronged by the system and is up against it. So, there were a few surprises when I finally got to watch it.<br/><br/>What seemed like anguish turned out to be confusion. You would expect some rebellion from a movie where the lead character is supposed to be a Rockstar. Unfortunately there was no Che Guavera moment. Storyline is icy thin and highly predictable. Narrative fails to grip the audience & movie leans on some cheesy dialogue for grabbing attention. Its all the more difficult to categorize the movie as there is no defined development of characters or plot. Its neither a full fledged musical journey nor a love story. Romantic angle is treated with overdose of physical intimacy and is on the verge of Satyriasis. The movie, for some, ends abruptly without any clear indications of whatever happened to everyone. Its a bit crude even you expect that 'Happily ever after' wasn't to be.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor(RK) has done some good job and has come of age in the movie as far as characterization goes. Its the failure of the director that the it didn't gel with the narrative. Nargis Fakhri(NF) looks overwhelmingly like Tara Sharma( From Khosla ka Ghosla). Other than how she looks, NF has done great job and looks pretty comfortable on screen. The on screen chemistry between RK & NF looks a bit cold even in intimate scenes but maybe that is what director intended to, to highlight the eccentric nature of the characters.<br/><br/>Only saving grace for the movie is without a doubt is its Music. A.R. Rahman has done a commendable job and you are left with a number tunes stuck in your head. Mohit chauhan has done a great great job as voice of RK. The voice matches so good that my brother asked me if it was RK singing or some playback. The Songs however fail to carry the story because the screenplay and narrative overlap the past, present and future. <br/><br/>Verdict: Watch the movie if you want to; but you won't miss anything if you decided against it."

","Friends i should say i was one of those people who were anxiously waiting for the release of this film. But after watching this film i came out to be disappointed. 1st half movie rocks as much as 2nd half of movie sucks. All the director is wanted to show in this movie is a Journey of a Rockstar and a love story. But, quite clearly he failed at both. But i should say this movie is still good in its bits and pieces and also a ""great camera work has been done"". Talking about performance... Ranbir Kapoor has proved it again, seriously a flawless outstanding performance by him. On the other hand, Nargis Fakhri is bad ...but she is very beautiful throughout the film. Music of A.R. Rehman is breathtaking (still, not better then Rock on ). So, at the end i should say that there are moments in the film where you will feel yourself connected to the movie but then again several continuity flaws and a not so good ending of the movie doesn't works out. It is a one time watchable movie and also the movie made in a non-chronological order(Not quite effectively) but you can still watch it because of superb acting done by Ranbir Kapoor."
"saugatadutta85","4","1","4","3 September 2012"," Sends out an extremely negative message
","Rockstar is a movie about a confused youth who achieves fame a rock singer. And what all he loses in the process to achieve fame. Somewhere in the beginning of the film, the character Janardhan Jakhar is told that one can be a true artist only if he suffers pain. And he goes about looking for an opportunity to create pain for himself (as well as others around him!). In this process, he tries to woo a girl already betrothed to someone else, knowing well that the drama is going to cause him a lot of pain, and give him the motivation to become a singer! The problem with this film is that it represents the wrong track on which the society thinks. And it gives a very wrong message. After watching this flick, quite a few creative individuals may think about dropping their pursuits. This is the 'Sadda Haq' generation, to quote a song from the film. These are the people who feel entitled to everything on Earth, and make a lot of noise during the TV debates. Unfortunately, the film ends up glorifying such behavior. The Rockstar's behavior and motivations are completely out of place. Nothing justifies that show of rage, or anti-social behavior which he exhibits. Apart from the wrong message, the film suffers from a poor and incoherent screenplay as well. One scene jumps to another, without much co-relation between them. Performance wise, Ranbir Kapoor is good as the rebel-without-a-cause Rockstar, but so would be anyone playing the role. It is the debut of the lead actress, Nargis Fakhri, and it is not fair to have sky-high expectations from her! The music is certainly not A.R. Rehman's best, but the excellent lyrics more than make up for it. The director Imtiaz Ali had shown this tendency of randomness in his previous flicks (Love Aaj Kal), but had managed to keep them intact. Here, he completely loses the plot. The high ratings are symbolic of a similarly confused society that has gone 'out-of-focus' itself. I will go with a four out of ten for Rockstar. Ra.One and Bodyguard are much more entertaining!"

","Rock Star â€“ CATCH IT (C+) Rock star is one of the most confusing incomplete movies ever made in India. The story is simple but the presentation and execution is way confusing. The movie shows life and love of rock star singer of a different kind. During all 2 and half hours, it jumps forward 4years then comeback 2 years then again jump forward 4yeas then 2years back then again 4years forward and 2years back. Two things only stand out in the movie, A.R.Rahman's fabulous music and Ranbir Kapoor's superb performance. That's the only reason to sit through 2 and half hours of rock star. Nargis the new girl didn't look Kashmiri or married or even anyone from Indian cultural values. There is no characterization to her character, whether she is married or not she lives the same life. Poor direction, poor ending in hurry and wrong actress casting makes rock star dreary most of the time. Overall, watch it for its music and off course Ranbir Kapoor."
"jmathur_swayamprabha","Null","1","4","15 November 2011"," Heartache makes a star ! Really ?
","Rockstar did not live to my expectations. In all the previous movies of Imtiaz Ali, I found the principal characters of this world only but in this movie, both the hero as well as the heroine appeared to me as belonging to some other planet. How can such a movie develop a rapport with the spectators when it is not being categorized as fantasy ? <br/><br/>The singer (or musician or both) - Janaardan (Ranbir Kapoor) comes to know from his friend Khatana (Kumud Mishra) that if he has to excel like a true artist, his should suffer a heartbreak. To fulfill his dream of making it big in the world of music, he starts striving for that only. A casual acquaintance with a girl, Heer (Nargis Fakhri) turns into a deep friendship and further turns into a love which is first realized by the girl and thereafter only by him, finally leads to a heartbreak when he comes to know that she will soon depart from this world due to a bone-marrow problem. Now he comes to know how painful a heartbreak is.<br/><br/>This story when told on the screen contains several indigestible incidents. The hero seems to be more eccentric less romantic. He is always ready to take the heroine (as well as the world) for granted. I have heard of such type of eccentric mood of late Kishore Kumar but never believed it. And the heroine too is, at least to some extent, casual in her approach towards the hero. The activities of both go overboard at several places in the movie. The hero's family kicks him out (never to bother about him thereafter which is quite unconvincing) but the heroine's family (parental as well as marital) is generous enough to allow her to live and do anything in the company of the hero. Well, she is fortunate (and unfortunate too because she dies after some time). The director has tried to test the brains of the spectators at many places by providing scope for them to interpret the things happening in front of them. However there is no dearth of potholes in the script.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor has done exceedingly well despite his confused and underdeveloped character. And he is one reason to watch this movie. Nargis Fakhri has also tried her level best but she seems to be miscast in the role. Among others, Kumud Mishra as Khatana is a character whose appearance on the screen provides some relief moments to the overburdened (by narration) spectators. Late Shammi Kapoor, in his last screen performance, has left his mark in the role of an esteemed clarinet player.<br/><br/>There is a lot of noise about A.R. Rehman's music in this movie. It's good and according to the mood of the movie but it's by no means great. The song in the climax of the movie - Naadaan Parinde is good but if somebody has listened to the old songs like Itna Na Mujhse Tu Pyar Badha (Chhaaya - 1961) and Ankhiyon Ko Rehne Do Ankhiyon Ke Aaspaas (Bobby - 1973), he / she can see the shadows of these and some other old songs in that. In fact, more than Rehman's music, it's the lyrics of Irshaad Kaamil which are praiseworthy (though Naadaan Parinde contains a good dose of plagiarism in lyric also). <br/><br/>Cinematographer has done a marvellous job. Right from the locales of Delhi to the beauty of Prague and certain other Indian and foreign locations, the complete movie is a treat to watch. It's a eye-soothing experience, no doubt.<br/><br/>Imtiaz Ali has tried to be realistic in portrayal of several scenes in the movie but the basic trouble is that he has chosen an unrealistic story with unreal principal characters. His is a gigantic effort in developing the narration but he could not infuse life into the bulk of it. Hence it's good but does not appeal. And therefore, unlike his earlier ventures, it does not have a repeat value. Nobody may like to watch it again.<br/><br/>In my review of Kaagaz Ke Phool, I had termed that movie as an imperfect one whose imperfection itself led to greatness. Imtiaz Ali has also made an imperfect movie but unlike the former, it's by no means great. But then, who can claim to be perfect in this world. Let's appreciate Imtiaz Ali's excessive creativity which has, unfortunately (for him as well as for us), crossed the limits of sanity."

","OK i know i m going to get lots of not useful votes but still somehow the movie didn't appeal to me as ""soul stirring"" as to various critics. To start with the first half of the movie is fantastic with tight script and humorous dialogues.Ranbir Kapoor shines in the first half where he tries to woo the lead actress. The first half is somewhat a trade mark of Imtiaz Ali where he narrates a love story with the warmth and soul that seems to be missing from the contemporary Indian movies . Don't get me wrong the first half does ""rocks"" and raises the expectation from the second half and that is where the film falters.The second half is soulless journey of Ranbir Kapoor to regain his lost love . The second half does become lame because of overacting by Nargis who just proves to be an eye candy in the film. Any Indian actress would have been better off than her , at least some soul could be instilled in the character.Ranbir tries hard and can be said to have evolved as an actor.No reason could be sighted for casting international actors when they are portrayed as Indian and could not even deliver dialogues in Hindi. There is enough talent in India that could have done the character with some zeal and justice.All in all I would say its not a very bad film but still its not the best from him.I would still go for ""JAB WE MET "" as his best as found it more refreshing and ""soul stirring"" than this one.I am going for 6/10 just for the entertaining and engaging first half and A R Rahman's music."

","It started off alright. People: fans, goons and police chasing after him all over town. Then he comes on stage, Jordan or Janardhan orJJ played by Ranbir as a rockstar. We have a flashback. He gets this idea that love, heartbreak, pain and misery is what he needs to become a Rockstar not only talent. At first it felt like a joke, satirizing the music industry but its not as he pursues a girl from the hot chick list, Heer played by Nargis. Like a typical Bollywood movie he is very persistent but his motives were not typical so at least right? He eventually confesses that he does not like her but not because she is not beautiful so they become friends.
They have this bucket list thing going on. They go to a theater playing a blue film. You know the weird soft-core porn type, ""Jungly something"" I cannot remember the second word in the title and I guess not really worth remembering. She wore a hoody pretending to be a guy. They leave early and the joke they make there is very cringy in a bad way. Heer says that they should have stayed longer. JJ says ""if they found out that you were a girl they would have raped you"". Her reply was then it would have been ""Jungly something 2"". Seriously who wrote this shit. There is nothing wrong in watching porn or glorifying it like a joke about JJ's conservatism or his surprise reaction and that was funny but they went too far with this joke. It was glorifying rape as well. Like seriously. The bachelor party he was looking away like an immature baby. Guys are not like that yet somehow in indian movies the hero is the innocent guy and the heroine has to tell him its okay. <br/><br/>Heer gets married and they still manage to hang around like old buddies. Her husband really let her hang around JJ. Okay he did because he trusted her. She exploited his trust and commits adultery. Way to go movie, back to the old days, married women should not be left alone with another man or it will always end badly is what you are saying not me. It is implied that they made love but atleast the lip-lock scene was a real one not the fake silly stuff like in the older moves. Okay fine he would leave and they shall never talk of this again as she requests him to do the right thing because she was done. He breaks into her house alarms buzzing everywhere. So they arrest him while she faints as she was having some health problems. It is not explained clearly really. All I gather is it has something to do with her bone marrow and low blood count. He returns to India and gets jailed for breaking and entering and assault for an undetermined period. This gave him more publicity. He got his chance and uses his pain to make good music. He is so rude to everyone all the time and does not appreciate the opportunity. Rockstars actually appreciate it in my opinion. He comes into Heer's life again as her condition gets worse because Heer's sister insists that he visit her in the hospital. She dies. It makes his music even better but he wants to quit now. The end. 
Frustrating second half, average first half good chemistry between the leads, good music but bad plot."
"arijit4711","4","0","2","24 December 2011"," Disilussioned direction
","A big let down from Imtiaz Ali. As a director of better movies like Socha na tha, Jab we met and Love aaj kal, I was expecting a very good film from him and even was quite excited on seeing the promos. But at the end Imtiaz made a caricature with neither any plot development and nor character development. Any sane person willn't be able to relate to the pain, agony and the anguish through which the protagonist traverses. Neither the love shown between the duo was worthy nor the passion of music inside Ranbir Kapoor was consistent. What baffled me most was the fact that each time the hero finds her love, he forgets everything about his music. This is pretty bullshit because one who adores music in such a way can never be a rockstar. For a rockstar, his music is his life..And even the eccentricities that are so prevalent in a genius are portrayed so absurdly. Even one doesn't understand about the genesis of his anguishes and to whom they are directed and why the hell he is angry.<br/><br/>Newcomer Nargis Fakri is adorable until she opens her mouth and acts. Her acting is just so cold and frigid. Ranbir excels but alas, the director makes a mess. A.R. Rehman is brilliant but the songs don't make any sense on screen, though when you listen it offscreen you will marvel at Rehman's creativity. Story and Direction sucks, I can't be more modest than this. The director presents an utter wrong impression of a rockstar and their oft followed path of self- destruction..Rather he confuses and amuses us with such a 'bang your head on the wall' type movie.<br/><br/>Many people have loved the film and that's very evident from IMDb ratings too, but any person who goes with a preconception of watching a movie on a rockstar's life, his priorities and eccentricities, his road to self-destruction and actualization etc etc will be severely disappointed. The only silver lining is Ranbir's acting and Rehman's music.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie completely wasted a mindblowing concept and made a total shitty mess. Not at all expected from Imtiaz Ali. My heart pains to criticize Imtiaz but I can't give it more than 4 out of 10."

","Rockstar is a hypothetical depiction of a aspiring singer and performer, that rests on ""pain and suffering"" as the prime element in the movie. It is clearly shown that success does not come without an imbibed pain and that it has to be essentially or through suffering, made a part of an artist or a creative genius.<br/><br/>I am an avid fan of Imtiaz Ali movies as he has always shown the true colors in life with no camouflage of any kind. The dialogs have always been so natural in his earlier movies and you could someway know where the movie is taking you and still be thrilled and excited to know it. His movies had always been a commonplace which everyone could relate themselves to. Though, Rockstar unlike his other creations failed to impress me as anticipated because it rests on pure ideological grounds and camouflaged events. As the name suggests, Rockstar is music driven and commendable for the way A.R. Rehman has explored into a new territory of Sufi, Czech and Rock. For a music lover, the movie will spell bounds of fun but for a serious movie goer and critic, it would look nothing but an exaggerated attempt to show anger and frustration and how it leads to creativity. Ranbir Kapoor as a protagonist has done justice to the role and I believe no other actor could have showed the gravity and expressions that were needed to show the madness and craving desire to be someone great. The role needed a young, angry, outcast and rowdy actor and Ranbir was him. The story follows the ambitions of a boy in a traditional and conventional New Delhi life who wants to be a rockstar. He often gets inspired by music legends and wants to be known like them. Though his attempts to be someone great are always saddened somewhat by the narrow mindedness that is floating around him and otherwise by his own foolishness of being a careless and stupid lad. He learns that true passion and creativity lies in pain and that he had no pain in life. Hence, he tries to find pain around himself and how he could then be someone great. In the process, he comes across a chick who is known to be sophisticated and talked about in his college, tries to be rejected by her so that he can feel pain. Eventually by his own foolishness, he gives up but the girl finds fun. They both start being together as they carry same ideas of mischief. What begins from then, is a story of madness to be with the girl and hence the his songs carry pain which is always wanted. Another element in the story that could make it a little tolerable is its cinematography. Certain songs have been shot with great emphasis to how the songs could relate to the surroundings. Thus, one actually feels for a small period of time to be experiencing the events. Other than that, the movie had no substance. And, I would not recommend it to someone who thinks him/herself to be a serious movie watcher. You can skip this one as you did the last few."
