"harricks","8","406","531","21 August 2007"," An old fashioned modern western
","I saw this film last night at a preview in the lead up to the Toronto International Film Festival. Having never been a big western fan (with a few exceptions - Shane, High Noon, The Wild Bunch) and having been rather indifferent to Walking The Line, James Mangold's last directorial effort, my expectations were modest, despite the hype that the film has received. But I was duly impressed. The action and tension remain constant throughout but, more importantly, the plot is compelling and the acting is terrific. No doubt many will be impressed by Ben Foster's affected performance as Russell Crowe's loyal but psychopathic sidekick (think Johnny Depp in the Pirate movies) but to my taste it was much too over the top in a cast that offered a number of subtle and well thought out performances.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is brilliant as the arrogant, amoral outlaw Ben Wade and Christian Bales infuses his role as a beleaguered rancher and Civil War veteran with just the right mix of pathos and dignity. Iy was wonderful to see Peter Fonda be given a role in which he was allowed to demonstrate his genuine talent, much too long hidden away. In my view, though, it is Logan Lerman who most deserves the accolades that will certainly come his way. He plays Bales' teenage son who comes of age in the course of the film. Initially disillusioned with a father whom he sees as drudge and a failure, he eventually recognizes his father as the hero he is (or at least becomes).<br/><br/>Cinematically, this film ranks up there with the best westerns of all time. It is consistently beautiful to watch and captures the expanse and majesty of the American west as well as any movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>In many respects this is a traditional western (it is a remake, after all). They really don't make movies like this much anymore and it will be interesting to see whether it finds an audience in this era of dumbed down teen comedies and quirky slices of dysfunctional modern life. I wish it well."

","""The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever."" Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer <br/><br/>In 3:10 to Yuma, a few references to The Magnificent Seven and the idea of a train arriving at a specific time when good and bad guys converge, as in High Noon, made viewing this Glenn Ford remake from 1957 a pleasant one. And right I was but for even more good reasons.<br/><br/>Not since Unforgiven and The Quick and the Dead have I been as excited about seeing a Western in its heroic and revisionist forms. 3:10 to Yuma is a true Western in the American film tradition about the 19th-century American West: It has clear heroes and villains (and a mixture of those), wide prairies, dirty towns, fast guns, weak lawmen, cunning murderers, kids on the cusp, and women marginalized, just for starters.<br/><br/>Then ratchet up to the philosophical/post modern/post Eastwood reflections on the profession of being a gunman juxtaposed with being a responsible father, and you have an classic angst-filled clash where villain has a wee bit of heart and hero an equal measure of cowardice. Delightfully mix in a certifiable baddie in the Lee Van Cleef/Jack Palance tradition, Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) as Wade's amoral lieutenant Charlie Prince (as in ""of darkness""). Best of all, it is nail-bitingly suspenseful and beautifully photographed.<br/><br/>In order to pickup some home-saving cash, poor crippled farmer Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is helping transport murderer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to court via the 3:10 to Yuma from Bisbee, Arizona. Getting Wade to the station is no easy task, even for the several deputies, because Wade's evil gang is in hot pursuit and more importantly, Wade is psychologically working on them from within, alternately charming and brutal; just imagine his roguish smile behind an extremely fast gun and unscrupulous conscience.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe a studio could dump such a winner in the dog days of summer. I will say only that if you have even a modicum of respect for this genre, see 3:10 to Yuma and relive the golden days of straight-up shoot-em ups with rough-hewn characters, electric plot, and revisionist attitude about the romance of being an outlaw or a farmer. Get there on time because that movie train goes fast from the get go."

"teresa-elbin","10","318","483","3 September 2007"," Don't Miss This Movie
","It's one of the best westerns and best all-around movies I've seen in a long time. That's largely due to the outstanding performances by the cast, ably led by the alpha male, bad guy, Russell Crowe. His protagonist is Christian Bale who turns in a nuanced performance as the down-on-his luck rancher. The scenes between these two men are riveting and a display of acting at its best. The supporting cast are all wonderful and in particular, Ben Foster, Fonda and Logan Lerman as Bale's oldest son.<br/><br/>The action is virtually non-stop which makes for a compelling, exciting story. But what really drew me in were the stellar performances, particularly that of Crowe. He is the bad guy you actually might end up rooting for. He goes from charming to deadly and back again all in the blink of an eye. He carries the film on his very able shoulders, but Bale gives him a good run for his money in the acting department.<br/><br/>This is one movie that any lover of westerns or anyone simply longing for a good movie with good acting will not want to miss. The two hours will go by in the blink of an eye and you'll be wishing there was more."
"bjxmas","9","110","161","23 September 2007"," Shades of gray. The measure of a man and what price he is willing to pay for justice
","Being a fan of westerns from a young age, I really wanted to like this movie and I did. I just didn't love it because of a few too many plot holes and inconsistencies. If you are willing to suspend belief and enjoy the ride, it is a very satisfying movie filled with action, suspense and terrific acting showcasing the intricacies of complicated men. <br/><br/>As most westerns ultimately are, this was a movie about the measure of a man. When faced with extraordinary circumstances how far will a man go to do the right thing and what price separates good and evil. It is a story of youth with a riveting performance by a young Logan Lerman as a rancher's son who doubts his father's worth and struggles to come to terms with his expectations of what makes a man great and who he will idolize. Being a fan of the TV series Jack and Bobby, it was great seeing Logan again and enjoying his work. He gives a sensitive, nuanced performance and holds his own against some powerhouse acting from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Russell is the perfect actor to play Ben Wade bringing a depth and humanity to a character who is established early on as a dangerous, ruthless outlaw. There are indications from the start that Ben isn't your standard villain, and Russell does a great job at showing the shadings in this character while maintaining the threatening nature of Ben Wade. There is a hint of gentleness and sensitivity and even though you suspect childhood damage might have produced a man capable of such evil, you never doubt the viciousness this character is capable of.<br/><br/>Christian Bale turns in another intricate portrayal as the rancher, Dan Evans. Slowly the layers and truths of Dan are revealed until he is laid bare, with all his regrets and failings threatening to define him. As a man trying to provide for his family and gain the respect of his older son, he gives a captivating performance as an average man struggling to do what is right while faced with overwhelming obstacles. <br/><br/>The interaction between these two fine actors and how their characters end up on the continuum between good and evil is the focus of the movie. 3:10 to Yuma is an interesting merging between the old-fashioned westerns of long ago and the new psychological metaphors of modern movie-making. There are lots of dead bodies littering up the landscape, but the blood and guts movie style of Peckinpah is thankfully missing and we are left with a character study wrapped up in an action, chase flick.<br/><br/>Peter Fonda has a wonderful role as a grizzled old bounty hunter and even though I knew he was in the movie it took me forever to recognize him. I kept thinking the character reminded me of Richard Widmark, but perhaps there was a touch of Henry in there too. Alan Tudyk has a nice turn as a quirky doctor and Ben Foster is mesmerizing as the big bad sidekick of Ben Wade. Many will think Ben goes overboard on the characterization, but it was difficult to not watch him as the crazy, vicious killer, Charlie Prince. I think he held back just enough to make the character believable, in an intensely crazed, vicious old-west world.<br/><br/>Ultimately the bad guys were more believable to me than the good guys. There were several instances where I wanted to yell at the screen and tell the good guys they were doomed because of their inept actions, but perhaps they just haven't seen as many westerns as I have and didn't realize these bad guys were truly vicious animals and no mercy would be offered. <br/><br/>Towards the end is when the stretches of believability most disturbed me and the movie lost some of its sheen. I just didn't buy all the contrivances they threw at me and for me, that made the ending less than satisfying. My sister, on the other hand, loved the ending and was actually crying, but don't let the crying scare you off. She tends to get overly emotional when she buys into the story and she had no problem suspending belief and taking the ride they offered.<br/><br/>If you love westerns as I do, then you owe it to yourself to support this western at the theater in hopes the box office receipts will encourage more westerns to be produced. If you enjoy great acting and character development and the wider framework of what makes a man a hero and what forces drive a man to despair then this movie provides ample fuel for further discussion. <br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma could have been a great movie if they would have cleaned up some of the plot holes and reined in the ending, but all in all, it was a nice time at the movies and it certainly offered up some lively discussion afterward. The entire cast was stunningly good, the movie was beautifully photographed and the direction kept it moving at a good pace with no lulls or boring moments. <br/><br/>It offers a glance back at the old-time westerns with a few nice improvements. Even if you don't normally appreciate westerns, the acting and action should be enough to make the time spent enjoyable. And if you never appreciated westerns before then maybe it will be enough to make you want to check out some of the greats like High Noon and The Searchers. Westerns have always been a fertile ground for examining the complexities of man, what makes a man great, and the shades of gray that resides in all of us."
"socrates99","9","160","243","9 September 2007"," Reminds me of some of the better westerns except with more guts
","There's a scene near the end where Christian Bale is clearing the air, so to speak, between himself and Russel Crowe's character, that suddenly made clear to me what the entire film was about. It also dawned on me that Bale is a bit like this generation's Gregory Peck, only better. He seems able to explore other ways of being on screen without losing sight of reality. That's quite a trick, and key in this film, as it's really all about his character, Dan Evans, a struggling ex-soldier with a family and a marginal farm to take care of.<br/><br/>Courage is the central preoccupation of this film, so it's more than welcome to see it in the film's production as well. There's a sensibility for weapons, dirt, wagons, injuries, even clothing of the period, on display here that's more than just admirable. It makes you wonder why old westerns didn't explore these elements more thoroughly, though I suppose it had to do with expense. But in having spared that expense these older flicks also failed to pull off the kind of true to life drama that this movie manages to delve into.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the interaction between Crowe, Bale, and his teenage son, William. Though the focus is constantly moving, including generous episodes with a wonderfully nuanced badman played by Ben Foster and some quality time with Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol, most of the story is in what happens between the ex-soldier, his son, and Crowe's gang leader, Ben Wade. Talk about art imitating life, Crowe is pretty much flawless as the intelligent but amoral Wade.<br/><br/>Don't expect a conventional ending. Think about it after you've exited the theater. Aren't we all a mix of good and bad?"
"robertblanton","4","175","291","7 September 2007"," ""Ahm gonna keel me sum law-men, Mabel!""
","Here is an undeniable truth of movie reviewers: When you really want to promote a movie that's not that good, talk about the great performances of the actors. Then you can praise the movie to high heaven, feel you have done your penance, and content yourself with the ingenuity of your expansive insights. This is the case with 3:10 to Yuma.<br/><br/>So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, let's just look at the last 20 or so minutes of the film: <br/><br/>1. Apparently the bartender/hotel clerk in Contention, AZ, whom we've not been introduced to until this point in the movie, is in cahoots with the bad guys because he make a point of surreptitiously and eagerly directing the bad guys to the location of the incarcerated Mr. Crowe. Why does he do this? Who knows. The filmmaker never lets us in on the secret.<br/><br/>2. Apparently the Neanderthal menfolk of Contention, AZ, are a simple-minded lot who, at the thought of earning $200.00 by murdering the the folks holding murderous Russell Crowe in custody, just can't wait to start throwing lead. ""Mabel, Whar's mah raffle? Ahm gonna keel me sum law-men an geet myselves $200.00 dollah cash on that thar barrelhead!"" <br/><br/>3. Apparently no one in Contention has a problem with watching their unarmed police force viciously gunned down in broad daylight. After this atrocity, folks continue to wander the streets, go in and out of stores, and continue their daily lives as though nothing has happened. Except for, of course, the menfolk who are hiding in wait for a chance to earn that $200.00.<br/><br/>4. Apparently no one bothers to theorize that when you are firing dozens of rounds of ammunition at two men who are as close together as they can be without being Siamese twins you just might hit the guy you're trying to rescue.<br/><br/>5. Apparently, when Russell Crowe's psychotic gunslinging hero-worshiping gang member finally realizes the implications of the above, he figures he better start shootin' them menfolk he'd promised that thar munny to. Of course, none of the surviving menfolk think to start shooting at him.<br/><br/>6. Apparently--well, you get the idea. In other words, this excuse for movie-making is, quite frankly, stupid! In order to take this seriously, you must convince yourself that the type of behavior exhibited by many of the characters in this film is the way people really act. Whether it be the above examples, or Peter Fonda being shot in the stomach, at close range, having the bullet removed, and then immediately riding out into the desert on horseback as though nothing had ever happened to him, much of this film is just plain ludicrous! By the way, I'm no gun expert, but I do know this: If you are shot in the stomach at close range you ain't gonna be going' nowhere and you certainly ain't gonna be trottin' around on a horse! <br/><br/>The bigger problem with this movie is its message, which is this: People who do the right thing because it's the right thing to do are fools. Good people don't thrive. As Christian Bale says, ""I've been asking God to help me for three years and he hasn't done it yet."" For those who would attempt to live a righteous, honorable life there is nothing but despair and hopelessness. In fact, at the end of the movie the true hero of the piece is the psychopathic, vicious, murdering Russell Crowe character. And, by the way, this film does NOT retain the ending of the original, so if you were hoping it would, forget about that.<br/><br/>If you see this film, you might recognize material from other Westerns. You have an iron clad stagecoach, reminiscent of John Wayne's ""War Wagon,"" quotes from the Bible, reminiscent of Randolph Scott in ""Ride the High Country,"" the psychological bantering between the Crowe and Christian Bale characters, reminiscent of not only ""Ride the High Country"" but also of ""The Tall T"", an Elmore Leonard story with Randolph Scott and Richard Boone, and Christian Bales's cursing teenage son, reminiscent of Ron Howard in John Wayne's ""The Shootist."" <br/><br/>Your better bets: All of the other movies I named above plus the original with Glen Ford and Van Heflin."
"mstomaso","8","122","200","11 September 2007"," Thoroughly Enjoyable Remake of a Classic Western
","Long ago, I saw the original 3:10 to Yuma featuring Van Heflin and Glen Ford, but I don't remember it well enough to compare it with James Mangold's new remake. Instead, my review will focus exclusively on the new film.<br/><br/>Mangold's film is a tense, traditional western based on an Elmore Leonard story. Leonard is a solid writer, and gave the material upon which the film is based enough background and characterization to permit willful suspension of disbelief. Mangold's film does the same. Our protagonist and antagonist are, respectively, Dan Evans (Bale) and Ben Wade (Crowe). Evans is a would-be rancher and family-man whose family is suffering from a drought and a merciless landlord. Evans and his boys cross paths with notorious outlaw Ben Wade and his gang on their way into town to confront their landlord, and Wade whimsically lets them go. But the connection between these two men and Dan's eldest son is far from over. Eventually Dan will accept an offer made by a railroad agent to help escort Wade to a train headed to Yuma prison, while Wade's crew of murderers dogs their every step.<br/><br/>Two performances stood out for me - Bale and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince). Crowe was good, but it's not clear that he engaged with his role with his usual intensity. There are several very talented actors in supporting roles, and they each pull off the transition to the western genre quite nicely (Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Peter Fonda and others). The film showcases the acting talent very well without losing sight of its straightforward but interesting story.<br/><br/>More often than not, good westerns are at least as much character studies as they are 'shoot-em-ups'. After all, it pretty close to impossible to enjoy a film in which anybody might drop dead at any given time without caring about the people you are watching die, or those doing the killing. Mangold achieves this by drawing on the simple strengths of the original material and allowing relationships to dominate both the story's development and the cinematography. For a western, there is a tremendous amount of dialog in this film, coupled with the usual meaningful stares. Wade is so wily and unpredictable that you really never know what to expect out of him, and his crew is headed up by his loyal and equally nihilistic protégé Charlie Prince. Dan Evans is his polar opposite, and Dan's son is an unusually accurate and complex Hollywood portrayal of a teenager. These and other relationships are the strengths and the medium of the film. When the camera isn't being used to build tension before a battle or showing us a gun-fight, it is establishing relationships and character. And many of the characters and relationships we see are surprising, ambiguous and more than a little ironic.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for western fans."

","I have to think that I am so out of step with the masses. What can others be seeing that I missed. I will say that in the restroom after the movie the other women were laughing at the movie and shaking their heads in disbelief of the hype. There will be many spoilers below. First of all, the acting was fine...that's about all the good I could see. The screen play was illogical. Why would Russell Crow's character continually miss opportunities to escape and the good guys continually miss opportunities to kill the bad guys? Why would they sit around a roaring fire in Apache territory and why wouldn't the Apaches just kill them as they most certainly would have? Why would Russell Crow's character kill all his guys who risked life and limb for him? Why would the writer put a stupid schtick in a chase scene where one character throws an explosive and another character shoots the explosive in mid air while riding full out on a horse? Why would the mine team just stand there and wait to be shot by men they knew to be psycho killers? Why would Russell Crow risk his life jumping over roofs just trying to get to the train? Why would the good guys miss the opportunity to shoot the bad guys in the street with a perfect shot from the bridal suite? How did Peter Fonda recover completely in a 24 hour period after being gut shot? How did Russell Crow's mouth heal completely after being beaten unmercifully by Peter Fonda? Why was Russell Crow's hands handcuffed in front and not in the back? I could go on and on, but I've already wasted enough time and money on this complete mess of a movie."
"alexkolokotronis","9","91","149","18 February 2008"," A Modern Classic
","This is the best western since Unforgiven. Every aspect of this film is great. <br/><br/>The acting was superb. Russell Crowe continues to give great and much overlooked performances. He delivers a great performance as outlaw Ben Wade. Crowe just keeps on putting me in shock with his spectacular performances. Crowe brought a mystique to his role that would of fit in with the old westerns. He seems as if he play anything and was a joy to watch here. He needs to be given much more and was definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Christain Bale also gives as a surprise to me a great performance as Dan Evans. He is on the verge of losing everything he's got. Bale displays his desperation and his willingness to feel that he has a purpose in life. He is definitely turning into a very good all around actor. I think he also deserved an Oscar nomination. Peter Fonda and Ben Foster also give very solid performances in their supporting roles. <br/><br/>I have heard some people say that this western was to talky but I don't believe so. I think this was filled with great dialog and was engaging for the length of the movie.<br/><br/>The directing by James Mangold was probably the best I have seen from him. He was able to bring back the old western style but yet mix it together with a modern effects and etc. He did not fall into the trap of making it boring or to violent. He carried the movie all the way through keeping the viewer entertained. The cinematography was amazing. The sceneries were spectacular and many of the shooting scenes were delivered with such excellence with the acting, directing but the cinematography brought those scenes and this movie to another level. The music was great as well. It did not become cliché but instead made you feel like you were back watching Clint Eastwood, Gary Cooper or John Wayne. It just captured me like no other western has in a while. <br/><br/>This movie is truly a modern classic."

There hasn't been a western with a character so badass as the one Ben Foster plays in this movie. Story-wise, the movie is an opposite Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with the good guys trying to run away from the bad guys in order to make a 3:10 train to Yuma.

","Okay, first why steal the title from a classic western if not just to yank a few more bucks from their clients (us) when the so-called remake is butchered beyond belief. This effort should have been a standalone production just so it wouldn't drag down another production with it.<br/><br/>The main character played by Crow is quite happy to murder law enforcement and his own gang members with nothing shorter than that of a psychopath yet fluctuates back and forth in wanting to help and feel sorry for his captor and son. I won't waste time repeating a lot of the films other irregularities, but that run through town with the citizens and gang now trying to kill them, I mean let's get real. Was it a town policy only to sell guns to blind people? And were the town people who were after the money, who knew every nook and cranny of their tiny town, just terminally stupid as well?<br/><br/>As for the last scene - total in its absolute ridiculousness. Crow was a psychopath. Someone unable to empathize with any worth extended to others, so what's with the aw shucks I guess he's not so bad after all when he's been murdering those after him and his own gang all throughout the whole story.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I'll leave it with this. If this is the best the studios can do with Westerns then they should forget about making them. This movie wasn't even worth the time wasted making or watching it even if you got to watch it for free. I like the main actors, I like Westerns, but the potential for quality that these things offered was absolutely absent here."

","Well, I can look at all the outrageous contradictions, bad cgi explosions/scope effect/fake town effect/cloud effect, etc, numskulled goofs and sheer idiotic behavior from characters in the film, and idiotic continuity from film makers, except a few. The script writer, continuity supervisor, and director should all have been fired. 3:10 to Yuma (2007) is an insult to a film viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>The gang, who does'nt seem capable enough to shoot anyone very well, is so dumb that they can't stop a slow stage coach? An armored coach (+3000 lbs), complete with a Gatling gun (+1000 lb) in the back (film for teen action fans)? Yeah right, it would weigh a ton so the horses could not pull it for long, plus the Gatling gun could not be fired while moving. Easy way to stop a slow stage coach, just shoot two horses. Wow, yeah, it's that easy folks.<br/><br/>Fonda (aside from his hideous acting) takes a .44 slug to the gut and rides out of it, then he rides out the next day without bleeding to death? Dumb dead white guys left on rocks, left by Apaches in front of their ""camp area"" so that everyone knows they (Apaches) live there. Not too smart script writer. Dumb white guys camp with an open fire in Apache country and live? Apaches, using rifles, are shooting in pure darkness, wearing ""war paint"" and traditional feather caps, while not moving around to disguise their location? It was also an insult to portray the Apaches as ""cold blooded killers"" while they were fighting for their tradition, family and lives.<br/><br/>For one, they would not use guns. They would wait, then surprise the camp (who was trespassing on their sacred land), and use arrows and knives. This was truly laughable and degrading to Apache skills as warriors. Wade, in cuffs, in pure darkness, guts 3 Apaches??? A stack of TNT is tossed in the air, then easily blown up by lead bits from shotgun, thereby causing extensive damage to a very secure ""open"" drilled tunnel that is very sound. This was truly laughable.<br/><br/>The last scene, which is badly edited (notice people walking about during gun battle, then gone in next scene, snow on ground in a drought season, etc), was absurd. A one legged man with a shotgun outruns everyone (thanks to shaky camera), then stops in the open to unfasten the train door and gets shot in the back? Well yeah, there was a gun battle 2 minutes previous. This was truly laughable.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma (2007) is an insult to a film viewer's intelligence, especially the insane ending where Wade shoots up his own gang who was attempting to free him. That tops the heap the most. It is degrading. For one, it doesn't prove Wade was ""moral"", just a schizo because he's yapping about escaping in the hotel a few minutes earlier.<br/><br/>The script writer has little in the way of intelligent reasoning."

And Ben Wade, the toughest, smartest, most ruthless outlaw of all times, remains in town, in a hotel room with a girl, with his horse tied up outside the bar until the Sheriff and his men ride back into town and easily take him into custody. (He has to be taken into custody early on in the movie in order to start this parody of getting him on the 3:10 to Yuma!) In one scene, toward the end, the gang offers the townspeople a $200 per person bounty on the Sheriff and each of the good guys and the townspeople go crazy in their desire to make $200 or more. And, in the end, Ben Wade, who, himself, or through his gang, has dispatched everybody who matters to their eternal rewards, is so impressed with the truth and courage of the opposition, that he voluntarily gets on the train to go back to the Yuma Prison for his third time and, most likely, to a date with the hangman. And then along the way there's some mention of the Bible, some Bible verses, and then some sort of cross or crucifix on Ben's gun handle. Yep, it's SOME movie. Recommend it to your friends who may have steered you to a similarly stupid flick or some friends that you would like to hear less from."

","Nice to finally see a decent modern western bring its way to the screen. Much in the style of westerns of old, lots of action, but it doesn't move too quickly where all your seeing is shootouts and blood. The storyline is deep and powerful, all the characters are interesting and make sense, and just an overall enjoyable film.<br/><br/>James Mangold puts himself on the board with this film, hopefully he continues to pump out future classics such as 3:10 to Yuma.<br/><br/>Go out and watch this in theaters, and then buy it on DVD when it comes out.

"ikanboy","7","31","51","29 September 2007"," A good movie ruined by a ludicrous ending.
","Reading many of the comments it seems obvious these days that all a movie needs is: good cinematography; good acting; interesting plot; plenty of action. That hooks most people nowadays. The fact that it lacks intelligent plotting, doesn't allow for any semblance of rational belief, and treats the audience as if it's stuck in dreamy adolescence, doesn't seem to matter.<br/><br/>Granted it's great acting by Crowe, Bale, and Peter Fonda. Great evil theatric posturing by Ben Foster. The cinematography is great, and it's based on one of the great ""thinking man's"" cowboy movies ever made. So how could they screw this up. Simple: by deciding, at the end, to pander to the audience that likes action, and is either too lazy too think, or finds attention to concentration bothersome to the base pleasure of being led by the nose.<br/><br/>*****************SPOILER*********** Up until the last twenty minutes the movie does fair homage to the original, and in some ways fleshes it out satisfactorily. To keep up interest there is way too much escaping/recapturing going on. Crowe gets captured initially not by some fluke, but by his own stupidity, which puts a crimp in the notion that he is a fiendishly clever sociopath. Then he escapes way too many times from supposedly hardened men, who never seem to get it that the best way to transport a sociopath is heavily bound. The fact that he gets recaptured again simply diminishes the ""invincible"" reputation he has as a badman.<br/><br/>But this is all signaling us for the end when Bale is left as the only one standing to take Crowe to the train station. The gang of seven sits atop their horses outside the hotel in which they are holed up. They sit bunched up - sitting targets - but no that would be too easy. Bale must take Crowe not only past them but half the town that has been offered bounty money. So how does he do it? The Director decides to turn the movie completely upside down and have Crowe aid and abet Bale in running the gauntlet. Not only aid and abet but kill off every last one of his own gang for pissing him off and shooting Bale. <br/><br/>I am so tired of having to sit through movies and suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the movie. I'm willing to do it when the movie doesn't take itself serious, but this one tries to pass itself off as a morality play, and Crowe's latter day conversion to Robin Hood simply insults probability."

It's a movie, but boy, that guy Dan Evans with the wooden leg can motor.And PLEASE, someone tell me how the amulet or lucky charm engraved in the gun handle or carried by Dan empowers them all to mystically pause then, as Dr. Laura would say, ""Now go do the right thing!"" <br/><br/>Yuma ends in something so contrived it's laughable. You know they say movies are made for an eight grade educated audience and even with grade inflation no one in middle school will be insulted by this film.<br/><br/>All the killing was great. I mean I love bullets, especially the ones fired at point blank that don't blow the guts out of Peter Fonda's character. Was he wearing body armor or is he just so old and leathery that it stops the molten hot projectile from penetrating his subcutaneous fat and peritoneum. Pretty soon he's 'good to go' and up in the saddle and fighting Ben. And when he gets flung over the cliff his posse pales show great restraint. ""OK Mr. Wade, that'll be enough, now get back on your horse, we have a train to catch."" <br/><br/>When Butch in Butch Cassidy gets mad at his gang but only kicks the big guy in the nuts. Crowe does Butch one better by blowing them all to pieces. A nice parting gesture after they ride 80 hard miles to rescue him. The very last icing on the cake was Roy Roger's horse Trigger doing a cameo and responding to a whistle from Crowe. <br/><br/>If you loved this movie don't watch, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Unforgiven, Open Range or Dances with Wolves.<br/><br/>Filmmakers: PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE THE WESTERN!"

","This remake of the 1957 oater (that's movie talk for ""western"") is serviceable largely because of the earnest craftiness of its two leads, who skillfully play off each other in a battle of wills, if not morals. Unfortunately, while the motives of the good guy (playes by Christian Bale) are both noble and realistic, some of the actions of the bad guy (Russell Crowe) may leave you scratching your head, and while nebulous intentions can make for wonderful mystery, in the end you're still not sure why Crowe's dastardly Ben Wade has done what he's done, and what it all means.<br/><br/>Dan Evans (Bale) is a dirt-poor farmer who lost a leg in the Civil War. His farm's about to be foreclosed by an unscrupulous land owner who's taken to damming a river and burning down Evans' barn to force him off his own property. So when stagecoach robber Ben Wade (Crowe) is captured and needs to be escorted to the nearby town to get on the titular train, Evans volunteers, both to gain payment to help save his farm and to save face in front of his two kids, one of whom is sick from tuberculosis and one who thinks his old man is a spineless failure. Saddled by debt and ungrateful kids, Evans' decision and motivation is easy to understand.<br/><br/>Ah, but getting the nefarious Wade to Yuma is going to be a complicated trick indeed, because the rest of his gang, led by Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) isn't going to let their fearless leader be trundled off to Yuma to die. Luckily, bounty hunter Byron McElroy (a gritty Peter Fonda) gets the idea of using a decoy stagecoach to lure the varmints off the trail while he and the rest of the posse, including Evans, schlep Wade in the other direction. The gambit works for a while, allowing the good guys to place precious geographical space between them and the bad guys; it also allows the movie to continue unabated. Because, after all, there are more people in Wade's gang then there are trying to bring him to justice - all they'd have to do is find him, shoot the hell out of the place, and grab him.<br/><br/>Although there's plenty of gunplay and death by bullets, this is much more of a psychological drama than anything else. Wade, as played coldly (but not charmlessly) by Crowe, has two goals in mind: gain the mental upper hand on Evans, an untrained rancher, and gain his escape from the clutches of law and order. Meanwhile, although Evans' intentions are less murky, he's not some squinty-eyed sharpshooter whose aim is always true; he's not an iconic hero who you just know is gonna save the day. Bale is terrific; you can really see the anguish he feels as a supposed failure in the eyes of his sons. In the hands of lesser actors, these two complex roles would have seemed less symbiotic and therefore less sincere. For example, apparently Movie Guy Tom Cruise was initially supposed to have Wade's role; if that had come to fruition, we would have been distracted by Movie Star Tom Cruise, and the movie would have suffered terribly as a result.<br/><br/>But despite the wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe, the movie's shortcoming is that Ben Wade's intentions seem rather inscrutable. I don't mean that they're simply ambiguous (is he going to flee or help the good guys fight off Navajo Indians?), I mean that they don't make much sense. One minute, Wade is all set to get away from Evans and escape to the safety of his gang, but in the next he's actually fending off his gang as it attacks Evans. There's no explanation given for this change of heart, but the new attitude is gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving the viewer a little puzzled. Sure, some may explain this as ""Wade comes to respect Evans and so doesn't want to see the rancher killed,"" but Wade's actions were much more than that. He wasn't just trying to save Evans, you see, he was actively trying to knock off members of his own gang, and the reason for that escaped me completely.<br/><br/>Still, 3:10 to Yuma is firmly entertaining, benefiting from two gritty, believable performances by Crowe and Bale, although it's marred by some unexplained actions on the part of its charismatic villain."

","I, too, saw a preview (at a press screening) and truly enjoyed the film. The performances ooze class, charisma and depth and for someone who is not so into Westerns I found myself lured into this tale of complex morality. Crowe is especially dashing in the film as a truly bad man who we want to believe to ultimately be good. He is really quite incredible and delivers such a complex performance, with complete ease. However none of the performances lack, not Bale's, not Foster's, not Fonda's. There is really an old school Western here, with a modern edge to it. 3:10 to Yuma is also quite stunning when it comes to cinematography and set design, but these elements merely help tell the story, they do not distract from it. It's definitely worth seeing. James Mangold (Walk the Line) is definitely a very talented director. I have this a 7 because I'm a film critic and am tough, but I think fans of the genre will likely rate it higher."

","James Magnold's ""3:10 to Yuma"" stars Christian Bale as Dan Evans, a struggling farmer who agrees to escort gang leader Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to a nearby train station. Wade is to be transported to prison. His men are determined to prevent this.<br/><br/>Magnold's film is both a remake of a 1957 classic, and an adaptation of an Elmore Leonard short story. Unlike previous incarnations of this tale, though, Magnold portrays Dan Evans as a down on his luck farmer. With one bad leg, a farm in ruins, a sick child and a lifetime of misfortune, Dan's the quintessential underdog. Tired of the world spitting on him, Dan embarks on a noble quest; he will get Wade to his destination. Nothing will stop him. He will be a hero.<br/><br/>The majority of ""3:10"" contrasts the morality, integrity and family life of Dan with the brutality, barbarism and lawlessness of Wade. Indeed, at first glance it appears that Wade is subtly corrupting Dan's family. He's the archetypal outsider, weaselling his way into Dan's life with the intention of seducing any and everyone. ""Walk in my shoes,"" Wade whispers.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, though, it becomes apparent that it is Dan who is in fact leading Wade into temptation. Longing for a family of his own (he was abandoned by his mother and he pines for a young barmaid), and slowly growing sympathetic to Dan's own plight, Wade thus gradually shifts from outlaw to hero. Ironically, he does this all out of a moral desire to mythologise and make a hero of – and so save – Dan.<br/><br/>And so ""3:10 to Yuma"" (both versions) boasts one of the strangest final acts in the history of Westerns. Here, Wade picks up his sick-shooters and joins Dan in a battle against Wade's own henchmen. Both films then end with Wade imprisoned, having assisted the very man assigned to put him in a cage. He's completed his transformation from an outside (outlaw) to an insider (farmer), though the film's final shot suggests that this transformation is short-lived.<br/><br/>Magnold's script occasionally has good chunks of dialogue (""Squeezing that watch won't stop time"", ""I've been standing on one leg for three damn years waiting for God to do me a favour... but he ain't listening""). For the most part, though, Magnold's dialogue is poor (he can't capture the blunt, macho poetry of Leonard) and he squanders very good ideas which weren't part of the original stories. And despite a strong last-act, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is poorly shot and poorly cast. Their bodies forged by modern gym routines and their inflections copied from cinema's past tough guys, Bale and Crowe never convince as 19th century frontiersmen.<br/><br/>7/10 - See ""Hombre"", ""Ride with the Devil"" and ""Bad Company"" (1972)."

Christian and Russell clicked so well and brought together an awesome western film, probably the best since Unforgiven. James Mangold captured the perfect feeling of a classic western film and brought together this great cast. This is one of the first films of the summer that I'm giving a perfect 10 rating, I couldn't find one complaint about 3:10 to Yuma.

To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if this is going to be nominated for a couple Oscars.<br/><br/>Ben Wade is an outlaw killer/thief who is on the run with his gang, but he is captured one day. The problem is that he has a reputation for being the fastest gun swinger in the West, so the policemen ask a man, Dan Evans if he brings him to the 3:10 prisoner train to Yuma for two hundred dollars. One problem, Ben's gang wants him back and will chase him, his son, Doc, and Butterfield throughout the West.

I was never really into western movies, except for the good, the bad, and the ugly, and unforgiven, but 3:10 to Yuma is a guaranteed classic. I am very much recommending this film to anyone, even those who are not into the Western films, because this is just all together a terrific film.

","When a sixgun fires a hundred bullets -- instead of only six -- it should be grounds for firing the director because it proves he doesn't know what he's doing.<br/><br/>The original 3:10 to Yuma is an eloquent drama about persevering through hardship, being a good role model to your boys and a hero to your wife, and doing the right thing in the face of life-threatening danger while not giving into the temptation to take the easy way out. It's an American classic and one of the great westerns of the 1950s. <br/><br/>I was hoping this remake would make a few adjustments to the original script and stage the story in an artful way, taking advantage of color, authentic costumes and props that are available now, and the beautiful New Mexico scenery. With everything going for it, including big stars and a big budget, this remake is a blown opportunity because the film makers have no idea what a western is supposed to be or do. Instead of telling a simple story we can relate to, this remake is an exercise in misandry (yes, that's a word, coined in the 1970s) that plays out like a spaghetti western made three decades to late, with ridiculous over-the-top action, sadistic violence, bombastic dialog, and vicious, whining, undignified characters who behave in unbelievable ways. It's a cartoon with people. There is not one single realistic or believable moment. There is not one moment that wasn't done better in the original. The new material, consisting mostly of an electrocution, an Indian attack, and various forms of carnage is no improvement. Even New Mexico, still the most pictorial location for westerns, looks better in other movies.<br/><br/>Compared to other recent westerns like Appaloosa, The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford, Open Range, and There Will Be Blood, this remake of 3:10 to Yuma simply doesn't measure up. Skip it. Watch one of those or the original if you want to see a quality western."

","The Western fell out of favour amongst studios in the early 1970s . Much of this was down to the critical and commercial success of THE WILD BUNCH a shockingly amoral Western that blurred the lines between good and bad . Previously the genre was best known for its distinction between good and evil where the good guy would always seemingly win whatever the odds . With hindsight the reason this very limited concept survived for decades is down to the fact that audiences seem to love happy endings <br/><br/>3:10 TO YUMA is an uneasy mixture of the traditional Western and anti-Western . The story revolves around wanted fugitive Ben Wadee being captured by a posse in Arizona who plan to take him to the rail station at Yuma where he'll be taken for trial at a federal court . Wade's gang now led by Charlie Prince will do all they can to release Wade before he reaches the rail station <br/><br/>The problem with the film is that it wants to have its cake and eat it . Russell Crowe is seemingly well cast as Ben Wade and the audience are asked to emphasise with him . Unfortunately he's the leader of a gang of outlaws and the first glimpse we get of Wade is when his gang raid a coach carrying gold which ends with its escort being shot dead . Why should we feel any empathy for Wade ? Well he stumbles across Dan Evans and his two sons but doesn't kill them out of hand . Let me see now it's okay to kill people if you're carrying out an armed robbery but it's wrong to kill innocent passer bys ? <br/><br/>The film continues with this warped view of morality . Prince is painted as the villain of the piece despite being motivated by a code of honour where his gang will rescue Wade all any cost . Considering the rescue attempts cost so many lives could anyone blame Prnce for forgetting all about his mentor ? The more the film continues the more confused it becomes as to who the good guys and bad guys are and by the time the final climatic ridiculous shoot out takes place you'll be beyond caring what happens to whom <br/><br/>Narrative wise this is the sort of movie that could have been a mini-masterpiece if it'd been directed in the 1970s by Sam Peckinpah but with the ethos of New Hollywood with its radical view of morality dying out in the early 1980s we're left with a rather old fashioned film in a even more old fashioned tired genre"

The story has too many flaws and holes in it. 3:10 to Yuma is every bit as uninteresting as The Assassination of Jesse James. It's overwrought, loaded down with the same thing over and over -- long periods of tough talk, followed by shooting their way out of an impossible situation. Then more chatter followed by another implausible escape from death. It has all the cartoonishness of an Indiana Jones movie.

","I'm not a Western film buff and don't claim to be so I had some reservations going into this film, however, I was also expecting something great even though it's not my particular genre. With Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, and James Mangold directing, I knew the screenplay had to be good. I knew the film was going to be good. I just didn't know how much I would love it. <br/><br/>Christian Bale plays Dan Evens, a poor rancher who's struggling during the drought to protect his family. He happens to stumble upon Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) as he's robbing a coach full of money hauled by the Pinkerton's. After a gun battle erupts, Wade collects on his 22nd robbery. Dan Evans oldest son, William (Logan Lerman), ignores Dan, which happens a lot as William tries to see the action from atop the ridge as Wade and his gang spot him after Wade shoots one of his own men for putting the rest of the gang at risk. Evans oldest son is in awe of Wade and has a sense of admiration his father wish he had for him.<br/><br/>Wade is caught in Bisbee and the Railroad Company is offering to pay three men to bring Wade to Contention and put him on the 3:10 to Yuma and send him to the Yuma prison. Evens tells him that he was the best shot in his regiment and Evans youngest son who sees his father as a hero tells Wade that he can shoot a jackrabbit at 50 yards, which is sayin' something. Evans is paid 200 dollars to help bring Wade to Contention.<br/><br/>During the journey we start to see a transformation from both Wade and Evans. Evans tells him that he will bring him to justice. He believes it's right to stand up to people like Ben Wade. By the end of the journey, as they make it to Contention, they wait for the train to come and this wait becomes the films strongest act. Evans is watching Wade in a bridal suite waiting for destiny to come. As the wait comes closer to three o'clock, Wade's gang arrives in Contention. The gang's current leader, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), is the only one who wanted to travel 80 miles to help Wade. Prince makes an offer to the towns folk of 200 dollars to anyone who shoots one of his capturers. The odds now seem insurmountable and since everyone in the town has guns cocked and drawn ready to shoot the Marshall and two of his best deputies decide that they're family men and this is an unfair fight and they will not die like this, so they bail on Evans. Mr. Butterfield also says that he won't be helping Evans put Wade on that train. Evans is found standing alone.<br/><br/>Now when all the bullets start flying reality goes right out the door with them, but the message and purpose for Evans leading Wade to the train makes it all worth it. The ending is controversial and a lot of people aren't going to find it realistic, but they haven't noticed the character change. Is it a little unreal how Wade seems to turn in the blink of an eye? Sure. Maybe. But the reasons for their turn is exhilarating to watch. Seeing Wade brought to justice was not Evans intention at all- as it was at the start of their journey. Evans does something incredible. Wade does something incredible. The actions during the final minutes with nothing but the sound of the chugging train engine like a slow heartbeat in the background is emotionally captivating. It is some of the best work of any genre you are going to find.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is great in this film and this may very well be his greatest acting achievement to date (American Psycho, The Machinist, The Prestige) and Russell Crowe is also phenomenal and this is one of his better performances as well (A Beautiful Mind, Gladiator, American Gangster).<br/><br/>This film is not about the gun battles or the wild west. It's about the characters. These characters are so deep and as we become so involved with them we are left rooting for them and hoping something doesn't happen that seems inevitable. The final lines of the film are said by Dan Evans' son and Charlie Prince. Both said to Dan Evans. We can get a sense of joy during these final moments because we know everything that happened up until that point went exactly as planed by Evans, and we get a sense of triumph in an odd way. <br/><br/>This is a great film regardless of genre. It's also the best Western I've ever seen."

","*** Major spoilers included *** Yes, this one has more explosions and graphic violence than the original, but that does not make it a good film. <br/><br/>As at least one other comment here pointed out, the story is totally illogical. We are supposed to accept that a previously cold-hearted killer grows to like the good guy family man yada, yada, yada trying to bring him to justice. So what if a hangman's rope is waiting, he wants to make Dan his pal. We even get little anvil on the head hints at what's to come later. Like Dan's son saying the killer has some good in him. He can see it's there. They even make Ben's victims, after Ben meets Dan, out to be jerks right before he kills them. To justify their deaths we assume-""Hey, he insulted his mom and did bad things in his past, he deserved to die"". Or ""He had to stab him countless times in the throat with a fork till he was dead...he was a total jerk and even burned Dan's barn down""... The final illogical straw was having notorious Ben Wade kill all his own gang members that risked their miserable lives to free him? Why because he developed some kind of guy crush on a farmer. Just plain stupid, done obviously for the shock value to the viewer. Even the sex scene between Russell Crowe's character Ben and a girl he seduces seemed contrived and pointless. Like it was stuck in the film to show his character wasn't gay. Otherwise we might later think he had a crush on Christian Bale's Dan and that's why he was attracted to him and wanted to get on that train. Of course then they would have to change the film's name to '3:10 to Brokeback Mountain'.<br/><br/>These are just a few examples from the avalanche of illogical moments in this film. Yes, the actors were all good and no expense was spared for explosions and running horses. To bad they didn't have a well written story to do the actors and horseys justice. <br/><br/>For those western fans that haven't seen the original 1957 film this was based on, see it.

","don't know what is more stunning..... the illogical and unbelievable plot or the volume of positive reviews. among all the problems i had with dozens of illogical and impossible character behaviors the fact that the posse dragged russel crowe to the 3:10 while he kills them off one at a time is absolutely the most ridiculous story point i have ever seen. the fact they don't just shoot him dead and then go home to their families is nuts. cowboys of the old west would have and nothing in the movie other than bales character hoping for $200 reward explains why these guys would die off one at a time and ride through hostile Indian territory to get crowe to a train to take him straight to prison with no mention of a trial is just idiocy. any comparisons to movies like the excellent and 100% believable unforegiven are something i cant understand."

","When Dan Evans, one-legged Civil War veteran and impoverished rancher is having one of his barns burned down by his landlord and about to be evicted because he is unable to pay the rent, things seem credible enough. But soon, ""3:10 to Yuma"" stops making any sense at all. For starters, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his gang of cut-throats have little trouble in stopping a stagecoach protected by a crackerjack team of heavily armed guards contracted by the Pinkertons. To boot, the stagecoach is equipped with the new-fangled Gatling (machine) gun. Despite the heavy artillery, the escort is no match for Wade and his boys with the help of a sharpshooter in the hills who never misses. Okay, then there's the leader of the Pinkerton group, Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) who's entrusted to deliver the stagecoach cache of money to a nearby town. When Wade's psychopathic lieutenant Charlie Prince (convincingly played by Ben Foster) shoots McElroy point blank in the stomach, he doesn't die but merely doubles over. <br/><br/>Although Wade is supposed to be this crazy outlaw responsible for a string of outlandish heists and murders, he really isn't that badhe's one of those touchy-feely bad guys with a chivalrous heart underneath. Inexplicably, he lets McElroy live. But just to show that he also has a dark side, murders one of his own men when a surviving member of the stagecoach posse takes the man hostage (Wade shoots both men). Wade first meets Evans and his two kids who have been watching the robbery of the stagecoach from afar. Even though they're witnesses to his nefarious deeds, Wade lets them go and apologetically takes their horses and lets them know where they can find them later. Even though Wade is supposed to be this brilliant criminal, he's easily trapped by local law enforcement after he tarries too long in the town with a barmaid he suddenly has the hots for. <br/><br/>Instead of locking Wade up locally and paying for a more professional team of law enforcement or Federal soldiers to help him, Grayson Butterfield, the Southern Pacific Railroad's representative, decides to conscript Evans, McElroy and a couple of other miscreants to march Wade through hostile Indian territory where they can catch the '3:10 to Yuma' and have him transported to where he can be put on trial. Their plan is to first stop off at the Evans ranch where they create a diversion, making Wade's gang believe that they're taking Wade in a stagecoach in the opposite direction but actually have Wade remain at the ranch where he has a nice but long-winded conversation with Wade's impressionable wife. Even though they're all afraid of the mighty power of Wade's men (with the memory of the defeat of the Pinkerton group fresh in their minds), they believe this particular stagecoach can outrun the gang all the way to a local fort. Sure enough, the gang outruns the coach, kills all the drivers and chains the Wade decoy inside the stagecoach and burns him to death. What a brilliant plan! On the way through the aforementioned hostile Indian territory, McElroy keeps chugging along despite having been shot point blank in the stomach. Wade kills McElroy after we learn that McElroy was not such a good guy after all (he murdered a bunch of Apache women and children in cold blood). Somehow every time Wade kills someone it's justified because his victims are far more morally tainted than he (Wade kills another one of the posse escorting him after we learn that this is the man who was principally responsible for burning Evan's barn down). <br/><br/>By the time we reach the town of Contention where the 3:10 to Yuma is about to arrive, we realize that all the townspeople are a bunch of cowards who are willing to accept $200 a pop by Wade's gang to kill Evans and the local sheriff and deputies who have volunteered to help Butterfield. Not only are all the townspeople in Contention browbeaten but the sheriff and his deputies also surrender their weapons to the gang (only to be blown away seconds later). You can watch one of the extras on the DVD and discover that some of the most notorious outlaws in the history of the old west were taken down by the local citizenry who were outraged by their antics. But not so here in '3:10 to Yuma'. When Evans singlehandedly attempts to move Wade to the train station where he can put him in the prison car, Wade cooperates and never tries to run away. Wade's gang fires round after round at BOTH Evans and Wade without regard to hitting their boss. Finally, when Charlie shoots Evans at the climax of the movie, Wade suddenly becomes a man of conscience and finishes off Charlie and the rest of his gang and then places himself in the prison car without batting an eyelash. <br/><br/>If you watch the DVD Extras, you'll get a fascinating look at how they put this movie together. There's some nice cinematography, passable performances and costumes but many of the scenes are incredibly drawn out (Wade's conversation with Evans's wife at the homestead and conversation with Evans at the hotel for example) and as I have already argued, a plot that makes little sense. Given the money that was put into this project, strictly from a writing standpoint, '3:10' is a decided failure!"

Otherwise, I haven't a clue what would have justified a remake. I would guess this is just another example of Hollywood having run out of original ideas and failing in the attempt to reclaim past glory.

","This is the most unbelievable, incredible movie that I have ever seen. ""Good guys"" can't seem to shoot the broad side of a barn, and what's worse, have no inclination to even try to level their guns at any one of a gang of mass murderers standing in clear view with no cover. Why, why, why? Why did any of them even bother carrying a gun , when they had no intention of (or ability for) using it? The ""sweet-talking, abused child, mass-murderer with a heart of gold"" theme is also hard to swallow. Why in the world would his captors not have gagged him? Why would the prisoner not be fettered? The thing is, I enjoy a good action flick as much as the next guy. I love the Die Hard movies. They're incredibly far-fetched, but fun. Unfortunately, this movie was not of that genre, but any of the escapist Die Hard fare is ten times more plausible!

And after that fiasco, we don't get closure as to whether Wade's son gets the money and saves the family ranch from the evil land grabbers.

"wmjahn","1","16","28","16 August 2010"," What a train wreck of a movie !
","Whilst the original adaption of the Elmore Leonard story is a nice B-movie, the re-make is a D-script (if D at all ...) filmed with an A-budget and starring a totally miscast ""hero"" Russel Crowe.<br/><br/>My God, what a turkey! I have just seen the re-make on TV out of interest, so I could compare todays filmmaking with the old semi-classic. I didn't expect much, but what I got was even less than I could have expected.<br/><br/>I know, yeah, a really good western is probably the toughest movie to make (and the last time Hollywood succeeded in doing so was OPEN RANGE and before that Eastwood did one of his best works with UNFORGIVEN), because the settings of the genre are limited and you can't have that much ""big/expensive scenes"" with explosions, car chases (smile), etc, so you have to rely to a reasonable/good story and some interesting characters, but both is totally lacking here. In fact the makers of this re-make didn't trust the story at all and threw in all kinda over-the-top action-scenes, which just look much too implausible to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>The character of Russel Crowe and especially one of his gang-members is despicable, but of course having a leading man like Russel Crowe (who gives the label ""wooden acting"" a new meaning), Hollywood can't show him as filthy criminal, but needs to build a hero out of him. So the movie takes a good time developing that the people he has killed and kills ""deserve"" their fate. It's just ridiculous - and sorry for moralizing - that Crowe/Wade killing a member of the posse with a fork (!) gets him just a medium-severe beating. The same goes for his next victim: in fact the only above average-interesting character in the movie, the Pinkerton-man played by Peter Fonda, is characterized a good half-hour as the most evil person imaginable (by a moralizing (!) Crowe) to be then thrown off a cliff for good sake and what happens to Crowe: nothing again! Come on, I hate it when scriptwriters think I am an idiot, taking sh-- for gold.<br/><br/>And Crowe is established as some kinda good (!) anti-hero, about whom the boy fantasizes as being a morale person, not totally evil. That's ludicrous and I don't see how somebody, who kills and destroys merciless, can have a good side or be worshiped?? When LEONE had an evil character in his western, he established that right away, of course with a portion of cynicism, for example like in GOOD, BAD, UGLY (EASTWOOD being ""good"", Lee van Cleef being ""bad""), but this 3:10 TO YUMA re-make does in fact take the good side of Wade indeed seriously.<br/><br/>And to ""balance"" that, the movie does of course need somebody really ""evil"" (to establish how ""good"" Wade is in comparison) and introduces a silly-staring gang-member, who lets somebody burn inside a carriage. That scene is especially ludicrous, because that just would not have happened in any decent western, it's totally against the ""rules of the genre"". Near gore-like scenes like this don't fit into a western, and it doesn't have anything to do with ""widening the boundaries"" of the genre to put in repulsive scenes like this one.<br/><br/>As I already mentioned, on top of all that Crowe is totally miscast. Not for a second do I believe his ""character"" as an outlaw, he just looks ""too good"", too well-fed with his puffy face (Mr. Crowe, stop eating junk food!) and too contemporary with his ""I don't like fat"" (haha!) eating-habits. Of course somebody like him cites the bible and tries to philosophize, which probably should establish the intellectual side of the evil. Yeah, in ""modern""-day Hollywood it has become kinda ""politcal correct"" to have the bad guy being a misunderstood intellectual with a hard upbringing ... hey, come one, that can't be meant serious (but it indeed is!) ?? Of course, compared to that (the lesser star) C. Bale looks like a stupid farmer, whilst in a good script, if there would be some moralizing, then it would fit (T)HIS character ...<br/><br/>And the ending ... well, I think I can skip that, many other posters on the IMDb have already pointed out how silly/stupid/unfitting it is (btw, Elmore Leonard doesn't like the changed ending either).<br/><br/>So ... another re-make which should have been avoided. It's sad, but Hollywood can't do any good genre movies anymore. People, who don't understand the western-genre, should simply stay away from it instead of ruining it even further!"

The final ambush gauntlet sequence is particularly laughable.<br/><br/>Consistent logic is not required for these characters.

"usanettom-1","1","16","28","19 February 2008"," Predictable, Corny, Stupid
","I don't get the hype for this movie, nor do I understand all the acclaim. The acting was OK, but everything else was awful. The story is more full of holes than all of the people shot in the movie combined. There were a lot of really stupid scenes that just didn't make sense. It was boring to watch due the predictability. I've never seen the original, so I was going into this without story background - and yet it didn't take long to find out what would happen at the end.<br/><br/>At the point in the movie where Crowe's character has the inevitable 'change of heart', I was thinking 'don't let that corny, mushy, pathetic speech that Bale's character just spouted be the reason Crowe's character turns' - and, of course, it was. Each should have his man-card revoked purely due to that scene.<br/><br/>So, let's move on to the scenery. One of the things I love most about westerns is the scenery - the huge, wide-open spaces, the mountains, big blue skies (I'm thinking Dances with Wolves or even Tombstone). I guess you could say in this movie it's pretty forgettable, since I saw it yesterday and cannot recall anything that stood out.<br/><br/>Well, some westerns have great music (Last of the Mohicans comes to mind). Again, I saw this movie yesterday and can't recall any music at all. I'm sure it was there, but I can't remember it.<br/><br/>What about interesting side characters? No, not so much. There was very little character development beyond maybe 4 characters, and even the development they had left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>If you want a good western, see one of the three I mentioned above. They're all much, much better than this failure. Don't waste your time on this one."

","The rancher Daniel Evans (Christian Bale), who lost part of his leg in the Civil War, is broken and owing a large amount to a powerful man in Bisbee. When the outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is captured after the heist of a stagecoach, Dan offers to escort the cold blood killer to the city of Contention to take the 3:10 PM train to Yuma to be sent to trial. In return, he would receive US$ 200,00, enough to save his land and give a better life to his family. During their journey, Ben gets closer to Dan while his gang of criminals follows the group to rescue their boss.<br/><br/>The deceptive ""3:10 to Yuma"" has an absurd and incoherent plot and is absolutely overrated in IMDb. Indeed I can not understand how many viewers do not see how illogical this movie is (maybe influenced by the positive marketing). I am a big fan of Christian Bale, I like Russell Crowe a lot, and actually their performances are top-notch as usual. Regarding the Hollywoodian bad guy Ben Wade, he is a cold blood killer and leader of mean criminals. However, along their journey, he has feelings for Dan in a ridiculously corny situation; he runs and jumps over the roofs and alleys without any explanation to help Dan to reach the station; in the climax, he kills his own loyal men that had risked their lives to save him. Regarding Dan Evans, he leaves his wife and sons in a dangerous trip just to raise money; however, he neither accepts the offer of Ben (ok, it would be corruption and not compatible to a good guy) nor the money of the railroad agent when they are under siege in the hotel with a dreadful perspective of survival. Last but not the least, he runs and jumps very well with only one foot. Why the good guy did not kill the arrogant and cruel Ben Wade along the incidental trip? Maybe the most ridiculous situation is Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda), who was shot in the stomach, riding a horse on the next day. See the original 1957 film instead. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Os Indomáveis"" (""The Indomitable"")"
"p-stepien","2","13","22","1 October 2011"," Yuma derailed
","Never before has the wild west been so gunslinging, deadly and immoral. A small-time one-legged rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is struggling with debt and is on the verge of his land being taken away by the railroad. Desperate to not let his family down decides to take on the task of transporting the notorious Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to the 3:10 train to the Yuma prison facility. However his gang of cutthroats and reckless murderers have different plans...<br/><br/>The attempted remake of the 1957 film garnered at reviving the Western genre made quite a splash at the box office in no small part thanks to terrific performances by Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Actually the whole cast does a commendable job with selling a script somewhat short of imbecilic. Another character worth mention is Ben Foster playing the dastardly second-in-command Charlie Prince. However even their best attempts can't hide how poorly written this movie is.<br/><br/>What is even more shocking is that the scriptwriters had a perfectly good script to base this movie on. The 1957 version - with all its flaws and low budget - had a tight, compelling and intriguing script which only needed to be brushed up and slightly expanded on. To some extent that was what was done, but somehow Welles and Brandt manage to add a cascade of ideas which derail the Yuma train from any semblance of logic.<br/><br/>Warning signs appear from the word go. Given the movie was sold as being realistic or gritty the Gaitling-machine gun opening sequence, as if taken from the annals of ""Wild Wild West"", sends out all the wrong signals. Such over-the-top action made me feel like in the middle of a Michael Bay movie set in New Mexico in the XIXth Century. And that is never a good sign. In an apparent attempt to feed considerably more high-budget action than the laid-back original the movie is unable to replicate it's unrelenting feeling of suspense.<br/><br/>I must add that I'm not exactly an aficionado of the old Westerns, so I really expected that given the star potential plus the vastly superior movie standards, this new version would sell the idea the way the original couldn't. The final pay-off is however sacrificed for sheriffs riding horses a day after being shot in the belly, blood-hungry Apache Indians and various non-sensical sequences (full with some horrendous wink-winks to its predecessor) which riddle the road to the train station in Contention. In the end the only scenes that really manage to work in this movie are those which are copy-pasted from the 1957 original version (which wasn't really that good).<br/><br/>The coup d'etat comes with the final resolution. WARNING - MAJOR SPOILERS. Brutally gutting the movie with ridiculous action the movie already has it rough to sell a believable ending. Unfortunately the slight gentlemanship of Glen Ford is substituted for a blood-hungry crazed and otherworldly fast-gunning Russell Crowe. The earlier movie had one gruesome murder throughout, while this revamped version has blood and guts spilling in the dozens. This makes the final resolution hard to swallow, especially given the change of heart occurs thanks to a pathetic sob story told by Dan during strangulation. From then on Crowe's character gingerly runs in leaps and bounds aboard a train set for Yuma straight towards his planned hanging. Just so the public don't feel too gutted by this turn of events Ben Wade lackadaisically mentions he's broken out of Yuma twice before.<br/><br/>What really killed this movie for me was the pay-off, which worked in the original so well. In 1957 Glen Ford's rather silent and enigmatic character decides to help Dan Evans fulfil his mission, due to admiration he starts having towards the unrelenting honest rancher. It is done in such a way, which makes the story spin conceivable, as the help supplied by Ben Wade is lasts just several seconds and can be sold as a spur of the moment initiative. The death of Charlie Prince functions here as unfortunate collateral of this turn of events. In the 2007 blockbuster Russell Crowe actively leads the way to the Yuma train for several arduous minutes. Given he is supposedly the leader of this gang of misfits wouldn't it be easier for him to just tell them to just stop with all this shooting, chasing and killing? On arriving on board the Yuma train Dan Evans is killed by the unknowing Charlie Prince. This ends with Ben Wade singlehandedly gunning down his whole posse of gunslingers. Need I remind you that the only reason those poor dimwits were there in the first place is to save their leader from prison? Absolutely appalling plot resolution.<br/><br/>Given such stupidity not even the best intentions of the cast, make-up department or cinematography can change this movie from being a veritable train-wreck that never made it to Yuma."

","I really wanted to like this movie. And I did enjoy the actors (Ben Foster particularly) for trying to make this work. Technically the film is flawed, which contributes to an overall feeling of being unfinished. The music, which is of course subjective, tries to be evocative of the genius Ennio Morricone scores of the Leone westerns. This fails miserably, because it draws attention to how poor the cinematography is. In Leone's spaghetti westerns, you have amazing beautiful landscapes contrasted with extreme closeups. Everyone has character. Everyone is defined. Here we have very short cuts early on destroying any sense of pace, edited poorly and simply framed poorly. Add to that the steadicam shake that is simply distracting for a film shot this much in closeup and you have a film that's cinematography is simply inexcusable for this day and age. In Ford's westerns, the landscape is used to full advantage. Leone's westerns are breathtaking marvels of wide open landscape. To be more modern, Open Range's scenery is absolutely stunning. This could have been shot in a trailer park or a lumber yard. It really can not be overstated how poor the scenery and cinematography is.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>From start to finish the major problem with this movie is the characters. Characters who are ex-military behave as poorly as possible in a gunfight (getting near a campfire in the middle of a gunfight in the dark), people who would never touch guns form mobs to kill lawmen for $200, and we have a prisoner who despite being a remorseless icy killer of dozens of people refuses to escape. Not only does he refuse to escape, but he saves the lives of his CAPTORS, returns to them, and then continues to be a prisoner. He pulls DYNAMITE out to help them all escape conveniently later, and after exchanging recipes for cookies with one of them decides to not only let him singlehanded try to get him on the train, but to virtually carry him to the station. Of course, since you've already abandoned all logic by this point, you may as well have the bad guy kill his entire posse who rescue him. Of course, he may as well get on the train by himself to just go to jail. I have seldom seen so many plot holes, and rarely been as irate upon leaving the theater. Just because there aren't many westerns produced year by year, that doesn't mean anything that is a western gets a pass for being this poor. There are some really good modern westerns that find their own way. I delight in westerns. I own the vast majority of Leone and Eastwood directed westerns and some John Ford ones. I would probably say Lonesome Dove is among the very best. I would in no uncertain terms recommend any of the films I have listed here. If you get the absolute worst of Ford, Leone, Costner, or even Jarmusch you are head and shoulders much better off than seeing this abomination. Oh and a note to the writers: Amputees from the civil war era didn't exactly jump off of roofs and run around all over the place."

Because Russell Crowe's character is inconsistent; you're either a hardened criminal, who kills people without remorse, or you're a criminal with a conscience, which is not the way this character is developed. <br/><br/>However, for some reason, Russell Crowe's character decides to shoot dead his entire gang, including his most loyal gang member who threatened the life of another member who wanted to call it quits in trying to break their leader out of custody. Fair enough, right? Remember when another one of his gang members got caught with his guard down? Russell Crowe's character shot him dead. <br/><br/>If you were for the good guy, played by Christian Bale, then you would have been disappointed, because he was shot dead by the gang, leaving his family behind, and it was all for nothing, as Russell Crowe's character was going to escape in the end anyway, because he admitted he had escaped from Yuma twice before, and his horse ran after the train at the end. <br/><br/>What the hell? Then what? His character would have escaped and found another crew that he could just execute when he felt like it? Maybe he really did grow a conscious at the end there?

Of course this was by a no name reviewer from the Houston Chronicle which should be a dead giveaway as to the content. The film was shot nicely and the acting was OK but they really had weak material to work with. The story was incredibly formulaic as most Hollywood films are. There were innumerable cheesy lines that were insulting to the intelligence that were only there to drive the theme of ""becoming a man and overcoming one's past"" home. Wow! Let's make the bad man (Crowe) look like a human being by showing his sensitive side. Jeez that's never been done before. At least in Unforgiven they did it with originality. What Eastwood did with a look or a sidelong glance took several terrible scenes of Crowe drawing pictures and talking about his mommy leaving him at a train station. Wow, how ironic. It was nice to see Peter Fonda again. He recovered pretty quickly from his gunshot wound though only to be tossed off a ledge by Crowe who was guarded by several inept people. You would think that with the money that the railroad had stolen they would invest more than a mere pittance to do away with their main adversary. But that is how Hollywood works, I suppose. If it drives the story, no matter how unbelievable, then it's in the script. I was drawn to this movie by hearing the scene between Bale and Crowe on NPR where Bale toys with the thought of taking the money and running. It sounded solid but I feel that the only money that was stolen was mine, unfortunately. Well....its a good thing that I love movies and that Peter Fonda is still alive. When I get robbed I don't feel so bad if it was done with some some original style and grace.

Byron McElroy gets gut shot, then is seemingly miraculously cured, able to go along riding his horse and seeking revenge. Amazing. Ben Wade proceeds to hang around town, drinking and having his wicked way with the local beauty, (who as usual has TB,) apparently just waiting for the posse to turn up and catch him at it. Ben Wade, the nemesis of the region, then seems to realise what a rotten person he is and appears to help Dan Evans get him onto the train, as if! Of course, rancher Evans has to die, his son now realising his father is a hero. By the time Mr Crowe decides to shoot all the remaining members of his loyal gang who are attempting to rescue him, I was fast losing the will to live.

Seems like everything was aimed with the idea of promotion than story - the need to make the cold-blooded killer, Crowe, redeemable (well he did read the bible - once), the need to have bloody killings but only of *really* bad guys, (or old and ugly guys), and of course, the need to preserve American family values. The image that a father leaves his son, even if it is a false one justifies any sacrifice, including the betrayal of loyal comrades.<br/><br/>This is not a John Wayne or Audie Murphy Western with good guys and bad guys. This is not a Clint Eastwood Western with basically good guys and bad guys or a Sergio Leone spaghetti Western with romanticized prototypes. No this isn't a Western at all.

"TheRationalist","5","9","15","17 September 2007"," Clichéd and Unrealistic Throughout
","I went to this movie expecting to see a modern western with at least some shreds of realism and creativity, such as I had seen in Eastwood's movie, The Unforgiven and the TV series Lonesome Dove. Unfortunately, that was not the case. 3:10 showed us just about every cliché and unrealistic action scene that abound in old grade B westerns. My suspension of disbelief was zero, I didn't believe a word of this movie. Here are a few examples why: <br/><br/>Gatling gun in stagecoach. An armored stagecoach with a Gatling gun mounted so it's field of fire through a slot traversed about 45 degrees....from any other angle it was blind and useless. So where did the attackers collect? Why in a bunch in front of the gun, of course.<br/><br/>We never shoot horses. What would killers like these guys do to stop and rob a flying stagecoach pulled by a team of six? Don't you think the first thing they would do would be to shoot one of the horses so that dragging the dead horse would screw up the whole team and harness...and if that didn't wreck the flying stagecoach, shoot another one...and if that didn't...you get the idea. But no, these outlaws were too humane to do that, they let the stagecoach keep going...and going...and going...while the Gatling gun and marksmen inside the bouncing stagecoach picked some of them off. I'm a pretty good shot, but I sure wish I could hit a man galloping on horseback under those conditions. Wait a mo...maybe it would be easier to just shoot the horse out from under him...no, can't do that...it wouldn't't be humane, even it might save my life.<br/><br/>The marshal who was gut-shot in an early scene, (and provided us with two nice clichés, the doc was a veterinarian, ha ha, and the tense scene of the forceps picking the slug out of his belly without anesthetic and being dropped...tink...into a pan) was up and ready the next day for a hard ride through the pass to take the prisoner to Bisbee. Some constitution I must say.<br/><br/>When the outlaw who was famous for his ruthless killings and bloody escapes, was brought to the ranch house (plot cliché contrived to make that necessary) the rancher let him eat at his family's dinner table with his wife and impressionable son. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the cliché of the barn burning and the rancher trying to save his horses. This burning was utterly unexplained and unmotivated.<br/><br/>During the dangerous ride through the pass and Indian country, the outlaw gets the jump on the marshal and rancher and ruthlessly kills the marshal. Later, the rancher and his son turn the tables and the rancher gets the gun back. Now, don't you think that as soon as the rancher got his hands on the gun he would have instantly shot the outlaw and taken the quickest way to get himself and his son to safety? But no, he has to risk his son's life and his own to get this guy past the Indians, and past the outlaw's gang who were coming to rescue him, so he could catch a train and go to prison. Spare me.<br/><br/>In the big final scene wherein the rancher brings the outlaw to catch the train, the rancher pulls the outlaw along with him while they run through alleys and over rooftops amidst a storm of gunfire from the outlaw's henchmen...and the outlaw simply runs along with the rancher and even climbs on the roof with him, making no attempt to grab the rancher's gun, or duck away from him or jump off of a building to get to his men...does nothing at all to save himself from life in prison. Totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>And lastly, if you were the outlaw's top henchman, experienced in robbing trains and killing the occupants as related earlier, and your boss was to be taken by train to Yuma and prison, and you had lead the gang into Bisbee to save him...wouldn't't it occur to you to disable the train as soon as it arrived, so no matter what the rancher did he couldn't win, he would just be stuck there in Bisbee, outnumbered twenty to one, till he gave up?<br/><br/>I love good westerns, have lived in the west all my life, know Bisbee and Yuma, Durango, Lordsburg, Tombstone and Las Cruces and all of the places where famous actual outlaws lived...but I just couldn't swallow this movie. Sorry."

","Struggling Arizona rancher and family man near Bisbee, deep in debt and about to be thrown off his land, volunteers to join group of men escorting sharp-shooting, womanizing, Bible-quoting gunslinger to Yuma train station for a fee of $200. Elmore Leonard's short story, the basis for the very fine 1957 western directed by Delmer Daves, has hence become a bloodthirsty yarn filled with psychopathic villains, dead bodies, and a runaway teenager. As the silver-tongued killer, Russell Crowe initially appears to be giving a subtle yet sharply-etched performance--but this portrait degenerates as the film goes on, as does just about everything else here. Director James Mangold leaves no western cliché unturned; by the time we get a surprise attack by gun-toting Apaches (whom, we're told far in advance, ""enjoy killing""), the movie has spread itself too thin, and all evidence of a suspenseful, character-driven western has been negated. Christian Bale as the rancher has one strong scene discussing the family-predicament with his wife. Most of the supporting players get stuck portraying brainless, mangy people--who tend to fit right in with the illogical scenario. *1/2 from ****"

The dynamite in the air shooting scene later in the movie is just as realistic. <br/><br/>The tension is non-existent and the characters are not believable, so it failed to draw me in and that is a fatal flaw in a movie. No magic left, just an empty display of video action running before my eyes. <br/><br/>While the actors performed quite well and the technical aspects of the filming were good, a bad script just makes the rest pointless.

"knowyourmovie","6","6","9","25 October 2012"," A bad western with decent acting and an inferior remake
","The 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" is one of those movies loved by general audience and critics alike. I suspect it would be hard to convince anyone in the opposite – that the 2007 movie is a bad western and an inferior remake, but I will try.<br/><br/>The 2007 remake tries to impress at all costs, but despite (or maybe because) of that it ends up being a shallow disappointment. It is more concerned with being entertaining than with making the story concise and whole. The shocking extremes and the sharp contrasts make the movie showy, but disconnected from reality on many levels – from the questionable plot twists to the impossible in the real world characters.<br/><br/>As a result, instead of a serious, solid western the 2007 remake ends up being a flashy gimmick with a strong artificial aftertaste and a severe lack of insight into human nature. In addition, the 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" is so preoccupied with being witty, original, and shocking that it almost completely leaves humor out of the story<br/><br/>The original 1957 film, on the other hand, features some simple, but tasteful humor, appropriate for a western. It wins us over by genuinely and thoughtfully telling a simple, naturally and smoothly unfolding story. As a result, several important plot elements are better thought- out in the older movie than in its ""younger"" counterpart.<br/><br/>That definitely includes the final confrontation scene that wraps up the 1957 movie very elegantly without any significant damage to the believability. The 2007 version, on the other hand, has a disastrous ending that cancels out most of the groundwork that had been painstakingly laid throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, unlike the original ""3:10 to Yuma"", the 2007 remake focuses more on the action and adventure elements and on the gun battles than on the battle of wits and wills between the ordinary rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and the gang leader Ben Wade (Russell Crowe).<br/><br/>In the 2007 version the characters of Ben Wade and his gang of outlaws are grotesquely overdone to the point of being a caricature, more appropriate for a horror or an action movie than for a western. According to the official movie description, they are ""vicious gang of thieves and murderers"". Ben Wade and his ""outfit"" are portrayed as ultimate villains - extremely disgusting, aggressively inhumane, scary monsters and heartless killing machines, full of horrific cruelty.<br/><br/>As of Ben Wade himself, in the 2007 remake he is portrayed as a confusing mess, an artistic and narcissistic Hamlet with a gun, a puzzling, artificially constructed hybrid of Hannibal Lecter and Prince Charming. This modern Frankenstein's monster, a product (or should I say a by-product?) of the rich imagination of the movie authors, absolutely does not belong to the simple world of American Old West.<br/><br/>He does not have much in common with anyone in the movie, including Dan Evans. Therefore, the unique bond slowly developing between Dan Evans and Ben Wade looks unconvincing and artificial in the 2007 movie. It is hard to believe that being so strikingly different from Dan Evans, Ben Wade suddenly starts to respectfully appreciate something about Dan, and even somewhat envy his humble life. In the key scene in the hotel room Ben Wade unconvincingly tries to negotiate with Dan by employing melodramatic childhood stories as well as a large dose of pseudo- intellectual philosophizing that the authors had recklessly put in his mouth.<br/><br/>In the 1957 version, Ben Wade with his down to earth, very human character is flesh and blood of American Old West. There is no unnecessary complexity or confusing mystery involved. Ben is a confident leader of the gang and definitely not a simpleton. At the same time, unlike his colleague from the remake, he does not show any weirdly peculiar miracles of cleverness and deceitfulness. He is flawed, but not hopeless.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Ben Wade has surprisingly a lot in common with Dan Evans and the rest of the small town folk. Even having gone different life paths, even having made different life choices, they all still remain children of American Frontier. They speak the same language, they are haunted by similar thoughts, and their value systems are more compatible than it seems at first. All of that makes the unlikely bond that develops between Dave Evans and Ben Wade in the original ""3:10 to Yuma"" both plausible and believable.<br/><br/>Ben Wade's arch-rival Dan Evans in the 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" for some reason is portrayed as the ultimate victim and the ultimate loser. He is a victim of the Civil War where he lost his leg, a victim of the bureaucratic indifference of the government, a victim of the hostile, powerful, wealthy neighbor who want so seize Dan's land and sell to the railroad, and even a victim of the weather conditions (drought). In addition, one of Dan's kids is seriously sick.<br/><br/>Unlike the extreme character from the 2007 remake, in the 1957 film Dan is just an ordinary, somewhat conservative and stubborn rancher whose life naturally happens to be hard. He courageously fought in the Civil War and was known as a sharp-shooter. He is loved and respected by his wife and his two healthy kids adore him.<br/><br/>I hope by now you see that the original 1957 ""3:10 to Yuma"" and the relatively recent 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" are two very different animals. Watching both films and then drawing your own conclusions is perhaps the best way to determine the ""winner"".<br/><br/>Here is what I think: the 2007 ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a watchable entertaining show with some good acting by Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, and others. However, those after a true western experience might be far more satisfied by the solid 1957 classic. <br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

This is not a re-enactment of the real west, this is the figment of some overheated Hollywood scriptwriter's imagination, merged with the marketing wing of the whole condemned exercise.<br/><br/>Go ahead. Waste your money. Open Range was a hundred times more real than this travesty, but just pretend that 19th century handguns carried by bad guys always killed the innocent people that got in the way.

If you want clichés, Hollywood distortion of what the real west was like, super-villains that are about one century displaced from Batman, and a thousand other dissonant falsehoods wrapped up in one overheated die-cast saddle drama, you've got it all here.<br/><br/>And it only gets worse. I only give it two stars because for a single viewing it is at least entertaining until you are half an hour or so out of the theater, at least presumably for most folks.<br/><br/>Treating lurid fiction like this fable based upon a Leonard Elmore short story like it is a historically-based true life drama should be treated as a hate crime against both truth and history."

","This western, a remake of a 1957 film, is centred on two men. One is honest rancher, Dan Evans, a man who is in financial trouble and fears losing his ranch and letting down his family. The second is Ben Wade, the leader of a band of gangsters, who is captured after a raid on a stagecoach carrying railway wages. Needing the money, Evans volunteers to be part of the group escorting Wade to the town of Contention where he is to be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma. It won't be an easy journey; they will pass through territory occupied by renegade Apaches and have to face members of Wade's well-armed gang who are determined to set him free.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed the 1957 version of the film I was interested to see how this would compare... I think it compares well. The story might be relatively simple but that doesn't lessen the film. It provides several impressive action set pieces; from the stage coach robbery at the start to the gunfight in Contention as Wade's gang try to stop Evans getting him to the train. Despite the impressive action it often feels character driven as we learn more about Evans and Wade. Both are interesting although Wade is slightly more so as there is a degree of ambiguity about the character... he is an unapologetic villain but can be kind at times. The cast is impressive; particularly Russell Crowe and Cristian Bale who are on great form as Wade and Evans. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoys westerns."

","3:10 to Yuma is a remake of the 1957 western film that stars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale together with Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol.It was the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard's short story of the title that tells a story about a desperado whose accomplices stage an ambush after he is taken into custody by a determined local sheriff.James Mangold directed the remake.<br/><br/>After watching the original film that stars Glenn Ford and Van Heflin,one will definitely notice that there is nothing new added to this remake as it stays true to the conventions and to the story.But what makes it great is the fact that the improvement of the characters and the performances of the cast made it worth watching.An extremely cocky desperado Ben Wade,portrayed excellently by Crowe and a nervous but gritty rancher Dan Evans,played magnificently by Bale made it worth watching.Despite the fact that western films aren't no longer the ""thing"" unlike in the 50's,the added complexities of the two main characters and the entertainment it provides made it worth watching.Credit also should be given to Mangold for his excellent direction as it had an interesting story and the themes on moral complexity was tackled upon effectively.It definitely was an update of Western film just like Unforgiven."
"raymond-massart","Null","2","2","28 August 2011"," Original is better
","Are remakes always better than the original? Certainly not I'm sorry to say and this is particularly true for 3.10 to Yuma. First of all, I must agree with other reviews on this site that have pointed out the far-fetched contents of the plot; particularly those relating to the personality structure of Ben Wade. The bad guy with the not-so-bad human touch does not work, as so many examples in former reviews have amply illustrated. Wade remains a cold-blooded murderer and deserves no sympathy on the part of the viewer. The shoot-out at the end of the film as a final climax even borders on the comical as it totally unacceptable that in order to give the plot a sort of Greek drama content, the leader of the pack turns on the gang that set out to rescue him. Russel Crowe does his best to to portray Wade's supposedly split personality but can't compete with Glenn Ford whose natural charm contrasted perfectly with his role as a villain. Christian Bale is a brilliant actor but his physique and strong features stand in the way of his portrayal of a rather weak character. Here again the hesitant Van Heflin in the original cast was more convincing. On the whole the first version of this movie was more slow-paced, less complicated and although even then one had doubts as to the credibility of the story, much more convincing."

"classicsoncall","10","14","27","12 September 2007"," ""You done it Pa, you done it...""
","Utilizing the core story from the 1957 movie of the same name, James Mangold crafts a masterfully tense psychological Western that convinces this viewer that the genre isn't dead by a long shot. ""3:10 To Yuma"" is one of those rare re-makes that surpasses the original by building on the themes presented there, while adding finely crafted layers to the story that help define it's characters, offering a glimpse inside the minds of the film's main protagonists. Those who dismiss the movie because of it's ending fail to consider what happened along the way, as events that occur and dialog among the characters offer many clues to Ben Wade's (Russell Crowe) 'sudden' turn at the story's climax.<br/><br/>Where the film differs substantially from the Glenn Ford/Van Heflin version is in it's intensity, not merely for the gun battles and action scenes in the remake, but in the way outlaw Wade and rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) employ a battle of wills to counter their respective foes. By comparison, the 1957 film is almost entirely laid back, with Wade's outlaw gang occupying a largely secondary position in the story. The addition of Evans' son Will (Logan Lerman) to the core story proves important in developing the senior Evans' obsessive resolve in proving his worth to himself and his family. Even when offered a fully reasonable way out from his mission, Evans sees it as his duty to respect himself first, and use that opportunity to teach his son a life lesson.<br/><br/>For me, the turning point in the movie occurred when Dan Evans saves Wade from certain death at the coolie camp. Even though son Will later saw it merely as payback for Wade's role during the Apache ambush, something even more fundamental was going on with the outlaw's understanding of what makes his bodyguard tick. You catch a hint of it at the hotel room as Wade attempts to engage Evans in further conversation - ""You mean we're still not friends?"" By the time Will implores Wade to hold back his men, you have a genuine sense that events are conspiring to force Wade to see this rancher in a new light. As Wade declines and asks why - Will: ""Because you're not all bad"". Wade: ""Yes I am"". But by this point, he's not.<br/><br/>For those needing further insight into Wade's actions at the end of the story, I would refer to an early scene in the picture when Ben Wade killed one of his young outlaws when he failed to do a thorough job of inspecting the robbed payroll coach - ""Tommy was weak, Tommy was stupid, Tommy's dead"". Tommy, I might add, also didn't follow his boss's orders. Therein lies the motivation for Wade's intemperate dismissal of Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) at the finale - Charlie didn't follow orders. He was told to stop shooting by Wade, and he didn't listen. I would still suggest strongly that Wade's admiration for Evans was more of a factor, but Charlie didn't help his own cause.<br/><br/>Speaking of Foster, his was an excellent characterization of Wade's second in command, on the order of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, or Keith Richards' Keith Richards. I also enjoyed Peter Fonda's interpretation of the Pinkerton bounty hunter, Byron McElroy. He seems to have aged nicely into a role suggestive of his late father, Henry Fonda, and all those great Westerns he appeared in. I also want to throw in a comment on the musical score as events headed to a showdown at Contention, highly reminiscent of, and sounding like an homage to the great spaghetti Westerns of the 1970's. I think Ennio Morricone would agree.<br/><br/>For those still in doubt about the ending, thinking it just too difficult to consider Ben Wade siding with Dan Evans, perhaps I can counter with a plot point I found to be hard to imagine. How would a career outlaw be able to quote so many passages from the Bible after a single reading over three days? That my friends, is truly unbelievable."

I can't imagine the other comments giving it such high stars unless they're as lamebrain as this movie was. I guess perhaps from a cinema field of work, this movie could be viewed as fine performances, but they certainly were wasted. I mused that even Crowe had a hard time packing away his paycheck with the delivery of some lame lines as well as receiving same. The storyline, as in the original, is sound, but what was done in this one, the industry should be ashamed. I lost count of how many people were killed and how many guns (endless supply of bullets) were around. In one scene, they're traversing through non-friendly Indian country to take a short cut, and maybe my brain drifted, but I didn't see any Indians ... just gunfire. At that point in the movie I was actually hoping to see the Indians and finish everyone off! I think what disturbed me the most about this movie was how evil Crowe's character was, but yet they added a twist to glamorize him and his horse instead of the hero. This movie was, also, very long. The killing scenes were even too much for my friend sitting next to me and both of us turned away ... which I would say here to turn away from this movie and keep your money in your wallet.

And, with some reservations, let's try and allow for an Apache night raid (not terribly historically accurate, according to most sources) by Indians who look more Sioux than Apache (feathers in their hair? this is a plains Indian thing, Mr Mangold.) <br/><br/>But what's utterly unacceptable is a line like ""Because you're not all bad!"" What's utterly unacceptable is the most dangerous killer alive getting guilted into putting himself at great risk of multiple GSWs, just so some gimpy rancher can look good in his kid's eyes. What's utterly unacceptable is James Mangold, who apparently knows what he knows about the Old West exclusively from watching (not very closely) some late-century movies, wasting two fine actors on this dumb circus. And as far as the extensive visual quotes from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" - buddy, if you're gonna quote a Western, may I suggest that that ain't the one.<br/><br/>However, Crowe killing his whole gang in about one second is very cool, as is the throwing of Peter Fonda off a cliff. The single appropriate use of this Fonda in a movie is as a ridiculous parody of himself in ""The Limey.""<br/><br/>To all the benighted souls who hail this as ""the greatest Western since Unforgiven"": check out ""The Proposition.""

He's witness as a dangerous gang (Ben Foster, among others) led by notorious gunfighter named Ben Wade ( Russell Crowe in the character of Glenn Ford) attacks a stagecoach and killing the passengers. Later Ben separates from his band and he goes to a Saloon where meet with gorgeous Emma (Vinessa Shaw). But the sheriff immediately surrounds the parlour and captures Ben. Railroad official(Dallas Roberts) asks for paid volunteers to join a posse to transport Ben Wade towards Yuma and Dan accepts. Other volunteers who unite posse are Doc Potter( Alan Tudyk), Tucker (Kevin Durand) and a veteran(Peter Fonda). After that and numerous dangers Dan Evans must hole up in a Motel while waiting for the train to take them to Yuma prison and overcome the murderer's several ploys to gain his freedom.<br/><br/>Good modern Western with exciting battle of wits between an obstinate farmer and an astute killer who begins to psych him out. Stylish, fast paced , solid, meticulous and violent look with several shootouts. This well acted movie is gripping every step of the way and recalls the classic directed by Delmer Daves though contains various changes, as excessive violence and a little bit overlong because the runtime first version is only 92 minutes. Based on a short story by Elmore Leonard. He's a veteran novelist and screenwriter , specialist on noir plot and Western and working from ¨Tall T¨, ¨Hombre¨, continuing with ¨Rosemary murders¨, ¨Get shorty¨, ¨Jackie Brown¨ until nowadays. Colorful and evocative cinematography by Papamichael. Memorable musical score fitting rightly to action Western by Marco Beltrani.

Actors like Crowe and Bale will try what they can to rescue some of the film's blatant simplicities, but are given a script with far too little detail to make any true characteristic impressions with roles that both should have provided more depth.

","Well, I have never seen the original version of this film, but I trust it was more convincing than this. As a true western lover, I may have had expectations that were too high, but this movie didn't manage to win me over. The action is very well done, particularly the early stage robbery, and the characters are initially good, though Crowe's scripture-spouting evil superman-like outlaw leader never really rang true for me. This started out as a mild, nagging irritant that grew as the story unfolded. Crowe and Bale's performances are very good, and Ben Foster is good as 'Hand of God' (Great name) gunslinger, Charlie Prince, though his character is never developed beyond the superficial level. The story starts out strong but gradually lost me until its ending turned ludicrous and had me looking around to see the reaction of the rest of the crowd, but they appeared to be surprisingly engrossed in the silliness on screen.<br/><br/>The story is about two men, the first of whom is Dan Evans (Christian Bale), whose ranch is being strangled by a greedy businessman. the second is an arrogant outlaw leader named Ben Wade, who Evans sees leading an attack on a heavily armed stagecoach. Shortly, the stunningly reckless Wade is easily captured. A plan is hatched to move him to a nearby railroad town and send him to Yuma Penitentiary, but Wade's gang presents a problem. Evans offers to join the transporting posse, in return for much-needed cash and the story is set. Some kind of Old West-style Stockholm Syndrome sets in and the rest....well, i don't want to blow the rest, but be careful not to give it any sort of thought.<br/><br/>There is some excellent, and original (particularly impressive in this genre) action and this backed up by some interesting characters, but Crowe's characters' actions are so far-fetched, that the whole story collapses and will likely leave all, but the action crowd unsatisfied.<br/><br/>This work was first published on realmoviereview.com"

It felt as if his life was more important that any other nice person or even all of them combined. There was no such progress in the screenplay as to why Ben would connect on an emotional level with Dan all of a sudden (just because the movie is drawing to a close) , and in the end he kills all his gang members including Charlie who was in his side and has traveled from far just to rescue him, no questions asked.

"rmax304823","5","3","4","19 June 2009"," Remake
","There are so many remakes and imitations on the screen these days that I'm tempted to borrow a line from a thirty-year-old movie myself and remark that if the MBAs who greenlight these projects had an original thought it would die of loneliness.<br/><br/>The original was a modest black-and-white Western of relatively low budget and a more or less satisfying 1950s ending. The poor rancher (Van Heflin then, Christian Bale now) gets to successfully deliver his carefree prisoner (Glen Ford then, Russell Crowe now) to the train on time and collects the money that will save his ranch.<br/><br/>This rifacimento isn't badly done but it's gargantuan by comparison. It's updated. Currently, the word ""updated"" can only mean more brutal, sexier, bloodier, sadistic, muddier, dirtier, and characterized by filthier language. All the modern conventions are adhered to.<br/><br/>Gone are the familiar studio back lots. Gone are the sunny days of dusty streets at the imitation ranches outside of Los Angeles. This was shot in northern New Mexico in the winter and it looks it. Everyone seems cold, dirty, and grim.<br/><br/>Again, that's not necessarily bad news. The historic Old West, though probably nothing much like this, probably resembled the remake more than the original.<br/><br/>But, unpretentious as the original was, I think I prefer it. There was only one deliberate murder in the original, and a fairly gruesome one. A hapless helper is hanged by the neck in the hotel lobby. We don't see the lynching but the image of the abject body is startling. This one has multiple killings -- more than I could count, since I have only ten fingers, not counting the extra pinky, and can no longer reach my toes. Russell Crowe is a convincing enough chief heavy but lacks the fake charm that allows Glen Ford to talk barmaid Felicia Farr into bed.<br/><br/>Crowe has only to say a few words to Farr's replacement, Vinessa Shaw, before the cut to the bedroom scene, giving the viewer a chance to ogle her nude body, which, as a matter of fact, is worth an ogle or two.<br/><br/>Ford kills nobody but here Crowe murders two of his captives. In one case he creeps up on a sleeping figure and stabs him in the chest with a stolen fork -- whap whap whap whap. It's kind of disgusting. It projects the sense that the producers were pandering to an audience of violence-hungry kids who must have their periodic fix. The original was all tension. This one is tense enough, but the bloodletting seems designed to make us sigh with relief. At last, some gore after all that talk.<br/><br/>The original ended with Heflin getting Ford on the 3:10 to Yuma Territorial Prison (which is still there and can be visited). A Hollywood ending, one might say. This one finishes with the rancher being plugged full of holes by one of Crowe's gang, then dying in the arms of his teenaged son. Looking down at Bale's dying body, Crowe has a ludicrous epiphany, draws his gun, whirls around, and instantly kills off the gang that has just saved him from the rope, one by one. Unlike the original, the remake must end, as it started, with a cascade of gore. Then Crowe turns the whole movie into self parody by jumping aboard the train to Yuma and climbing into the barred cell. There has never been a hint of remorse in his attitude before, nothing but deadpan stoicism, so this comes as a complete surprise. Yet, although the climax must be bloody, the producers don't want the bad guy to go free, so at least a part of the old Hollywood ending is retained after all -- even if it must be forced onto the narrative like a one-size-fits-all sock that doesn't fit.<br/><br/>What will they come up with next? How about Roy Rogers' ""Son of Trigger,"" only with Keanu Reeves, and this time we kill Trigger and then eat him. It will probably make a nickel or two. Is the portfolio of Hollywood's ideas completely bankrupt? It's a legitimate question."

","3:10 to Yuma is an awful film. Something that I cannot believe the likes of Crowe / Bale / Mangold ever got involved in. I mean - did they even read the script beforehand? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The amount of unbelievable situations this flick throws up is ....how can I say it? Unbelievable!!!! <br/><br/>Here's just a quick flavour of what's wrong in this picture: - Peter Fonda's character gets gut shot at point blank range, carried into town on a horse, operated on by a vet and still leads a posse to track Crowe the very next day. Or it could even have been the same day !! - Crowe is a master criminal- so smart he's robbed the railroad umpteen times but instead of heading to Mexico with his gang he waits around for the Marshall's to capture him - even having a drink with Bale as he waits. - Bale got his foot blown off in the Civil War and hobbles most of the time - yet is able to run and jump in the dramatic conclusion like Usain Bolt. - Crowe is supposed to be a psycho yet runs with Bale trying to avoid his own men from setting him free. He must have had a 1000 chances to run the other way and escape.<br/><br/>I cannot go on as I would literally bust the 1000 word review limit on IMDb just simply pointing out the ridiculous premise of this movie. No wonder Cruise turned it down. He probably thought it was a joke. He was right.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good - Crowe is quiet and simmering even though he has an unplayable part in my view. His character simply has no logic to him. Bale is brooding and excellent as always - but again, his character makes some decisions that cannot be explained. Idiotic is too kind a word. Foster is eating the scenery as usual - but also good in his over the top way. The direction is OK, cinematography fine. It's just the story line, premise, screenplay that literally makes no sense scene after scene, page after page until the end that has to be watched to be disbelieved.

I don't even think the acting was as great as some of you are saying. It was OK but nothing great because the characters have no depth at all. This movie is no up there with Scarface on the list of most over hyped, over rated movies of all time. Don't even waste your money to rent it... If you want to see a great western check out Tombstone trust me."

"NavyOrion","4","9","18","27 September 2007"," Just OK
","Although beautifully filmed, and with capable performances by Christian Bale and Russel Crowe (I agree with the reviewer who compared Bale to Gregory Peck), this movie just doesn't live up to its hype.<br/><br/>I'm willing to overlook a few plot holes and unexpected twists; after all, a story with no surprises is no story, just information. But there's a certain level of credibility beyond which I can't go. You want to have a character survive being shot? Fine, but don't gut-shoot grizzled old Peter Fonda and then have him riding a horse the next day (on what even the characters described as a ""hard ride"".) Don't have the group reluctantly decide that they must try to sneak through Indian territory, but then build a roaring fire that reveals their position.<br/><br/>I'll even go along with the murderer's being unwilling to kill a protagonist he has come to grudgingly admire, but just because the guards on the prison train were nice enough to let him get off for a minute to say ""hi"" to his gang, I can't believe he would then GET BACK ON (even if Trigger the Wonder Horse is just waiting for a whistle to come follow.) For that matter, what was there for Crowe to find so admirable in Bale's character? How hard is it to guard a prisoner who will gladly follow you in running and jumping across rooftops, to catch a train that will take him to be hanged? Maybe he just wanted to be there to help out in case Bale's character remembered he has a wooden leg and shouldn't be able to run or jump across rooftops.<br/><br/>By the way, note to Ben Foster, who played the evil-but-loyal sidekick Charlie Prince: tone it down a notch. Every time he came on the screen, I felt like I was watching Mark Rolston's ""bull queer"" character from ""Shawshank Redemption"". It's a shame that in a movie where the director was trying so desperately to make everyone ""multifaceted"" (to the point of unbelievability) that Prince would come off as so unremittingly evil in EVERY scene in which he appeared.<br/><br/>I can't believe that people are comparing this mediocrity to the great old westerns, or to great modern ones (""Unforgiven"", for example.) Maybe they're so hungry for the genre that anything with a guy on a horse looks good. After all, this is the finest western to come from a major studio in years. It's just a shame that that doesn't say very much."

","(mild spoiler) This film had great cinematography and fine acting. The bare story had great promise which is a rancher trying to get a slick outlaw to the train to prison with a gang of outlaws hunting them. The film starts great with a stagecoach robbery with Gatling gun verses outlaws. Unfortunately, the film turns to soap opera. We must endure scene after scene listening to motivations and psychological analysis. This film must have been written by doctors or social workers.<br/><br/>The wife and family are a very unfriendly bunch to the father. He is blamed for not making enough money and a missing leg. With friends like these you don't need enemies. All the characters turn out to be no so good. Even the hero father seems to be saying he is just trying to set an example for his son or even just trying to impress his family. He ultimately blames the US government for his problems with his old war wounds. Even the actions of the boy made no sense near the end. This was in a sense an anti war western,<br/><br/>So much of the violence is gratuitous with graphic for the sake of graphic. Unlike Apocolypto or 300, there is absolutely no reason for the graphic closeups other than to say the world is brutal. Why some viewers believe redemption in any film is out of place is beyond me. This film has little of any point. Change and twisted new ideas just to be different does not improve film. This movie is better if you don't listen too closely. This film had potential but fails."

Everything from the acting to the cinematography, to the score were superb. Many, many, accolades to both Christain Bale and Russell Crowe, both did an outstanding job playing opposite each other. Also, my hats off to Peter Fonda as well for playing a righteously despicable bounty hunter. 3:10 is a perfect rendition of an old western short story, that's brought into the modern age by it's amazing ability to capture the imagery and setting of the 'old west' time period. The shots and the quality of the film create an aesthetic this genre's predecessors from the 1950's and 60's were not able to capture. This element helps the audience to more realistically than ever be able to pit themselves in the untamed west, see the sunsets, feel the snow and the cold, taste the dirt, and smell the gun powder.

"pushnlacs","9","18","44","2 September 2007"," That ending!!!!!!! (NO SPOILERS)
","At first I was thinking that it might not be as good as I was hoping for. The opening scene contained way to many close ups for my taste as well, but by the time the end credits rolled I was thinking it was even better than I had expected.<br/><br/>If you've seen the original, things are pretty much the same except this one is a bit more violent and darker overall, and lets just say the ending isn't the same lol<br/><br/>But what a ending it is!<br/><br/>There's good performances all around, though I'm not sure Ben Foster(is that his name) is as good as a lot of the reviews are claiming. Or maybe its just that he didn't play the part like I pictured it from the reviews. I pictured a crazed quick talking madman but instead got a slow soft spoken killer. He's still very good though.<br/><br/>Crowe was good as well but I have to be honest he's never been an actor that blows me away, I like him and he's given some great performances which this is one of but his name alone for one reason or another doesn't make me want to see a movie. AFter this one it might though.<br/><br/>Like I said he does a great job, I actually Think he was pretty bad-ass, Still I think Bale gives the best performance of the film. I used to think Bale wasn't a very good actor but that has changed(long before this film). He ma not give the coolest performance of have the coolest part, but it's the best performance acting wise IMO, it's subtle and doesn't draw attention to it self yet you can feel what he's feeling. You Cant ask for much more than that. Then again you can't ask for much better acting all around including the smaller roles like Fonda for instance.<br/><br/>In terms of camera work and the cinematography, I have to say there's nothing that really stands out. The Browns and grays of the old west look fine but there's nothing that really catches you. Same goes for the camera work, the film is shot very simply. Im not taking anything away from the film because of these facts though. For what it is the cinematography and camera works just fine.<br/><br/>Its honestly the ending that makes this film though. It would still be a really good film without it but the ending makes it a great film."

"bkoganbing","8","8","17","7 September 2007"," How I Miss Frankie Laine
","It seems as though back in the fifties every other western seemed to have Frankie Laine singing the theme song. The 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma is one of my favorite westerns. Part of the reason is that theme which echoed through out the film. <br/><br/>What I liked about 3:10 to Yuma is that the hero/protagonist is an ordinary man trying to support his wife and two sons through some very hard times. When a killer is caught and because he needs the money he agrees to help transport him to Yuma State Prison on the 3:10 train from Contention. A lot happens between the capture and the boarding of that fateful train.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Christian Bale make admirable updated substitutes for Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. Though Ford's performance as the sly rogue of a gunman is good, the previous film was driven by what I always considered Van Heflin's greatest screen role. <br/><br/>The original holdup was hardly the violent affair that this one was. Only one shot was fired and that was by Ford when the shotgun guard momentarily overpowered one of the gang. That's here too, but the holdup itself was taken from The War Wagon.<br/><br/>One part was totally eliminated and that was the part of the town drunk, played by Henry Jones in the original version, who was the only other man to volunteer his services. Jones was killed in a gut wrenching scene then, but in fact my favorite scene from the original was when Heflin's wife Leora Dana pleads with him to let Ford go, he responds with a heartfelt speech about how he couldn't look himself in the face after the sacrifice the town drunk made. I've seen the 1957 version dozens of times and am never failed to be moved by that scene.<br/><br/>In its place the part of the oldest son is built up and conversely the wife's part is cut down. Young Logan Lerman plays the older son who tags along after the group taking Crowe to Contention. Lerman is 14 and he and Bale have the usual father/son issues. Lerman feels his Dad to be a failure with things going so wrong against them. Bale and he bond during the shared experience and you know no matter what the outcome of things, he'll leave a good legacy for his children.<br/><br/>The usual tension between Bale and Crowe is present as it was in the original when Ford kept trying to bribe Heflin. Added to this is a whole lot of violence, most of it started by Ben Foster who's part as the young punk outlaw in the original was played by Richard Jaeckel. Foster is one murderous thug in this film, only Crowe is able to keep him somewhat in line. <br/><br/>The characterization is still there, the violence is expected in this day and age even though a lot of it is gratuitous. This version of 3:10 to Yuma is fine, but it can never take the place of the original in my affections.<br/><br/>This review is dedicated to young Harve Stewart of Stephenville, Texas and one of the Professional Bull Riders best young stars. I saw an interview with him where he mentions this is a film he likes. I liked it too, but I would commend him to watch the original 3:10 To Yuma which is just one of the best western dramas ever made. It was out in 1957 and I was 10 years old at the time. I'm old enough to be Harve's grandfather and I'm sure back in the day 3:10 To Yuma was enjoyed by his real grandparents in the theater."
"Buddy-51","7","9","20","15 September 2007"," flawed but generally compelling Western drama
","Set in the years immediately following the Civil War, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a rip-snortin', old-fashioned Western whose characterizations and performances compensate for an occasionally muddled plot line and a tendency towards implausibility.<br/><br/>Christian Bale stars as Dan Evans, a struggling rancher who, for a $200 fee, agrees to help escort a cold-blooded killer to the train that will take him to prison in Yuma, Arizona (at that time a territory, not a state). Russell Crowe is Ben Wade, the gang-leading outlaw whose very name strikes terror in the hearts of the local populace. Based on the short story by Elmore Leonard ( as well as the 1957 movie derived therefrom), ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a thoughtful Western drama that nicely balances its requisite shootouts and tough-guy posturing with just enough psychological insight to make the whole thing interesting and worthwhile.<br/><br/>The two stars bring a great deal of intelligence and conviction to the roles they've been assigned to play. Bale's reticent stoicism is placed in direct opposition to Crowe's world weary cynicism and outward charm - and the match-up is a good one. The men they are portraying may have an entirely different view of morality and of what it takes to be a man, but they are still able to establish a genuine, if somewhat shaky, rapport on the common ground of mutual respect and understanding. The climax of the story may feel a trifle contrived and artificial - we really don't believe that Wade would do what he does at the end - but it isn't enough to spoil the overall effectiveness of the film.<br/><br/>James Mangold (""Cop Land, ""Walk the Line"") has directed the movie with sufficient gusto and energy to counteract some of the verbosity of the screenplay. Fortunately, the dialogue generally avoids platitudes and clichés - although the action itself is frequently confusing and often geographically inconsistent (i.e. characters who don't have horses seem to arrive at destinations almost as quickly as those who do).<br/><br/>In addition to Bale and Crowe, Mangold has elicited excellent performances from Ben Foster as Wade's wiry but creepily bloodthirsty henchman, Charlie; Logan Lerman as Evans' too-big-for-his-britches older son, William; and screen legend Peter Fonda as the hard-bitten bounty hunter, Byron McElroy, who may finally have met his match in the wily Mr. Wade.<br/><br/>On a final sour note, the cinematography by Phedon Papamichael is surprisingly dull, muddy and lifeless, an especial disappointment considering the gorgeous Southwestern landscape with which he was given to work.<br/><br/>All in all, however, a very fine Western."
"TomMurphreyEsq","8","10","23","3 September 2007"," Magnetically Wicked
","Crowe's portrayal of the wicked protagonist Ben Wade intrigues the viewer with the intensity of his evil deeds, the provocativeness of his philosophical musings, and later in the film, with some glimmering traces of human compassion and justice. Christian Bale gives a gritty and sympathetic performance as always. It should surprise no one to see Crowe get another nomination for best actor for this Brando-level performance that brings to mind the likes of ""One-Eyed Jacks"" and ""The Appaloosa"". You see some interesting themes such as Ben Wade's sexist views of women and the Father-son conflicts of Christian Bale and his 14 year old son for whom he yearns to win back respect and dignity. But, ultimately the film is about atonement --- about men who fail miserably in life yet are given one last chance to atone."

Crowe and Bale make the film which would otherwise be set aside as just another western in an era where they have not been so popular.<br/><br/>Crowe plays the gang leader with sympathy, as a lover, artist, Bible quoter who tries to keep the other psychos in line. Bale is so believable as the scrappy war-injured rancher and family man.<br/><br/>I wish that the ending would have been a little different, or more positive for the poor family man just trying to do the right thing.

","3:10 to Yuma is directed by James Mangold and co-adapted to screenplay by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. A remake of Delmer Daves' 1957 film of the same name, it's based on a story written by Elmore Leonard. It stars Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Peter Fonda, Ben Foster and Logan Lerman. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Phedon Papamichael.<br/><br/>After the capture of notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe), a posse is put together to escort him to the town of Contention from where he will be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Joining this posse is broke rancher Dan Evans (Bale), disabled in the Civil War, Dan is struggling to keep hold of his land and to support his family. Seen as a flop in the eyes of his eldest son William (Lerman), Dan sees this opportunity as a way out of his problems. But with Wade an intelligent foe, and the outlaw boss' gang on their trail, Evans and the posse will do well to make it to Contention alive...<br/><br/>Daves' original film is a fine effort, very much pulsing with psychological beats and cloaked in claustrophobic atmospherics. Backed up by two excellent Western performers in Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, there is many a Western fan who cherish it and never felt it was a genre piece ripe for a remake; myself included. But the logic behind the reasons Mangold and his team put forward for remaking it made sense. A story of great thematics for the adults, and action a go-go for the younger modern film fan. Thus putting a Western back in the headlines at yet another time when the genre was gasping for air. All that was left to do was get two of the modern era's biggest stars to play Wade and Evans - which of course they duly did - and it was good to go. Just don't mess it up was all that was asked of the makers.<br/><br/>Running at nearly half an hour longer than the original, Mangold's movie slots in a new mid-section and changes the ending. The former works a treat as the posse venture through hostile Apache country, meet some ne'er-do-well railroad ruffians, while Wade's gang, led by the supremely fiendish Charlie Prince (Foster), are on the bloody trail. The latter is a huge misstep, both in execution and character development. Most film fans are happy to suspend disbelief in the name of good entertainment, but here we are asked to ignore some impossible athletics while also being asked to swallow a character turn around that beggars belief. Such a shame because up till then the blend of traditional Western character themes such as morality and redemption had dovetailed nicely with the pistol banging and all round breezy action construction. While the father and son axis also gives the narrative some extra bite.<br/><br/>Even bad guys love their mothers.<br/><br/>The performances are also of a high standard. In the support slots Fonda, Foster and Lerman are top dollar. Fonda is all leather faced and gruff as bounty hunter McElroy, Foster does a quality line in sneering villainy, and Lerman, in a tricky role, utterly convinces as the conflicted boy breaking out into a man. But this is Crowe and Bale's movie. Crowe has Wade as an intelligent dandy, a man who loves and understands women, an artist who also has a tongue as quick as his hands are on his guns. We know that Wade is callous, but Crowe ensures that we never know what is around the corner or truly on his mind. Bale puts much dignity into Evans, he's a put upon man, tortured by his failings on the home front, but there is stoic nobility there and as he and Wade venture further on their journey, a grudging respect begins to form and Bale and Crowe really start to put credibility into their characters. And then that last quarter nearly undoes all their excellent work...<br/><br/>In spite of this, 3:10 to Yuma is a good time to be had as a modern Western production with old traditional values. Energetic and never dull from first frame to last, it's recommended on proviso you don't mind unscrewing your head and taking out your brain for the last 15 minutes. 7.5/10"

","I grew up on westerns and have been a fan of the genre since childhood. This remake is well acted, but the ending is completely different than the original movie's. <br/><br/>The essence of the western is the triumph of good over evil. In this remake, the person who walks away is the psychopathic outlaw, Wade, while the rancher, Evans, is killed. In the original, the rancher survives to return to his family. <br/><br/>Once Wade starts helping Evans get Wade to the train, why doesn't he call out to his gang to stop firing - especially since he tells Evans that he has already been to the prison in Yuma twice and escaped both times?<br/><br/>Although Evans starts the trip with Wade for the money, it is obvious that he is ending it to earn his son's respect. He certainly does that, but the ending does not require that he die.<br/><br/>I suppose that the change in ending was made to accommodate our current cynical popular culture. If so, that is the right of the screenwriter and director. However, the movie as remade in 2007 isn't ""3:10 to Yuma"". Perhaps they should rename it ""4:29 to Tucson"" or whatever. <br/><br/>If you want to see a outstanding modern western that is truer to the western genre, try ""Open Range""."

Its what happens here.<br/><br/>Crowe plays a typical outlaw: so bad he's a pure fit for the archetype and therefore good. He's so opposed to the law of the land that he strictly follows the law of the genre, which in this case is the law of the medium. He's placed himself in a situation where he can reinforce his own story. Its why he lives.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, he encounters a farmer who we have gone to great lengths to understand that he is without story. Moreover, his teen son is engaged as his designated watcher, and we learn that the son believes there is no story there. What to do? Well, we have to have the bad guy, who owns the story by having mastered it, write the story for the farmer.<br/><br/>Its an amazingly simple construction, but apt for the genre.<br/><br/>I imagine it is delivered well enough.

While I understand that Ben Wade had come to respect Dan Evans a great deal, it still made no sense for him to then murder his own men for saving his life by killing Dan. Just too far fetched! I saw the remake two nights ago and the original last night. While there is much I liked and admired in the remake, as I said, I thought the ending made very little sense. I was very curious to see how the original ended...as it turns out it was COMPLETELY different and to my mind much better and more logical.<br/><br/>In the original, Dan does not get shot, so of course Ben Wade does not shoot his own men (totally nonsensical in the remake!). BOTH men jump on the train and escape the ambush by Wade's men. When Dan asks Wade why he not only saved him but got on the train to the prison with him, Wade said that he didn't like owing anything to anybody. Dan had saved his life (earlier in the original film) and so now they were even...besides ""I've escaped from Yuma prison before anyway!""

"DICK STEEL","10","4","7","12 January 2008"," A Nutshell Review: 3:10 to Yuma
","It's been a long wait for the remake of 3:10 to Yuma to finally reach our cinemas. In fact, the Code 1 DVD is already out, and I thought it was probably missed opportunity if there are interested folks out there who decide to get the DVD instead of catching it on the big screen. I do not understand why the need for the delay, contrary to the belief that it is a Western movie which might be an unpopular genre to go into, and of course, I can only recall a handful which made it to cinemas here in recent times - Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven, Tombstone and Wyatt Earp - the last 2 being movies about the legendary lawman and the shootout at OK Corral.<br/><br/>Some 50 years ago, audiences were introduced to the duo of impoverished rancher Dan Evans (then played by Van Heflin) and the number one outlaw of the land, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). As the story goes, Evans has to feed a family and the poor harvest and weather aren't doing him any favours. As Wade gets captured, volunteers are immediately called for to escort him to the town of Contention, to put him onboard the 3:10 train to Yuma jail, hence the title. Two powerful actors have now taken over the mantle of the 2 rivals, namely Russell Crowe (who's having a comeback of sorts to our screens with the recently released American Gangster), and Christian Bale in respective roles. And unlike American Gangster which had again 2 high profile actors sharing top billing, Bale and Crowe share a lot of screen time together, thus boosting the appeal of the remake.<br/><br/>Even for those who have seen the original, I am glad to say that on the whole, this version ranks far superior than the original version. The earlier version, being made half century ago, will definitely need a decent update for modern audiences, and that aspect did not disappoint, with more in-depth character development, and exciting shootouts. However, in my opinion, the ending of the original packed far more a punch that this one, given that the ending in the 2007 version is likely to be more in line with stories these days - the cynical, non-saccharine sweet ending.<br/><br/>If it followed the original closely, then most audiences would have found it trying as most of the movie took place in a hotel room where the duo are waiting for the awaited time to make a run for the train station. Here, director James Mangold and scribes Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas decided to boost the middle section with a detour to Apache land and encountering railroad builders (check out Luke Wilson!), presenting again more threats to the group escorting Ben Wade. Also, Ben Wade is presented in a more menacing manner, constantly probing the group and looking for opportunities to make his escape, rather than the rather subdued original which didn't exhibit any notion of danger. What I also found to be a leg up, was the swapping of importance between Evan's wife Alice (Gretchen Mol) and his son William (Logan Lerman), which eliminated a rather awkward moment in the original where Alice paid Dan a visit whilst holed up in the hotel room. The structure and development otherwise remained about the same, and even some lines from the classic were reused in this remake, in particular in the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>Character wise, you can't get any more better than having Crowe and Bale flesh out their characters and giving both a sense of angst, who on a better day, could probably have been good friends. You follow them as the duo gain newfound respect for each other, and the longer running time provided ample chances for the audience to find reason to connect, and understand the characters at a deeper level. Ben Wade was given time to show that he isn't all bad, despite what he tells others and from what he had done to gain his notorious reputation, and in Dan Evans, he finds the kind of life that he yearns for - beautiful wife and family, with sons who look up to the dad - but will probably never get, unless you count the mercenary hoodlums as family (Ben Foster in a truly badass role). And from Evans, learning his true motivations for this suicidal job, could have made any grownup feel sorry, while he exhibits his admirable work ethics in the face of temptation, to just get the job done, to put food on the table for his family, and teaching his sons as well that it's not the size, calibre or speed of the gun that matters, but principles.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma deserves to be watched on the big screen, and given limited screenings and the crowding of movies this month, do make time for it. It's a perfect balance for those looking for mean gunfights, and powerful drama, and this remake delivers it all where it should matter - adopting the best bits in the original, and plugging the gaps when those portions falter. Highly recommended, even if you're not a fan of the Western genre!"
"JamesHitchcock","7","4","7","26 September 2007"," It could have been a classic Western, but I left the cinema feeling cheated
","The semi-revival of the Western continues apace. (I say ""semi-revival"" because, although the genre is now doing better than during its nadir in the eighties, it seems unlikely that it will ever again occupy the central place in popular culture that it held during its heyday in the forties, fifties and sixties). I remember recently reading an article in which a critic expressed the view that the Western could not be revived because there were no younger actors who could convincingly play the heroic roles once taken by the likes of John Wayne, Kirk Douglas and Clint Eastwood. My reaction was to disagree, and the first two names I thought of as potential modern Westerners were Russell Crowe and Brad Pitt. This film proves that I was right about Crowe; I look forward to Pitt's ""The Assassination of Jesse James"". <br/><br/>Although I have never seen the original 1957 version of ""3.10 to Yuma"", it was clear that the remake was made in the tradition of the genre's Golden Age. There was very little in this film that would have looked out of place in a Western from forty or fifty years ago. It has much in common with Anthony Mann's ""The Naked Spur"" and Fred Zinnemann's ""High Noon"", both from the early fifties. It shares with ""The Naked Spur"" the theme of a group of men escorting a prisoner (in both films named Ben) to stand trial; in both films the leading character has taken on this responsibility because he needs the money. The ending of ""3.10"" parallels that of ""High Noon"", with a lone man taking on a gang of bandits and a clock ticking down to the time when a train is expected in town. <br/><br/>The central character is Dan Evans, a struggling Arizona farmer who has been crippled since losing a leg in the Civil War. Evans joins a posse tasked with delivering Ben Wade, the leader of a notorious gang of outlaws, to the railroad station in Contention. Once there, Wade will be put on a train to Yuma prison, where he will be tried for robbery and murder and, if convicted, hanged. The title refers to the time when the train leaves Contention for Yuma. Evans undertakes this responsibility, not out of any abstract belief in justice or any hatred of Wade, but because he is heavily in debt. Each man in the posse will receive a reward of $200, put up by the Southern Pacific Railroad, who are anxious to see Wade hanged because he has robbed a mail coach carrying their payroll. Ironically, the railroad itself has caused many of Evans's problems, cutting off his water supply in the hope of acquiring his land cheaply. (Not all the villains in the film are outlaws). <br/><br/>Getting Wade to Contention, however, will not be easy. The posse have to contend with hostile Apaches and with Wade's gang who have sworn to rescue him. Wade, like his namesake Ben Vandergroat in ""The Naked Spur"" is a cunning individual who knows how to play upon his captors' weaknesses and create dissension within the group, seeking his chance to pick them off one by one. <br/><br/>The film is handsomely photographed, in the best Western tradition, and the acting is excellent, not only from Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the leading roles of Evans and Wade but also from many of the supporting cast, especially Gretchen Mol as Evans's beautiful wife Alice, Logan Lerman as his teenage son William who follows the posse against his father's wishes, Ben Foster as Wade's sadistic henchman Charlie Prince and Peter Fonda as the brutal Pinkerton guard Byron McElroy.<br/><br/>The film, however, falls short of being one of the classic Westerns, largely because of the disappointing ending. Evans, by now the last surviving member of the posse, has to escort Wade alone to the train. He appears to have succeeded, after William starts a cattle stampede to prevent the gang from rescuing Wade, but at the last minute Prince gets through to the train and shoots Evans dead. Wade, however, then draws his gun and shoots Prince and the other gang members before getting back on the train; it is unclear if he is voluntarily going to his death, or if he has plans to escape. <br/><br/>The final act was clearly intended to act as a sort of redemption scene for Evans. Struggling to support his wife and children, he has lost his self-respect and believes that he has also lost the respect of his family. He has exaggerated his wartime heroism. His family believe that he lost his leg fighting for the North against the Confederates; in reality he never went into battle and lost his leg after being shot by his own side. He hopes to regain his self-respect by getting Wade onto the train, doing the right thing because it is the right thing, not because it will bring him gain. Unfortunately, the film-makers also attempted, clumsily, to make this act a redemption scene for Wade. There is throughout a sense of respect growing between Evans and Wade, and just before the final showdown William appeals to Wade's better nature, saying ""You're not all bad"". We are clearly intended to conclude that Wade's final actions have proved William right, but I found this part of the film psychologically implausible and difficult to take. Wade does not prove himself a good man by shooting dead his own comrades who, villains though they may be, have risked their lives in the attempt to save his. Wade's own previous record does not suggest that he has any moral right to set himself up as the gang's judge, jury and executioner. For all but the last few minutes this is a very good film, but I nevertheless left the cinema feeling cheated. 7/10."
"iPDZOFiwyQehdyib","10","7","15","21 September 2007"," The ending was not mystifying
","For some reason many people are having a difficult time understanding the ending to this movie, so let me explain it for you.<br/><br/>The plot is allegorical. Dan Evans is 'the moral man' and Ben Wade is, quite simply, the devil. The devil can be charming to suit his needs, and he can get inside the heads of most men. But he can't be killed. He's a force of nature. And that's why he isn't executed in the course of the story, saving everyone a lot of time and tragedy. That and a respect for the rule of law by our protagonists.<br/><br/>But on rare occasions the devil can be swayed by a particularly excellent display of virtue. The devil was once an angel himself.<br/><br/>By the end, Wade wanted Evans to live because he had passed the devil's test. He was willing to put his life on the line, despite all temptation to the contrary, for no better reason than that it was the right thing to do. By the end of the story the money was completely unimportant because the drought had ended. He continued only to redeem himself in the eyes of his family, and also in his own eyes. Evans was setting an example for all men.<br/><br/>The devil, though evil, is also very prideful, and considers himself principled. Dan Evans beat the devil to as much of an extent as any man ever can. Evans was a righteous man and earned survival. So it was Charlie Prince that killed him. Charlie Prince, a demon who embodies wanton slaughter, whom even the devil cannot keep in check all the time. He kills his gang for disobeying his desires, out of a devil's measure of compassion for Evans, and because he has come to believe that it is wrong for him to spoil Dan's son, who has once declined to justly kill Wade and again declined to murder him in cold blood, in deference to the rule of law, and because his father had taught him better than that.<br/><br/>Wade does not go to prison. The purpose of getting on the train is part of maintaining the illusion of triumph for young William. I imagine that as soon as he got a few miles down the track, he would have broken out of the train and rode off. Any other action on his part would have resulted in William shooting him.<br/><br/>The main point of the allegory, therefore, is that although man cannot BEAT evil, he can still refuse to join it. And the hope comes in when you realize that eventually evil will always turn on itself. It is inherently self-destructive. Though the devil lives to fight another day, and the moral man dies, he dies a saint, and there is at least one family in Bisby that will not be corrupted by him."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","10","24","9 January 2008"," The Good & Bad Of This Western Remake
","For you lovers of classic-era films, make no mistake: this is not the ""3:10 From Yuma"" that you know: this re-make is a very rough, very violent and profane. It does entertain, however. Its biggest ""plus,"" I think, is that it pulls you in almost immediately and and keeps you involved in the story. It's hard to take your eyes off the screen. So.....the ""good news"" is the entertainment value; the ""bad news"" is the ludicrous story and poor moral message.<br/><br/>MORE GOOD NEWS - It's always a pleasure, or usually a pleasure, to watch Russell Crowe and Christain Bale: two very good actors who you can count on to be entertaining. A lesser-known actor, Ben Foster, is extremely effective as ""Charlie,"" the most evil man in the movie. Meanwhile, the cinematography is good and the sets are excellent. You really feel like you are part of the Old West and are witnessing these gunfights as they happen.The story has many twists and turns to keep you guessing.<br/><br/>MORE OF THE BAD - Every time God or the Bible is mentioned, it is done so in negative terms. God doesn't answer prayers; the villain is the only one quoting Scripture. His mother told him to read the Bible, so he did for three straight days and his mother left him, etc., etc. All of it is needless, but obviously the biased writers had to get their atheist agendas into the story. Meanwhile, our intelligence is further insulted in the big action scene at the end when literally hundreds of shots, some from close range, are fired at the two main characters and nobody is killed! In fact, these guys are still running all the way through town to the train: no problem. Neither guy gets hit??! Puh-leeze.<br/><br/>There's more, but you can read other reviews for more pros and cons. I rarely mention another reviewer, but I was impressed with the review written by ""robertblanton."" It is posted on the first or second page and I recommended reading it. <br/><br/>Overall, suffice to say, I still enjoyed the movie, was entertained, but was not impressed with a lot of the writers' agendas, nor the credibility of the action scenes.<br/><br/>On a final note: if you have the DVD, check out the bonus feature ""Outlaws, Gangs and Posses."" It has some fascinating material on what these guys, and others, were really like in the Old West."

","As a fan of both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale with a taste for spaghetti westerns, James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma was quick to catch my eye amidst the likes of Tony Gilroy's Michael Clayton and Tarantino's Death Proof. Pitting the Oscar winning, bad-boy Crowe against the ever impressing, intensely diverse Bale was a mouth-watering prospect and Yuma was a train I eagerly sought to catch. Unfortunately, I found myself travelling second class.<br/><br/>As in the original, the drama lies in the tension between the two leads. Crowe is the bearded outlaw Ben Wade with the stupidest cowboy hat I've ever seen. Bale is the partially crippled, cash-strapped rancher Dan Evans, don't worry his hat is better. Anyway, their paths cross when wanted man Wade is arrested via the aid of Evans, who offers to help guard the bastard until the train to Yuma prison arrives in an exchange for $200. As the men edge towards the station and the clock tick-tocks towards ten past three, the tension rises. The men's strained company is fuelled by envy; Wade yearns for Evan's domestically orientated way of life and hot wife (Gretchen Mol); whereas Evans wants the outlaw's mutinous freedom. And, in time, a hushed respect develops between the two. But Wade's widespread reputation as a ruthless gang-leading, gun- slinging killer keeps all the guards on their toes. Especially Evans. Will Wade's raucous, trigger-happy crew intercept? Or will they be beaten by the clock? Only time will tell<br/><br/>3:10 To Yuma is by no means a bad film, but its plot is relatively bland and falls short of exercising its star's potential as well as its audience's imagination. It's a western that shies away from trying something new. Whether that's the point of the tale or not I don't know, after all it is a remake. And the fact that Mangold opts to open with (brace yourself western fans) a robbery, is an early indication of just how lacking in innovation Yuma is. As for Crowe, well, he's been far more convincing in the past. His portrayal of Wade requires him to be a merciless, short-fused desperado whose only real effort to cut loose as the villain is by oddly supporting Evans in his personal pride filled quest and conjuring up some rather nifty charcoal sketches. How intimate. But the character of Wade is ultimately a cold-blooded, bible- quoting killer who seems to do all he can to capture the audiences' sympathy. It doesn't work. The Aussie seems to have a knowing grin on his face throughout the entire movie and, after a while, his sadistic comebacks flirt with your nerves. Bale, on the other hand, is excellent, playing a hard-done-by, withdrawn hero who's more concerned with regaining the respect of his wife and two boys by putting the bulky villain behind bars than he is with the cash. His poignant justification to his wife as to why he's opted to guard Wade is one of the film's few captivating moments. ""I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way they that look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't."" <br/><br/>Ben Foster's portrayal of Wade's right-hand-man Charlie Prince is also one of the film's highpoints. He's about as ruthless as Wade himself, but his idiosyncratic Arizona accent, killer one liners and swanky jacket make for a character you'll love to hate. Add to that the bombastic, far-fetched gun war at the end which helps generate a decent level of excitement but, ultimately, 3:10 to Yuma fails to build up a full head of steam. <br/><br/>If you're a hardcore fan of the western genre, steer clear of this. Clint Eastwood practically buried the genre with Unforgiven. Yuma has absolutely nothing on Clint's magnum opus and would be shot-dead in a stand off withJohn Hilcoat's potent Aussie western (well eastern) The Proposition. Unless you can pick Yuma up somewhere for cheap, the £12.99 for which you'd normally be required to pay for this DVD, really isn't worth it. And don't even get me started on the £24.99 you'd have to fork over for the Blu-Ray version."
"djmomo17","5","5","10","20 February 2008"," Wrecked by ending
","I haven't seen a western in ages and I've really enjoyed Christian Bale's work over the years so I thought I'd give this a try.<br/><br/>Overall the acting was pretty good. Bale's character was an atypical protagonist and had more layers than in a typical Hollywood film. Crowe was pretty charismatic, even tho I can only stand to see him once every 5 years. Ben Foster as Crowe's right hand man was also pretty cool. Between him and Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men (tho Javier edges Ben out by a couple notches) it's been a good year for western baddies. Peter Fonda and Alan Tudyk were also great. Nicely turned with some real nuances.<br/><br/>So for most of it I would say it's pretty good - not great but more than serviceable. Great films break barriers and set new rules so serviceable is still pretty fun.<br/><br/>Then Crowe goes ""Disney"" (unconvincing change of heart whilst strangling Bale) and I couldn't really focus on the rest of the movie because I realized that the bottom had just dropped out. OK, Bale tells him a sob story about how pathetic he is and then Crowe stops killing him. That I can believe. But then when they suddenly become ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" buddies, leaping over rooftops, even shooting his own gang...Holy Bat-cows Batman you've lost me. I even went to the IMDb board and there are some good posts about how Crowe's character wanted to throwaway this life of crime, and admittedly there are several scenes which could be interpreted that way, but the way it was directed or acted it just didn't ring true at his final ""apotheosis"". A good film doesn't require you to sift through scenes looking for possible explanations. I mean in a mystery film sure, but based on the swelling score I don't believe Ben Wade's change of heart was meant to be a source of David Lynch-ian conjecture and reconstruction. There are other plot holes as well, especially Peter Fonda riding a horse after being gut-shot and when a Gatling gun barely makes an impact on horse mounted bandits - but that's Hollywood and I can forgive heroic hyperbole for the sake of plot. But that last bit really sunk this one for me. I don't know how the original story went but it almost would have been more interesting if Ben Wade had been accidentally winged by the $200 mercenary town folk, Charlie goes ballistic on the townspeople, Wade then shoots Charlie out of indignation, then escapes while Christian Bale rubs his throat (living for another day). Okay I guess that could use some work too, but at least I could swallow that more than what ended up on film."

","This is one of the best remakes of an old western that I have ever seen...well worth your time and money to go see this one on the big screen. 3:10 To Yuma has always been a favorite movie of mine and my husband ( we are both Glenn Ford fans. Russell Crowe is always an excellent choice as he is one of my favorite actors but he has a supporting cast that does a phenomenal job even though he was the bad guy in the movie. I went with my sister on a Saturday afternoon and we both enjoyed it although westerns are not her usual choice of movies.

"lpope-1","10","5","10","9 September 2007"," Best Western movie and story in this decade
","3:10 to Yuma. What a great Western. I was interviewed on some show after I saw it and it was almost too soon for a complete reaction. Oscar worthy, yes: for story, for costume, editing, and maybe even one for acting. Christian Bale and Russel Crowe are in a really worthy battle for the best man on and off screen.<br/><br/>The story is so great. The pieces fell into place like a mortise lock. Unique, chambers of steel, contradicting shapes that distinctly turn from one contradiction to another. It was so contrasted from the bad to good and came together in a dance between characters that found respect and humanity in battle.<br/><br/>What is an enemy? When did paths go apart? The subtext of family vs. outlaw & Fatherhood vs. orphan fill me up with their individual parts, essential is the parallel and the rough setting. Everyone struggles to survive and defend the deepest core values. These outcasts with these values that made them come together. Words took on deeper meaning as they were few enough in an action filled western. Fascinating ideas rolled together seamlessly into this movie.<br/><br/>It was like a song really, with a harmony and haunting melody that allowed you to drift into identification with either main character. I was on the edge of my seat wanting, rooting for a wonderful outcome. I got it in parts, in spades and with a huge dose of loss. How can I describe a great movie without giving any of it away? Just to say go see it. It is entertaining and a great body of work. The eyes have it. They have made this a really wonderful movie. It will leave you thinking. It will leave you grateful, compassionate and disturbed."
"us5466","5","10","25","3 September 2007"," Strong elements, weak links
","I love westerns and always want them to do well. This one has many excellent attributes: photography, cohesive story line (mostly), strong performances from most of the cast. But I left disappointed because the two main characters wind up making no sense at the end. Russell Crowe is a bad man who is likable, but would he really go to prison voluntarily out of respect for the ""courage"" that Christian Bale has shown by refusing to abandon his mission of delivering Crowe to the train? A man who killed one of his captors with a fork and tossed another one, while unconscious, off of a cliff? Would he run through a hail of bullets at the end to help deliver himself into captivity? If he admired Bale so much, why not knock the bumbling idiot out while he had the chain around his throat? Crowe would be free and Bale would have been honored for his valiant effort, even if he was overcome in the end. And Bale....was he on a suicide mission to get out of his depressing life? He was so pathetically eager to prove to his wife and son that he had substance that he was willing to die, leaving them his glorious memory...but nothing else? He's a father in a hard time, it makes no sense for him to engage in a single-handed gun battle with a multitude of thugs. He's got better things to do.<br/><br/>And, what's with the effort to get this vicious thug to prison when it is clear all of the law enforcement people, at least in this movie's script, are amoral cowards ready to be bought? Think how many people would have lived if they had just shot the bastard early on. That would end the movie, so of course that couldn't occur. The focus on bringing him to justice only makes sense in the context of a society that values justice. Evidently, there must be some social sense of law and justice or there would not be a prison at Yuma. But it is sure missing from the townspeople in Contention who all pull their guns and become murderers for hire when Wade's gang offers them money. In a society like that, the typical response would be to shoot Wade post haste instead of dying in a futile effort to ""uphold justice"".<br/><br/>All the pieces are here for a great Western, but the director's urge to make the genre modern, with an ending in which the bad guy can cheerfully abandon his life of self-centered meanness because he has found a friend in a failed, but stubborn rancher....while the rancher inexplicably finds his greatest moment in dying to uphold a sense of duty that no one else seems to share. Neither character's situation at the end of this story rings true for the times, or for that matter, for the characters as they were at the start of the movie.<br/><br/>And what's with the throwaway cuteness of whistling for the horse? Anyone think he can keep up with train for any distance? Or does that mean Wade intends to get off the train and go back to the bar girl as soon as he out of camera range? Silly joke to end a movie that's supposed to be about duty, honor, justice, etc."
"WriterDave","7","6","13","9 September 2007"," The Train Has Left the Station
","A down-on-his-luck rancher (Christian Bale) attempts to restore some honor to his name, regain the respect of his young sons, and put some money in his pocket by escorting a murderous criminal (Russell Crowe) to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison in James Mangold's update of the 1950's Western of the same name based on a short story by Elmore Leonard.<br/><br/>Westerns are a hard sell these days. Unless taking the radical deconstructionist route like the neoclassic ""Unforgiven"" or the bold avante-garde take of last year's vastly underrated ""The Proposition,"" the genre often comes across as stale and unwelcome. The only other film to play it straight recently was Kevin Costner's ""Open Range"" in 2003, and that movie was only a moderate success. ""3:10 to Yuma"" lacks the reverent and epic scope of Costner's piece, but makes up for it in grittiness and a valiant attempt at psychological complexity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately ""3:10 to Yuma"" is awash in genre clichés from the robbing of a stagecoach, to the stoic wife/mother at the homestead (Gretchen Mol), to the depiction of Native Americans as mythical phantom threats ready to scalp and kill anyone in their path. Also distracting are the ""cameos"" that range from a welcome Peter Fonda as a morally questionable bounty hunter to an unwelcome Luke Wilson complete with green teeth as an unnecessary mining posse leader. Likewise the supporting cast is hit or miss with Logan Lerman showing some decent range as Bale's eldest son while Ben Foster fails miserably at being method as the insane sharp-shooter hellbent on rescuing Crowe from the gallows.<br/><br/>The film's saving graces are director Mangold's traditionalist leanings in pacing and Western iconography and the lead performances from Bale and Crowe--two great actors who sometimes resort to scenery-chewing and are shockingly subdued and nuanced here in their multiple physical and mental face-offs. ""3:10 to Yuma"" culminates in a fantastic finale at the train station that is entertaining enough to forgive the cattle cars of clichés, buy not enough to make the audience wish they would resurrect the genre more often."

","Saw both yesterday (Friday). Glenn was better than Russell. Christian a lot better than Van Heflin. Foster a whole lot better than Jaeckel.

One, the bartender, is of low morals that beds Wade in 2 minutes and the other is the disapproving wife of Dan that drives him to desperate acts. The 2 boys of the Rancher: 1957 - in background only (OK). 2007 - older boy (wise, knowing, directors eye (?)) saves the day and acts as a foil to his dad (UGH). Better idea: Rancher has NO kids and NO wife and there is a male bartender. As expected, the technical aspects are an order of magnitude better after 50 years. Scenery is good. Very watchable film.<br/><br/>The 2007 ending was more unreal (everyone in town trying to kill them and missing) than the 57 version and more of a downer.

Dan (07) knocks the Union because they only paid him 198.50 for his shot off leg which does not hinder him in the lease in the last reel when he jumps and runs all over town. Dan (57) is just a troubled man with both legs working.<br/><br/>I think the problem with both is the source material... The story is just not very good and does not work from any perspective....

Now I like westerns haven't seen too many but this is my favorite of them all it just does everything you want to see from a action packed western.<br/><br/>It starts out with Dan Evans (Christian Bale) being a poor rancher and owing money to the rail road company so they stay away from his land. Then they show you Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) being this bad-ass outlaw that is robbing a armed wagon. Well when these two characters paths meet that is when the story goes from OK to just amazing that is in the first 20 minutes of the movie. But the main plot is a group of people a bounty hunter, rancher, doctor, and a guy who owns the rail road and his lackey are having to take Ben Wade to a prison jail called the Yuma.<br/><br/>Acting wise everyone does great my personal favorite was Ben Foster who played Russell Crowe's right hand man.<br/><br/>Overall this is almost a perfect movie but it is the reason I love film. Honestly I never saw the original but if it is half as good as this remake then you got one hell of a film. I give this a BUY you will want to watch this again."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","23 April 2008"," Doesn't totally play to all its potential strengths but is still a very good modern western with solid delivery across the board
","Dan Evans is a struggling rancher being pushed off his land by men he dare not stand up to. An amputee from his part in the war, Evans longs for the respect of his sons, but all they see is his refusal to take up arms for his land. Evans is in town to try and reason with the landowner for more time to pay off his debts when he stumbles across outlaw Ben Wade in a bar with his guard down. Wade is captured and a posse is put together to transport Wade while a decoy draws off his gang. With the money and the moral aspect, Evans joins the posse and sets out, with the time pressure on them from the very start.<br/><br/>I missed this film at the cinema but I did want to see it as I had greatly enjoyed the original and had indeed commented in that review that the film would work if done well in any setting, so I figured the remake could work as well. The simplicity attracted me to the original and this remake, for all its Hollywood production values, is still a solid and simple tale. The heart of the film is the battle between good and evil as it occurs both between Evans and Wade but also within Evans himself. This comes out best in the final scenes (the waiting for the train is a smaller part of the film than the original) and it did make me wish that more had been made of this. However, what makes up the majority of the film does still mine this theme, albeit not as effectively because of the sense of space and action tending to take away from the pressure cooker of the hotel room with the ticking clock.<br/><br/>IMDb currently has this within the top 250 films ever made, which needless to say I disagree with but will say that it is a strong modern western and a very engaging film all round. Director Mangold does a sterling job of keeping the material the focus and succeeds in making the climax very tense, even if he cannot drag it across the whole film. I did like the way that the film is restrained in regards the cinematography; too often westerns will feel obligated to have sweeping landscapes and make the most of them just because it is what the genre does. Here though the locations are impressive without ever being forced onto the viewer as if they were the focus  Mangold and his crew keep the focus tighter and the characters don't get lost in wide shots.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the main draws for the modern viewer, with the star pairing being a big selling point. Crowe is a solid Wade but I never felt like he was doing more than playing the character rather than totally being it. Bale on the other hand is much more convincing and this did make it work very well. The two men do play off one another really well and again it just added to my desire that the film had allowed them more time with just the two of them and a ticking clock. Lerman is a device character but he works well within the demands of the script. Foster enjoys a simple but memorable character by being simply evil throughout. Support is solid as well with some good turns from people such as Mol, Fonda and others.<br/><br/>Overall then a solid and enjoyable western. The things that made the original so strong are not quite as well delivered here but they are still present, with strong delivery across all aspects making for a very good, but not brilliant film."
"RanchoTuVu","8","4","8","13 March 2008"," logically disjointed but gripping western
","3:10 to Yuma always had an interesting moral ambiguity to it with an honest financially desperate rancher trying to salvage his life and family and his pride by delivering an infamous outlaw to a coming train while fighting off his gang in order to earn an honest $200.00 and save his ranch. This version has terrific editing of the action, a lot of which has been added on, including a fantastic stage coach robbery. The outlaw himself is as bad as can be and yet has his own sense of justice and fairness which is in the best tradition of famous American outlaws. If anything this film is maybe too reliant on its action and the great acting while letting a few holes mangle the plot. Why didn't Ben Wade just ride out of Bisby in the first place? Lets get captured so that we can introduce him to failing and disabled Dan Evans (Christian Bale). The overall impression is a solid combination of action, acting, great sets, photography, editing, etc.. while one wonders about the logic behind it all."

","Everything about this movie is topnotch. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale are about the best actors around. Without them this movie would have just been another western. With them it is a classic. Amazing what a decent script and great acting can do for a movie. The supporting characters were all well written and well acted, adding to the movies potency rather than detracting from it. I'm not a big fan of the kid who played Charlie Prince mostly because I absolutely couldn't stand the over the top portrayal of his character in the Hostage. But while he was over the top again here it wasn't so far out of the realm of belief pertaining to his character.<br/><br/>All in all this is the best movie I've seen in at least a year. Well done 3:10."
"gradyharp","10","4","8","9 January 2008"," Understanding why Westerns are a National Treasure
","If there is a truly unique American contribution to film making then that contribution has to be the Western. Though not as popular a theme these days as it was in past decades, it only takes a powerhouse film such as 3:10 TO YUMA to remind us just how pungent storytelling of this type can be. Yes, the story itself (based on a short story by Elmore Leonard) is rather simple: desperate farmer needs money to save his failing farm and family and signs on to escort a powerful outlaw to the train that will take him to prison. But in this screen adaptation by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas the story is fleshed out by sharing with the audience the essence of the pioneer spirit and the sequelae of the Civil War on the minds of the dispossessed who turned to crime against the ruling order - the railroads and the banks represented the conquering North - and the film becomes one of profound understanding about man's plight in the pioneer West.<br/><br/>The landscape and atmosphere of Arizona is captured with dusty accuracy by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael and sets the stage for director James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted', 'Walk the Line', 'Identity', 'Kate and Leopold', 'Cop Land') to work with his talented cast to give a realistic view of life in the hard times of the old West. Russell Crowe is the notorious outlaw Ben Wade whose gang includes such actors as Ben Foster and Rio Alexander and once he is captured during a robbery, the local sheriff promises to pay $200. to destitute, crippled farmer Dan Evans to escort the prisoner to Contention, AZ for catching a ride to the 3:10 to Yuma and prison. The connection between the two disparate men - Wade and Evans - is the message of the story and is beautifully enhanced by allowing the audience to understand both sides of 'the law'. The co-stars of the film include Gretchen Mol as Evans' wife and young Logan Lerman as Evans' impressionable son William, Dallas Roberts as the head of the bank investment at risk, Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw and a large cast of the people who interplay in the drama.<br/><br/>Both Crowe and Bale give superlative performances, acting so cohesively that it would be difficult to single out either for the Oscar: this is ensemble acting at its finest. For once the added features enhance our appreciation of the tales from the Old West and how they became legends and the comments by the director, producers and cast actually make sense! The film will doubtless become a classic: it deserves the honor. Grady Harp"

"Birdhasflown","10","4","8","17 September 2007"," Be on Time to 3:10 to Yuma
","The Western has been somewhat non existent in the last 5 years, with the exception of ""Open Range,"" in 2003, and HBO's series ""Deadwood,"" the genre has moved into extinction in movie goers' minds, as many Westerns nowadays focus on shootouts and blood and leave out the humanistic themes that the genre is built around. <br/><br/>These humanistic themes are exemplified through stories of men who bring anarchy to places where law and morality are hard to find on the new frontier, which give rise to bold hearted men who stand up for justice when it is no where to be found. In ""3:10 to Yuma"" you find such a moral story line as criminal Ben Wade comes across rancher Dan Evans. <br/><br/>Dan Evans is a maimed Civil War solider who fought for the North and has come to Arizona to seek refuge and peace for his family, but he has come to find nothing but pain and misery as his crops and cattle are deprived from drought, the town's businessman threaten Evans to pay off his land, and his wife and oldest son look at him like he is a coward. As Evan's barn is burnt to the ground by the businessmen and his posse, Evans decides to head into town to tell the businessman off. When he confronts him, he's told to pay up or his cattle and home will be burnt to the ground, how's that for your landlord? Now, the only way to compensate for his grievances and to pay off his debts, Evans decides to take up a job that will give him enough money to pay off the shrewd businessman. The job is to escort captured outlaw Ben Wade through perilous desert so Wade can get aboard the Yuma train and await certain execution. Wade is the leader of a band of criminals who bring down stagecoaches and rob anything on the Southern railroad. Wade is wanted for countless murders and over $400,000 stolen. <br/><br/>Wade is brought into Evan's home, where they wait to ride out any of Wade's posse who are certainly looking for him. There Wade brews the interest of Evan's oldest son, William, and begins to flirt with Evan's wife. William has the mentality to go out and do violence to avenge their families burnt down barn, which you can say is the Wade part of the boy. But Daniel tells his son that a man must get by with his words and not his actions. <br/><br/>The quiet and authoritative way of Dan Evans played expertly by Christian Bale, becomes a character that stands with Shane from ""Shane,"" or Gary Cooper's Marshal Will Kane from ""High Noon,"" They are regular, vulnerable men who stand up to injustice when no one else will, and are prime role models for children and young men who need to lead honest lives when there is much temptation and room to be lead astray. <br/><br/>What's captivating about James Mangold's crisp, authentic morality play is how it circles around the characters stories and the dichotomy between the righteous man, Evans, and the outlaw, Wade. Ben Wade is a cunning, charming, and heartless criminal who perfectly manipulates and torments his captures as they travel through deadly wilderness swarming with Apace Indians, brewing tensions, and Wade's gang of criminals on there tale. Wade however is revealed to have a humane side to him as we realize he isn't too far from Dan Evans, its just the choices the pair has made set them apart. Wade and Evans begin to bond, as the pair begin to understand one another. Many shades of Wade's character are revealed as well as he cites passages from the Bible, and takes to draw sketches in times of solitude. Russell Crowe maybe plays one of his most entertaining performances as Ben Wade in this film. Wade and Evans keep working off each other as they both force the other to question their subsequent livelihoods. Evans leads an honest and clean life, Wade points out to him, but he still suffers for it. Isn't it better to lead a life like his, Wade tries to confide to Evans. Evans though thinks different, and speaks of always doing what is hard and right when many choose the easier path. By the end of the film Evan's example rubs off on Wade, and the story calls to mind that the wildest of dogs can be tamed. <br/><br/>In the most stirring scene in the film, when Dan Evans is alone with outlaw Ben Wade in a hotel room, battered, tired and bruised from a hellish odyssey through sand and rolling tumbleweeds, Wade's posse circles the hotel, where Evans and Wade await certain death. All of Wade's captures leave him in fear of their own lives, but only Evans stands by Wade and promises that justice must be served and that whatever happens, he'll get him on the 3:10 to Yuma. It's almost homage to Butch and Sundance's last stand in front of the Bolivian army, but Evans sleekly leads Wade past bullets and swarming gun men, in a shoot out that will be remembered forever. <br/><br/>This film is surprisingly a remake but it stands alone as its own film, and also up there with my favorite Western films. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe have called for the genre's immediate revival."
"rogerdarlington","Null","4","8","16 September 2007"," A lot to Crowe about
","Don't generally get no westerns no more so I guess, when one rides into town, I'm gonna mosey on down and check it out.<br/><br/>Now there have been so many westerns in the history of the cinema that it's impossible for a new one not to be derivative and ""3:10"" is self evidently so, both in being based on a 1953 short story by Elmore Leonard and being a remake of the 1957 movie of the same title starring Glenn Ford in the lead role. There are obvious echoes of ""High Noon"" in the cowardice of all but one man to do the right thing and of ""Shane"" in a boy finding inspiration in a cowboy's courage. <br/><br/>So, if the trail is so well-trodden, why go there? It's partly the joy of the western itself: those terrains, those outfits and - above all - those guns (and here, when shots ring out, they RING out). It's partly the more nuanced character of the main protagonist: the outlaw Ben Wade who is cunning, ruthless and real fast with a pistol, but knows his Bible, can sketch a sensitive drawing, and is polite to the women folk. Above all it's the fine acting, mainly from the charismatic Russell Crowe as the leader of the gang and Christian Bale as the rancher Dan Evans who is determined to get him on that train, but also from various support performances including the veteran Peter Fonda as a bounty hunter endlessly on Wade's trail and Ben Foster as Wade's psychopathic second-in-command.<br/><br/>The very final sequence is too light-hearted for the 122 minutes that have preceded it but, that apart, this is a fine western that manages to combine both exciting action and character delineation in a work that will further enhance the reputation of director James Mangold who did so well with ""Walk The Line""."

","Wow! Finally a Western made for the adult mind! Thank you Hollywood for a job well-done! <br/><br/>What a delightfully complex film about motivation, relationships and values. It's about a father and a son on the verge of manhood, and another son with an illness; a bad guy who has a strong sense of self and truly knows how to lead; about a society that condones the mass murder of women and children as long as they are Native Americans but not of armed robbers stealing from what was then one of the most powerful corporations on earth - the railroad industry.<br/><br/>It's also about a society which tolerates racism towards hardworking Chinese laborers building the railroads; and at the same time allows working-class farmers to be brutally pushed off their land in order to make the powerful even richer. But the only real ""bad"" guy society is organized against is the one who steals from the rich and powerful! How incredibly convenient and ironic! <br/><br/>This story is also about pride, self-respect, intelligence, courage and even self-confidence. We are also confronted with senseless violence committed by evil men on one hand and the immediate need for self-defense on the other. What's worth risking your life over? Is the central question 3:10 to Yuma asks.<br/><br/>There's so much going on this amazing film, there's no way to absorb it all the first time around!

The ending is ridiculous and at some points the action scenes seemed more in character with the way the World Wrestling Federation presents it's brand of entertainment. Russell Crowe's character was so mixed up I believe he should see a head doctor during his stay in the Yuma jail.

","First Off, Go see this film. 3:10 to Yuma is by far the best movie I have seen all year. Bale solidifies himself as a proved actor, as if he wasn't before? (American Psycho, Batman Begins, Rescue Dawn, The Prestige) Do I have to continue? If Christian Bale does not receive an Oscar nod, the Academy should just quit giving out rewards. Crowe gives his best performance since Gladiator as a ruthless, cunning, quick-witted bad guy who steals the screen with his presence. Ben Foster's (X-Men:The Last Stand)supporting role as the quick-handed, loyal,gun-wheeling outlaw is his best character performance to date, as it should also garner a Best-Supporting Oscar nomination.

A Masterpiece."
"Quinoa1984","8","6","14","11 September 2007"," as solid, violent, and sophisticated a Western you'll see this year
","The best western I've seen since the Proposition - which might not mean a lot since it's been a year since that film came out. But while Mangold's film may not have the existential resonance and eerie quality of the Aussie feature, we do have a better-than-average feat of genre film-making, loaded with great machismo presence (and heart), and a feat of storytelling uncompromised by muddled metaphors or Leone copycatting. It's very violent and without too much hope for the characters on the surface by film's end. It looks as though things have suddenly, surprisingly turned against the conventions (whether this is different from the original I can't say having not seen the 1957 film version yet). But underneath, there's a moral code that is evoked brilliantly.<br/><br/>The premise is as simple as they come for a story based on a short- originally written by Elmore Leonard early in his career- for a pulp western magazine. Gang outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe, his best performance in quite a few years, even if he could potentially play it in his sleep) is captured without the help of his posse (with icy fast-shooter Ben Foster as second in command), and is sent to be hung for numerous crimes and murders in Yuma. Dan Evans (Christian Bale, terrific as always, usually in silence) is a rancher who is in danger of losing his land if he doesn't get enough money together, and so takes the job of being part of the group (among them an old and weary and hard-ass Peter Fonda as Bryon McElroy). It's a tale where good versus evil should be well defined, but this where the conventions sort of get muddled, which is really what starts to make 3:10 to Yuma more than just a star vehicle or blockbuster of the week.<br/><br/>Beneath the veneer of each man lies truths that haunt them, and have made either one into how they are in the present. Wade is calculating and evil, but somehow has a level of honor beneath his countless sins; watch him tell of reading the bible cover to cover as a kid after getting it from his mother, and then never seeing her again. Or how Evans got his war wound, how he hides that simple fact from his children, even from his son (William Lerman, maybe the most limited performance as his sole motivation is 'I'll go with you', though still does it well enough to act with the best of them). There's some level of understanding that forms between Wade and Evans, and amid the countless gun battles and wounds faced against Apaches, train workers, and the whole town of Contention, loaded with gun power, as the train is soon on its way, neither man can ever quite give in, aside from what the end goal entails.<br/><br/>Mangold directs this picture like a pro in the tradition of someone like Howard Hawks- a few really good scenes (the climactic battle through the town, a dinner scene between captured Wade and the Evans family, and maybe the scene between Wade and Evans in the hotel room, among maybe one other I can't pin down), no bad ones. It's interesting to read the only substantial criticism of this 2007 version of 3:10 to Yuma being too long, where the original was just right in length. But nothing seems to be fattening to the storyline here, and the script keeps things moving along at a very tense pace while never stopping for a moment of characterization, like one of the campfire scenes. And giving enough breathing room for actors like Crowe and Bale allow for them to do what they do best.<br/><br/>In this near-classic feature that works as a very respecting throwback to tragic tales of doomed men in the guise of typical Hollywood product, while working finitely as a pure action movie for today's audiences, 3:10 to Yuma is taut, precise and superlative as a ""guy"" flick."
"tubby1","7","5","11","5 May 2008"," Entertaining.
","The casting of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the lead roles made 3:10 to Yuma a very appealing proposition.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 3:10 to Yuma is a simple, linear western which does not make effective use of the talents of Crowe and Bale.<br/><br/>It is two-hours of cat and mouse which is ably executed and good fun. However, considering that Crowe and Bale were at its disposal it is a rather frustrating experience considering the lack of character insight.<br/><br/>3:10 Yuma is worth a watch, and the script tries to make amends for the lack of character development with a gritty last twenty minutes... Sadly it was too little too late."
"ihatemichaelbay88","9","5","11","2 September 2007"," Excellent
","I just got home from a preview of this movie. I have been very excited about this film for quite some time now for a few reasons. One being that it is a western, a genre that hardly ever lights up the silver screen in the modern movie age. I was ready for a change of pace from the CGI/Michael Bay blowemup popcorn flicks, and this nostalgic western seemed like it had the muscle to bring a pure, vintage old west film.<br/><br/>Secondly, the cast. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale working together is a movie goers dream; two of the most versatile and consistent front men sharing leading roles on the same big screen. Of course, it seemed almost like too much star power for one film, a mistake that many directors make that usually leads to overacting and unconvincing characters.<br/><br/>Apart from the actors and the potential originality of this movie, I had a gut feeling that this movie was special. The first film of 2007 that we could see appearing in several categories for Oscar nominations. It had come to my attention that this film was a remake of the 1957 Glenn Ford classic. Some people shy away from remakes, claiming that they ruin the original movie. I personally did not feel as if this was a movie that would butcher Ford's ""3:10 to Yuma."" It was in the hands of ""Walk the Line's"" James Mangold, Academy Award winner Russel Crowe and Christian Bale, the most talented actor in Hollywood. This movie was not set up to be a modern garbage remake of a classic; 2007's ""3:10 to Yuma"" was destined to merge fifty-year-old classic film-making with what purity is left in present Hollywood. <br/><br/>After seeing this film, I have decided that it is indeed my favorite film thus far of 2007. The Old West is recreated vividly with ranches, old railroad towns and the vast frontier. Mangold's attention to detail is prevalent throughout the entirety of the movie, and it pays off immensely with his flawless sets (the railroad construction site was a favorite of mine).<br/><br/>Bale and Russel Crowe. It goes without saying  they were fantastic. Crowe plays a perfect Ben Wade, the meanest, most diabolical outlaw in the west. I particularly loved the character of Wade for his multidimensional persona. Crowe's Wade was chillingly evil while subliminally always having an aura of virtuosity looming about him. It was a beautifully developed character, and don't be surprised to see Crowe getting an Oscar nod for him performance.<br/><br/>I didn't think the Bale's Dan Evan was up to par with his Dieter Dengler, but he is (as always) great. A stand out performance came from the young Ben Foster as Charlie Prince, Ben Wade's right hand man. His character was menacing, funny and bad-ass. It was probably my favorite character in the film, and I am expecting great things in the future from Foster.<br/><br/>This film may be a remake of '57 Glenn Ford classic, but I believe that it has solidified itself as a modern display of classic film-making. The plot line does not drag, the dialogue is smart, the sets are incredible and the acting is first class. Do not shy away from this film over the fact that it is a remake. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a brilliant film, and deserves a viewing from even the most skeptical of remake-haters. 9/10."

It was enjoyable from the start, but it's in the last 10 minutes that it gains all of its value. The ending is by far the best part, I strongly disagree with those who didn't like it. I think that if somebody didn't liked it, was probably following a preconcieved path about how characters should behave and how the movie should end. Instead, the power of this story is all in the possibility of change.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe is outstanding. I don't like him much usually because I think he seems always out of place in every movie he does, but this role really fits him perfectly, and he acted great.<br/><br/>That being said, Christian Bale is the main reason of the success of this movie, and by far the main reason to watch it.

","Director James Mangold, participating in great collaboration with cast and crew, has used the classic genre to tell a contemporary story. The result is a gripping and absorbing tale, in which a great script is propelled forward briskly with great performances, most notably by Christian Bale as the down on his luck ex-soldier turned rancher looking at chance to redeem himself in the eyes of his family (and perhaps himself?); Russell Crowe as the charismatic and yet ruthless robber; and Ben Foster has his loyal but psychotic second in command to Russell Crowe's character.<br/><br/>Bale plays his role quiet low key and controlled, and the way his character is taken advantage of at the beginning of the film generates considerable sympathy for him and makes his journey through the rest of the story compelling refreshing and not stereotypical. Crowe is particularly impressive as a clever and ruthless leader of his gang of robbers, but his very subtle take that his character is getting tired of his life, and his gradual bonding to Bale's character is genuinely fascinating to watch. Ben Foster portrays a borderline psychotic in a manner that also avoids stereotyping, and also results in an absorbing performance.<br/><br/>These actors are ably supported by good supporting turns by Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Dallas Roberts, and Logan Lerman as Bale's character's son. In fact it is the character interplay which is the driving heart of the film, and keeps you transfixed throughout. This interplay is brilliantly facilitated by writer-director Mangold, who sets it in a spectacular environment and embellishes the story well-handled and exciting action sequences. Kudos go to Phedon Papamichael's photography, Michael McCusker's editing, Andrew Menzies's production design, Arriane Phillips costume work and able support from the sound mixing team and the stunt crew. It really makes a difference that the film accomplishes so much in camera rather than relying on digital effects, and is so much better for it.<br/><br/>However the most trenchant technical contribution has to be from Marco Beltrami's brilliant score, that creates to terrific mood and helps propel the story along to its interesting and thoughtful conclusion.<br/><br/>The film further cements James Mangold's reputation as one of Hollywood most eclectic directors and one of the best for drawing excellent yet accessible performances from his actors."

Then he climbs back on his horse and rides all day. Nobody is *that* tough.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the rest of this film is awesome. It's tough, gritty, and has no silly romantic sub-plots that would've served only to bore the audience. The dynamic between Ben Wade (RCrowe, bad guy) & Dan Evans (CBale, good guy) is terrific. The acting by the entire cast is tremendous. Particularly good is Ben Foster playing one of Ben Wade's henchmen. He's a psychopathic butcher and is very believable in his role as Charlie Prince. Best remake of an old film i've ever seen (I saw the original 1957 film with Glenn Ford & Van Heflin as a kid in the '60's).

","Now I would like to clarify before the rest of my review is read that I have not seen the original off of which this film is based so my review will not be a comparison there, but I will in the future try and watch it to have a basis for comparison. So this review is of this film as a stand alone.<br/><br/>This film is subdued. Like Christian Bales' character Dan Evans, the film has spurts of sustained adrenaline, but nothing full fledged. It takes its time to open up revealing character for the main ones, but leaving the rest to fend for themselves in two dimensional roles. That is fine as it fleshes out the main character very well and makes for a nice ride and adventure sort of a character study than a thrilling western. There is one man to keep the flare very much alive throughout though and that is Ben Fosters' tough and good for nothing puppy dog of a side kick Charlie Prince. He's the mean tough and detached bad guy of the film. Russell Crowe as Ben Wade has to provide the psychological bad guy of sorts, but there are plenty of bad characters in this here western. Not the least of which are several of the captors escorting Wade like Tucker who has his own bad faults like burning down a certain someone's barn in the very beginning. Still though, I would call this the best western in quite a long while for its characterizations alone.<br/><br/>And I would say that is because of the heavy presence of Crowe and the subdued approach of Bale which adds an interesting dignity to each. The film isn't over the top, but subdued not feeling like a hard R film at all outside of a gruesome wound in the stomach and a splattering of language that is so minimal it quickly forgotten. The film also has a very good story to work with, one of redemption and heroes which also doesn't loose sight of realism and has quite fragile characters. You may be able to see most of the film coming, but it is enjoyable because of the delicacy it takes in getting there.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert:<br/><br/>I felt sorry for many people at the end and not the least of which is Charlie as he is betrayed for coming to help Wade. For that it and the knowledge that Wade will probably go free anyways it is not a completely satisfying ending, but a realistic one. I will probably have a better judgment to make a solid grade after I see the original."

","I enjoyed this movie up until the part where the great Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) had a change of mind, helping his own capture by being shot at and jumping over roofs to get to the Yuma train. I also didn't understand why Crowe's character would kill his entire crew who risked their lives to be loyal to their boss. I understand that Crowe's character might have taken a liken to the brave and crippled Dan Evans (Christian Bale), but what did he expect was going to happen to Evans when everyone in the entire town were shooting at the two of them. I was relieved when Evans' young son decided not to shoot Ben Wade...it showed he would eventually become the bigger man."
"jpschapira","8","3","6","22 December 2007"," The power of silence
","I don't know much about westerns, but I do know about emotion. I also don't know if it's because of James Mangold's gift to generate it or because its impeccable and flawless cast, but ""3:10 to Yuma"" has emotion to spare. Not every day silence touches deep inside in a world surrounded by gunshots and blood. <br/><br/>The movie tells the story of outlaw Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) and his gang; and the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), the man who took him to the train that would send him to prison. Two men so different but somehow very much alike, two men full of secrets but also filled with honesty; one walking all by himself, another one with a family to support.<br/><br/>Why did Mangold shoot this remake? I rather not ask him, and I haven't seen the original but I can understand. I can understand and appreciate the delicate work the director has taken under his hands; the calculation of beautiful close ups and long shots; the management of a perfect production design (Andrew Menzies); the quiet observation and the precise control of his actors.<br/><br/>Talk about acting duos. If ""The Machinist"" wasn't proof enough, Christian Bale's character study and commitment can be seen in several facets here: in the way he talks to his wife (Gretchen Mol), with care but with the silent suffering that what he has is not enough for her; how he talks to his son (better every day, Logan Lerman), with pride because he's almost a man but with preoccupation because he's still his kid. <br/><br/>These are sad characters involved in desperate situations. Situations that lead to well-based confrontations that are well structured and that serve the storyNo gun here is shot without a purpose, write it down; and it fills me with joy. The other big star? Russell Crowe, whose look says everything. The most intense look I've witnessed since Leonardo DiCaprio's in ""The Departed"".<br/><br/>It's a good screenplay, this one by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Hass, but it hasn't got many words. It takes an actor of complete mastery to transmit a thousand feelings through the look of an eye. Yes, it has been done millions of time and it's not so difficult; but this is a whole different context. It's a Western; Crowe plays an outlaw who is not allowed to show feelings and succeeds in staying that way. What he feels, you can see it in his look; if you sense it, you'll understand his great performance. <br/><br/>Only a few times the main characters give long speeches; they are not so long and they explain who they are and the reason of their personalities. You have to pay attention, because you may get lost in the tension of the action. However, I think Mangold is very clever in managing the moments, supported by Marco Beltrami's best score yet, and with a performance by Ben Foster that shows he's between the best actors of his generation. <br/><br/>There are things we say many times and they start to loose their true meanings, I want this to be true: ""Silence hurts; silence speaks"". Do an exercise and try to figure out what each character says to another when they look at him in silenceYou'll find plenty of those moments."

","Christian Bales and Russell Crowe are perfectly cast as the protagonists in this Western, as their respective characters seek redemption for their lifetime of failure and evil, respectively. Christian Bale's performance is especially riveting, as you come to know the character portrayed in the very depth of his soul. He finds redemption in his relationship with the villain Wade(Russell Crowe)and in his heroic behavior within the story. So, too, does the villain Wade, who finds his own redemption in his relationship with Dan (Christian Bale) and his final decision to give closure to the elder son. There is sufficient humanity and, indeed, humor in the portrayals by these characters, who are ably supported by the rest of the cast. This is a Western that can be enjoyed by serious film-goers who normally bypass this genre, and these same film-goers will regret missing this one if they do."

You cannot help but love his character. Going into this movie I was thinking it was going to be a big action style movie as many westerns in the past have been, I feel I was wrong. Don't get me wrong there was a good bit of action, however the story was just so great and full of life, while I was watching the film I really didn't even think about the action in it. 3:10 to Yuma just has such depth that you will just be immersed in it until you realize the credits are rolling and you get that feeling of sadness that the movie is actually over."
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","3","6","30 September 2007"," A dying breed of film.
","By all means, get yourself to a theater and enjoy this wonderful Western while you still can! Very few quality Westerns are made for the big screen anymore. Every now and then you get a gem like Unforgiven or Open Range, but Hollywood just doesn't churn out quality ""oaters"" like it churns out animated penguin movies and comic book adaptations and things like that. Right now, there is an outstanding film named 3:10 to Yuma playing on the full screen! Go see it! That said, let's take a closer look at the film. This version is a remake of a film by the same name released some fifty years ago. The story is originally based on a short story from Elmore Leonard. The plot deals with a down-on-his-luck honest cattle rancher (Bale) who crosses paths with a dangerous outlaw (Crowe) and his men after a daring stagecoach hold-up. The outlaw, known as Ben Wade, ends up spending a little too much time after the hold-up in town with a beautiful woman. Before he can escape and re-join his gang, he is surrounded and taken into custody by a motley group of town folk and would-be lawmen. The rancher, in town to dispute a debt, also helps hold him. Now, Wade must be taken to a nearby town where he will catch the train of record which will take him to prison and a certain trip to the gallows. The rancher and others sign up for the trip for a price of $200 each. The rest of the film deals with the trip to the railroad town, and the myriad of complications and dangers faced by the men trying to deliver Wade to justice. The action seldom lets up for long, and the conversations that buffer the action are full of intelligent dialog spoken by memorable characters.<br/><br/>That is one of the film's biggest strengths. Most of the characters in this film are distinctly drawn and full of color. They aren't simply random guys on horseback who peer out from under big cowboy hats. We learn about these men as individuals, and some of them are absolutely unforgettable. Wade's lieutenant, played by Ben Foster, might in fact be the most memorable character in the film. This is one bad-arsed hombre who keeps the gang right on the good guys' heels. You might think this guy would clearly be able to take over the gang himself, yet he has a strange and unexplained fascination with rescuing Wade. There might well be a lot more going on than we're told, anyway. After a time, we get the sense that Wade might not be all that fond of his old gang. He obviously feels superior to them and perhaps has simply used them for all these years because they are just a bunch of hardened killers who happen to be good at robbing coaches. I'd hate to give too much away, but the film's final scene pretty much confirms this hypothesis. The young man playing Bale's bold son also stands out memorably. We'll be seeing more from that young man over the years.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma has perhaps the highest body count of any Western since The Outlaw Josey Wales. I have never seen anyone put a Gatling gun on the back of a stagecoach before. Hard to believe it wasn't enough to stop the gang. There are some elements of the plot that may be tough to swallow from a conventional perspective, though. Vinessa Shaw is a hottie, but would she really be worth getting caught over? Maybe! Could a man with a wooden leg be able to outrun dozens of men shooting at him? Nah! But the scene is exciting! Much like the rest of the film. I urge all of you once again to go see it! 9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

Filmmaker James Mangold does a bang up job keeping the action lively and somewhat unpredictable from such a familiar storyline (kudos to the smart screenplay by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas based on the original Elmore Leonard short story) and making his two leads an unlikely source of anti- heroism at its finest. Foster is memorable as the sociopathic right-hand man of Crowe's murderous band of bandits. One of the best American westerns since ""Unforgiven."""

"XFLRWF","10","3","6","17 September 2007"," ""Every way of man is right in his own eyes""
","Ah, the Western. The mere mention of that genre evokes thoughts of heroic sheriffs, quick-drawing gunslingers, and villainous outlaws. That is the traditional version. James Mangold's remake of ""3:10 to Yuma"" delivers a Western that is not merely a shoot 'em up but also a great study of its characters. It is Mangold's masterful storytelling and direction that draws in the audience more deeply into the story and characters. This is accompanied by the fantastic performances of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale who prove that heroes and villains have more underlying reasons for their actions than simply money or vengeance.<br/><br/>Former Civil War soldier Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a down-on-his-luck farmer. He has only one leg, his children don't respect him, and he is heavily in debt. While rounding up his cattle, he comes across notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) who has just finished his latest holdup. Their destinies intertwine in the local saloon where Evans volunteers to accompany a posse to ensure Wade gets on the 3:10 train to Yuma where he'll be sent to prison and hanged. The group must survive the vicious loyalty Wade's men have for their leader and other vigilantes looking for vengeance against the outlaw if they are going to make their goal.<br/><br/>The film would have been ordinary and average if it not for the masterful storytelling ability of James Mangold. When he introduces the characters, Evans is shown trying to live a just life and do things the right way whereas Wade is carefree and cavalier about his life. It is a great dichotomy of the honest man who struggles through life and the evil man who breaks the rules and lives free and easy. Mangold's timing is perfect in setting up the characters before he connects their fates. There is an imagery of a split screen and the audience experiences everything happening all at once. Mangold's ability to draw in the audience makes them feel as they were right in the picture. This is especially true in his slow close-ups during Evans' and Wade's different monologues. The delivery by the actors is flawless but it is through Mangold that movie goers really feel the experience. His direction makes the audience feel they are being addressed rather than the supporting actors.<br/><br/>The terrific screenplay of Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Hass is adapted by Elmore Leonard's short story. Welles, Brandt, and Haas create multidimensional heroes and villains and show the grey areas between black and white. The trio dedicates equal time in introducing Evans and Wade before tying their fates. They have a great sense for how much to divulge to the audience before bringing the hero and villain together. The team also brings out the unique characteristics of Evans and Wade and supplies them with thought-provoking ideas about the thin line between right and wrong.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, this is one of Russell Crowe's best performances a he fits so smoothly into the role of outlaw Ben Wade. Crowe does not play Wade as the typical heartless gunslinger that would shoot a man just for being looked at funny. Rather, he is cool-headed and only kills for survival. This is best viewed by reading Crowe's eyes as he moves an entire scene with a simple look. Crowe has a lot of fun with his character's malevolent ways that there is a charisma about Wade that almost makes you cheer him on. Crowe's performance radiates is so well done that audiences have to remind themselves that he is a murderer and a thief. Christian Bale is also outstanding as the long suffering Dan Evans. As with Crowe, he tells his life story with his eyes. Whereas Wade's are shown to be carefree and hopeful, Bale shows Evans' beaten down and ravaged by all he has suffered. Bale is so talented in his role that he truly makes the audience feel his pain and need to do the right thing. He creates the kind of character who becomes a hero not because he wants to but because nobody else can. The film is also filled with several superb supporting roles such as Peter Fonda as bounty hunter Byron McElroy, Ben Foster as Wade's second-in-command Charlie Prince, and Logan Lerman as Evans' son William. Each actor brings something to story and plot no matter how small the role may be. Fonda shows he still has something to offer as the relentless McElroy. But it is the performances of Foster and Lerman that have the most depth. Foster plays Prince as quite the opposite of Wade. He is quick to shoot first and ask questions later before shooting again. But as Foster shows, Prince is not an ordinary sidekick. He has a deep devotion to his leader that Foster brings out in moments of fury and dedication. Lerman's role as William Evans has the most depth and transition of character and it is a task that is expertly handled. As William, Lerman exhibits the rebelliousness attitude that is common among teenagers. But like his father, it is his need to do the right thing that drives him. Lerman uses this to show William's transformation from irritable boy to courageous man.<br/><br/>""3:10 to Yuma"" has all the elements of a perfect film. It has a great cast, terrific story, and a director with an eye for action. In a summer where special effects are king, ""Yuma"" offers action and humanity. It truly fires off all the right shots.<br/><br/>GRADE: A+"

The 1957 original starring Glen Ford and Van Heflin was pretty darn good; but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale makes this 3:10 to Yuma one of the great ones. Full flavor shoot-em-up western. A more than well photographed movie about Arizona filmed in New Mexico. A desperate farmer(Bale)struggles to support his ranch and family through a harsh drought. He accepts 200 dollars to help transport a notorious bad man(Crowe)to the railroad depot to board the 3:10 to Yuma for imprisonment. The gang leader does everything including bribery to sway the farmer into letting him escape. Excellent efforts from Peter Fonda, Ben Foster, Gretchen Mol and Logan Lerman.

"Chris Knipp","8","3","6","11 September 2007"," A place in the mind still left for heroism
","James Mangold: 3:10 to Yuma (2007) A place in the mind still left for heroism With the help of two British actors, New Zealander Russell Crowe and Welshman Christian Bale, James Mangold has directed an intense, beautifully photographed remake of the 1957 movie 3:10 to Yumathat breathes new life into the American western. The continuing power of this seemingly antiquated genre is the way it provides settings in which moral conflicts mean something. The center of the film is the relationship between Crowe's charming villain Ben Wade and Bale's struggling rancher Dan Evans. As opponents/foils, the two end up mano-a-mano, with only Evans left to take the captive Wade to the jail-bound train.<br/><br/>Wade is not only a man who's been very good at being bad, but an artist who quotes the Bible and never loses his cool; he has panache and style. Evans appears as a diminished, now hopeless, man whose own elder son William (Logan Lerman) lacks respect for him and is fascinated by the outlaw. A predatory neighbor who covets his land has cut off Evans' water so his cattle will die. He lost a foot in the Civil War but that isn't any kind of badge of courage; his greatest strength may be his sheer desperation. Wade's gang is all around, and in the lawless post-Civil War West there isn't another man in miles with the courage and devotion to civil order necessary to risk helping the rancher. But Evans goes to the last mile just for the $200 he's been offered to do the job and refuses the thousand Wade offers to let him go. If he's being stripped to the bone, the skeleton that remains is steadfast and noble enough to impress his wily charge.<br/><br/>The Wild West is a world of such mythical dimensions that the duel of these two men still makes sense and speaks to us. It's a world where values don't come easy. The skimpy hardscrabble towns that dot the plains have no law and order to speak of. It's a bank employee who's behind Wade's being brought to justice, because money talks and the bank has lost a lot of that to Wade's gang. It's every man for himself and Wade has done well. Everyone is armed, shooters are respected, and Wade's a good one. In Crowe's terrific understated performance, he never ceases to be quietly seductive; and in fact he seduces a woman before our eyes and almost seduces Evan's wife. We see how hard and tough he is. He always seems to have resources to spare.<br/><br/>But as an actor, Christian Bale's stock goes up a few more notches here too: he has been piling one accomplishment on another and this time he proves a fitting match for the great Crowe. As Dan Evans, there's a sterling cleanness about Bale's deeply tanned face. It's the face of a soulful man of integrity. He's stripped down to nothing, and can take nothing for granted. And in turn he is a man who won't give in. No matter who survives, Dan Evans' values are the ones that are destined to triumph. As in all great myths, we watch not to see what will happenwe know thatbut how it will be played out, with what style and what emotion. And the filmmakers and the cast do not fail us there.<br/><br/>This is probably more cynical than the 1957 original (which unfortunately I have not yet seen). Today's stars don't have the purity of the John Waynes, the Glenn Fords (but Ford was cast against type in the earlier version as Wade), the Henry Fondas. But the very fact that actors like Bale or Crowe are less sterling or rigid in the image they project and we and they live in a blurrier world makes for a duel that's also, arguably, troubling and interesting in new ways. It's haunting to see Peter Fonda, aging now, resembling his father, very fine as Byron McElroy, a character new to this version, essentially a mercenary, not a good guy but a bounty hunter bent on getting the prisoner to justice strictly for the money.<br/><br/>The acting is so strong in this character-driven drama you may not notice its physicality has high points and low points. There's a robbery in which a stagecoach gets upended that's dazzling and fresh. But a night raid by Indians is so sketchily staged and shot it's not quite there and you barely know what's going on. The final stretch from a hotel to the train station is so open to crossfire Dan's traversing it successfully with Ben seems not difficult but impossible. It's an exciting sequence nonetheless, but compared to other cowboy final shootouts not a very suspenseful one. The movie has a good sense of landscape and at certain moments its images even have some of the feel of period photographs, like Jarmusch's remarkable Dead Man.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not such a bad thing that it's hard to single out certain scenes as the best. It all hangs together in this adaptation of the original Elmore Leonard story. A most interesting feature is the way Dan's son William has the spirit of an outlaw, but becomes a hero on the good guy sidebecause he can, and it's his dad. William partakes of the movie's sense that almost anybody can go either way by luck or a twist of fate, and this is what gives this twentieth-century western a lot of its edge.<br/><br/>Set alongside earlier movies like Cop Land; Girl, Interrupted; and Walk the Line, this looks like Mangold's best work so far. It may be hard to make a western any more and always was hard to make a really good one, but this is an impressive demonstration that the genre has not breathed its last."
"tomrito","9","3","6","10 September 2007"," Very well made film
","This was unquestionably one of the best movies of the year so far. It was a well made remake with great acting from everyone including; Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, Ben Foster and surprisingly Peter Fonda. The movie had the perfect feel and texture of Arizona in the late 1800's and was totally entertaining from the opening credits to the last scene. It must take a lot of work by a lot of people to have such attention to detail in a film, but I have to give most of the credit to the director, James Mangold, for getting the actors, props, animals, and music to all come together and work so well. One thing I did want to comment on was, there have been some people on this site that have said that Russell Crowe's character did not stay true to form or that they could not believe the changes. Well I have to disagree with that. It is true that he was a ruthless killer but there are three scenes that were foreshadowing for his actions. One was when he said that even bad guys love their mothers, another was when he said that she left him reading the bible for three days and never came back for him, and the last was when he said that he would not last long as leader of the gang if he wasn't totally bad. When he saw the relationship between Christian Bale, whom he admired, and his family, I think he knew that this was the real true value in life, and in that moment of ""weakness"" he knew what he had to do."
"Craig_McPherson","9","3","6","10 September 2007"," The Good, The Bad, and the Magnificent
","In Hollywood, it seems, all good things come in threes. One studio decides to release a vigilante film and two others follow with their own takes on the same theme. Given this, there's no reason why the venerable western, a genre that Hollywood hasn't revisited in years, should be any exception. What's more, if James Mangold's re-envisioning of 3:10 to Yuma is any indication, this year's trio of westerns (soon to be followed by the Brad Pitt vehicle The Assassination of Jesse James, and the Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men) may well yield some of the best entertainment in quite a while.<br/><br/>Based on the 1957 Glenn Ford/Van Heflin picture, which was, in turn, based on a 1953 short story by Elmore Leonard (52 Pickup, Get Shorty), Mangold embraces his subject matter with unabashed enthusiasm, along the way paying stylistic homage to oater icons John Ford and Sergio Leone, to deliver a movie that is as complex and character driven as it is packed with lead-spewing action.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe brings the same brooding intensity he mined in 2003's Master and Commander to the role of Ben Wade, the ruthless leader of a gang of outlaws that has made their mark robbing stagecoaches while foiling all efforts of the Pinkerton agency to both safeguard their booty and reign in the gang.<br/><br/>Crowe's black heart is counterbalanced by the quiet upstanding righteousness of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), who plays a down on his luck rancher trying to eke out a living for his family and avoid foreclosure by an unsympathetic land owner hell bent on selling Evans' land to the railroad. When Wade is finally corralled, Evans seizes the opportunity to hire himself out to the Pinkertons and transport Wade to a nearby town and put him on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison.<br/><br/>From there, the story of two men, each centered in a morally different universe, unfolds as Mangold piles layer upon layer of character depth upon each, while at the same time picking away at the bleakness of Wade's fiber to slowly reveal glimmers of humanity.<br/><br/>Supported by a top notch cast of veterans and newcomers such as Peter Fonda, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Alan Tudyk, Luke Wilson, and the impressive Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) as psycho gunslinger and Wade's right hand man Charlie Prince, Mangold delivers a rich tableau that speaks to the true, humble motivations of heroism and the ability for empathy to be found even in the darkest recesses of the self-centered human heart. Rounded off with a twangy score that evokes the spirit of Ennio Morricone, 3:10 to Yuma nicely ensconces itself as one of the great modern westerns, alongside Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, Kevin Costner's Open Range, and the best of Sergio Leone's saddle sagas."

","When watching 3:10 to Yuma, it's hard to believe it all started with a short story by Elmore Leonard. This exceedingly well told story with it's rich characters and beautiful cinematography ranks right up there with some of the best Westerns in history: The Magnificent 7, A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's Ben Wade and Christian Bale's Dan Evans seem like polar opposites when the movie opens, but as their story unfolds we find there is much more to these men than meets the eye.<br/><br/>The very best villains are ones you can love, and Wade is most certainly a charmer. His earnest face and smiling eyes belie the masterful mind working nonstop within. In Evans, he finds the perfect foil.<br/><br/>But I would be remiss if I didn't mention Ben Foster's portrayal or Charlie Prince. Loyal follower to Wade, Charlie is the type of guy who'd kill you with a smile and never lose a minute's sleep over it. Ben does an outstanding job of creating an intoxicating mixture of adoration, loyalty, viciousness and outright lunacy.<br/><br/>As if this weren't enough, there are several other characters represented outstandingly by some very talented folks: Logan Lerman's William Evans, and Kevin Durand's brief role as Tucker to name but a few. Everyone in this cast does an excellent job of bringing this story to life.<br/><br/>My only caveat would be the ending. You will either love it or hate it, but either way you won't be bored by it."
"BinaryStar909","9","3","6","8 September 2007"," Very impressive film on all fronts
","3:10 to Yuma is easily one of the finest films I've had the privilege to see this year, and one of the best westerns to come along in quite a while. The film shines in all aspects, performances particularly, but the direction, cinematography, music, sound design (really startling gun shots, much more realistic than most films, sounds like a small detail but I found it made a big difference), and writing are all excellent.<br/><br/>I was genuinely surprised at how great the dialog was throughout the film, and its made all the better by the excellent actors delivering it. Doc Potter (played by the brilliant and hilarious Alan Tudyk) gets some of the best lines in the film in terms of humor, Wade (Crowe) has some great bad ass moments as well, but I was most impressed by Evan's (Bale) dialog throughout the film. It has a really wonderful way of cutting through to some really brutal truths that most films barely touch on or avoid altogether, and Bale's delivery is really, truly astounding. While I am a huge fan of Christian Bale, he's been on my bad side after Harsh Times (which I really, really, hated), but with this, he's back in my good graces, and I have a higher opinion of him than ever before. His intensity in this role is unbelievable. He doesn't have a great deal of dialog really, but he uses his silences to his advantage and really conveys an amazing amount of emotion through the desperate look on his face for most of the film. He has a short conversation with his wife before leaving to deliver Wade to the train station that is one of the finest pieces of acting I've seen in quite a while. I can't even describe the depths of Bale's performance, especially after seeing the film only once. This is certainly a film that requires multiple viewings, and I can only imagine how much better it would be on a second viewing.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe also turns out a really incredible performance, and this is coming from someone who is not much of fan of his. I have only really liked about half of what I've seen of Crowe's work, and while he obviously has talent, I always considered him rather overrated. This is the first time that I have really seen what other people have apparently been seeing in him for years. There is a certain simplicity and straight forwardness in his performance, he just is Ben Wade. The character is actually quite charming, in fact some of my favorite moments in the film were the stories he tells to his captors over the course of the journey about his visits to Dodge City, people he's killed, women he's been with , and the like. Watching the interactions between Wade and Evans is always fascinating as well.<br/><br/>While I have only recently gotten into watching westerns after seeing Once Upon a Time in the West not quite a year ago (I've been hooked since then), this is one of the finest I've yet to see. It evokes all the things one associates with classic westerns, but at the same time, it transcends them in some way which I hope to understand more once I am able to see it a few more times. Highly recommended."

","When a western is made, it seems a wind blows by carrying whispers of discontent and doubt.

It is not that I like westerns, but I love good movies. As movies go, this western will go down as one of the best made.<br/><br/>Why great? Bale and Crowe for one thing.

But the way that it is done is hard to match. I never saw the original version so I cannot compare this to that.

","Contrary to most of the commentators here, I kind of thumb down for this movie. When I heard about the hyped remake with a hearth throbbing cast such as Crowe, Bale and Fonda etc, I thought this would be one of the spectacular movies of the year. However, from the very beginning there is something about the movie that makes you bored. The slow pace of the flick makes you flip over to another channel or doze off involuntarily. In my case as I watched the movie on board of a plane I just fast forwarded to skip all the in between scenes to catch up some exciting gun fighting episodes which you expect from any western. Basically the movie is focused more on the psychology rather than shooting. This might be a plus point for some, but for me it did not work out. When a western, I expect some slick shooting and fighting sequels. My friends, that's something you can not find in this movie. A good thriller, many tensions and a surprising end... But do not expect old school shoot'm up western with a good guy / bad guy plot."

","Now here's another movie that critics seemed to love, and I just plain hated. Sometimes it's annoying to be out of step with the Universe, and yet in this instance I think I have a strong case.<br/><br/>Frankly, I think ""3:10 to Yuma"" is an excessively violent, utterly unbelievable and even somewhat mean-spirited film. In vintage Hollywood tradition, the movie tries to make Russell Crowe's character - a crazy, murderous, gun-toting maniac - into a sort of folk hero, by pitting him against other characters who are even sleazier than he is. However, I did not like Crowe's character for a single moment; nor did I appreciate the film's attempts to put him on some kind of pedestal.<br/><br/>My other major problem with the film is that it's paced terribly. There are actually too many action scenes, and each one becomes progressively more unbelievable. An incredible number of people get killed - too many people, in fact. I simply can't believe that so many people would sacrifice their lives to perform some of the senseless missions depicted in this film. And, unbelievably enough, Crowe's character is considered to be a highly successful gang leader - despite the fact that he keeps getting large numbers of his men killed in clumsy operations. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Worse yet, the action scenes are interspersed with repetitive ""character development"" moments in which Crowe, seated at a dinner table or near a fire on the prairie, talks trash to the other characters, who just passively sit there and allow themselves to be psychoanalyzed by a crazy gun-toting murderous maniac. Hmm...right.<br/><br/>I know that a lot of people like this movie. It is exactly the kind of movie that looks great to many critics and film buffs, but I just can't enjoy it because I think it's packed with movie clichés and it's got a messed-up moral compass. The more I see of sensitive foreign films, the less I like this kind of American movie - the kind where lots of people get shot in the head, and it's supposed to be OK because the bad guy is more interesting than the good guys. Yikes..."

","Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are fine actors. Here, they do well with the silly dialogue they have been given. But despite the undoubted talent of Russell Crowe, even he seemed to be confused about the nonsensical plot. A shame really,as this was beautifully filmed with solid supporting actors. If you want to see a really GOOD western where the outnumbered good guy fights it out with the bad guys before the afternoon train, you'll still have to go out and rent Bad Day at Black Rock. Spencer Tracey, Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine did it much, much better. Outnumbered good guy, played by Spencer Tracey, is cruelly bullied early on by the bad guys over his physical handicap from previous war (in his case, he does a terrific and believable fight scene despite a paralyzed ARM!) Christian Bale has a terrible limp in Yuma, but he seems to have ""found the cure"" before one scene when he goes running along, and jumping between, the roofs! Where do they get the ideas for these modern movies? And why can't they do them as well as they have been done before?"

"azzy-2000","10","4","10","14 September 2007"," Best film of this year?
","Or, at least, no doubt a shot for Oscar's. The plot is rather simple: Dan Evans (Christian Bale) desperately needs 200 bux to water his land and to feed his family, thus takes on a dangerous task of delivering local outlaw celebrity (Ben Wade, played by Russell Crowe) to the 3:10 prison train to Yuma. Don't make a mistake - this is a remake of 1957 movie, but by no means a replica. I just downloaded the old version and watched about half of it, and what i can say - 2007' ""3:10 to Yuma"" is about as contemporary as any movie could be. First, Ben Wade. In the old version, he was as simple as a stone - good-humored, cold- blooded rascal, but no more. Crowe's Wade is a mystery in himself, with all this bird- sketching, Bible references and tragedy in the past. Definitely he's not just an outlaw  he's a guy who defies God himself, and, jugging by the movie ending, not without success. He's constantly playing, making a world of his own - in short, he's a puppeteer. Snickering and cool he might be, but there is a raging volcano somewhere deep inside. Next, what about Evans? In the 1957 version, he seems like a moderately successful farmer. He has this little problem with water, but make no mistake - he knows his way about the land and livestock, his children and his wife respect him. And Bale's character? He's a ""person with disability"" (lost his leg during the war), his wife doesn't think much about him, his older son defies him. Doesn't it sound like a modern age hero? With much more of these tragic hues, Evans is definitely closer to us than Van Heflin's good farmer guy. And then, locked in a room face to face with his own destiny, he chooses the only way a modern hero would choose. Self-destruction and glory eternal ;) But, definitely, Ben Foster's character Charlie Prince is the hit. He's a scene stealer, and even Crowe and Bale look kind of bleak compared to Foster's passion and rage. There is definitely gay undertone in his performance, which is completely absent from 1957 movie (in old version Charlie Prince even flirts with barmaid - in this one Wade seems to be the one and only object of his passion). Dunno how much of this stuff was scripted and how much Foster brought to the character, but you don't easily forget mad and beautiful Prince's eyes. Anyway, gay or not, let's say - there is much more than just loyalty in Prince's desperate ride to Wade's rescue. The last scene, when Wade shoots Prince in cold blood, and, especially, the look Ben Foster's character gives him, is, IMO, one of the strongest cinematic moments in the entire history of the industry. Interestingly, there is almost no place for women in the remake - even a love story is ""all men"". The mark of nowdays? Or just director's search for originality? Anyway, this is by far the best movie i saw in 2007. Beautifully shot, strong characters, magnificent desert landscapes and never-ending tension  it looks much more like a scary fairy tale, than a real life story (and 1957 film is real life to the core)  but isn't our life now a scary fairy tale? The ending, improbable as it is, sent chill down my spine. It's a 100% must see."

Ben Foster's performance was outstanding along with Christian Bale's. Russell Crowe did a great job also, but he had a very simple role, there's not much about his character that you don't already know. He's the bad guy, plain and simple.

","Well, growing up enjoying every type of movie that involved guns, horses and guns, I was really looking forward to this remake of a Glenn Ford 1957 classic... I was not let down one bit! I was invited to see a sneak preview with a group of print writers from several papers. I could see them scribbling away while I was soaking in the post Civil War look that was being shown up on the big screen... I was 6 years old again and seeing a true American Western... yippee!!! <br/><br/>This movie was extremely well written and equally well acted. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale give Oscar worthy performances and Ben Forster, as Crowe's number one henchmen Charlie Prince, gives the finest supporting acting performance I've seen in years! He'll probably be overlooked at Oscar time, but he commanded the screen when his character in a maniacal greatness, shot man after man in a cold blooded ease.<br/><br/>This has a Clint Eastwood revisionist feel to it with the good guys and bad guys living in a gray line blur. Peter Fonda plays a mercenary Pinkerton man that admits that he's only read the Bible and no other books, but kills Apache with disregard. Ben Wade (Crowe) calls him on the apparent hypocrisy of his actions.<br/><br/>I'll not spoil the ending here, but I'll tell you that for all of Ben Wade's rotten nature, he proves that ""even bad guys love their mothers!"" <br/><br/>You'll enjoy this movie if you like guns, horses and guns... like me!!!"

Where each falls short the other stands up...this becomes extremely relevant as the movie progresses. As amazing as the two of them are Ben Foster dazzles the viewer in the role of Charlie Prince.

If the viewer can let go of the need for logic and enjoy fine acting and entertaining dialogue, it should not be too difficult to appreciate the characters brought to life by Crowe, Bale, and the supporting cast. What the script lacks in consistent believability, it makes up for with humor and chemistry. Crowe, as the hardened, life-long (yet charming) criminal searching for something decent in himself, and Bale as the beleaguered, beaten down rancher desperate to hold onto his land and last shred of self-respect make a memorable screen duo who square off against each other (and themselves) physically and psychologically."

The locations are beautiful and the casting loaded with A-list caliber talent, although a bit too soft and pretty looking for a Western. They don't cast tough guys like they used to. Unfortunately the screenwriters abandon the original Elmore Leonard story and the entire movie falls apart in the second half with several surprising but poorly motivated twists and finally an utterly stupid, watered down ending.

I could easily see everyman in his character, and he played it masterfully.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe was also the best I have seen him since Gladiator. He really played a much more nuanced character than I could have imagined, and I really enjoyed the ending where this nuance came out strongly.<br/><br/>Ben Foster was born for the role of Charlie Prince. He was as evil as evil gets and made you cringe every time he appeared to see what he would do next.<br/><br/>All of this suggests that director James Mangold had a tight rein on this film and delivered what will go down as a western classic.<br/><br/>The screenwriters, Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas brilliantly turned Elmore Leonard's story into a compelling tale that had a lot of the flavor of the original, but was different in areas that mattered.

""3:10 to Yuma"" is one western that doesn't try to pay its respects to the genre or use it as a pretense: it's a bona fide action thriller but at the same time, it is totally modern in the way it poses some of the undying dilemmas humans may face in rough times. It even has an ending that permits the viewer to wonder about the next steps and the ultimate fate of those still standing -something Holywdood usually refrains from these days, preferring to show us everything at the end, so that we don't need to think or imagine about anything afterwards.

A movie like this would make a good ""over-the-top"" parody on westerns, similar to what Tarantino and Rodriguez did in ""Kill Bill"" and ""Grindhouse"" but I am afraid this wasn't the intention of the director; instead he was seriously and sincerely trying to make a typical western... and that is SO SAD! So unless you are a western junkie who doesn't care about holes in the plot or lack of common sense in characters' actions, avoid this movie at all costs.

","The original 1957 ""3:10 to Yuma"" film with Glenn Ford (Ben Wade) and Van Heflin (Dan Evans) was one of my favorite movies -- just about the only Western film I cared about. The denouement (what else are you going to call the defining scene) where Glenn Ford did a reversal of his character and helped Van Heflin escape his (Wade's) gang was heart rendering and surprising. That's what a reversal in a story should be. Puts faith back into life -- yes people have real feelings and writers could pay attention to them.<br/><br/>It was the current writers, we presume, that changed the ending in the 2007 remake. It is my earnest want that you don't kill off the good guy in a movie like 3:10 because then there's no point to the reversal.<br/><br/>One of the main purposes of the original film was to do the impossible and have bad guy Wade save Dan Evans to live on because bad guy (Wade) had a human moment and for a myriad of reasons -- perhaps he realized what decency was like in the experience of being taken through dangerous ground unharmed by good guy Evans -- helped the both of them escape the gang.<br/><br/>This kind of storytelling is more than a shoot it up western, it's about man's humanity to man -- something we will see more of soon. The only westerns that have been loved well enough to survive are those that do show man's mental inner workings and occasional humanity to man. <br/><br/>Yet there's plenty to like in the 2007 film, but the ending spoils it for those in the audience who identify with the good guys. Wade was going to be able to escape anyway, so he could have saved Dan without too much self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>Oh, and the close-up on Wade's pistol that had a pretty crucifix -- was that supposed to allude to Wade's conversion to 'humanity.' -- Didn't work. Or to Dan's self-sacrifice? Let us pray. And there's was no satisfaction by that time in Wade's gunning his gang because Dan was already gone. Quel dommage.<br/><br/>Perhaps this remake went astray because it was too ambitious -- the father-son relation theme was played more heavily in 2007 than the 1957 movie, and the torture of Wade was outlandish -- Could be this was supposed to prove that Wade could feel pain. Also noticeable is that the bungling Potter was not played as much (that's okay though). All in all, very ambitious for a young team."
"secretagent_007","9","3","7","1 February 2008"," Yuma Has Unexpected Depth
","Life has not been easy for Dan Evans. He fought in the Civil War and lost his foot. He settled down on a ranch, then got hit with a drought. He has a family, but one of his sons has tuberculosis, the other seems to hate his guts, and his wife no longer has faith in his ability to provide for them all. And then someone burns his barn down. Evans is a man who is beat down by the world every day. He is a failure in his son's eyes because he is not a war hero and he is not a dashing rogue like he reads about in his dime store novels. This character, played solidly by Christian Bale, has one of the best setups I've seen recently - a guy who is ripe for change in his life.<br/><br/>Change comes in the form of Ben Wade (Russel Crowe), a dashing rogue just like the kind Dan's son reads about. Ben and Dan cross paths as the rancher is collecting his cows that were scattered by the barn burners. Ben proves to be a brutal man, but fair. He allows Dan to get his cattle, but relocates his horse so he can't fetch the law. Back in town, after Ben has been cornered in a saloon and placed under arrest, Dan offers to get Ben on the train to prison in exchange for enough money to save his family from all kinds of trouble.<br/><br/>This is a thrilling ride, full of shootouts and horse chases through the desert, but it thankfully stays focused on the characters in the story. Ben Wade is a conflicted character from the outset. We first see him drawing a sketch of a hawk - a small hint that maybe he was never meant to be the leader of a gang. (I gather that not many thieves back then had much artistic ability.) After he's caught, he even shows sympathy for Dan's plight, though that doesn't stop him from trying to get away when he can.<br/><br/>Like High Noon, this western is a story about a desperate man trying to do the right thing, even if it's also the foolish thing. You can't call Dan a coward and you can't call him stupid, either. Every step he takes to accomplish his mission is thought out and nothing depends on luck. One of the best new westerns in years, up there with Unforgiven, Open Range, and The Quick and the Dead.<br/><br/>(Just kidding about that last one...) http://www.movieswithmark.com"

Specifically (without giving away spoilers) pay attention to who does and doesn't get shot at during the course of the film, and ask yourself why the villain Ben Wade would go along with certain things when he is, in fact, a cold-blooded killer who wants to escape.

They share, for me, an exploration of character that the oater genre is perfectly placed to deliver because it's the culture where the influence of law is always five days away or right on the main street but incapable of providing the legal force and moral imperative needed. A man becomes judge and jury to fill that vacuum and, in the process, we get to watch the lines that define hero and villain shift and reform. But enough gobbledygook.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's Ben Wade is riveting. He's God and the devil, charming and menacing, petty and generous, and some other contrasts. Crowe develops Ben Wade into the man who slaughters his gang of cutthroats one moment, boards the Yuma prison train to pay respect to Dan Evans, and then whistles for his horse like the Lone Ranger summoning Silver to rescue him from the cliff face. Christian Bale is equally compelling as the rancher wrestling with his own set of values, a moral man needing to justify himself to the outlaw. In sharp contrast is the completely evil Charlie Prince. Ben Foster is two-gun Darth Vader; he owns every moment he's on screen. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a visually appealing story, directed with understanding. It even has Peter Fonda showing his skills and not enough of beautiful Gretchen Mol. Unlike some, I didn't care much for Logan Lerman's William Evans. I guess I've seen enough of hormone-ravaged teenagers taking it out on their parents.

I, for one, didn't even know that ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a remake until I read IMDb's description; westerns from the '40s and '50s are the types of movies that I usually avoid.<br/><br/>As for this movie. The most interesting aspect is that, as was the case with David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"", I ended up wondering whether or not the son is headed down the same direction as his father. But for the most part, I can't see much difference between this western and the average one. You see, ""High Noon"" was very likely an allusion to McCarthyism kowtowing; ""Shane"" was the original story of a total stranger defending a family from thugs; the spaghetti westerns gave the first accurate portrayal of life in the old west (gritty and dismal); and ""Little Big Man"" was the first movie to side with the Indians (and of course ""Blazing Saddles"" totally trashed the genre). But to this movie's credit, it does show the Chinese working on the railroad, which is what really happened.<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth seeing, but I wouldn't recommend it above most other movies. Starring Russell Crowe, Christian Bale, Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda. Imagine that: Peter Fonda went from ""Easy Rider"" to a remake of a western."
"jaddison383","7","3","7","17 January 2008"," A Thriller of a Western
","In a genre that has long been dormant comes this film: a passionate, fast-paced, and thrilling adventure. 3:10 to Yuma is a Western with all the classic moments you hope for, and yet enough twists and intelligence to be original.<br/><br/>Dan Evans is a rancher at the end of his rope and in need of cash to pay off debts. By chance, he agrees to escort a captured outlaw, Ben Wade, to the 3:10 to Yuma; the train that will take him to court and hanging. Wade's gang is close behind and being led by a murderous sidekick. And there's more to both men than what meets the eye...<br/><br/>The character of Ben Wade is played brilliantly by Russell Crowe. Wade seems like a true gentlemen when you talk to him- but then without warning, his violent and deadly outlaw self can come out. And when it does, he becomes truly a thing of terror. Though not quite as terrifying as his sidekick, Charlie Prince, played eerily by Ben Foster in one of the best performances of the year. Christian Bale plays Dan, a rancher who is desperately seeking something to save both himself and his family.<br/><br/>With a pulsing bass-driven score and action sequences you won't soon forget, 3:10 to Yuma is well-worth a watch. While staying true to the beloved Western genre it also brought new energy and life into it, creating a film that is not only exciting, but also thought-provoking. That is a great achievement. 7/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"Extremesplash","8","3","7","15 January 2008"," Best Western since Tombstone
","This remake of the classic 50's western was truly one of the most entertaining movie-going experiences I've had this year. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe again do not disappoint. Both actors add a level of depth to characters that could've just as easily been archetypes for good and evil. And the movie itself could've easily been edited down to receive a PG or PG-13 rating, but I'm glad the filmmakers decided against that in order to show the grittiness of the Old West. The supporting actors also did a fantastic job, especially Ben Foster. Foster has been surprising me lately with how he disappears into a role. I didn't recognize him as The Stranger in ""30 Days of Night"", just the same as his role as Charlie Prince in this film. Some may argue that this doesn't live up to the original, but the strong performances all around and the grittiness lacking in the original should set this apart."

","How on earth can anyone like this astoundingly moronic tripe??!! The plot holes are so gaping that stagecoaches can waltz through them.<br/><br/>First of all, let's give 'credit' where it's due. Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. These are the three idiots who came up with this retarded script. And since Welles was part of the original as well, there's simply no excuse.<br/><br/>The movie starts off quite promisingly actually, with a nice barnburning and an impressively shot robbery(no pun intended). You start to feel comfortable that this just might be a hassle-free ride with eye-pleasing visuals. But then, slowly but not-so-subtly, the alleged scriptwriters embark on their film-long mission of insulting your intelligence.<br/><br/>Mission Outline- <br/><br/>-Peter Fonda(McElroy) gets shot point-blank in his stomach. Nothing wrong with that, so should've been the scriptwriting trio. But then after a couple of hours and what appeared to be a pinching out of a bullet he's not only up and running, but also fit enough to ride horses through mountainous terrain.<br/><br/>-Russell Crowe plays a brutal, merciless killer albeit with a supposed aura of charm around him. But he must've possessed macaroni for brains as even after knowing almost the precise duration within which his initially misdirected eventual captors would return, he decides to stay back and cool his heels in the middle of a small inhabitation. <br/><br/>-Crowe kills with gay abandon and by using various means to do so. Whether it's by repeatedly stabbing someone in the throat with a small fork, or by shooting someone in the temple or neck, or by throwing someone over a cliff. What do you do with such a man? Christian Bale and Co. show you exactly what to do. 1. Make him have dinner with you in your house sitting right beside your wife and kids. 2. Handcuff him and keep his hands in front of him, rather than behind. And that too, loose enough to let him handle any weapon he pleases. 3. Let him ride on a horse of his own alongside you. 4. When given the choice between risking your own life to save him from some men, one of whose kid-brother he'd killed, and walking away, choose the former. 5. Risk and attain certain death to get him on a train to a prison from which, as he's already told you, he's escaped twice. <br/><br/>-Crowe's posse, led by Ben Foster, ride for miles and miles in intense heat with the single minded pursuit of saving their boss. They face fire and brimstone, eliminate threats on the way, raise a whole town against his captors and during this are also caring enough to give their boss back his favourite hat and gun which he'd lost when he was arrested. So what does Crowe do? He kills his entire posse in flat three seconds. Why? Because he'd forgotten to tell them the fact that he'd actually developed respect and admiration for the man who was holding him hostage and then was loading him up on a train to a prison. Yes, the posse had committed the gaffe of killing that man.<br/><br/>Why have I given this movie even 3 stars? For the brilliant cinematography and the two lead actors who bring at least a semblance of dignity, although in all honesty, the blame should be shared by everyone who consented to be a part of such a project. But don't worry, i still haven't listed all the plot holes. There's still enough left to make it a fun filled sleuthing experience for you. Cheers!"

","Absolutely brilliant!!...the best western I've seen since Proposition. Although the movie is a remake, the director does a wonderful job handling Hollywood's great Russel Crowe and the enormously talented Bale.<br/><br/>The story is simple, but the characters just take control. Crowe plays his negative character with grace, gaining the viewer's respect as a famous outlaw. Bale is convincing as always, using his expressions to add depth to his struggling yet brave character. Ben Foster also delivers a fine performance as a menacing and loyal partner to Wade. All his scenes were top notch...he is a star in the making!<br/><br/>A great movie for all western fans, worth traveling to Yuma for!"

","Very disappointing. It started out okay but the last 1/4 of the movie was so incredibly stupid that it ruined the whole thing. I'm a big fan of ""modern"" westerns (yes, i know it's a remake of a not so modern western), and I'm a big fan of Russell Crowe. This movie, however, was a total waste of time. The only reason that I'm even giving it a '4' is b/c I can see on my old ratings that I gave Jurassic Park III a '4' and I don't know that this movie was any worse... it certainly wasn't any better. I know, you want to watch it anyway and ""see for yourself"". Fine, go for it, but you will be doing yourself a big favor if you turn it off after the first 1:30h and just make up your own end to the story."
"scollins-29","5","3","7","9 January 2008"," awful
","I was worried when I heard the promo that said 'best western since ""The Unforgiven,"" a Clint Eastwood soul searcher. This is a modern western that seems to go nowhere. It is difficult if not impossible to have any empathy for the 'hero', Bale. He is naive, inept, has no apparent skills and should have been killed off early in the movie. His character brings nothing to the table. In every confrontation he is in, he loses. He is not credible as the protagonist.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe is credible as the ""bad guy' but only inasmuch as he kills with ease. There is no reason given as to why Crowe lets Bale live on the several occasions that he has to dispose of him and get away. Ironically, you begin to like Crowe's character more than Bale's. At the end of the movie Crowe is actually cooperating with Bale for some unknown reason. When Crowe leaps onto the train that is to take him to jail, Bale stands there with his back to the gang and they kill him, big surprise to no one!! Crowe gets off the train, kills all of his gang members who just saved him and gets back on the train and heads off to jail. Absolutely laughable!! Waste of money if you are looking for a western in the true sense."
"JoshtheGiant","9","3","7","8 January 2008"," One of the Few Remakes to Be as Good as the Original
","This is one of the few remakes that is just as good as the original. I only had one qualm. It was that Wade was less menacing this time, due to the fact that he kept trying to escape. In the original it's more chilling because he never once try's to run. He just waits. The ending is also not as good as the original, but it worked. Before this film I never thought much of Mangold as a director. Walk the Line was pretty good, but the direction was the worst part of the picture. Here it is the best. He carry's the film, makes it wonderful. It's him that makes it as good as it is, the other great things just help. He points the camera directly where it should be, and with the right angle. He creates a nerve wracking mood. He has no chance at Oscar attention, but he deserves it. The performances are fantastic as well. The two leads are Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Crowe is fine as a semi psychopath. He is chilling, and it's his best work since the beginning of the decade. Bale is better though in Van Heflins roll. He is the most likable character in the film, and the best drawn. This helps Bale, but the character wouldn't have worked if played as it should have. Bale changes the character that's on the page, into something else. By the end he is less likable, and more relatable than I would have guessed. The supporting performances are also fine. Ben Foster in particular was brilliant. He was truly scary, and completely believable. I also really liked Peter Fonda as the aging hit-man who was a sort of psychopath himself. The cinematography was also very impressive, as was the score. Both are Oscar worthy in my opinion. The script was great, and much more realistic and heartfelt than I expected. All in all this is a very underrated film, and one of the best of the year. A masterpiece in everyway. I really enjoyed it as entertainment, and it also managed to be a work of art."
"Keith-18","5","3","7","2 January 2008"," Perfectly ordinary
","I've seen the greatest westerns ever made, 3:10 To Yuma (2007) wasn't in the same ballpark. Much too ordinary to rate high in any category. The cast was weak. Some great actors in roles that did much less than use their talents. The good guys and the bad guys were low in personality and just not convincing in their roles. The 2nd in command bad guy was the most convincing. The usual sheriff character was especially weak. I liked the fact that people had to load their revolvers now and then instead of shooting off 40 rounds without reloading. To compare the star's role to his other movies really sank the movie for me. Great and interesting actor in a real bore of a character. The good guy was boring beyond belief. I hope this role doesn't sink his acting career. When I think of great westerns, I think of Red River, The Big Country, Winchester '73, Bend Of The River, The Far Country, High Noon, Shane, The Searchers, Once Upon A Time In The West, My Darling Clementine."
"dbborroughs","9","3","7","23 December 2007"," A great film and one of the years best
","Its been a while since I saw this and I'm still trying to find some words.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a noted outlaw, Russel Crowe, caught in a small town. He has to be taken to a larger city with a rail connection where he will put him on the titled train. Along for the ride is a rancher, played by Christian Bale, a slightly disgraced man with a family and mounting debts who's trying to do the right thing even though his kids and his wife don't understand him or his choices. As the men get closer to the train the run into several obstacles, not the least of which are Crowe's men who are very intent on freeing their leader, no matter what the cost.<br/><br/>A remake of a 1957 ""classic"" western this updated retelling adds some shading and some violence for a creation that is uniquely its own. Violence aside this film seems to belonging more in the classic era of the western. However ""old fashioned"" though it maybe in the telling (as someone said in a review its clear that no one told director James Mangold that the western was dead), the film benefits from the muddying of the moral sensibilities since things are never as clear as the may have been in a by gone time.Why anyone is doing anything is never clear, even the hero played by Bale who is clearly carrying a chip on his shoulder the size of Montana. This grayness helps to make the good guys seem better and the bad guys worse since we know that what ever choice they have made its at great personal expense.<br/><br/>Some are hailing the film as a classic, others are liking it but not loving it. I'm really confused about it. To be certain the film is close to being, if not on, the list of best films of the year (I also keep wanting to use the term mythic, especially since it seems to shift into that mode at times). The question for me is whether its a classic or not. I've been going back and forth on the subject for the couple of hours and I still don't have an answer, which is why I can't really write about the film, even though it deserves to deeper discussion."
"funkyfry","7","3","7","5 November 2007"," solid Western action
","I didn't find the movie as fun or compelling as the original ""3:10 To Yuma"" basically because the villain wasn't quite as ambiguous and the characters weren't given as much time to develop. Luckily I haven't seen it in quite a few years so I was able to watch this re-make with much the same attitude as someone who hadn't seen the original. It's a satisfying film in and of itself, probably the most solid Western I've seen in the last few years (though I know I did miss a few chapters in this seeming Western Renaissance). The original story is by Elmore Leonard, and this film succeeds IMHO largely because it doesn't try to muck it up or modernize it too much. Other than the female protagonist (Gretchen Moll) the wife of the hero Dan Evans (Christian Bale), none of the characters feel like 21st Century people walking around in the Old West like so many newer Westerns do (and frankly, a lot of 40s/50s Westerns feel like people from the 40s walking around in the Old West. So it's a bit of a universal complaint regarding the genre). She has a line where she has to say ""We're supposed to make decisions together, aren't we?"" that really seems odd in the context of an 1860s frontier family if you know what I mean. Other than that, it's all pretty much authentic feeling as far as that goes.<br/><br/>A brief summary: Evans is a farmer who's about to lose the family farm to debt, so he agrees to help bring outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to another town where he can catch the 3:10 train to Yuma where he will be imprisoned. Evans' son William (Logan Lerman) decides to set out to help him because he doesn't think his dad is enough of a man to accomplish the task.<br/><br/>You'd expect that the boy would just get himself in trouble and quickly be in need of rescue, so the film earns itself extra points just for avoiding that cliché. However the development of the general angle of the son, father and outlaw is handled in a pretty predictable way. Because the performances are good, it all works and becomes very sad by the end when tragedy strikes. Lerman's work is very good for a juvenile actor and he looks a bit like the young Christian Slater. The story element with the 3 of them evokes some memories of the classic ""Shane"" with its domesticated man and gunslinger competing in the boy's mind for respect. In fact the movie is far more than most newer Westerns which just go through the motions of the Old West ritual (or Leone's great films, which make ritual itself the centerpiece)  the story engages many of the classic Western themes including the individual vs. society, physical might vs. justice, etc.<br/><br/>I also greatly enjoyed Peter Fonda in the movie; he's aged into quite a solid Western character actor at this point in his career. The scene with his death was one of the more striking in the film, although I couldn't help wondering why they didn't tie Ben Wade up better considering he kept escaping and killing people. There are a number of compelling action scenes in this film, in contrast to the original which as I recall really only had the tension building up to the exciting scene where Evans leads Wade to the train. In this one we have a very nice scene where the good guys actually have to rescue Wade from a vengeful railroad baron and a thrilling stagecoach robbery in addition to the climax.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, I still think Bale has yet to prove to me that he is a compelling actor. He's never embarrassing or unconvincing but I always find him nothing more than serviceable. Crowe on the other hand I haven't seen much of over the years but he really impressed me in this film; I can see why he's such a popular star. It's easy to see why William is enchanted to some extent with him, and the fact that Crowe has so much more screen presence than Bale actually does benefit this film and fit the characters. This is a Western that seems to accomplish the impossible  it will not bore young viewers addicted to fast editing and constant action, but it will also not offend those with more traditional tastes in Westerns. The music is stand-out as well, eschewing the modernist tendencies of newer Westerns like Dwight Yoakam's ""South of Heaven, West of Hell"" but also not feeling completely out of place in a newer Western. I would say this is a solid production all-around and will satisfy the hunger for Westerns for those like myself who feel seriously under-fed by Hollywood these days."

However I was terribly mislead into thinking this was gonna be good. I do not wish to discuss in depth the details of the movie but will instead point out why it was very very disappointing for me. 1. The leading role is a totally useless guy who did shoot especially well. His relationship with Russel crow was very strange in that they were supposed to be enemies but I see them helping each other out all the time when they were supposed to hate each other's guts. 2. Russel's crew came all the way to save him only to be shot dead by him in the end, and just stood there getting shot without even trying to duck-->Not logical. 3. Russel's character was very conflicted in that he did not try to run over overpower the main character in the end but fascilited his trip to the train.-->Very strange thing to do for someone who wound get hanged when he got on that train. Hell he even climbed in after killing all his crew. 4. I did not get the point of this movie as the story was filled with things that are just not logical and u don't see in real life and thus cannot move me. 5. Russel's crew were all gathered on the street right below the window where he was held last. The good guys coulda shot at least 4-5 of them from the window and thus win if they tried, but no~ they instead voted to walk out and get shot...that's friggin stupid...<br/><br/>I been reading IMDb for years now and this is the only movie I really felt commenting on as the rating was way too high or that I don't understand US culture as well as I might have imagined."

When Clint cut the hanging rope from 1000 yards it was a bit hard to believe of course.I guess they can get a way with a bit of a stretch to make a story but 3:10 went way overboard. I think if IMDb didn't force the reviews to be so long you would be reading a lot more negative ones.

This was the case for the two leads in this movie. Crowe's character, Ben Wade. And Christian Bale's character Dan Evans. Crowe's character was trying to just escape himself in the beginning. He wanted to get away and try something new. Dan wanted to just be something that, in his heart, he knew he wanted to be and what he SHOULD be.

","3:10 to Yuma was a disappointment. Many have compared it to Unforgiven, which is a true gem in the school of realism. 3:10 is so far from realism that it hurt me to watch it. So many things happen that are just plain stupid and unreal. The last thirty minutes require that you suspend disbelief, as the saying goes. Even though the cast is good and the acting is OK, the story itself is absurd. The casting is proper and all fit their roles, especially the 14 year-old son. The cinematography is good, but not great. The acting itself seems to fit the moment, though Russell Crowe seems bored at times. The original 1957 film 3:10 to Yuma with Glenn Ford is superior to this version. I was just so annoyed at many parts because of unintelligent moves or comments by the characters. Spoiler alert: One example is that Evans does what he does for the money $200. Then he is offered $1,000. to let Wade go, and he turns it down because people will wonder where he got all the money. No one in the entire film seems to care about where money comes from. Or he could simply move away. Just not smart in so many different parts. This film is greatly overrated and will show itself for what it is when the smoke settles. See Unforgiven or Lonesome Dove for realism, not this turkey."

","Saw this yesterday and was very disappointed. The acting from the two leads was below their normal standard and neither looked particularly inspired by their roles, although Crowe appeared to enjoy playing a roguish villain. At times there was a good level of tension but the pacing meant that the suspense was not really sustained. I felt the character of Ben Wade was unconvincing and lacked conviction. It fell into the trap of being a contrived and clichéd Hollywood villain more akin to an action film or even worse a TV movie and lacked the gravitas, power and humanity of characters such as Josey Wales or William Munny  which I imagine were the kind's characters and films that this was trying to emulate. Worst of all was the ending, which I won't fully reveal, but unfortunately was a typical Hollywood cop-out and completely unbelievable. The best thing in the film was Ben Foster who I agree stole every scene. He's now the go to guy for a plausible and three dimensional (and seriously deranged) baddie. But he's also shown his versatility in other films by portraying more complex characters and appearing in comedies such as 'Get Over It' and I predict/hope he will get his lead break soon."

I don't mean that in a bad way but potential film-goers need to know what they are getting in for. While the cast is uniformly excellent the question that is begged here is why was this film remade? They have lifted whole sections of dialog from Delmer's film and have really done nothing more than add realism to the violence. Sure, it is in color but to what end? Every bit of vibrancy in the image has been drained out as if they wanted to do it in black and white but didn't have the guts.<br/><br/>I really wanted to enjoy this movie but found myself checking my watch on more than one occasion particularly in the last half hour.

"filmgasmreviewers","10","3","7","8 September 2007"," Filmgasm.com's 3:10 to Yuma Review
","By: Jordan Appugliesi <br/><br/>The last WESTERN we've had in recent memory was Bandidas. Yes, the hot spicy Mexican chica's that made that film bearable and cheesy to watch; but its been a while since we've had a rough, fun, old fashioned western film and 3:10 To Yuma was the perfect way to maybe, restart that genre? (wanted or not). From the director of my favorite film of all time, James Mangold, comes 3:10 To Yuma, an old fashioned western that is biting with social commentary on wealth and poverty, full of action and fierce dialogue, and great action with a fantastic score and cinematography to boot. Westerns are films that are cheesy through out, but fitting and never laughable, usually do to its great actors.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe hasn't been this good in years and Christian Bale just adds another great film to his resume of already fantastic work. They both have great chemistry, and as all great hero's and arch enemies do, they have this respect for each other and understanding even though they are both at the tipping point of a shoot off between each other. Again, both are just fantastic and you kinda seem to ask were Crowe has been all these years, his last great film was a Beautiful Mind in 2001 or for those who were a fan of it, unlike myself, Master and Commander: Far Side of the World. This seems to be his year too, with this and the highly anticipated gangster drama, American Gangster, with Denzel Washington coming out later this year. (Yes I know he had Cinderella Man but that went missed).<br/><br/>Also the supporting cast is fantastic, with Henry Fonda who isn't on screen more than 20 minutes he is maybe the most memorable, Ben Foster is absolutely despicable, in the best way; his character is horrible but he plays him fantastically and this maybe his breakout role that will make him a household name. Everyone else was fantastic, even Luke Wilson; he makes a little cameo and it's great. The action is sparse but when its there it is memorable and thrilling, but to me the dialogue was much more fantastic because again, these two men have respect for each other, while hating each other at the same time, and Crowe and Bale have fantastic chemistry to make it work. We deal with issues of Father/Son relationships, class levels, and just plain ""who kills a guy faster with their gun"" arguments (for your information, Crowe takes the gun award).<br/><br/>The score is fantastic, very old fashioned and just classic, from the wardrobe to the dialogue it feels fresh and isn't an outcast in todays Blackberry era but it also feels like it's a classic old fashioned western that we have all seen on TV once or twice, at the least. The ending is fantastic, with again I sound like a broken record but say it with me, a gold OLD FASHIONED shoot out show down that is without a doubt the icing on this fantastic cake. 3:10 To Yuma screams the beginning of award season and it literally makes me want to run out and by my tickets for the other big contenders for the rest of the year, like my highly anticipated The Brave One and the rest of the contenders. So next week, go and take the 3:10 to Award Season because you won't be disappointed."

With its allegories to U.S. patriotism and the rising paranoia over Communism, the Delmer Daves work featured the now-quaint notion of doing the right thing and standing up for what one believes - in the face of overwhelming odds, just like the Fred Zinnemann classic that won Gary Cooper his second (and most well-deserved Academy Award).<br/><br/>Thank goodness these particular virtues were not left out of this new version, directed by James Mangold (""Cop Land,"" ""Girl, Interrupted,"" Walk The Line""). And while the violence level has been increased tenfold, the basic underlying message is still prominently displayed.<br/><br/>Playing the reluctant hero (as he did in ""Batman Begins""), Dan Evans, is Christian Bale, a struggling one-legged farmer and Civil War veteran in the Arizona Territory. When he witnesses a stage robbery pulled off by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his violent gang, he'd prefer to stay out of it, but his nature gets the better of him.<br/><br/>Ultimately, he aids in the capture of Wade, and (for money he desperately needs) agrees to help transport him to a distant town and put him on the train to Yuma Prison. He is joined by his son, William (Logan Lerman, ""The Number 23""), Pinkerton guard, Byron McLeroy (Peter Fonda, ""Ghost Rider""), railroad official Grayson Butterfield (Dallas Roberts, ""Walk The Line"")and a young doctor (Alan Tudyk, ""Knocked Up,"" ""I, Robot,"" ""Death At a Funeral"").<br/><br/>Wade's henchmen, however, led by the psychotic Charlie Prince (Ben Foster, ""30 Days of Night,"" ""Alpha Dog""), is hot on their heels. Foster is fantastic in a supporting role dripping with nonchalant evil, like Ralph Feinnes in ""Schindler's List.""<br/><br/>After encountering renegade Apaches and a revenge-minded lawman (Emilio Estevez, ""Bobby""), the guards and prisoner arrive at the depot. Unfortunately, Wade's gang gets there shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>When Prince offers the townspeople $200 to shoot anyone trying to take Wade to the depot, the only one who stands up for justice is the farmer. The concluding shootout is certainly loud and confusing, but is gripping and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Crowe is marvelous in the role, blending an almost Zen-like philosophy of Zarathustrian virtue with a violently demented killer's instinct (he callously shoots one of his own gang for a simple mistake).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, as the tortured family man trapped in a circumstance beyond his control, Bale is wonderfully understated and nuanced here. In fact, if this was not a late summer release, I'd say either of these men could cop some award nominations, but it's too early to predict anything right now.<br/><br/>Kudos must also be given to the camera work of Phedon Paramichael (""Walk The Line,"" ""Sideways""), who brings Monument Valley and other beautiful locations to life.<br/><br/>And while certainly not the greatest western film to appear on the silver screen, it is the best since ""Open Range,"" and represents a woefully under-appreciated genre very, very well."

","If you like a movie that is well thought out, well executed, well acted, well cut, action packed, and more emotionally stimulating (in a heartfelt way), than a Tarantino film, go see this movie. Funny parts, serious parts, touching at times, and fairly believable, (except for the fact that the guy with a stump for a foot can run that much without a limp). It's got it all. If you are a fan of any of the members of this cast, go see the movie. It's a great ensemble. If you feel Hollywood has been creating crap lately, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Russell Crowe kicks hard in a way only he can do. Is it the greatest western ever made? No. But at the least it's very satisfying. It's nice to see a genre that hasn't been mainstream in a while. The primary characters are all more complex than they initially seem and interesting to the end. Good guy/bad guy gets fairly muddled, except for Bale's character, who is the obvious protagonist throughout. The pacing is fairly consistent and there's a lot of creativity in cinematography. Even if you don't like westerns, it's a strong enough film to be gratifying and worth the ticket price."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","2","4","24 February 2018"," 3:10 To Yuma succumbs to the slow pace of classic westerns but its conclusion is satisfyingly gripping.
","A remake of the 1957 classic heist western with a modern visualisation that allows a new generation to enjoy the thrills. Y'all know westerns are one of my least favourite genres, and unfortunately this film includes typical traits that add to my dislike. An outlaw who goes by the name of Ben Wade is captured, to which the father of a ranch family bravely steps in to escort the prisoner to Contention (for some gold ofcourse) so that he can be brought to trial. Hot on their tail though is Wade's gang, who's loyalty result in them doing anything to get him back. As with most modern westerns (and classics for that matter) the production design is top notch. Small rural towns, desolate wastelands and ominous canyon passes. Everything looked great and director James Mangold ensured the natural environment took ownership. However, it's the screenplay that really stood out. The dialogue actually created the characters. Sure, both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were electric, heck even Ben Foster's sinister antagonising characteristics were well portrayed. But the dialogue created them. The script allowed Ben Wade to be an ominous enigma. The script enabled Dan Evans to be a courageous veteran who would do anything for his family. The dialogue between these two lead characters manifested a rivalry that gradually transforms into mutual respect. In fact, it was the only critical element that the film had going for it during its first two acts. They. Were. So. Slow! Maybe the genre isn't for me, but I just can't get onboard with a glacial paced narrative. Fortunately it's third act was tight, the shootout was utterly gripping. The gritty tension that was built up just completely unleashed itself, and it was oh so satisfying. It saved the film for me, and it goes to show that the conclusion to a story is the most important factor. One of the better modern westerns I've seen, but that's not saying much from me."
"areatw","7","2","4","6 October 2017"," Breathes new life into a dying genre
","I'm yet to see the original version of this film, but 2007's version of '3:10 to Yuma' is good enough to stand alone, without drawing any comparisons to the 1957 original. I thought this film was excellent in just about every area. From the plot to the acting and the cinematography and visuals, everything was as good as I've seen in a any modern Western film.<br/><br/>This film breathes new life into a dying genre. It's 10 years old now but we haven't had many Western films as big and bold as this one released since. In many ways it's a shame that Hollywood doesn't invest in making more modern Westerns like this one. There's definitely a market for more films like this, and part of the reason '3:10 to Yuma' stands out so much is that there is a severe lack of competition in its field. We need more films like this."
"Kungloa","10","2","4","17 August 2010"," Redemption, at any cost.
","I think above all ""the Western"" is the kind of movie genre that only interests its certain fans. Fans who love being told the oldest and most classic stories in a very straight-forward fashion.<br/><br/>I would say this movie is kind of a break from that mold, the story doesn't settle with any subject matter nor are the characters set in a black/white world.<br/><br/>Man is inherently good. This is something a lot of people believe in. Even if reality is more or less grounded in the grey area.<br/><br/>Which is where most of these characters reside.<br/><br/>Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) is a ruthless criminal, leader of an outfit of 'animals', loose but loyal henchman. It's quite the performance.<br/><br/>Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a rancher down on his luck, who seems to have found his redeeming act in bringing Ben Wade to justice. <br/><br/>These two characters and at the same time the actors, make this film what it is. A story tracing the thin line between what is right and what is wrong. And with that knowledge, making a choice."
"gwood194","10","2","4","21 July 2010"," It just works...
","The western is an interesting genre. It can work either as plot driven or character driven. If we look at the 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma, we can see an excellent example of a plot driven western - the characters are little more than stick figures moving around within the plot - Ben Wade and Dan Evans never really come to life. While the 2007 film retains and even expands the plot, it is the character development of these two that makes this movie great. Russell Crowe's Ben Wade is as complex a character as we're likely to find and Christian Bale's Dan Evans only slightly less so. Others have complained that it drags - and it is 30 minutes longer - but those parts that ""drag"" are part of the character development. Of course, individually, we like what we like and those unable to follow what these two actors are doing should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Just a word about ""based on a short story by Elmore Leonard"". The Elmore Leonard story is about 15 pages and plants only a seed of plot for the movie. That this movie could arise from that seed is masterful writing. It reminds me of ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" which is based on a 39 page short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Again, Fitzgerald's story only plants a seed for what develops into a great story. (And Fitzgerald's short story isn't even one of his better efforts.) For me, movies fall into three categories - those I can't make it through the first time, those I can watch once and enjoy, and those that I can watch again and again, picking up something new each time. This is one of those in that last category."
"CarmaChan","10","2","4","19 July 2010"," This remake is a huge improvement on the original.
","I saw this version for the first time last night on cable TV and was totally engaged and very impressed. Today I watched the original with Glenn Ford, who did a great job as Ben Wade, but I have to say that this remake is a huge improvement on the original. There are many changes in the story and I applaud every choice. The casting is excellent - Logan Lerman, the actor who plays the 14-year-old son in this version - did an outstanding job and stole the show, in my opinion. My favorite part is where he believes there is an ounce of decency in this murderer, and Wade tells him he has to be rotten to the core to lead this bunch of animals.<br/><br/>The directing is also a big improvement... the closeup on the Gatling gun and the rolling of a cigarette in the opening robbery scene are subtle tell-tale signs that they are expecting big trouble.<br/><br/>Ben Wade is so much more heinous in this version and it's important that he should be - it gives more credibility to Dan Evans' reasons for risking his life.<br/><br/>The dialogue is purely outstanding - ""I'm not stubborn."" What a perfectly timed conversation! Great casting, performances, editing, everything - APPLAUSE!!!"

","I am going to write a quick little review for 3:10 to Yuma. I only saw the film once. Which is a real shame because I thought it was awesome. Everything about 3:10 to Yuma is awesome. Russell Crowe is a badass. Christian Bale gives a good performance, not as good as Russell Crowe's but is still good. The film actually has a lot of celebrities in it. Ben Foster is in it as the villain and I think Luke Wilson was in it for a bit. So was Alan Tudyk, who was incredibly brilliant in Death at a funeral. <br/><br/>In short, 3:10 to Yuma is awesome. Before I end my review let me say one more thing. The ending is amazing and it slaps a smile on your face. Without a doubt, Russell Crowe gives the best performance in the film. 3:10 to Yuma was one of the best films of 2007. Awesome, awesome stuff, man.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma:****/****"

","As a general rule, I hate westerns. I can't relate to them enough to care about the characters. Even when I can see there's something worthwhile in the story, the trappings of the genre place enough of a disconnect to keep me out of the story.<br/><br/>It was with much trepidation that I took a friend's recommendation to watch this movie. I agreed mainly because I respect both Bale and Crowe enough to give it the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Despite being somewhat talky, there's not much in the script to make it something the movie can rely upon. In the end, do I honestly believe that the two lead actors to embody characters that can forge enough of a bond that the facades fall away and they have to deal with each other as real people?<br/><br/>With due credit to Logan Lerman, acting as a mirror to the hearts of both of the leads, I can honestly say that Crowe and Bale each achieve their formidable task. <br/><br/>I walk away wondering if I would have the courage to act as either Wade or Evans did, and I honestly don't know.<br/><br/>If that's not the sign of a film worth watching, I'm not sure what is. I may have to give westerns another chance."

And in the end he shoots all of the men trying to help him escape, climbs on the train and hands over his gun to the jailer on the train so he can keep his date with the hangman. This ain't no High Noon folks. I did like Peter Fondas character, and thought he did a very good job. There was nothing wrong with the acting, but the ending was not good to say the least. I would have thought the son shooting Ben Wade would have been more realistic, and although not great, certainly a better ending."

And I have watched this movie at least 5-6 times over the last two years. As a young 29 year old male I must say I was more then intrigued with the outlaw Ben Wade, simply a brilliant character brilliantly played by crowe. But what really got me is the pure guts of Dan Evans, the father, played by bale. I would recommend this movie to anyone as I think this movie has something for everyone in it.

","""Every way of man is right in his own eyes."" - Wade quoting the Book of Proverbs, 3:10 TO YUMA.<br/><br/>Every modern Western released after Eastwood's mighty 1992 elegy has laid hollow claim to ""The best western since UNFORGIVEN."" 3:10 TO YUMA is.<br/><br/>That's because - like UNFORGIVEN - YUMA is not a ""Western,"" but an operatic tale set in the old west, balancing themes of honor, cowardice, heroism, paternalism, on the simplicity of the road movie, the buddy movie, with magnificent performances, nuanced, subtle, graceful, uncompromising.<br/><br/>Phew, my thesaurus is bloody...<br/><br/>A crippled rancher, Evans (Christian Bale), must escort notorious captured outlaw, Wade (Russell Crowe), miles into town to put him onboard the 3:10 p.m. prison train to Yuma... With all hell on their trail in the form of Wade's gang, led by maniacal Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), pursuing his boss with a single-mindedness bordering on homosexual.<br/><br/>Set in the 1880s, shortly after the Civil War, we meet rancher Evans (Bale), down on his luck, one foot lost to the war (in a heroic battle, he tells his sons), barely supporting a wife and two boys, staring into the abyss of a drought, while the local authorities constantly try to run him off his farm to make way for a railroad...<br/><br/>While Wade (Crowe) nonchalantly robs a bank stagecoach, letting his men do the misdeeds while he draws pictures and moves in after the bloodletting. The savagery of his men washes over him without effect; he is well on his way to nihilism. Their loyalty means nothing: he emotionlessly guns down one of his gang taken hostage by the stagecoach driver, to remove the driver's advantage - then he guns down the driver...<br/><br/>Wade is so arrogant about his power and indifferent about his fate that he calmly rides into the town where the stagecoach was headed, has a drink and uses the fact that he looks exactly like Russell Crowe to seduce a bargirl into bed.<br/><br/>The lives of the outlaw and the rancher intertwine when Evans happens to be in town when Wade is captured, and accepts $200 to join the posse to escort Wade to the station. ($200 was exactly the amount the army paid for his shot-off foot.) <br/><br/>Peter Fonda (renowned for his iron horse, here riding a real one) is bounty hunter, Byron McElroy, so tough that after getting shot and having the bullet removed by a veterinarian, is ten minutes later taking Wade into custody and riding out of town with the posse.<br/><br/>3:10 TO YUMA is not about the train trip or the train - it is about the journey of the outlaw and the rancher, by road and by soul.<br/><br/>Remade from the 1957 film of the same name (with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, from a short story by Elmore Leonard), director James Mangold (from the great COP LAND to the not-so-great WALK THE LINE) elevates the somewhat clichéd 1950s characters to multi-dimensional, complex people.<br/><br/>Wade is not the sneering black-hat villain of the original, and it is no accident seductive Russell Crowe plays him - charming, principled, educated; in a stopover at Evans's homestead overnight, Wade easily wins over the rancher's wife (Gretchen Mol), ""I once knew the daughter of a sea captain. She had the greenest eyes I ever saw. Like yours."" The only way we can even identify Wade as the ""villain"" is - ironically - his black hat.<br/><br/>Evans is not the respected, upright do-gooder. The town officials resent him for not surrendering his land and his family regards him as less than manly. In impassioned desperation, he tells his wife why he needs to endanger his life accompanying the outlaw to the train  redemption: ""I'm tired of the way that my boys look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't."" <br/><br/>Nuance reaches a zenith in the film's final scenes as Wade admits to Evans that he has been to Yuma prison twice, and escaped twice, and the ghost of a knowing smile flits across Evans's face... He would win back his respect this day.<br/><br/>The 2007 YUMA ends on a more powerful note than the original and Mangold and new screenwriters, Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, create a moral dilemma where Wade and Evans realize they are more like each other than each would dare admit - principled men - and were it not for the circumstances they might well have been friends. A reckoning looms - the gauntlet run through the town, the rancher and the poet villain, the rancher's boy, and the mad homosexual - and somehow, Wade and Evans both find redemption in the tragedy that unfolds.<br/><br/>In the scenes where Wade and Evans flee through the town, dodging bullets from Wade's gang and the townsfolk alike, we step outside ourselves and think, ""Jesus Christ - it's Christian Bale and Russell Crowe! - megastars together on screen!"" Amazing how they lost themselves in their characters so completely. A Brit and an Aussie playing two Wild West Americans. How does that grab ya, Yanks? Guess it's still not as offensive as Chuck Connors playing GERONIMO.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","The original ""3:10 to Yuma"" was stagy and turgid at times, but it held its own as a parable for the '50s' effort to find the relationship between what we say we believe and what we are actually willing to live with.<br/><br/>This version just doesn't come close. It has no sense of humor and the tone is unremittingly grim. The characters are unlikeable, so the actors are left with a thankless job, trying to keep us interested in people we'd rather not ever meet again. Mangold tries to put bite in the script by resorting to larger-than-life Western clichés, like the two-gun killer in the grey coat, and the young boy's ""surprising"" (not) acts of heroism, but these only look anachronistic and out of touch with the film's excessive realism in design. Finally, the camera work is just dull, and the editing is a hatchet job, especially in the action sequences.<br/><br/>This was touted as a resurrection of the Western genre, but I have no idea why. But the general feel of the film did remind me a little of the old ""Gunsmoke"" TV show, which tended to get talky and dull; but ""Gunsmoke"" did have a solid rock to stand on in the character of Sheriff Matt Dillon. That's who this movie needed, desperately. Unfortunately, he never arrived."

","I was excited to see this movie, even though people had been badmouthing it to me, because I love westerns and the cast sets up expectations obviously. Anyway, I'm not going to waste vast amounts of time on this movie, so I'll make it short. I was impressed with the first half of the movie, where Russel Crowes character still had credibility and the allegiance of Christian Bale was still undefined. Actually the best thing about this movie I find, was the mystery of Bale's undecided sympathies, that seemed a potential for an original turn in the plot. When this edge was taken off quite early in the movie, in the Ranch-scene, the only thing I had going for me was Russel Crowe's character that eventually also came over the top. I agree he is an incredible actor, but his character just wasn't good enough to make the whole movie. The whole intellectual villain with a heart and a warped sense of religion wasn't anything new and not as good as when done before. Personally I wish I re-saw Tombstone or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, Sometime in the West or any other classic western than wasting my time on this second-grade movie.

That's all well and good, but every now and then you want the gifts a solid narrative offers, characters you can identify with, and real life issues you can care about. At moments like that, watch ""3:10 to Yuma."" Director James Mangold keeps the tension high. Christian Bale, as Dan Evans, a one-legged Civil War vet trying to keep his struggling Arizona ranch together, gives one of the best performances in recent film. He is always 100% true to the material. He brings Dan Evans to life. While watching Bale convey common decency, desperation, and quiet strength, I kept wondering, ""Where did Bale learn that? Where is he getting that from? What is he calling on?"" Bale's performance is all the more impressive given that he's up against Russell Crowe as the charming, evil outlaw Ben Wade. Small parts are beautifully cast. Ben Foster makes an impact with his depiction of Wade's sartorially dashing underling, Charlie Prince. Gretchen Mol as Dan's wife Alice, Alan Tudyk as a caring veterinarian, Peter Fonda as a Pinkerton man, the great beauty who plays a woman Wade takes up with for a brief assignation, the railroad men who torture Wade  every actor is perfect.<br/><br/>""3:10 to Yuma"" is the kind of film that thinking people discuss the next day after seeing it.

Yes, the ending was a complete surprise, so much so that it was completely unbelievable, as was the rest of the movie.

"anithegregorian-2","8","2","4","20 April 2008"," Who says all the good guys have all the dignity?
","I watched this movie on a DVD which one of my friends brought. Heres the catch-line that I made after wathcing it -> Who says that all the good guys have all the dignity? The movie starts with Rusell Crowe pulling off a big loot with his nasty and mean gang members by using Chritain Bales cattle (Christian Bale being a ranch owner is on the lookout for his cattle). Crowe is one of the most wanted and famous hoods (outlaw) wanted in almost all the counties. As the movie progresses you get that feeling of hatred for the villainous Crowe, how evil, sadistic and mean he is, Crowe certainly takes the charm over Bale through out the movie. The way Crowe confronts the Bar Girl, Bales wife, the way he keeps drawing all the pictures of everyone he meets or every good thing he sees; that maybe his way of easing the pressure or just relaxing, but believe me CHICKS DIGG THAT! :) So, you wonder why all the bad guys have all the good girls well, start drawing pictures or just need to get witty and bad like Crowe I tell you; Naaaah Im just kidding, but wait there's some truth in there about what Im trying to say. There are some perks in between where Crowe takes care of the Apaches and helps the Crew get out of the tunnel. Then comes the climax where Bale needs to prove himself to his kid that his father ain't a coward, so Bale decides to take Crowe to the train at 3:10 to Yuma singularly. Crowe consistently tries to push Bale over the edge about why he's doing this, why he's going thru all this pain of putting him on the 3:10 to Yuma? but Bale's ignorant answers keeps Crowe thinking. Crowe(Ben Wayed) is a smart, witty and intelligent outlaw he doesn't need all the answers he is smart enough to figure that out on his own. Then comes that gripping moment when Bale has to get Crowe out from the Motel singularly to the train station and while the clock is ticking Crowe tells Bale about his childhood. About how he was casted-away by his own mother at a train station where his mother tells him to wait at the train station while she goes to take the tickets giving a bible in Crowe's hands and telling him to read that. The end of this movie proves everyone wrong! Villains are not born bad, its us who are responsible for that.<br/><br/>The movie is nicely pictured, casted and directed. Reincarnates some of the memories of good old Clint Eastwood's wild west movies. All the actors have done very well, in particularly Rusell Crowe, I mean how would you expect a Gladiator to become an evil and witty outlaw from the west in cowboy suits. Crowe is certainly the center-point of the whole movie. And I can bet that no one else could have done it better than Crowe. No offense to Chirstian Bale himself, he's also become a mature actor after his Batman success. Indeed a cheerful story that you can preach to your youglings, or just enjoy it with friends. A definite Oscar nominee should I say it is."

","Prior to now, I can reasonably say that I had never watched a Western film. I had, however, watched the Lonesome Dove miniseries which I enjoyed.

I'll discuss that more a bit later. <br/><br/>What I found most exciting about this film was Ben Wade, as I stated earlier. He is a very cunning and unpredictable villain. We sympathize with him and understand how he behaves. I mean, who could kill some guy while in handcuffs? Russell Crowe's performance was top-notch. Of all the movie villains I've see from General Grievous to Sauron, I'll always remember Ben Wade for his well-roundedness and three dimensionality. Furthermore, his sympathy with Dan was perfect. It was actually realistic; a reason I've been wary of Westerns. Even Lonesome Dove suffered from fantastical situations and character relationships. This isn't to say that Dan was a subsidiary character. Christian Bale did well in this role, and his accent was surprisingly believable. However, his importance was marginalized in favor of Ben Wade.Still,I'm impressed with the variety of Bale's film roles. He is a real actor,not a movie star.Interestingly, this film is similar to the first Batman film. The villains are the focus and the heroes serve to develop them in various ways. Finally, I loved how the film ended. Both Wade and Evans had conclusions to their characters. It was a tragic ending that actually worked. Ben probably escaped and Dan put him on the train.<br/><br/>Another point of interest is the music. Most films from last year, with the exception of Sunshine, didn't have I-pod worthy underscoring music. This one was an exception. The music raised the tension and never felt overbearing. It also accompanied the situations well. I've thought that music can be a way of characterization, just look at Darth Vader's theme. This film is similar. Though not for individual characters, the music prepares us for the various chase sequences that occur. As with the music, the editing was good too. Most of the film is in long shots, which heighten the tension of the shootout sequences. This was especially well done when Wade and Evans were in the hotel room. This scene also provided a frame-within-a-frame which added greater effect to the scene. Mangold has proved himself a skilled filmmaker, and worthy of a viewing.<br/><br/>This was a great experience for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the remake of 3:10 to Yuma. So much, that I plan to watch the original and Mangold's other films. I cannot compare it to the original or the Elmore Leonard short story. Also, this movie doesn't suffer from any overbearing plot holes. Everything is resolved. However, as entertaining as the film is, I would forgive any minor misrepresentations of the original work. I have heard that the woman from the bar had a more important role in the original film. If you're looking for a modern action film, you can't do much better than this one. Both it and its original were well-received. It's definitely worth a viewing and a spot in your collection."

","Westerns might be making a comeback. With Americans' newfound appreciation of independent and more artistic film, such a statement isn't too off-base. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a hell of a start, showing that great acting is more important than action in making a Western. There's nothing in the action that you can complain about, in fact there's nothing in the whole film that can be complained about, but the acting takes precedence and that's what sets this film apart.<br/><br/>""Yuma"" is a remake that centers around a rancher named Dan Evans (Christian Bale) who is struggling to feed his family and beginning to doubt his image as a father and husband. He gets mixed up in the thievery of Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his band of outlaws and after Wade is caught, agrees (for the money) to be a part of a crew that is to escort Wade to a station where he is to take the 3:10 train to Yuma, or ultimately, his death. Of course the rest of Wade's bandits, led by Charles (Ben Foster) want him back and Wade will surely not be very compliant.<br/><br/>The premise is simple, but every moment of the film is exciting. If there isn't action carrying the scene, then there are the great talents of this cast that make it interesting. Crowe is very strong in the antagonist role and Bale is great as always. It is amusing how a Welsh and an Australian actor give such believable portrayals of Americans. Ben Foster is also very easy to despise and moviegoers will be sure to see him more in the future.<br/><br/>There might not be anything amazing about ""Yuma"" but I challenge anyone to find something bad or off about it. Director James Mangold is certainly credible enough to have all his bases covered. It's simply a clean cut Western with a modern mindset that makes itself clear in the characterization which is more about being real and cool than just being a cool and stereotypical cowboy. The acting gives the characters heart and really brings out the themes and morals of a film thats main intention is the action and excitement.<br/><br/>""Yuma"" is the perfect merger of a glitzy Hollywood Western action film with great drama led by great acting: the ideal film in from a money standpoint and from a quality standpoint and arguably those films deserve the most praise."

","I had fairly high aspirations for this film due to the acclaim almost everyone that I had spoken to was giving it. The thought that I hadn't seen this movie until it was finally released on DVD irked me in the sense that I would be missing the general theater experience that most movies deserve to be viewed in. I genuinely feel that ""3:10 to Yuma"" was that type of film.<br/><br/>It wasn't that this movie was bad by any means, amazing actors such as Christian Bale, Russel Crowe, and Peter Fonda are enough to make any film fairly memorable. The thing that got me about this film however were the overused western themes and lack of complete realism. It sometimes felt hard to believe that characters could be using such profanity in America's early years while managing to dodge every bullet thrown at them.<br/><br/>This appeared to me like the type of movie that you go to the theaters to see and really don't do much with it afterward. It's good enough to get the critical acclaim it seeks as a general thriller with lack of a building foundation. This movie is certainly not worth buying but for the casual moviegoer it's something that at least the men in your family will enjoy while it's on."

","Set in the years just after the Civil War, it was still every man for himself in the west.<br/><br/>The two opening scenes establish the two main characters. First we see Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and his family at night, on the homestead, and they hear a noise. It soon is clear that it is not an animal, someone had just set fire to his barn. He and his 14 year old son William (Logan Lerman) get saddles and whatever they can as the barn begins to crumble. Dan knew right away, the fire was set by one of the men working for a rich and powerful business man that he owed money to.<br/><br/>Next we see an armored wagon carrying loot and being pursued by Ben Wade's (Russell Crowe) gang. Their reputation has spread over the old west as dangerous men who will take mercy on no one. Wade even shoots one of his own men who did not perform up to expectations.<br/><br/>Eventually Wade gets captured, but his gang is still free. The task is to get Wade to prison where he can be tried and hung. As the plan breaks, they will get him to a town where he can be put on the 3:10 to Yuma prison. But getting him there will not be easy, his gang will make sure of that.<br/><br/>Dan Evans, cripple from an accident during the war, volunteers to help get Wade to the train, after he bargains for $200 for his efforts. He doesn't really want to do this, but he needs some way to get out of debt and save his family and their homestead.<br/><br/>Ben Wade is dangerous, and he is the kind of guy who always has a smile, even in captivity, and is always talking and asking innocent-seeming questions, always trying to get an edge, and usually is successful.<br/><br/>Both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are superb in their roles. Even though they are on opposite sides of the law, through their ordeal they gain a measure of respect for each other.<br/><br/>Peter Fonda is Byron McElroy, craggy old hired gun who helps protect the wagons as they carry loot across the west. Gretchen Mol is fine in a small role as Dan's wife Alice Evans.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: There is a showdown and big gunfight right before the train comes to town. Dan's 14-year-old son had followed them and provided some key assistance. In the end Dan's bravery got Ben to the train, but Dan lost his life to one of Ben's men.

","If there's one good thing to be said about remakes, it's that they raise awareness for the original films on which they were based. Before I heard about the upcoming Western to star Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, I would probably have never made the effort to track down Delmer Dave's 1957 film, which proved to be a suspenseful and entertaining gem. '3:10 to Yuma (2007)' was directed by James Mangold, and was part of the Western ""revival"" that took place last year {along with the much-awaited 'Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)' and 'No Country for Old Men (2007),' which had significant traits of the genre}. Of course, whenever a picture is remade, it is inevitable that comparisons be made between the two films, and, because I saw them just one day apart, I gathered an good understanding of the strengths and weakness of each. Is James Mangold's film, with the monumentally bigger budget, a better film than its predecessor? The answer is yes and no.<br/><br/>The plot for '3:10 to Yuma' is basically the same as the original film, though a few additional plot elements have been included, most importantly the added participation of Evan's son, William (Logan Lerman). Following a successful gold robbery that left many dead, notorious bandit Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is captured in the small town of Bisbee. A poverty-stricken rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), desperate to prove himself to his family, and especially his oldest son, volunteers to escort Wade to the town of Contention, where he is to be placed on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Meanwhile, Wade's ruthless gang, led by loathsome second-in-command Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), prepare to rescue their leader, and to murder anybody who gets in their way. As the minutes tick closer to 3:10 PM, the other volunteers either retreat or are murdered, and it is left to one man to fulfill his duty and load the wanted criminal onto the locomotive.<br/><br/>In adapting Halsted Welles' 1957 screenplay, which was based on a short story by Elmore Leonard, screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas do a decent job of ""fleshing out"" the straightforward story of the original film. The journey with Ben Wade to Contention is considerably more eventful than it was before, and the wellbeing of any one character is never assured. Additionally, Wade and Evans are given more opportunities to interact, making their respective actions in the film's final act more believable. Of course, given their previous participation in such ""dumb"" flicks as '2 Fast 2 Furious (2003),' the screenwriters evidently couldn't resist a few action-packed flourishes, and the characters' fondness for murdering every human being in sight demands that a considerable amount of disbelief be suspended. Some killing here and there is certainly important to show that the bad guys mean business, but, with the biggest body count I've seen in a long time, I wonder if it was all necessary. No self-thinking bandit, however angry and determined, would ever pointlessly shoot a town Marshall after his surrender, lest an entire cavalry be unleashed on his tail.<br/><br/>Where Mangold's film decisively matches its predecessor is in the primary casting decisions, with both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale delivering intense and compelling performances. Bale, as Dan Evans, is a unique Western hero, in that he's not very heroic at all, and might easily be dismissed as a coward. However, his resolution in delivering Wade to the authorities reveals a streak of gallantry that his prisoner comes to admire, and, in recognising his captor's heroism, Wade himself uncovers a sense of nobility within himself. Throughout the film, in the quiet moments dispersed within his chaotic lifestyle, Wade finds himself sketching the images he admires: an auger buzzard perched on a tree limb, the beautiful bar-maid naked in bed, and, finally, Dan Evans watching vigilantly from his rocking chair, shotgun cradled over his knee. Despite insisting that he is ""as rotten as hell,"" we are shown a righteous side to Wade's personality, one that clearly detests the actions performed by himself and his gang members, despite the knowledge that, whoever these bandits killed, they killed them out of respect for him."

","I enjoyed the way the story was told. The actions of the characters seem at times to be counterintuitive or ludicrous. I often found myself thinking ""why the hell would he do that?"" As the movie continues and the story begins to unfold the ""whys"" get answered with bits and pieces of dialogue ""filling in the blanks"". Great story telling! Before watching this movie I read some of the reviews written. It seems that a lot of criticism focused on holes in the plot or a ridiculous story line. I personally can't remember the last movie I've seen that didn't leave out some aspect of the story. Do you really expect the writers to hold your hand and explain every detail of the movie's story or characters? BORING! If you need this kind of guidance I suggest you try sticking to movies geared towards the 5-10 year old audience range. Oh wait; even that audience would have an imagination capable of ""filling in the blanks"" for themselves.<br/><br/>My favorite character by far was Charlie Prince played by Ben Foster. A sly, cunning killer with a sick sense of wit. The man marches straight into the Marshals office, pretending to be an innocent witness, to report a murder and robbery he had just participated in.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast played their respective roles excellently. Bale and Crowe both are great actors and I enjoyed their character portrayals.<br/><br/>I enjoy watching movies for their varied artistic expressions.

"EijnarAmadeus","8","2","4","29 January 2008"," Entertaining and decent remake
","Teaming up Christian Bale and Russell Crowe for a high-noon and gunslinging western seems like a good idea, it seems even better when it's Walk the Line-director James Mangold who's operating this. Although Walk the Line suffered from being a straight-faced drama, he knew how to get the best out of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Whiterspoon - and that surely promises good things for Bale and Crowe to come.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays the gunslinger Ben Wade, a black-hearted villain who (as usually) has got a pounding, charming heart for sketching and women. Christian Bale is the family man Dan Evans, with a heavy debt to pay he decides to lead Wade (together with some other, amateurish men) for the reward of 200 pounds.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is a bit of a disappointment, after watching it you get the weird feeling of all the things they could have done different. But after all, while watching it is a enjoyable movie that's got a fine look for down-in-the-dirt Wild West and pulls out believable characters and story. Crowe acts Wade with a professional glee, as soon as Evans' oldest son William gets drawn into the picture, it's obvious that the 14-year-old ""disappointed-over-his-pa"" boy is more fascinated than scared by Wade. And that's not the only thing that gets a bit too calculated, the plot swifts easily throughout without eager to surprise or swagger. By the time Bale and his gang starts heading Crowe for the 3:10 train to Yuma, the movie feels a bit dried up, not very boring, but not all that interesting. However, the movie pulls out a great card by the end, it's a solid, though not thrilling, ending that puts some sparkle into this deserted story. Don't get me wrong; 3:10 to Yuma has got a straight-forward, tight story to tell, but Mangold should have been twirled some pieces and kept the viewers more off-balanced, making it a welcomed western-installment for its originality. Instead Mangold makes some of the same mistakes he did with walk the Line, he plays it too much by the rules.<br/><br/>Bale and Crowe are better together on the screen than apart, their dialogs may not blister, but they're just as neatly tied together so actors of their class know how to handle the material, and its especially Bale's Evans, who's at first a bit-of-a-bored character, who shines through as a earnest, struggling man, risking his family security so he can bring justice to a man who keeps him worried about them in the first place. The action set-pieces are decent, they play out like a 2007-version of a Bonanza episode; a bit more brutal, a bit louder and much slicker. 3:10 to Yuma doesn't feel like it finds its place, and does thereby suffer from this; but in the end it's a decent Western."
"ShrinkSteve","9","2","4","27 January 2008"," ""Confusing ending"" requires attention through the movie! (some hints rather than outright spoilers)
","Plenty has been written already about the outstanding work of the actors in this film, by viewers who know much more about movies and acting than I. However, one point has been raised that should be addressed by someone who knows behavior. That is the confusion some feel at the ending of this movie. <br/><br/>Without spoiling the actual ending, even though many have done so in previous posts, I offer this: it is not that Crowe's character grows to respect Bale's character, but, that he sees, for the first time, in Bale's character, a man who does as a father should do. Watch the scene in the hotel, when Bale's character sends his son away, before the ""walk"" to the train. Watch Crowe's face. It is here he begins to change. It would have been easy anywhere along the journey from the hotel to the train station, for him to take control, but he doesn't. When that critical moment comes when he is about to, Bale's character reminds him of that relationship he has with his son, and again, Crowe's character has no choice but to try and preserve something of the dignity of one man trying to something good, against incredible odds, with no real self-interest served, but the interest of his son given the highest priority. <br/><br/>Crowe's character describes his father, earlier in the movie. This is very revealing and lays the groundwork for his ""change of heart"" later in the movie. In the final scene, he sees his fantasy destroyed, then is shown mercy by the son, how could he do anything but what he does? I think the director astutely shows how this leopard's stripes really haven't changed, however, when Crowe's character gives his little whistle, his ultimate intentions are revealed.<br/><br/>Sometimes it is hard for us to understand the ""morality"" of a criminal. However, even a criminal of Wade's proportion, has some ""rules"" to live by. When he is one on one, and is forced to think about individuals, he makes moral decisions of his own. When he is at a distance, and doesn't have to know those he might destroy, it is easier and causes him less distress to do so. Just watch the decisions he makes throughout the film and you will see the conflict he obscures with that cool, vicious, yet charming charade. Beautifully portrayed by Crowe. Hats off to a man who knows people, as all great actors must! <br/><br/>Lastly, kudos to Bale, for I have yet, prior to this movie, seen him give such a subtle and convincing performance of such a complex character. His Batman was hard to swallow, and I couldn't stand him in The Prestige. What a difference here. I have little doubt that Crowe's stellar work in this film challenged Bale to give his all to this role. I look forward to more work of this caliber from him in the future!"
"drystyx","5","2","4","26 January 2008"," excellently done
","This was what you call an excellently done movie. First, it is a Western, and a remake of the classic Heflin film, though not the best script. What is so astonishing is how true to the original this movie is made. It does pay homage to it, and much of it is word for word, while at the same time, punctuating itself with it's own soul. <br/><br/>Perhaps the main weakness is that this version is much more ""Hollywood"", with the over the top unkillable perfect evil machines, and the total contrivance of a ""Natural power order among humans"". This part is, I admit, way too Hollywood.<br/><br/>In the original, Heflin, one of the greatest Western actors of all time (Shane, Gunman's Walk, Stagecoach), dominated the movie with a superior performance. But lets be honest, he also had the help of excellent writing for his character. The remake alters his character somewhat, from a simple man of the era, trying to make ends meet, and retaining his dignity; into a simple man more in tune with our era. The character isn't as well written, but Bale knew he was following in gigantic footsteps, and his performance is outstanding, going above the written word so to speak. The other chief character, the charming, but deadly outlaw, was revolutionary in the time of the original, and may have been better done in other movies (Robert Ryan in ""The Naked Spur"" and Barry Sullivan in ""7 Ways to Sundown.) It became a trademark of the classic Western era, but still in the experimental stage. Ford was a very good actor, but he just didn't seem to cut it for this film the way some other actors did. Crowe's performance in this remake was monumental, but to be fair to the original actor, Crowe had a lot more to study from. This doesn't detract from his performance, however. I almost hate to single out Crowe's performance, although I believe it to be Oscar worthy, because everyone in the film was outstanding. This tells us not only that the casting crew deserved note, but also the director (who elicits the performances), the film editing crew (helping to make good cuts), the film crew (for making such good cuts), and actually everyone else. This was obviously a well oiled machine. I do have a gripe with the Sound, because I had to constantly adjust it, and lost much of the early dialog, but having done some film work myself, it is an ongoing joke among film people that sound people don't know what the H... they'e doing. Again, much like the original, which also had a well oiled machine, and no weak spots. A good film (in a year of some of the worst films on record), makes this a good choice for rental."

But it delves more into the psyche of an eccentric outlaw(crowe), a one-legged rancher(bale) trying to *man* up for his family and children and the relationship that develops between them. Christian bale delivers good performance, just short of a great one. It reminds me of al pacino in donnie brasco. The normal tough guy playing the weakling. Its difficult for them to pull it off because the audience is used to seeing them in a different shade and they themselves have to let go of their normal selves and natural instincts to put up a character like that. There are times in this movie when Bale lets the normal Bale come to screen and i felt that at odds with how the rancher should have been. But thats only once or twice in otherwise a great performance.<br/><br/>The movie has its share of clichés, like a bible-reciting,painter,womanizer outlaw and others and heck i wouldn't say there is much novel about the story/screenplay. But it's just well done and there is no dull moment in the movie. The score is also reasonably good. My final word would be: its not an action/western as might seem and if thats all you are going for, this ""might"" be a disappointment. But its an entertainer alright and will definitely grab your attention for as long at it lasts."

The Good, the Bad and the ugly. Shane. Unforgiven. High Noon. The sons of Katie Elder. The series of 'The Virginian'. And the remake of the 3.10 to Yuma joins that list. There is all you want from a good western (I don't do politics so there is no revisionism comparison in this review). The baddies are really bad, the good guys are truly good yet naive and unsteady. What makes it special is the deeper human touch that runs trough this movie. The interaction between the characters is allowed to develop throughout. Also the use of scenery is kept to a minimum so as not to interfere with the developments. Great movie, great entertainment and contrary to some reviews I thought the ending was appropriate!!

In fact, he takes over much of the attention at should be given to Russell Crowe as well. Crowe is given a hard and complicated role, yet he did brilliantly. In my opinion, Crowe's character, the outlaw Ben Wade is the more interesting. It is like the film is just a glimpse of Wade's life where there is so much more going on. Many people will be confused at the end by Wade's choices. But if we watch Crowe more carefully, there are many subtle hints through out the movie that will explain a lot about this special character, that in the end, you won't be able to characterize him as good or bad. The film is beautifully directed, very well paced. The music and cinematography are powerfully done. The only weak point of this movie is the acting of Logan Lerman who plays William. But it is a hard role for a young actor so it's understandable. This is one of those movie that will grow on you as you watch it over and over. I rate it 9/10."

","Seen on a double bill, I hardly expected to like this movie more than ""A Fistful of Dollars"", but damned if it ain't true. In spite of the rather silky Bush-era hairstyles, it's a ringer for a good A western of the classic era - no doubt because it lifts most of its script from one. Like all my favourite Westerns, it is anti-heroic; the good guys and bad guys shade into each other until there's some doubt about who is who, and it manages this without being corny. Themes aside, it's been a long time since I saw a movie that packed this much visual information into its first five minutes; the set pieces are all riveting; the performances live up to the production - it obliterated my Russell Crowe block. My minor complaint is that the fleeting outsider's nod to the Chinese railroad slaves should have been more detailed and defined; as it is it feels like guilty liberalism. My major complaint is about the ending; there's a couple ways to take it ideologically I guess, but the bottom line is that it just doesn't work. But it wasn't such a turnoff that I didn't spend a long time thinking about it, and overall this is way better work than I expect from Hollywood these days."
"Monotreme02","8","2","4","6 December 2007"," A brilliant character study; an old-fashioned Western with a modern twist
","As beloved as it is, it cannot be denied that the Western is a dead genre, and for justified reasons. The same all-American clear-as-crystal stark morality of good versus evil that attracted us to the comic book superheroes of the second World War period also drew us to the heroic endeavors of the old American frontiersmen who explored and developed the far west. Ethics in the classic Westerns were simple: The good, honest men wore white and always defeated the bad, criminal men who wore black in a showdown. One could almost say that the old Westerns glorified the post-Civil War western frontier, which truly was a dark, difficult, and dangerous life for those who chose to live it. But this kind of morality quickly wore off, and when America turned to more complex super-heroes so the stark good-versus-evil morals of the Western genre began to outstay its welcome. Since then, Westerns saw only one other renaissance in the form of the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60's, whose morals were present but somewhat twisted. Since the 60's the Western genre saw few resurgences, the last one in the turn-of-the-90's with Kevin Costner's epic Dances with Wolves and Clint Eastwood's opus, Unforgiven. And now, we have another resurfacing of the genre with 2005's The Proposition and 2007's 3:10 To Yuma and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.<br/><br/>What is so good about these modern-day Westerns is that they are just that; old-fashioned stark morality is replaced by modern-day foggy-lined morals; 3:10 To Yuma provides an exquisite example of these plays on morality. Here is a hero that just wants to scrape by his simple farm life and performs heroic acts for selfish reasons only  erasure of debts, monetary reward, and his family's well being. Here is a villain who is obviously superiorly intelligent than his crew of cutthroats and who seems more preoccupied with bible verses and drawing sketches of nature than a life of crime. It's every man for himself, just like it was in the actual frontier.<br/><br/>I must admit, I haven't seen the 1957 original, but James Mangold does an exquisite job in his re-make/re-imagination. Although the film is overall old-fashioned, it still features many modern film-making techniques aside from the blurry morality of the brilliant screenplay and the down-and-dirty depiction of Wild Western life. Hand-held cameras and very modern-styled action photography are wonderfully employed, and in general the cinematography is a wonder to behold; naturalistic while managing to be stimulatingly beautiful. Mangold also directs like a modern director, allowing his brilliant actors to explore their characters and deliver powerhouse performances full of nuance and subtlety.<br/><br/>Indeed the entire ensemble cast can be mentioned in good light, especially supporting actors Peter Fonda as the scarred, craggy old bounty hunter who is one of the best examples of blurry morality in the film; in this chapter of his life he is under contract for the ""good guys"", but we learn that he has had no problem in the past murdering women and children; and Ben Foster, who delivers a truly scenery-chewing and brilliant performance as outlaw Ben Wade's clearly deranged right-hand man. But the true wonder lies in the film's two top-billed actors, among the best of their generation: Christian Bale and Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>The two plays off one another to absolute, pitch-perfect brilliance, and both manage to find the niches of both of their characters. It's wonderfully fascinating to watch how Crowe plays Wade as enjoying his playful-but-deadly manipulations of the party accompanying him to the train that will take him to Yuma prison to be tried and hanged. Only Bale's Dan Evans can provide the proper contrast to this, as his straight-man routine is coupled with obvious intelligence. He seems out of place in this landscape and we learn that he was originally from Massachusetts but was forced to move to the dry weather of the western frontier due to his young son's illness. For someone with so much to lose, we the audience  and even the characters in the film, including Evans himself  don't know exactly why he is so stubborn in delivering Wade to the train. Is all the trouble really worth the $200 reward? Or is Evans simply trying to prove something to his wayward eldest son who doesn't have faith in his father, who is embarrassed to tell him the tragically un-heroic way he lost his leg in the Civil War. The ""battle of wits"" reaches a climax as the two sit in a hotel room near the end of the film, waiting patiently for the train to arrive. The little conversation they have is rather banal, but we learn so much from the characters just by seeing how Evans is willing to open himself up to the outlaw, and how Wade listens intently to his story.<br/><br/>Like the greatest intelligent movies, 3:10 To Yuma is a character study of the kind that the characters don't have one simple trait that identifies them but rather are three-dimensional, fleshed out human beings who fascinate us with their unclear intentions, fears, regrets, mistakes and quirks. The film is incredibly well acted from its ensemble cast in general and its two stars in particular, and Mangold truly delivers the goods on the directing plane with his old-fashioned film-making with a modern twist in terms of the cinematography and action directing. This is a fascinating, realistic and brutally honest portrayal both of the 19th century Western frontier and of the morality of men, and is an extremely satisfying, entertaining and well-made film in general."

","I'm actually not really much of a 'western-fan'... my favorite movies within the genre are 'Young Guns I+II' - which should say it all.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe has always been one of my favorite actors and Christian Bale... well - he has had his ups and downs in my view (some of his best are The Prestige, Batman Begins and Equilibrium/Cubic... the worst are American Psycho and Shaft). But my view on Christian Bale has changed completely - from this movie on he is in my good book.<br/><br/>Rarely have I seen a better western - it has everything (though the indians only have a very small part to play in it)- the saloon, the gun fights, the good guys (with white hats) and the bad guys (with black hats) - and of course - the sheriff who actually shouldn't be a sheriff at all... But apart from all these very common things in all westerns, this movie has both feeling, morale and empathy. The story is intriguing, the plot is deep - and good, the acting is superb, the camera guys should get a raise and the instructor likewise a lot of equally good scripts (with equally good actors).<br/><br/>I am not going to give any spoilers - any preview you see or read will say it all, but if you're going to see only one western movie this side of the century - make sure that this is it. I have recommended it to all of my friends - and have yet to hear an 'it is OK' or a 'that is not a movie for me at all'... and we do - oftenly - not share the same taste in movies...<br/><br/>From Denmark - two thumbs up and 9/10 (can't be a 10 because I'm more of a horror-man than a western-man... but as good as 'Young Guns'... or maybe even better...)"

So when I was watching a movie there was a preview that caught my attention mostly cause of the combination of Russel crow and Christian bale and a unique story (later found to be a remake).But any way the two stars of this film really do a great job the whole time you are drawn into this movie. You get a few different ideas of what it was like to live in those times by the life style you choose. Rare aspect of this film is great acting :) as I said before just really worth seeing that part. The story line is very well written too. Would recommended for kids over age 13 years old, so you could sit down with the family and watch this one. Bottom line if you like crow and bale and great stories from glances back when acting and plot make a good movie then take the time to view this one."

","If, like me, you were fed up watching a generation of fifth-rate westerns that were not fit to shoe the getaway horses of their predecessors from the 1950s-70s, then this film is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>I was dubious despite the great reviews as remakes of great films like the 57 version of 3.10 tend to be dire and leave me like Colonel Kurtz muttering ""The horror... the horror..."" but this one was better than the original.<br/><br/>It worked on several levels. Most importantly it was an express train of events - not just meaningless fireworks, but action leading to another action and another. But it also worked as a meditation on what happens if responsibility to your conscience and your loved ones want to go in two different directions. Much has been said about the excellent cast. Crowe in particular is icily impressive and the bible-quoting baddie. Best of all, it manages to be gripping without taking itself too seriously - it always has a heart as well as a head.<br/><br/>I've not enjoyed a western this much since The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Hats off to the makers."
"cox526","9","2","4","8 November 2007"," The best western since Unforgiven
","I read the comments earlier prior to watching this movie and they were spot on. The acting is fantastic and Oscar worthy performances throughout. It deserves best film but whether this is up for Oscars come next year who is to say, it should be and best supporting actor easily by Ben Foster who plays the ruthless gang member on the trail of his captured boss Ben Wade (Russel Crowe). His performance was the most memorable as he exhibits the resolute qualities of his captured boss. Both the antagonist and protagonist roles are well played. A well crafted and intelligent screenplay which makes for the best film since Unforgiven. Like Unforgiven it doesn't set out to show good guys as flawless and bad guys without some sensitivity. Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) exhibits all the wile and cunning of a fox to escape his captors and it is towards the end he shows a different side to that which he plays so well throughout the film. Another case in point Byron Mcelroy (Petre Fonda) who is on the good side. It is soon apparent that he is as ruthless as those he intends to bring to justice and those who are justice are equally as ruthless in other ways as the story unfolds. Only Dan Evans (Christain Bale) has any credibility as the suppressed rancher. As the story unfolds the twists in the story make the film intense and thoroughly enjoyable. It will stand out as a classic and hopefully be the revival of the western. If it is I hope for more of the same intelligently written well acted and Oscar worthy westerns. Lets hope it is nominated and gains the recognition to put it up there with Unforgiven."

","The original version of this wonderfully done remake is probably the inspiration for 16 Blocks, S.W.A.T. and other similar movies. 3:10 to Yuma is about the complications in transit taking a prisoner from one place to another.<br/><br/>Even non-fans of westerns should watch this if only for the extremely talented Christian Bale; watching any movie of his is surely time well spent. He always chooses to play interesting roles, and in 3:10 to Yuma, he plays Dan Evans, a poor, handicapped rancher who volunteers to be part of a rag tag team to take captured legendary outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to Yuma prison.<br/><br/>James Mangold (Walk the Line, Identity) does an incredible job of directing the terrific cast. Ben Foster (X-Men: The Last Stand, 30 Days of Night) is a revelation as Charlie Prince, Wade's most loyal crew member, who will stop at nothing to rescue his captured leader en route to Yuma prison. Crowe is able to make his complicated character multi-dimensional in that he is both fearsome but someone you also secretly root for.<br/><br/>Everyone does justice to the heart-wrenching script peppered with killer lines. In explaining his decision to take the prisoner on the dangerous journey, Dan frustratedly whispers to his wife Alice (Gretchen Mol), ""If I don't go, we gotta pack up and leave. Now I'm tired, Alice. I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way that they look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't."" In another pivotal scene between Dan and his teenage son (Logan Lerman), he says, ""Just remember, it's your old man that hauled Ben Wade to that station... when nobody else would."" Not all men in his situation will do what is right. Christian Bale makes the rest of us want to believe that his kind of man still exists."

","It is a great idea from the movie studios to bring back western movies, its been a long but a very long tie since I watched a good and decent western until today that I saw 3:10 to Yuma, a remake from a 1957 movie with the same name. This movie keeps the same formula of old time westerns but wit a whole new look. A very interesting story about a rancher who decides to escort an outlaw to the train station so he could take the 3:10 train to Yuma. The plot convince me a 100%, it is very well developed. Its a film with lots of action and adventure, some involuntary humor. The time line is perfectly portrayed on the landscapes, the scenery and the costume design. The direction from John Mangold is excellent, it has a very good rhythm, thing that makes the movie very enjoyable. It has a wonderful cast, Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances as the legendary outlaw Ben Wade, Christian Bale is also amazing in his role of rancher Dan Evans. A great revelation was young actor Logan Lerman in his role as Dan's older son William, it was a really good performance. In the supporting roles we have to mention Ben Foster as Charlie Prince and Peter Fonda as Byron McElroy, their acting were pretty impressive. To conclude, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very recommendable."
"takeittothemax-1","9","2","4","24 October 2007"," Combining old and new: 3:10 to Yuma.
","Cracking whips, intense chases, stagecoaches, revolvers, spectacular gunfights, with the good guy always winning: all part of the old westerns. It seems that in the modern era, audiences are more enthralled with the complex than with the simple and sweet. Rather than merely be entertained, we want to be exposed to the characters' emotions. We want to feel the heartache, anger, love, or hate of the individual rather than seeing only his good side portrayed. I must admit; I am one of these people. I don't go to the movie theater to see a fake representation of life; I want to see it as it is, with all its ups and downs and everything in between. Perhaps this is why I so enjoyed 3:10 to Yuma. The film's creators combine the flare and feel of the old with the drama and emotional complexity of the new, while in the process producing a remarkable film.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Bisbee, Arizona where the main character, Dan Evans (a one-legged Civil War veteran), lives with his wife and two sons. The film opens as Dan's barn is burned down by the landlord who is going to sell Dan's land to the railroad company. He tells Dan that he has two weeks to get off the property or the house will be next. On his way to speak with the landlord, Dan witnesses the robbery of a stagecoach by the infamous Ben Wade and his band of rebels. After Ben's arrest, Dan offers his assistance in delivering the criminal to the 3:10 prison train to Yuma (hence the movie's title). What follows is one scene of action after another, as the remains of Ben's gang hunt Dan and the others on the trek to deliver Ben.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest aspect of this movie is the acting and character development. The film's creators manage to place two excellent actors into uncharacteristic roles. Christian Bale, used to playing the part of the tough guy (in movies such as Batman Begins and Equilibrium), plays the part of Dan Evans, a cautious rancher whose reputation with the public and his own family has suffered as a result of his reluctance to use violence. Dan's youngest son has tuberculosis, and this combined with a failing harvest has his family in a tough spot financially. When the opportunity comes to make $200 by delivering an outlaw to prison, Dan takes it gladly. When speaking to his wife, Dan says, ""If I don't go, we gotta pack up and leave. Now I'm tired, Alice. I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way that they look at me. I'm tired of the way that you don't.""<br/><br/>Opposite the character of Dan, is the outlaw Ben Wade played by Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is likewise used to playing the role of a man of justice (think Gladiator). However, in this movie he plays the role of a conniving, womanizing, and Bible-quoting criminal. When asked by the doctor of the prison party whether it is true that he dynamited a wagon full of prospectors, Ben replies, ""No, that's a lie... It was a train full."" <br/><br/>In my opinion, the best movies are those that ask questions. Even better are those that answer them. 3:10 to Yuma is of the latter. It asks the question, what makes a man good, and answers with the character of Dan Evans. While Dan may not be perfect, he strives to do what is right. The film brings out the fact that good things do not necessarily happen to good people; and, in fact, in Dan's case the opposite is true. His family suffers and even resents him because of his choice to ""turn the other cheek."" Despite this suffering, he leads his family in prayer. When Dan volunteers for the job of taking Ben to the prison train, we, Ben, and perhaps even Dan himself assumes that he is doing it for the money. However, when his comrades abandon him and he is left alone to deliver Ben, he is offered his payment, yet he refuses to accept money for backing down on a job. After this, it is presumed that the desire to perform a heroic deed drives him on. Yet, after racing across town among a shower of bullets, this is likewise proved wrong. Finally, we come to the conclusion, that Dan is doing this deed simply because it is the right thing to do and this earns him my respect as well as that of his son and Ben Wade.<br/><br/>The intense violence, mature themes, and several swear words earn this movie an R rating. However, this is the most morally upright secular movie I have seen in a long while. In a time when the bad is often celebrated and the good looked down upon, 3:10 to Yuma offers a breath of fresh air. What happens to Dan? Does he deliver Ben to the train? Well, you'll have to watch the movie to find out. You may find me back at the theater watching it again too."
"kayaker36","8","2","4","3 October 2007"," Flawed, Stritctly for Adults, But Worth Seeing
","This is a splashy, color remake of a movie made in 1957 in black and white. There is much added material, much more blood and violence, lots more talking. An element of sadism along with occasional four letter profanity make this movie UNSUITABLE for viewers of tender age.<br/><br/>The production values are high, with full exploitation of fifty years of advances in movie-making. The gunfire sounds startlingly real. The roughness of frontier towns like Contention, Arizona is convincingly depicted--half the buildings are just tents, muddy streets, few women to be seen. <br/><br/>The director understood the importance of the role of Ben Wade's lieutenant--played in the original by the young and fair haired Richard Jaeckel. The casting was right on the money here, with this time the character's feminine element explicitly pointed out rather than implied. A big surprise was the gritty performance by Peter Fonda--unrecognizable but utterly believable as a tough-as-leather Pinkerton man and a long way from ""Easy Rider"". Just as that film launched a second career for Jack Nicholson, Fonda could benefit much from his work in this one. <br/><br/>Plausibility problems begin with the first scene: the holdup of an armored wagon. Five of the twenty men in Wade's gang are killed. Would you join an outfit with a loss rate of 25 percent? The other plot holes have been thoroughly exposed in earlier reviews. Amazing how ignorant these experienced lawmen are about prisoner transport! The last scene is both repulsive and ridiculous, truly an anticlimax. <br/><br/>An entertaining two hours all the same."
"jeff-coatney","9","2","4","14 September 2007"," The Most Beautiful Aspect of This Film is Easily Missed
","Westerns are by their nature allegorical territory. But this film hides away a secret that if you're not careful, you may miss. I picked up the clues somewhat by accident, but as the film unfolded I began to more fully understand the Russell Crowe character and the Christian Bale character in a way that made the film impossible to misinterpret. Fathers almost always want the best for their sons. They want to protect them from harm, disappointment and loss. But in the final analysis, when everything else is taken away, even a bad father wants his son to have someone in his life he can count on, someone worth looking up to. In the final moments, when a father knows that the only things he's given his progeny are the worst parts of himself, and he has an opportunity to give him something truly good he'll do anything to provide that gift. Even when his nature is to destroy everything that matters to him. How could a man, who by every measure is a failure, not be a hero when he stands as a giant in the eyes of the boy he calls a son? Who could ask for a better father than the man that walked Ben Wade to the train station when no one else would? A man could not ask for a better Father for his son than that."
"seaview1","8","2","4","13 September 2007"," High Noon Time with 3:10 to Yuma
","Although the western film recently experienced a brief resurgence with Unforgiven, the number of quality ones has been few like Open Range. With the remake of the 1956 cult western, 3:10 to Yuma, (itself adapted from a short story by Elmore Leonard), the genre is primed for another comeback with this tense, well acted film.<br/><br/>Set in the old west not long after the Civil War, a cattle rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), and his family struggle to make a life for themselves as a local businessman threatens to foreclose on his property and make way for a railroad. His cattle are poached by outlaws led by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his lieutenant, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster in a surly, effective performance). The criminals rob a money wagon (in a scene right out of Heat done western style) and stop at a local town. Wade is captured by local lawmen and is escorted to catch the Yuma prison train, which is hours away from arriving. Evans offers to join the group in return for some valuable reward money that will ultimately help his family's plight. Thus begins a tortuous journey that has potential repercussions for Evans' family and Wade's bid for freedom even as his gang is in pursuit. Will Evans and his motley crew get Wade to the railroad station in time and who will survive? Director James Mangold, fresh from his successful biopic, Walk the Line, again elicits strong performances from his two leads, Crowe and Bale. Crowe is everything we expect him to be, and his role is Oscar worthy. His outlaw is a cultured, Bible-quoting man who effuses an animal magnetism that is appealing to men and women. What is so satisfying here is that Bale is equally up to the task and really shines in a difficult, challenging role. The supporting cast is uniformly sharp with special nod to a grizzled, unrecognizable Peter Fonda as a tough bounty hunter. Logan Lerman is effective as Evans' older son who is ashamed of and gradually realizes a growing respect for his father. Luke Wilson has an amusing bit role as a corrupt railroad hand.<br/><br/>The film has a plot similar to the 1950's westerns High Noon and Last Train from Gun Hill, and encompasses elements of the classic western formula, namely the cattleman versus the railroad; only in this case, it is used as a jumping off point to a deeper, more psychological conflict. This is really a movie about what motivates people to do what they do. Most of the dialogue involves Wade's hurling insults and quips at a stoic Evans. We can see that Wade has a respect and growing admiration for Evans' seemingly hopeless quest, and the emerging facts have a strong bearing on what is to come. We learn about Wade's childhood and about what truly guides Evans' reasons for taking such a risky mission. His role in the Union Army during the Civil War comes to the fore. And how did he get his leg maimed? These shades of background and characterization enrich an already tense and interesting plot. The memorable ending, which pushes credibility just a tad, truly tests each man's resolve and sense of justice.<br/><br/>Production values are strong with beautiful cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (Walk the Line, The Pursuit of Happiness). The film moves at a deliberate, methodical pace (editor Michael McCusker) and is never boring. It gets to the conflict fairly quickly and reaches its finale, an agonizing chase across town that is quite exciting and riveting right to the startling end.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a film that western enthusiasts will love while those who appreciate a strong, tense character study will find much to savor. Although we expect gold performances from Crowe and the ever maturing Bale (hard to believe this was the boy in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun), it is Mangold's prowess in that delicate balance of critically acclaimed, popular film-making, that may become a major force in Hollywood for years to come."
"Jonny_Numb","8","2","4","12 September 2007"," Riveting
","In ""3:10 to Yuma,"" there is a cheeky simplicity to the plot that portends a much greater complexity--by setting up the story of crippled Civil War veteran Dan Evans (Christian Bale), whose last shot at saving his foreclosed ranch and winning his family's respect is by helping transport notorious criminal Ben Wade (the coolly controlled Russell Crowe) to the titular train, it becomes a meditative character study on the always-blurry line between the outlaw and the working man. ""3:10 to Yuma"" reminded me fondly of ""The Proposition,"" another neo-Western founded on a plot that was also deceptively simple, only to have painted a multi-layered portrait of humanity by the film's close. As Evans, Bale evokes a ""stubborn"" demeanor hiding a stronger will, and by the climax, he has persevered in becoming a man bound by a credo of lawful determination; Crowe, who is not quite his opposite, maintains the slithery reptilian charm of an outlaw who has been educated by his trade, but possesses and empathy and morality all his own. The film is at its strongest when these two developing characters share the screen, and the climactic sequence is as cathartic, exhilarating, tragic, and as strangely uplifting as anything I've seen so far this year. Director James Mangold brings an appropriately rustic, washed-out look to this thrice-told tale, and uses the camera as an instrument for putting us within the action. Yet while the violence comes in furious, mean bursts, it ultimately is a sidetrip to the psychological battle of wits taking place in the foreground. ""3:10 to Yuma"" is one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

","A sturdily crafted, sharply directed & strongly acted western drama that comes jam-packed with plenty of gunslinging action & dynamic interplay between its characters, 3:10 to Yuma exhibits ample depth in plot & characterisation and offers a thoroughly engaging ride for the most part, only to throw it all away in its final moments.<br/><br/>Directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the period setting is recreated in fine detail but what drives this film are its well-rounded leads, each bestowed with an interesting arc while consistent dose of action keeps things alive n kicking as plot progresses. The finale is where Mangold loses his grip and is unable to wrap it up in a satisfying manner.<br/><br/>The issue I have with the final showdown is that it isn't refined enough for us to buy such sudden change of heart. It betrays the character definition established prior to the third act and isn't convincing at all. Nonetheless, both Russel Crowe & Christian Bale bring their A-game to the table and deliver solid inputs in their respective roles, yet it is Ben Foster who steals the show.<br/><br/>Overall, 3:10 to Yuma impresses in several aspects, both individually & collectively, and properly utilises all its ingredients to finish as a worthy example of its genre but the final step brings such an unexpected sudden halt to its momentum that it leaves behind an underwhelming aftertaste in its wake.

Higher budget means fancier clothes, more detailed sets and a larger pixel count. Which is of course appreciated.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is also at the top of his game. A fine character and fitting Crowe's usual mannerisms perfectly. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about Bale. I'm usually a fan of his, but he also has certain mannerisms he cannot escape. And here they didn't serve to make the character more interesting. Quite the opposite.<br/><br/>There's also the problem that they tried to modernize the values of the story a bit too much. I haven't seen the original, but from what I can surmise, it was pretty typical as far as westerns go. Tough as hide heroes, nefarious villains, strong pioneer women. Whereas this film tries to throw in rebellious teenagers, racial commentary, evil land barons, Native Americans, hidden hearts of gold and a twist ending meant to tug at your heartstrings. Making the whole film feel bloated and disjointed as far as values and themes go.<br/><br/>Still, for a remake this ain't half bad and for a modern western it's surprisingly good. Plus I freely admit that the film was mostly ruined for me because I found Bale's character and his son so annoying. That will probably not be the case for most viewers."

","James Mangold did a very good job in here, creating an new western in an old-fashioned way.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale) a ranger who decides to take Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) an outlawed man who must be taken to a train station before the train of the 3:10 to Yuma arrives, in order to put him in jail.<br/><br/>Here you have two very good actors together and that's a very good thing. On one side you have the poor ranger who wants to take care of is family at all cost, Christian Bale, and on the other side is this outlaw who must be taken to justice, Russell Crowe. They both carry all the weight of the movie in their relationship and they did it very well. Also a special mention to Ben Foster who did a very good job as one of the counterparts of Ben Wade, who is trying to rescue him.<br/><br/>The action and chase scenes were very good and kept you on the edge of your seat at many parts, keeping the tension.

","I wonder if the lasting feeling I get after finishing a movie that leaves me so invested that I'm still wrapped in that world after it has ended, is unique to only me. Because 3:10 to Yuma is definitely one of those movies for me. Which surprises me because I've never been very interested with western movies until now. It seems to be one of few accurate and quality resurgences of the western genre from maybe the past decade. It seems to have only some that a western should have, according to what loose knowledge I have on them. Basically, it seems that most westerns portray ""the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization"" and uses this to tell stories of morality. So knowing this, to me 3:10 to Yuma may not be your average gunslinger western, it is most certainly a story of morality, and a damn good one at that. In addition to these themes, the story itself maintains the same level of engagement and tension, and it's delivered through so many great performances. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale are excellent at giving these morally complex characters, and we can easily understand how they might feel in any given situation. The music in the film is appropriate to each scene, and helps guide the viewer to sense the brevity of each scene. And in the end I think I've found yet another new favorite."

It belongs to my top ten westerns near Leone's The good, the bad ... and For a few dollars more, John Ford's Rio Bravo and Liberty Valance, Tarantino's Django (except the blood), High Noon, Costner's Dance with wolves and Eastwood's Josey Wales and Unforgiven.

","Going into watching this film my association with the western genre had been made up of the classics like 'Butch Cassidy..' and 'The Good, the Bad...' which for their time were masterpieces.3:10 is not perfect but is still a great film, the film made me relate to Red Dead Redemption (Video Game) with its plot centered around redemption.The plot is centered around the transport of the outlaw Ben Wade (Crow) to a train to take him to prison, escorted by a rancher ultimately wanting to prove to himself and others his manhood. Christian Bale and Russel Crow deliver great performances portraying both side of the law and kept me divided throughout on who i'm supporting, for the genre their performances were great but not memorable as I never saw them as their characters but instead Bale and Crow.As a film I identified it as a modern western as there is a personally obvious difference and with this film if you have only been exposed to newer films of the genre you are left satisfied. But for those who have seen the classics you are left feeling like the film was fighting to be in the same category as 'The Good...' but tried so hard that it forgot the most important feature of a western. The Environment. The scenery was lacking throughout and the long shots that the genre is known for were barely noticeable making it feel more of a road trip movie than a western. But I could forgive all of that as long as the ending would satisfy me, not to spoil anything lets just say its ambiguous. Overall as a Modern western film 3:10 left me satisfied with its objective of presenting the west of the 19th century with a plot carried by great performances. But overall left me feeling nostalgic for the films of Eastwood. 7/10"

Alas, what we've gotten since are ""True Grit"" . . . and ""Jonah Hex"". Mixed results to be sure.<br/><br/>On its own, the movie plays out fairly conventionally, but for its two leads. Russell Crowe breezes through with star looks and charm (except for the final scene, which complicates his character . . . actually, the whole movie really comes alive in these final 10 minutes). For his part, Christian Bale's inborn intensity ably conveys his character's burdens, mostly in holding onto his land, but also in his desperation to do the right thing.

"Leofwine_draca","9","0","0","10 January 2015"," A modern day classic of the western genre
","The western genre is all but dead in Hollywood these days but every now and then a film comes along that reminds us of the genre's potential. The last one was Costner's OPEN RANGE, and this one manages to be even better than that thanks to the central pairing of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. 3:10 TO YUMA is an actor's film from the off, a powerhouse pairing of two Hollywood stars at the top of their game, who can actually act.<br/><br/>Although the rest of the movie is excellent it's these two guys who make it unmissable. Clearly, this isn't some kind of B-movie with black and white characters; Crowe is introduced as the chief villain yet ends up showing a lot more humanity and character than many of the good guys. Bale takes his flawed hero role and runs away with it, turning what could have been a caricature – what with his crippled leg and everything – into a deeply human guy who you just can't stop watching.<br/><br/>The plot works really well because it's fast paced. The story is told through action, which is a very difficult thing to achieve – off the top of my head only the BOURNE films and the TERMINATOR films are similarly successful. There are dozens of shoot-outs, things exploding, showdowns and more – all you could expect from a hi-tech western and all expertly choreographed. Yet it's the script, too, which makes the film, creating thoroughly engaging 'quiet' moments just as riveting as all the chases and shooting. My favourite scene is in the run-up to the showdown, set in a hotel's bridal suite, where the assorted characters ponder their fate and decide their futures. It's tremendously suspenseful and edge-of-the-seat viewing material.<br/><br/>The supporting cast does a very good job – from an almost unrecognisable Peter Fonda as a grizzled cowboy to Ben Foster as another creepy, hateable bad guy. Director James Mangold has proved himself in the past with the likes of COP LAND and he once again shows that he's a master of his craft, able to deliver a solid, exciting and highly entertaining movie despite the familiarity of both the setting and the set-up. 3:10 TO YUMA is a masterful film and one to be enjoyed over and over."

"ipekmine","8","0","0","7 June 2014"," 3:10 to Yuma from a Russell Crowe fan's perspective
","3:10 Yuma is one of my favorite movies, and that's pretty cool considering that I'm not a big fan of Westerns. However, with this movie, it seems impossible to be disappointed –from the cast to the director, from the plot to costumes and music, it's altogether a fruit of quality work. Apart from the motion picture itself, I'd been pretty surprised and further impressed with the behind the scenes features and interviews, as the making of the movie turns out to be just as impressive as what we see on big screen. Especially the 'town' that was built and the train brought to the area were really cool, and it's amazing how the crew managed to give us a dusty, dry Arizona scenery out of what was actually covered in snow. In terms of acting, I think the whole cast was simply good, each and every character was portrayed properly, fitting their role and the overall story -as expected from a team led by the Christian Bale-Russell Crowe duo. The two, in my opinion, had excellent chemistry, in a way that it makes you like both characters equally and understand where they come from, what they do and why. Then again, if I were to choose, I'd go for Ben Wade in a heart-beat, owing to the magnificent portrayal by the talented Russell Crowe. For starters, Crowe once again gives us a brilliant accent, adds a dose of ""Russell"" to his role, and adds Ben Wade to the long list of ""unforgettable characters Russell Crowe played"". Ben is not just some outlaw with a fast trigger, nor your usual villain. He's smart, extremely charismatic, and a damn good leader –wait for it– with conscience! He's not purely bad (as Pearly Soames was in Winter's Tale), but is the kind of bad guy that the young look up to (as Dan's son, William does), ladies admire and ordinary men envy. In other words, he's probably ""made bad"", as hinted by the scene where he tells Dan the story of his mum leaving him at the station with a Bible (speaking of mum, just gotta love the scene ""even bad men love their mamas""). All in all, whatever life's done to him, it seems to have made Ben Wade a brilliant leader who earned absolute loyalty of his gang (his words as they drink for Tommy at the bar shows what a determined and focused leader he is, one of the many cool quotes of the movie: ""Tommy was weak. Tommy was stupid. Tommy is dead."") Furthermore, I simply loved Ben's wittiness and was a pleasure to see a good many excellent Russell Crowe smirks on screen (e.g. the scene where Wade is detained and told that he's going to end up hanged; the part in the hotel room when he asks Dan ""You mean we're still not friends?"" and the whole dinner scene at Dan's place). The only two scenes I am not a big fan of are –as expected– where Byron gives Ben a rough time after we say goodbye to Tucker (Kevin Durand's part is small but brilliant nonetheless, by the way!) and the scene when the Dan and the rest catch up with Ben in the tunnel, in the hands of some old enemies, if I may say so (ouch! do not hurt Ben Wade or you'll regret it, peeps!). And only one thing in the entire movie I don't really understand, why and how, seriously, does the girl (Emma) not runaway with someone so absolutely hot and amazing and breath-taking as Rus.. I mean, Ben Wade?! :) Taken altogether, Russell Crowe fan or not, I see no reason why one wouldn't like this movie. Do give it a shot if you haven't already – you're not gonna regret. **walks away singing ""they'll hang me in the morning, and I'll never see the sun ""**"

","""3:10 to Yuma"" is a fun action western that keeps you guessing what will happen next. The acting is excellent all around and the story is simple but at the same time it collects one's attention. The settings are beautiful and when you break it down, this film really does not have too many flaws. My only complaint for this film is the pacing and the character development for both the Main and side characters. The pacing seemed to jump from face paced to slow and dull. The character development was slow on most of the characters which really isn't an issue, for the movie is solely based on the story and action. There really is no reason to complain about this movie, but sometimes the movie just does not connect with the viewer. Part of me really loves this movie, while another part of me dislikes certain aspects of the film for no real legit reason. Since I have not seem the original 3:10, I can make no comparison. I can assume that the original is just as enjoyable if not better then the reboot."

","Okay, I admit the first time I watched this it did not make as big an impression on me, but seeing it again I'm going to give it a 9. There are a lot of holes and flaws and ""wha??"" moments, but in spite of it all I really enjoyed it overall and it's somehow different. I don't usually watch a film a second time so I must have seen something in it.<br/><br/>Yes, a lot of disbelief needs to be suspended and tolerance expended, increasingly toward the end. In all these types of action movies you see these things like people being shot yet still able to run and fight and ride, but this one takes it further, stretching the imagination until it snaps. So why was I so willing to forgive and overlook? The performances, mostly, the complex layers of characters, and just that cat & mouse, back & forth, push & pull, and all the weird good guy-bad guy teamwork.<br/><br/>A combination Western and character study, we get long looks into the psyches of these two fascinating men, and little by little the motivations for their unlikely actions start to come clear. So many times throughout this movie Wade could have killed Evans, starting from the first 15 minutes. A lot of it was ""the movies,"" of course, but I like to think some of it was how those characters would really have acted. To further attempt to explain it away...some of it could also have been that Wade knew he didn't have to try too hard, and was just making a game of it to amuse himself from the beginning.. Also I think Wade admires Evans more than his own son does, and he maybe felt, ""A"" for effort – the guy deserves to win a little.<br/><br/>Ben Foster as Charlie Prince blew me away, again even more the second time around. He bursts onto the screen, turbocharged, and just takes over the film. Simply riveting. A TV actor? No way! One scene and I want to watch everything he's done. He inhabited that character. Crowe and Bale are both absolutely superb and leave nothing to be desired. This movie made me a Russell Crowe fan all over again. Peter Fonda also shines as Byron McElroy, the hard-as-nails Pinkerton guard. Kevin Durand was good in this as well, though his character was rather one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Ben Wade was the most richly developed character: the level-headed, wise, enigmatic outlaw – ruthless, yet sensitive enough to draw and read and be a sweet-talking' lover. Wade is not evil; he claims he is, but even the boy sees this is not true.<br/><br/>The Dan Evans character was bitter and so intense. Stubborn, with the kind of stubborn pride that will get you killed. He wasn't doing it just for the money, and even justice was debatable when you figure all the good guys that got killed so that this one bad guy could get on that train. Mr. Butterfield was also very stubborn, as was Byron.<br/><br/>Will is the young son, on the accelerated track to manhood. Outwardly he idolizes Wade, but inside he already has all the best parts of his father.<br/><br/>Charlie was more a caricature than a character. But uncontrollable and psycho as he was, his adoration ensured complete loyalty.<br/><br/>It was an outlandish plan from the get-go (even if they somehow miraculously could succeed in getting him on the train, wouldn't Charlie and company then just go after the train?). Things really started to go downhill toward the end, and there are so many things I would change, but the suspense was wild, and in the end everyone got what they wanted I think. It's hard to find a good ending that perfectly resonates, and this was a good one in theory; if they had made the odds less impossible and tweaked it in a few other places, it could have been a great one. You never know if things like that could be the result of an executive decision by one person holding the purse strings, and I decided not to let that ruin the whole movie.<br/><br/>So enough redeeming stuff for an overall win: able direction, an authentic feel to the sets, some pretty funny lines, plus all the stuff mentioned above, but worth it for Ben Foster's performance alone. It was movie-making on a grand scale – the kind that leaves you changed after you come back down into your life, feeling invigorated the next day and giving you something to think about."

Then of course it's such a silly ending that Evans dies then Wade kills his whole gang, then he gets on the train to go to prison so the audience thinks he's taking responsibility of his wrong doings. But that is just thrown on its head a few seconds later when he calls his horse from the train so he is obvs just gonna get off and escape. Like he wasn't a redeemable character at all, Evans died because his gang was after him, so the hero of the film died just because Wade was bored and wanted to travel across the wild West pissing people off and killing folks.<br/><br/>Also Christian Bales character was supposed to have his leg blown off and had a wooden replacement. yet he was clearly bending it at multiple points during the film. this movie defo doesn't deserve the rating it has."

But you don't strictly have to be a western fan to enjoy this movie. It isn't just plain shoot'em up kind of film where the protagonist can hit a hat from 100 meters while firing from his hip. It has an intriguing story and relatable characters. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are undeniably the carriers of this film. Their characters' conversations are always tense and interesting and through them we get to know their motivations and way of thinking. The dialogue in this film is really well done and it shows that these characters aren't simpletons and that each of them has some depth. Action scenes are also tense and fun to watch.

","Set in the Wild West of the United States in 1884, it's a convoluted story of two men, their values and beliefs, and the journey they embark upon. Russell Crowe is the renegade Ben Wade, while Christian Bale plays a limp, father-of-two-boys, struggling farmer named Daniel Evans. Percy Jackson's Logan (Wade*) Lerman, ironically plays the 14-year-old son that could be inferred to be Wade's own! Velvet, the green-eyed beauty Ben believes to be his soul-mate, could be Dan's wife's former self as a dancer in Dodge, Alice Evans played with dignity by Gretchen Mol. A farmer has lost his faith. His land is dirt, as arable as the Sahara Desert! His cows needs feed, and his last bags are burning inside his barn. The train, the sea-to-sea passageway across the widest part of the North American Peninsula, needs his land, and Dan's clawing at clouds trying to stay afloat. The heartless Railway bullies want him out whatever it takes. The bankers want their taxes, and the wife is nagging for his attention. Enter Ben Wade and his merry men. About as merry as an Apache in a Ku Klux Klan convention! The film delves deeper into his psyche than Dan's, and Ben needs all the development he can get! He represents the black side of the Yin-Yang: just a touch of good in him, as we see at the films grand finale. The white side's black dot can be represented by Dan's scene of rage, and what set it off; or whom! They are mirror opposites and see in each other what the other lacks. Both fought the Civil War on the ""wrong side"", both are trying to be men of their words', and both want to teach each other a lesson. But there is where their similarities end. Ben has issues as great as the Devil reincarnate! Ben Wade's mother put a knife to his father's throat the night before she sat him on a train station bench, told him to read the Bible, and never returned. He says it took him three days to finish, at the ripe ol'age of 8. He loved a woman that loved her life. He wanted Paradiso, New Mexico while she liked to boogie! Thus his infatuation with green eyes. Now, where's the moral of the story? Dan decides to deliver Ben to a train departing at the title's time and location for a $200 pay, which turns out to be the amount he was paid for losing a leg while retreating from a battle, and (cream on top) being shot by friendly fire! 'What goes around, comes around'? Ben shows us his true colours just minutes after the repetitive studio logos are finished. After being interrupted sketching a hawk by his first Lieutenant {the ever-evil Ben Foster as Charlie Prince(ss)}, Ben and the gang destroy an armoured coach, about 5 armed guards, a semi- automatic Tommy gun, and one of his own men. He seems to kill with a purpose, unlike his gang that seem to enjoy it more like a hunt, than a murder. This is no survival of the fittest! As the pair journey to Yuma, Ben slowly evening the odds along the way, they encounter foreign resistance which leads, inevitably, for them to join forces to defeat: the Apaches, the rail-road, . Even though one kills to steal money to achieve his dream (living by the sea in Mexico with a scrumptious green-eyed beauty) while the other kills for a $200 pay to maintain his dream (living with his beautiful, green-eyed wife & two kids, in a luscious, rain-soaked prairie that one day God will provide), they both go beyond expectations to appease their own unique view of what is ""right"". Truth exists only behind the eyes of its believer! Even when Dan is offered the money to walk away, once by Ben, and once by the snivelling accountant, he believes its his prerogative to show his son his valour, before he dies! And so Dan died believing he did right, while Ben Wade sits on the train to a prison he's escaped from numerous times before. Good guys die young, and Bad guys get laid? While Ben was acting out his hate and contempt for life, Dan displayed some very egotistical traits. He left a widow and two fatherless sons on a useless farm so he could prove to himself he wasn't a gutless wonder for obeying a retreat order! Logan's role deserves a whole adolescent-hates-dad treatment, but is worth watching nonetheless to see the magnificent arc his character undertakes. * Logan's real middle name is Russell's character's surname: Ben Wade.

","Remake of the 1957 John Ford's movie with the same title, it follows the story of a small-time rancher agrees to hold a captured outlaw who's awaiting a train to go to court in Yuma hints its title. A battle of wills ensues as the outlaw tries to psych out the rancher and try to escape. Christian Bale plays Dan Evans, the rancher who is trying to escort the outlaw to the train due to him being in financial trouble and is on the verge of losing his ranch. Dan Evans is also a Civil War veteran with a tortured past, during the war he lost his foot and ever since he has struggled both physically and emotionally explaining the reason why he is in a financial mess. This is compounded by the fact that his own son looks up to Wade more than him. This makes Christian Bale's character, a bitter man. Russell Crowe plays Ben Wade, a highly dangerous outlaw trying to outwit the rancher. He is a bit cocky at times, but Russell Crowe pulls up a likable character out of the brutal bandit. He is amazing and showed a variety of different sides to himself. The way, he let silence himself, and then do the talking for him in some scenes is incredible. It was a kick back/tone type approach. The way he approached the love interest scene and the leading to that was one of the most beautiful scenes in the movie. It was very moving. This create an unspoken bond develops between the two characters that I found a little bit confusing at times but by the end of the film you just go along with it. The supporting cast isn't half bad. I love Peter Fonda's role even if it's a small cameo. Ben Foster as Charles Prince really does look the part of a outlaw. The shootout at the end is the best I have seen in a western for a good couple of years even if it doesn't make any sense. The movie scenes doesn't flow right. It cuts and jumps around like crazy. The movie has too much close ups, so we lose the wide sets and sceneries in some shots so unlike John Ford who use the sceneries to make his Westerns look epic in size. In no way, does this movie beats out John Ford's classic. Still, I would highly recommend that you go and see this James Mangold's film and would give it a try."

They couldn't possible know his feelings toward Evans and since he didn't instructed them not to shoot Evans they did what was expected to do. And second thing that bothered me was moment of truth between Wade and Evans when truth about Evans' wound came up.

"josh_youngbwfc","8","0","0","17 June 2012"," The Magic of the Western Lives on
","The western is the original genre of cinema. The first ever narrative film was The Great Train Robbery and was the western which began Hollywood's long running obsession with cowboys and outlaws. However, with the uprising of science fiction and the superhero genre now becoming the leading money spinners in cinema modern westerns don't usually do that well in the mainstream. 3:10 to Yuma, released in 2007, managed to make a small profit but didn't pull up many trees, yet I think that this is a fantastic film that proves the western can still entertain.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is the story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a war veteran who lost his leg and now struggles to keep his family on his ranch through drought and debt problems. When the infamous outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) finally gets captured and needs escorting to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison, Dan volunteers to take him for a price. Along the way Dan wins the respect of his son and finds a mutual respect and reluctant friendship with Ben Wade.<br/><br/>Directed by James Mangold, not a very famous director by any means, 3:10 to Yuma manages to capture the essence of the western very well; the visual direction of the film is very good. When people think of westerns they usually think of gunfight after gunfight but what you have here is a slow paced film but with a story and characters like these there is no danger of it ever becoming boring. Both Christian Bale and Russell Crowe put in fantastic performances and the character of Ben Wade is possibly one of the greatest antagonists I have ever seen; I think that his personality is a great one and rather than just being a badder than bad villain it becomes clear that he actually does have morals and he does have his own rules that he lives by, despite the fact that he runs one of the roughest gangs in the west. The conflict that arises between Evans and Wade is very interesting and watching the respect that these two men have for one another grow throughout their film and they confess secrets to one another is actually quite touching.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk and Gretchen Mol all do a good job with what they are given but Ben Foster who plays Ben Wade's right hand man Charlie Prince is absolutely fantastic and brings a real sinister side to his character. Rising star Logan Lerman puts in a shift as Evans' son and fan of Ben Wade and it is clear to see that he has real potential as an actor.<br/><br/>Throughout 3:10 to Yuma there isn't that much action with the real emphasis based on the interactions between Dan Evans and Ben Wade as I mentioned earlier but when there is action it is very good. There is a scene at the mines where Evans' group rescue Ben Wade from torture that goes down very well and the final shootout is brilliant. People are dropping like flies during the final gunfight when Evans races to get Wade onto the train and the ending is pretty much as perfect as it could be.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is by no means the best film ever but since the first time I saw the western it has been on my list of favourite films."
"valadas","6","0","0","3 March 2012"," With a little more this could be a good movie
","For those who saw the 1957 version of this same story by Delmer Daves the difference is clear. A dramatic plot described in much simpler scenes but full of intensity now changed into one more western movie with the usual clichés: shootings and killings galore, attacks, horse riding, suspense and even Indians. Not altogether bad anyway since the acting is good, the most thrilling scenes are well built and the suspense not exaggerated. But it has got the usual unlikelihoods in western movies in terms of facts such as for instance the almost miraculous deeds in those shootings that defy the laws of aiming with small hand firearms as anyone who has ever fired these guns too well knows. Besides that this movie has a rather inconclusive end on the contrary of the Delmer Daves' version in which the end is meaningful and clear although surprising. In both movies the story is the same though treated in different ways: an outlaw is captured and must be taken forcibly to another town (Yuma) in the train that leaves at 3.10 to be imprisoned, tried and eventually hanged there while the outlaw's gang is trying to rescue him at all costs. If I remember rightly in the first movie the outlaw is captured and led all he time by one man only, a sheriff or Marshal of another town, while in this movie he is escorted by a small group of men though in the end it's only one that tries to lead him to the train facing a lot of obstacles due to the fierce opposition of the gang. It's a movie you can see with a certain pleasure but not exactly what you might call a good movie."

","I personally am not much of a Western fan, however recently I have got into the more modern and recent Westerns with casts I know of from other modern films.

The story is simple Christian Bale must escort captured con Russell Crowe to the 3:10 train to Yuma to face justice for his crimes, and those of his gang. Bale is doing the job for $200, which he needs to secure his land from being taken from him by the tax man.<br/><br/>Here in begins his journey with his son to take Crowe to the train station, both dealing with those of Crowe's gang and even Native American Indian attacks. The weapons and equipment of the Wild Western period look amazing, sound great and authentic. The action is searing, and times can really take you aback with gunfights erupting anywhere. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale work well together, alongside an impressive supporting cast with Ben Foster playing Crowe's gang second-in-command intent on freeing his boss from the law. <br/><br/>However its not just attacks and ambushes Bale must deal with, he like Crowe hides his own inner-demons which are also another reason for him doing the job. To tackle demons from his own past. The film moves along well, and you never get tired or bored as you are always moving along. This is accomplished with the cast, and story. A solid Western is what I would call 3:10 To Yuma and a film to settle down with."
"freemantle_uk","9","0","0","7 November 2010"," An entertaining, action-packed Western
","The Western has a genre that has been revived in recent years, with many releases getting critical success. We have seen many films like the Assassination of Jesse James, Open Range and Seraphim Falls, with even international efforts making the scene, like The Proposition and The Good, the Bad and the Weird. After making the award winning Walk the Line, director James Mangold comes up with an entertaining follow-up.<br/><br/>Set in the late 19th century Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a Civil War veteran and an impoverished ranch owner in Arizona. He owns larges debts to a rival. Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is a ruthless outlaw leading a violence group of men and notorious in the area. After a successful ambush, Wade is captured by the local authorities and Dan offers to take the criminal to train to Yuma prison for $200, showing his son William (Logan Lerman) that he can provide for his family. From Bisbee Dan and a team of men including a Pinkerton agent Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda), a doctor (Alan Tudyk) and coach owner Grayson Butterfield (Dallas Roberts) to take the man, but they are followed by Wade's gang led by his loyal right-hand man Charlie Prince (Ben Foster).<br/><br/>Mangold set about using a Saving Private Ryan style of realism. The set designs and costumes were wonderful and the little details reminded me of the HBO series Deadwood. The violence is brought to a realist level, that being shot is nasty and not a clear death. But Mangold and the screenwriters tell a more traditional story, a tale of adventure and redemption in a violence and lawless world. Mangold and the writers bring in more modern ideas and themes to give the story a little more meat, with themes about Dan trying to be a good father and providing for his family seeing that his oldest son having lost faith and making the villains more three dimensional characters, with Wade trying to justify his actions, showing his rivalry with Byron and that he has sympathies for Apache people (though I doubt an outlaw would have been that sympathetic to native Americans).<br/><br/>Mangold also directs some excellent action sequences, particular an ambush in the beginning of the film and the final sequence, with blood and bullets flying over the place and are perfected edited. Mangold shows that people want to see the action, avoiding too many quick cuts and keeps the camera steady and still. Mangold shoots with traditional filming techniques and camera but uses modern lighting to make the film look more fresh. Mangold keeps a dark brooding tone throughout, particularly the night and does not hold back. He shows that the modern Western genre can be both meaning and action packed, not just the preserve of art-house crowd.<br/><br/>There is a great cast in this film, and Crowe and Bale are two of Hollywood most talented, if troubled stars at the moment. Both worked well together and have excellent screen chemistry as two different men. Crowe was the slighter stronger performer, but its only a manner of splitting hairs. Lerman shows that he is a promising young actor and why he was giving the lead role in Percy Jackson and why he was a strong candidate to play Spider-man. Tudyk and Roberts were very similar to characters in Deadwood, particular Doc Cochran and Whitney Ellsworth. But the most surprising performer was Ben Foster: his career has been unimpressive with roles in X-Men: The Last Stand (which was no more then a glorified cameo) and 30 Days of Night. In 3:10 to Yuma his role was engaging as the main villain, a ruthless, violence man who is young and does not have any boundaries which come with age. He is a man who looks up to Wade as a father figure/older brother (a long running theme in the film) and looks older with a bread.<br/><br/>Whilst watching a very entertaining film, I did think I would like to see what Steven Spielberg and Sir Ridley Scott could do with a Western."

"johnnyboyz","8","0","0","12 July 2010"," Tearing; tense and challenging race-against-time western as feuding sides and ideologies play out under a canopy of high drama.
","James Mangold's adaptation of the 3:10 to Yuma text is pure pulp in a Western form but with a brain to match: a chase thriller; a morality tale; an interesting clashing of two 'set' American Dream-infused ideologies, as two individual men come together; a power struggle between these two men, further more encompassing the shifting dynamics between other characters as their relations and prior histories with one another are torn and forced together in equality. The film is essentially a telling of getting item 'A' to location 'B', but across the vast and expansive deserts of 19th Century Arizona, as the United States of America was forming. The MacGuffin in this case, the item that kick starts everyone into gear, comes in the living and breathing form of a fearsome bandit – something that doesn't sit there inanimately but is able to have an effect on proceedings. Mangold's film is a masterfully unravelled and tension filled exercise; full of fiercely ambiguous friendships and some deeply rooted rivalries thus perfectly capturing the overall sense of the era as settlers battled against natives; interior clashes between sides played out and the large looming fall out from The Civil War remained.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma's relatively simplistic premise paves way and allows for intricate study not to get lost amidst a sea of complicated narrative, that further still would quite probably have given way to exposition. As relations shift and understandings are forced into being forged, the film utilises the arc of its antagonist so as to encompass a revisionist element to proceedings; taking its character from a distinct type before placing him in the company of many men whom mean well, tread a finer line between moral and amoral than the antagonist, as well as the lead himself whom embodies the positive traits associated with both a justified living and justified existence. 3:10 eventually rounds off with a finale that signals ultimate change within the individual. The two main players of the piece are Christian Bale's Daniel Evans and Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, Bale maintaining that odd sense of consistency that sees the effectiveness of his acting diminish without totally evaporating when he himself is not the primal focal point of the film and must be placed up against somebody else in direct opposition.<br/><br/>Evans is a struggling farmer with wife Alice (Mol) and two sons, the eldest of which William (Lerman) is refreshingly more involved in the film than it needed have bothered. Despite ploughing an honest trade, drought has rendered life as a farm unit particularly difficult for the Evans' and a frustrated William observes the hardships through a growingly bitter eye. Indeed the film begins with him slowly, lingeringly turning over a playing card of a bandit in a darkened room with that prominent sense that one's mind is at an age that sees one shift down respective routes that come to outline one's life. Later on, when local council enforcers burn down one of the Evans' barn when repayment didn't come through, he is there again with a rifle ready to shoot them in the back as they ride off. It takes an older, more level head in father Dan to prevent William from taking the first steps into immorality, such is his young and impressionable personality that later on he hears of a location known as Dodge City from the mouth of outlaw Wade and seems dangerously allured.<br/><br/>That person is indeed Ben Wade, an all-in-black clad bandit whose first task it is to observe his minions hold up a stagecoach full of money heading towards a local town from a nearby mountain on high; that sense of power over his followers present in the film positioning him there, far from danger but close enough to see everything that transpires. When it comes to picking apart the wreckage, he wastes no time in taking out survivors and those even in his own clan whom are taken hostage by said survivors. Wade's way of life and character is placed in stark contrast with that of Evans', the film treading a fine line in what it itself thinks of each respective lifestyle in that the life of farming and hardship seems downtrodden and unappealing, with Wade's cut and thrust existence full of action, companionship and reward. But he lives this life with a seemingly respectful eye on his surroundings, toasting to fallen comrades at saloons afterwards and with a strange penchant for sketching the odd item in-between raids. His continuation of indulging in this behaviour later on sees him state proverbs around the Evans' dinner table, at which time the link is made obvious that the character is doing so in the presence of the nourishment brought about by way of moral work instead of the intake of alcohol bought through ill-gotten money.<br/><br/>Opportunities arise for Evans when Wade is caught, and sentenced to death by way of hanging in a penitentiary some miles away. The film's premise seeing several people volunteer to transport Wade to a local train station so as he may be transported to meet his fate. Being the financially struggling farmer he is, Evans is all too keen to aid in this action but hostile natives whom own the land everyone must journey through; others out for Wade's blood on personal vendettas and Wade's own gang are elements to be taken into consideration as they all strive to catch the titular train. The film carries that stark, rapid feel about it in that the journeying to the station is a race-against-time element that sits on a back-burner and simmers effectively as this adventure plays out. While certain aiders in this task fall foul of the elements plus Wade's continuous pleas to be let go for a large fee that'll help Evans no end as rainclouds supposedly form over his farm on the horizon, there is enough tension and ambiguity to drag the film through to its stark and effective finale."
"JohnWelles","8","0","0","6 June 2010"," About as Good as a Remake Can Get.
","""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007), directed by James Mangold, is a remake of the classic 1957 Western of the same name, made by the under-appreciated Delmar Daves. Mangold crafts a excellent Western, with fine leading performances from Christian Bale (as Dan Evans, played by Van Heflin in the original) and Russel Crowe (as Ben Wade, played by Glenn Ford in the original) and a charismatic turn from Ben Foster (as Charlie Prince). I like how, while being reasonably faithful to its source, they changed some things so as to render it worthwhile and not simply a pointless retelling of the same story. It benefits from nice photography and editing too. I've noticed some complaints about the ending, but I thought that was one of the highlights, with expertly staged action and the climax is refreshingly different from the 1957 film. Not quite as good as the original (no remake can be truly great, I think, because they lack that crucial element of originality), but still very exciting and enjoyable. I heartily recommended it to anyone who likes Westerns well acted and directed."
"ladylardbottom","6","0","0","5 June 2010"," 3:10 To Yuma: A Comparison
","The original '3:10 To Yuma' (Delmer Daves; 1957) starts off dramatically enough: a farmer, Dan Evans (played by Van Helfin) and his two sons, searching for their wayward cows, witness a stagecoach robbery in which the driver attempts to fend off the bandits by taking one of them hostage, only to find the leader of the gang, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford, in his only film role as a villain), shoot both the hostage and the driver in order to prevent his gang's capture. Apologetic, he demands the stage driver be taken back to his home, because, he says, ""every man deserves to be buried at home.""<br/><br/>This is in stark contrast to the remake, '3:10 To Yuma' (James Mangold; 2007). This 'modern' interpretation finds the original's dramatic impetus lacking, and instead opens with Dan Evans' (Christian Bale) homestead under attack by guns-for-hire, who burn down his barn in their latest attempt to force him from his land, so that it can be appropriated by the railroad. We learn that the farmer's son is ill, and that drought is soon to take all of his cattle, before Dan and his children witness a bloody and ultra-violent robbery of a steampunk-esquire armour-plated, machine-gun wielding stagecoach by Ben Wade's (Russell Crowe) gang, where several men on both sides of the confrontation are killed amidst a frenzy of bullets.<br/><br/>This increase in aggression carries throughout the remake. Where Glenn Ford's Ben was more of an adventuresome, charming scoundrel in the lead of a 'gentleman's gang', Russell Crowe is, quite frankly, just another mildly charismatic, garden variety criminal whose only distinction is that he and his gang will resort to absolutely anything in the pursuit of their ill- gotten fortunes. Crowe's Ben stabs a man to death with a fork as retribution for taunts, and throws a man off a cliff for insulting his heritage, because ""bad men love their Momma's too."" Ford's commits no further violence beyond the original killing -- and arguably, he does not need to, since the demonstration of his capacity for murder only needed to be demonstrated once for his audience.<br/><br/>At this point in both versions, Ben takes Dan's horses and sends him on his way, which, although in the original seems like something Ford's Wade would likely do -- to spare any further bloodshed -- is quite out of character for Crowe's Wade, given the ruthlessness he shows in the robbery. This point is mildly perplexing. In the remake, Dan is given the additional task of dragging a wounded man back to Bisby, where we once again diverge from the original, having Dan not meet the posse sent to find Wade, and hence formulate a plan for his capture, but instead the farmer finds Ben in the saloon coincidentally, in the hunt for the man who is trying to force him from his land. The end of the scene is essentially the same, however -- Dan is offered $200 to help escort Wade to Contention City, where he will be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma to face trial.<br/><br/>To increase the running time by half an hour, the journey to Contention city is drawn out in the remake, whereas the original skips almost directly from Evans' homestead to the hotel. During the journey, Wade kills two of his captors, they fight with Apaches, and after Ben escapes, he is tortured by railway men. This additional plot adds a great deal of action to the film, making it less of a psychological thriller than the original.<br/><br/>Despite all of the remakes high-budget bluster, I prefer the original. Glenn Ford's attempt to corrupt the 'incorruptible' Dan Evans by saving him from his financial troubles is far more believable than the disingenuous portrayal of Wade by Crowe, and that crucial element of the original plot is lost in not only the sound and fury of the remake, but in the character of Dan Evans himself. <br/><br/>The remake gets 6/10."

It has to be compared to the 1957 version and it clearly doesn't stand up to the original.<br/><br/>It adds a lot of story arcs and action sequences that don't really add anything to the story and in effect detract from it.<br/><br/>The original was elegant and cohesive in its simplicity. The remake is fairly chaotic and doesn't seem to know where it's going.<br/><br/>The cinematography was also a lot better in the original, with many scenes reminding of Ansel Adams photographs. The cinematography in the remake is nothing special and misses the epic feel of the better Westerns.<br/><br/>The characters aren't as well developed, although Crowe gives a reasonable performance and Bale, though a bit whiny, is doing a decent job as much as the script lets him.<br/><br/>Fonda, Foster and Durand stand out well as supporting cast.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad movie at all, but it feels like a letdown compared to the original which even after 50+ years seems to have very little flaws and has aged really well.<br/><br/>My suggestion - start with the original."

","Western, it is not my favorite genre. At least, not before I saw the film ""3:10 to Yuma"". I was quite skeptical, because usually I don't like western movies at all. But I must say the film 3:10 tot Yuma really opened my eyes. The movie is a remake of the 1957 film ""3:10 to Yuma"". They recycled the name, but didn't recycle the same shot's and dialogues. It's is a whole new movie with his own look and his own stars. The film stars the phenomenal Russell Crowe and Christian Bale and it is directed by James Mangold and produced by Cathy Konrad.<br/><br/>The filming of the movie took place in New Mexico, not in Southern Arizona, where the movie is set. This is a little bit strange because Arizona is portrayed as being flat, when it is actually mountainous and hilly. The climate is also different. The week before shooting the last scene, a storm dumped almost two feet of snow on the set. The movie makers decided to shovel the snow from the buildings and roofs, because it would be strange if you see snow in a film where you only suppose to see sand and rocks. So the movie makers really made an effort to create the perfect set and I think they succeed."

","In all actuality 3:10 to Yuma wasn't the best of films. It gave me a feeling of waiting in line at a bank or the dmv. Your just sitting or standing there just to wait for what you already know is going to happen. It was well made in the sense that it made you feel like you were in a bank in the wild west but still in a bank. You hear my dislikes about the film but I still gave it an eight, and it was for one reason, the ending. The ending was the best I thought because it was a mixed emotion of love and evil. Overall I gave it an 8 because the acting carried it through and the ending set it off, the all of the story in the middle could have been more thought out.\ -Bobby B."

I felt it fell down in the second act, and got a bit messy there.<br/><br/>It did however manage to recover and ended strongly. Seemed to lack direction in the middle, not from the director, but just, as too where it was going.<br/><br/>Strong performances from both Crowe and Slater, which when they came together, really picked the film up. They played off each other well.<br/><br/>Nice effects and shot well. Pretty good, but I think modern Western's need something extra to lift them.

"DKosty123","6","0","0","28 December 2008"," Remake Has Strong Cast
","The cast of this movie is the main reason to watch it. Christian Bale & Russell Crowe give strong performances. The reason this film does not rise into a stronger rating for me is that the special effects while dramatic are sometimes beyond belief.<br/><br/>I understand that special effects can be used to great excess and be very effective from Bales recent The Dark Night outing though what makes them effective there is great acting. The thing is, in the Western genre, if the special effects get over-done, it stretches the imagination beyond the believability factor. That is what happens here.<br/><br/>If you buy into the strong acting performances, you don't mind the stretch. If your looking for strong western believability in story, you do. I am in between these on rating this as the effectiveness of the acting does at times make you look beyond the story and more into the character of the men acting it.<br/><br/>This film does make Wade, the main bad guy, appear to be a tormented man who does things for reasons other than his main motivation. Bale is very effective as the farmer, civil war vet who is supposed to take him in.<br/><br/>The story is exactly the same as the 1957 film of the same name, but I think this one illustrates actors in development, while Van Heflin & Glenn Ford were already mature star actors when they made their version. Still, the cast in this one is solid. The extra time this version runs developing the characters is time well spent here."
"RResende","Null","0","0","19 December 2008"," (not) subverting, and a pair
","What an interesting and effective film.<br/><br/>This is a remake of a western originally made before Leone laughed with at the western genre. But this film is made in 2007, 43 years after that injection of irony and subversion of the genre took place. This film takes itself seriously, or at least, picks the key elements of the genre before Leone twisted them, and assumes them in the Ford vision. I think that's a dangerous approach, because the audiences, in the meanwhile, updated their old conceptions to what Leone proposed (to me, born in the 80', 'classic' are the Leone films, the others are 'old'). But the overcome is successful.<br/><br/>So, we have extreme characters populating the whole thing. Crowe is ambiguous, so intelligently mean that we like him, so he grows on us as Bale's character grows on him. The men are in the game for clear reasons. Bale for self transcendence (to grow on his sun), Crowes uses a mask of meanness as a revenge for child rejection (the Bible as an expiatory element), Bale's son as a form of self-imposition. Reaching one's goals as a cross through the desert. Honour is a key element, dying for it is worthy and admirable. That's something Leone mocked at. But than, we have visual sequences which owe more to Leone than to anything before him, and more to recent action films than to old Ford or Hawks' westerns gunfight. So, this is a miscellaneous, a real product of this time, when genres are all subverted, and even trying to make a genre film totally in the line of old notions is a subversion in itself.<br/><br/>Why this one is so watchable, and effective, is for Bale/Crowe. They both are intelligent actors, Bale more flexible and someone who adapts to what it takes, Crowe a more internal, meditative and imposing figure. So, they are as actors the mirrors of what they're characters are. And that's something really well done. The narrative arcs are classic, but so well built...<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","This movie was such a disappointment. The story line was thin at best with no character development whatsoever. Russel Crowes performance is good however, but given the lack of dialog, I wonder if this movie would have suited a silent movie At over 120 minutes in length and such a slow storyline it could have been condensed to 90 minutes with the same outcome due to the slow pace. Spaghetti Western's such as Fist Full of Dollars etc kill this, especially given the budget of this film. Except for the music which suited the movie, I would not want to see this again. Wait for the DVD as its not worth the price of admission. Isn't Russel Crowesupposed to be in a band? From his performance in this film, he's got to be happy hes not a full-time singer!"

","3:10 to Yuma Comparison<br/><br/>In the case of the 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma based off Elmore Leonard's short story, and a half a century later, a remake of the movie, it is interesting to see how the difference between the three versions reflect changes. Indeed, the 3:10 to Yuma films not only showed the differences of Hollywood, but also compared our modern day culture to that of 1957.<br/><br/>The written short story of 3:10 to Yuma by Elmore Leonard was the first to be published in 1953. The short story is virtually the bare minimum compared to the film. There are ideas portrayed in the film that are not represented in the story at all. For example, the beginning scenes were added in the 1957 movie was not in the short story. The short story jumps right to after Ben Wade is taken prisoner and they ride to Contention city. The audience only learns about what happened prior to this event in the film. Another element that was changed from the short story to film was the character names. Paul Scallen plays the equivalent role of Dan Evans while Jim Kidd is also known as Ben Wade. Amongst the main characters, the supporting characters are also introduced under a different identity. <br/><br/>The 1957 film based off the short story is a modest film. In this manner, it is an 88 minute film that delivers a relatively simple story in a straightforward fashion. It is mainly conceived as a physiological drama in which Ben Wade interacts with Dan Evans as the time counts down to take Ben to the train that will send him behind bars. As the first film to be based off the story, it provides the audience with a minimum amount of content to understand the story, yet does not include as much content as the 2007 remake. There are some additions to the film in the remake and there is virtually no content left out from the 1957 film.<br/><br/>The 2007 3:10 to Yuma is stunning in both its similarities and differences. It follows the same basic storyline, even using many of the same dialogue as the first. However, it's a whole different film in which it's based more off the action, is a third longer than the first, has a twisted ending, and of course keeping up to date, it is crammed with many details, conflict, and bloodshed. There are many added scenes to the movie to add to the action. The Indian gunfight and the escape from the town where Ben Wade is captured are the two best examples of action-packed scenes that did not appear in the 1957 version. Furthermore, it can also be thought of as more detail to the remake. For instance, Ben Wade defends Dan and his men from the Indians and kills them while they are hiding. Dan later says to Wade that he's not all bad inside him. He denies it and says that he only killed the Indians to defend himself. It's a perfect example of how the added scenes to the movie can be played upon later in the film to display the significance of the new scene. Another small detail that is added is that the audience finds a hidden characteristic of Ben that he has an artistic side. In one of the opening scenes, he leaves a sketch of a bird he saw on a branch hung on a tree. Again, he sketches a picture of the bartender that he meets.<br/><br/>There were many elements that were retained, modified or expanded upon between the interim of the short story to the remake of the film. But whatever the reasons, 3:10 to Yuma is exciting, looks great and is well acted in both films. It is clear evidence that the death of a Hollywood western has yet to occur."

","Please don't take any review of this film seriously that says this movie is a great picture, because it isn't. Great movies do not take the audience for idiots and self-destruct in the final 20 minutes.<br/><br/>This was 2007's best trip to the movies, and ought to have been a solid winner, as it was very, very good for an hour and 40 minutes. 3:10 TO YUMA was at least something we were truly interested in seeing, a real western and not some silly comic book adventure for 11 year old's. Too bad the filmmakers fell into the agonizingly familiar practice of covering over idiotic flaws with excessive noise and action; but that is exactly what they've done with the final 20 minutes --- when a common sense climax is what the audience paid for.<br/><br/>The critical task is for the rancher (BALE) to successfully take the outlaw (CROWE) from the hotel room to the train (1/2 mile) with the outlaw's gang in town to prevent that from happening. How the rancher does it is (get this) the outlaw simply co-operates! No kidding! And after that, the outlaw simply decides to gun down for no reason five members of his gang that were in town for the sole purpose of breaking him out. Can you imagine any worse insult to the intelligence of the audience? Oh, well; the first 100 minutes were really good, and this movie wasn't as bad as Warner's slaughter of J K Rowling's 5th book; a dreadful movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>The original 3:10 TO YUMA was never a classic western but it was a solid good movie, narrowly focused on a clash of two strong men. The new version is not a remake in the usual sense but a powerful and original new story borrowing the basic premise of the original as well as a few lines of exact dialog. Needless to add, the original film had an honest ending that neither insulted nor cheated the audience."
"rklok","2","3","8","1 April 2008"," Possibly the dumbest story of all time
","This movie makes me wonder if Hollywood is testing out the masses. ""Lets see how stupid a movie-script we can produce, and still get lots of people to like it?"" Well you have to do worse than this. It seems, with a rating of 8.0 after nearly 50k votes here for this movie, that people buy anything nowadays. As long as it has profiled actors, entertaining action and believable costumes.<br/><br/>The story of this stupidity of a movie utterly insults my intelligence.<br/><br/>I should have understood it from the very beginning, when the bandits are to rob a coach. Instead of lying in ambush, and just shoot the people on the wagon (espescially the ones with a gatling-gun!), they all (with the exception of their bad-ass leader who just hang back (!)) ride head on shooting wildly, not hitting anyone. Several of them gets killed. But hey, they have a sharpshooter in the bushes! He take out one of the two operating the gatling-gun. Then the one left swings the gatling-gun away from the huge targets of horses and riders around the wagon to shoot at the sharpshooter far away! Just ridiculous. And it just get worse and worse throughout the movie, till it explodes in such a stupidity it had me groaning in mental pain when the final scene ended.<br/><br/>As another wrote here, western-movies is not about realism. They should not be either. Sure the wild west was a frontier to the wild, with lots of murders and lawlessness, but the gunslingers of modern westerns did not exist as they are portrayed in the movies. They were exaggerated even back then, and the two feathers have now become several hens.<br/><br/>And that is the really silly thing about this movie: The seriousness of it. There is not a hint of humor or irony. It seems I am supposed to feel something for the characters, and believe the story.<br/><br/>I could fill a book of all the why's in this movie. In the end I just wanted the only believable character, the right hand man of the bad-guys leader, to just kill the leader (who had a change of heart and suddenly became a good guy (please!)), the hero and his son. Because of their stupid actions they all would have deserved it!<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor is Ben Foster, playing second in command to the bad-guys. Yes Russel Crowe and Christian Bale do a good job acting as well, its just that their characters actions are totally unbelievable, thus making their performances a waste.<br/><br/>2 stars to Ben Fosters portrayal of Charlie Prince."

","This basically could have been a good movie but that it stretches our belief at every turn. So much so that it becomes really absurd and, in the end, just plain too dumb for words.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays a down-on-his-luck rancher who happens upon a bloody robbery, and later identifies bandit chief Russell Crowe, and volunteers to help the authorities escort the criminal to the far off train station. Bale's character is a crack shot and an acrobatically tough customer for a man with only one foot! Crowe tries his best to corrupt Bale, but to no avail. The ever-thinning group plods on to the train station, with the help of Bale's son, apparently the Superboy of the rancher set.<br/><br/>Crowe's gang is in pursuit in order to set him free. They are led by Ben Foster, excellent here in a variant of the Gene Wilder role in Blazing Saddles. Foster does a great job as a diminutive Doc Holiday-esq gunslinger who may have more than just gang loyalty for boss Crowe.<br/><br/>The movie ends with an Old West version of The Gauntlet, in which every gun in town is firing at Bale, and missing. Then, incredibly, in one of the worst motion picture endings in memory, Bale is shot dead, Crowe pays off his gang's loyalty by killing each of them, turns himself in, and leaves, but not before summoning his horse to follow the train. The assumption being, I guess, that having impressed everyone with his goodness, he will again escape on the animal after the train goes round a turn.<br/><br/>Well shot, well acted, poorly written twaddle."

I would not recommend it to anyone. I'd rather recommend NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, though I am no Coen Bros fan. But then again, I guess there is a certain tendency in films being made these days (remakes or not) to really go downhill in the end. Perhaps time and writer's block at the end just makes them all pull down the curtains in anyway possible without thinking how it will sink with the audience. I simply can't understand why such an ending??? Perhaps, the cast and crew are playing some sort of joke by building interest, pulling us along and then laughing at us when we go ""HUH?""

","I hadn't seen an American western in many years until I watched this beauty several days ago. Thank goodness Cruise turned the project down because Crowe is brilliant and I can't imagine another actor imbuing the role with the nuances of dread and then gentle bon homme masking a sinister nihilism. Crowe very deftly moves from one into the other leaving me slightly tensed wondering which side he will light on and therefore where will the character go now.<br/><br/>Movies generally do not imprint themselves in my memory because of the acting but 3:10 to Yuma is the exception that proves the rule. Christian Bale virtually matched Crowe in his portrayal of Dan Evans who carried as much emotional baggage, albeit nuanced and therefore slow to become unmasked as the film progressed. The movie should be seen if only to watch this superb pairing of actors at war with each other throughout the film.<br/><br/>Strangely, the one other bit that I noticed immediately was the Confederate officer's coat worn by Ben Foster's character, Charlie Prince (I apologize if I am wrong about the character). My little pet theory revolves around the fact that the American West was so lawless and, dare I use the word monstrous, because the Civil War had just finished ten or twenty years earlier and those thousands of out of work Confederate soldiers descended on primarily Yankee settlers as well as Indians having their land stolen from under them--not a pretty mix. Putting a major outlaw character in a Confederate officer's coat makes, in my opinion, a hugely strong historical statement."

","There is a lot of good photography and some exciting set pieces, and there are bits of good acting in this movie, and even a few scenes that work pretty well. But the high points are overwhelmed by numerous plot points wherein characters do inexplicably stupid things or things contrary to the nature of the character. This happens mostly with the good guys, but also a couple times with bad guy Russell Crowe. My wife and I paused the movie halfway through because it got late and I was tired and the next day she had to convince me that we should finish it so at least we knew what happened. But my wife also felt that the movie was, as a whole, unbelievable due to these many plot holes and inconsistencies. It seems to me that a supposedly exciting movie should hook you in better than that.<br/><br/>I also have to say that this is the 2nd movie I have ever seen with the adult Christian Bale (back in the 80's I saw 'Empire of the Sun') and I have yet to be impressed. Of course the other film was 'Batman Begins' which stinks in too many ways to count. But anyway, so far, it is my opinion that the adult Christian Bale seems to be a 1.5 note player. He's good at doing that vacant, angst-ridden stare that is so popular these days, the expression into which bad directors hope the audience will project their own emotions so as to save the artists some work. But not much more.<br/><br/>Another thing: some critic said this is the best western since 'Unforgiven.' Please! Not that 'Unforgiven' was all that great, heck, 'High Plains Drifter' and 'Outlaw Josie Wales' are tons better. But truly, the best western since 'Unforgiven' was 'Brokeback Mountain.' And for crimony sakes, 'Brokeback Mountain' was better than 'Unforgiven.' I will concede, however, that watching '3:10 to Yuma' is better than watching no western at all. But is it better than just watching a rerun of 'Gunsmoke' or 'Kung Fu'? I don't think so."

","I used to dislike westerns something rotten, i couldn't take them seriously, that was until i watched the dollars trilogy, and saw what westerns were really about.. a recent time in history where money was truly king, and life was worth as much as it cost to live another day, and whether that was historically accurate or not, it didn't matter, it offered the opportunity to show men at their basest and most basic. <br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma captures that essence, and it is the driving force behind the story, a story that is great pulp fiction at its best. It's hard to find fault with this film from a story-telling aspect, I'd find it hard for someone to get bored, or to not want to know what happens next, and to find themselves completely satisfied by the time the end credits roll.<br/><br/>When you watch Yuma you wonder why it wasn't as well known, it has a great cast, with faultless performances, Crowe and Bale have an amazing chemistry, and the supporting cast is fantastic, Ben Foster is fast becoming the best guy on camera that you love to hate.. wow i never expected him to play the roles he has since first seeing him in 'Get Over It', but now he plain flat out rocks, i'll watch anything with him in it and it was a pleasant surprise to see him here. But why did no-one see this film?? THE NAME!!! the promotion campaign had some of the coolest posters going around, but who is going to watch a film with a bunch of numbers and an odd sounding abstract name in it? It sounded like a science fiction film, but was a western. Once you watch the film you'd find it hard to call it anything else, but this film is a pure example of the title defeating its success.<br/><br/>I hope the name doesn't hurt it post theatrical success, because this is seriously a great film that anyone who enjoys good stories will like, right up to the immensely satisfying finale, this is one of the best films of 2007 by far.. if you're even half interested in watching this film , and are reading IMDb reviews to figure out whether it will be worth your time and money to watch it.. just stop reading now and go watch it!!! i'd be highly surprised if you were disappointed.. not many films make it into the IMDb Top 250 within a few months of being released, and the ones that do.. they're usually worth 2hrs of anyone's time."

Mangold's direction is mostly flavourless. The score and sound were recently nominated for Oscars but neither really stood out for me.<br/><br/>The cast is fairly solid with a couple of standout performances in supporting roles, namely Ben Foster's villainous Charlie Prince and Peter Fonda's crotchety Byron McElroy. Headliners Bale & Crowe are solid, if not up to the level of some of their previous performances.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie was that it took a while for the story to 'grab' me. Luckily, the film does start to gather steam eventually and the ending even provides some subtle commentary on good guy/bad guy archetypes.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, it's a good western, which is a rarity these days. Just don't expect a masterpiece."

Ironically, it is simply a great remake! And I am definitely not a fan of remakes although it seems life is a great remake with different actors and props. I would take at least an entire day to write about the main characters of this film. Pay attention to the dialogs! Details will help the action scenes make sense! The characters are not only moved by love and power! Only Peckimpah with his Cable Hogue to be compared with this one, or some of Kurosawa's! Shakespeare is not in love! And the main ""Citizen"" is just like Cain (Kane) was to Abel inserted in a time-warp of unafraid actions, nonetheless, aware that human selfish behavior is the main consequence of circumstances, which sometimes can no longer be altered, simply by a mysterious need of existing, compelling and slowly altering without compromising oneself; hence the difficulty of some to comprehend such an astonishing film!"

But, I didn't like the manner in which one key character was rather unceremoniously eliminated from the story at mid point. The scene truly demanded a bit more theater to it. It left a bit of a hole.<br/><br/>Also, one brutal scene involved burning a man alive. (I closed my eyes and covered my ears. I don't like recalling those scenes later.) With a little creativity they could have implied the violence and made that scene more memorable and less graphic. That scene is probably a reason for the 'R' rating.

"nickchang780","9","2","5","9 January 2008"," This movie blew me away! One of the Best Westerns ever made!
","To great regrets, I missed this movie in the theaters a few months ago. So I anxiously went out and bought this movie last night on Blu-ray disk at release date, saw it, and loved it instantly! As a big fan of Westerns ranging from classic Leone and Peckinpah to all of the WB/Eastwood productions, my expectations of YUMA was quite high. To my delight, YUMA exceeded my expectations not only as a Western...but it's also just a darn good, kick-a$$ movie about honor and respect amongst both good and bad men.<br/><br/>Great performances by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale both as men of strong moral character despite being opposites in ideal, and side of the law were to be expected. What really blew me away was Ben Foster's role as the cunning and ruthless Charlie Prince, Crowe's most loyal gunman. Having seen him in more youthful and down to earth roles in his past films, it was a real treat to see him in such a darker role...and he pulls it off quite well.<br/><br/>The action and gun-play in YUMA is also very well done. The key thing is very well paced. The violence in YUMA is not as gratuitous as the Peckinpah films, but it's generous enough where the action and gun-play is evenly paced within the context of the story, which involves the journey of two men being pursued. From the stagecoach robbery at the beginning (with a Gatling Gun too!), to the climatic shootout between Bale, Crowe, and Crowe's Posse...you definitely get more 'bang' in this film than the most of Leone's films and Eastwood's 'Unforgiven'.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Westerns and/or Action films with honest plot and characterization, then you MUST watch this movie. It has all the ingredients and then-some of a fine Western. Although not as epic as my all-time favorite 'Once Upon a Time in The West', it's definitely up there with other greats made within the last 20 years like 'Unforgiven' and 'Tombstone'."

"dead47548","9","2","5","8 January 2008"," An action-packed western that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
","A roller coaster ride of flawless action and brilliant dramatic strength. Bale and Crowe are two of the greatest modern actors, in my eyes, and they fail to disappoint in this one. Both of them deliver absolutely exceptional performances and watching them play off one another is one of the most memorable film experiences of my this year in cinema. The supporting performers also turn in some noteworthy work, notably from Ben Foster (who's out of control charismatic brilliance is possibly the highlight of the film for me) and Peter Fonda. It was also great to see Logan Lerman get a meaty part, after the terrible cancellation of the phenomenal television series Jack and Bobby in which he gave a wonderful performance in the title Bobby role. I did feel that Gretchen Mol was pretty underused, though.<br/><br/>The story itself also happens to be sensational, consisting of a vast array of beautifully unique and intricate characters. Every character has so many flaws and details provided by the script, making it fascinating to see what happens to them throughout. The action is some of the best I've ever seen. It takes a visceral, gritty and in-your-face look at Western violence. We follow the characters from their point of view as they charge on their horses to rob a bank courier. All of the action is so hard-hitting and intense that it left me hanging onto the edge of my seat. The final battle, as Evans (Bale) and Wade (Crowe) sprint through a town with guns blazing and 30-40 men trying to stop them from reaching the 3:10, is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable rides I've ever experienced.<br/><br/>I was, however, quite displeased by the completely unrealistic fact that Evans was sprinting and charging through the town, going just as fast as Wade, when Evans had lost one of his feet during the Civil War and was running on a prosthetic foot. Pretty bizarre that a man with only one actual foot could move that quickly. It's easy to forgive this small displeasure though, due to the sensational work all around. The ending is utterly amazing, as it provides two huge twists that evoked more shock and gasps from the audience than DiCaprio's death in The Departed (which I saw on opening night with a sold out theater, so that's saying a lot). The ending combines an anti-Hollywood, tragic and beautiful death with a very Hollywood (but reasonably so, trust me) decision that I didn't see coming from a mile away. In short, it's definitely one of the best films of the year and more than lived up to all of my great expectations."
"johnny-08","7","2","5","23 December 2007"," Good remake
","I've never watched the original version of ""3:10 to Yuma"", but this one really surprised me so I'm gonna say that this is a good remake. Mangold managed to hold my attention right till the end and there aren't any boring parts in this movie. Everything is made on high level of professionalism but what really puts life in this story are actors. I will extract only two names from this great cast list: Russell Crowe and Ben Foster. Crowe is excellent, so cold and strong acting. He's great as bad guy. But Foster surprised me, his ability of portraying Charlie Prince is stunning, cause I've never seen him in this kind of role. Christian Bale, young Logan Lerman and legendary Peter Fonda are also good, but Crowe mostly steals the show.<br/><br/>This western is somehow different then all the others. Because westerns are made so people would enjoy themselves (especially for males); there are lots of shootings with plot that is always very easy to follow. But Yuma (and westerns like ""The Searchers"" and others) takes a turn there. Yuma is not just a western, cause it has great story and great character development. Both, Ben Wade and Dan Evans are talking about their lives. How did parents treat Wade when he was child, what happened to Evans in the war, relationship between Evans and his older son and every conversation between Wade and Evans is great. There are so many topics to discuss about that this movie goes beyond normally western and makes my favorite ""western"" movie. If you don't like westerns just watch it because of Crowe and Foster. Highly recommended."
"MichaelMargetis","7","2","5","23 November 2007"," Overrated, Unrealistic but Entertaining
","Overrated is the first word that comes to mind. I don't know, I remember hearing such wonderful and shockingly positive things about this movie from critics. For god sakes, Roger Ebert gave it a '4-star' rave review. Critics said it was the best western since Clint Eastwood's 1992 Best Picture Oscar Winner 'Unforgiven'. After having finally viewed '3:10 to Yuma' I realized that most of what the critics said was pure bullshit. I mean, it was a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it's a seriously flawed Western and calling it the ""best Western since 'Unforgiven'"" isn't ridiculous, it's unforgivable. Christian Bale stars as a down-on-his-luck rancher/family man who is struggling to get by and getting run out of town. When gun-slinging bad-ass Russell Crowe comes to town and gets arrested, it's up to Christian Bale who is appointed to take him as a prisoner to the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. After that it's a wild but uneven ride rittled with clichés and poorly-crafted dialogue. When guns are a-blazin' in '3:10 to Yuma' it's absolutely incredible. Both the cinematography and directing (from the highly underrated James Mangold -- Identity, Walk the Line) of the film are absolutely sensational. The dialogue is another story. When the movie relies upon the dialogue and character development it's tedious, drawn-out and uninteresting. Also, while entertaining the gun-slinging is completely unrealistic and unlike what many morons want to compare it to ""Unforgiven"", which was one of the most realistic and gritty westerns I've ever had the privilege of seeing. As far as the acting goes, the two leads are very good. Russell Crowe is very effective and likable as the bad-ass bad guy, but it's Christian Bale who outshines him with a much more subtle and better crafted performance which boils to an emotional and brilliant peak in the film's final minutes. The supporting cast is filled with solid performers -- Gretchen Mol (The Shape of Things), Peter Fonda, Luke Wilson, Alan Tudyk (FOX's Firefly, Serenity) and especially Ben Foster (Alpha Dog), who for some reason seems to only being playing a hyper-active sociopath these days. All in all, I recommend '3:10 to Yuma' for anyone looking for a good time. Just don't be expecting anything Oscar-worthy. Grade: B"
"Slickflix","8","2","5","22 October 2007"," ""Just remember, it's your old man that hauled Ben Wade to that stationwhen nobody else would.""
","A good western is hard to come by these days. In the 50's & 60's, guys like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood rose to stardom playing gunslingers in the old west. Over time though, the genre fell victim to endless clichés and schlock. So when a new western is released and manages to impress, I consider that quite an accomplishment. In 2005 I was pleasantly surprised by ""The Proposition"", and this year  I'm happy to say that ""3:10 To Yuma"" is a success.<br/><br/>James Mangold's remake of the 1957 film is a crackerjack character piece set amidst deadly circumstances. Christian Bale plays Dan Evans, a down-on-his-luck rancher in danger of losing his land to a draught. As chance has it, he finds himself involved in the capture of famed outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). The authorities look to Evans to help take Wade to Contention where he will be placed on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Evans agrees, as he not only feels morally obligated, but placement of Wade on the train carries a $200 bonus  enough to buy back his farm. Unfortunately for our heroes, Wade's gang is hot on their trail, and plan on getting their leader back by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold, hot off his hit ""Walk the Line"", demonstrates a similar touch that he showed in the Cash biopic. While the film is competently shot and paced, it's his ability to work with actors that deserves recognition. ""Walk The Line"" featured Oscar nominated performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, two talented youngsters. With ""Yuma"", we have the privilege of watching two of today's finest actors go toe to toe. Christian Bale is well on his way to becoming the best actor of his generation. Whether playing Batman, Patrick Batemen, or Bob Dylan  Bale has demonstrated a range and depth of performance that is unparalleled in movies today. Russell Crowe is equally multi-talented, going from roles like ""Gladiator"", to ""The Insider"", to ""L.A. Confidential"" with ease. He also has an on screen intensity that is unmatched in Hollywood.<br/><br/>In ""Yuma"" both actors are in fine form, and Mangold clearly is having fun watching sparks fly between them. The movie builds as a test of wills between the men. On one side is Evans, a noble man determined to provide for his family through an honest living. Then there's Wade, a cold blooded thief who quotes scripture just as fast as he kills. Their journey together finds them struggling to understand the other man, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other. Amidst the tension is a constant threat of violence. Their trail is filled with the likes of deadly Apache and greedy posses. Not to mention Wade's gang, determined to make it to the train before his captors and set him free. The film features numerous impressive shoot-outs and action sequences, including a nail biting gunfight during the last act. On the downside, it ends a bit too abruptly and asks the viewer to suspend some believe. All that is easily forgivable though. ""3:10 To Yuma"" is a quality western made better thanks to the first rate performances by the brilliant leads.<br/><br/>3.5/4"
"george-rolph","9","2","5","4 October 2007"," Sometimes the line between good and bad run close together.
","Nobody, from the director and writer, to the actors on the screen, put a foot wrong in this movie. Beautifully shot, with an unobtrusive music score and a deep and powerful story, this is one of the best and most intelligent movies I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Crow and Bale are perfectly cast, whereas Bale and Cruise (originally wanted for the part of Ben Wade), would have been a disaster in my opinion. I can't look at Cruise on film without thinking of him jumping up and down on a couch like a performing monkey, so his image has been wrecked in my mind.<br/><br/>OK. The story.<br/><br/>Bale plays the part of a small time farmer (Dan Evans) caught up in circumstances that overwhelm him but give him a chance to rise above what fate has handed to him. It is a part that Bale plays to perfection. His role is that of the good guy trying to make a honest days living in a corrupt world full of greed. Opposite him is Crow. Rotten, vicious, ruthless, smart and very dangerous, because he is so smart. Yet, each are two sides of the same coin. Were past circumstances different for these men, it would be easy to believe that each of these two characters could have turned out like the other. It is this fascinating and deep idea that makes the story work so well.<br/><br/>Watching the interplay between these two main characters is the farmers son (played superbly by Logan Lerman) William Evans and throughout, you get the feeling that whatever happens to his father will determine the way the boy develops. A fact that is as true today as it was in the time of the old west that this story is set in. Barely trying to conceal the contempt the boy feels for his father, he is drawn to the exciting world of thief and killer, Ben Wade (Crow). Though I long for the day when Hollywood will once again portray fathers as decent and hard working men, this movie does not sink to the level of dad bashing that so many other productions do. The boy has a boys understanding and no move is made to comment on it one way or the other. That is a mark of the excellence of the writing. The audience is given the honour of being smart enough to work that out. In Hollywood movies today, that is a rare honour indeed.<br/><br/>Into Dan and Williams already hard life crashes Ben Wade and his gang of killers and robbers. Abandoned by his mother as a child and cynical to the point of the near psychopathic, Wade has no time for sentiment. Women are used and discarded. Men are useful if they do what he says, but no use if they do not. As head of his gang, Ben Wade is more a lion tamer than a leader of men and he knows it. He has trained them the way circus people train dangerous animals and they do his will right, or they don't make it. his manipulation skills are finely honed and he uses them well to figure out others and find their weak spots. Yet, despite all of these character flaws, his intelligence and respect for bravery in others manages to make him a likable villain.<br/><br/>Almost hidden in the background of this story there is a thread running through it that intelligent viewers will pick up on and hopefully think about. That thread is the vital importance of family life and the need for all of us to make certain we allow space for parents to be able to make a good job of bringing up their kids. Raising children is too important a job to be left to governments and no matter how much they try to take over that role, they should be resisted. If not, what you see in this movie is what you get. Fathers must be cut some slack and mothers supported, not by government alone, but by all of us. We have to end the cynical, hate filled attitudes of many of our young, by teaching them that law abiding parents are good people and not weaklings. We also have to tell governments, in no uncertain terms, to take their grubby hands off of our kids and family life. Stop listening to Oprah, parenting books and tapes and start listening to granny and granddad is my advice.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great movie and one that deserves to win Oscars all around. I doubt it will, but I hope I am wrong. Oscars these days tend to be tools of politics and those that are not go to movies that are full of sentimental slush. Rarely, it seems, do films like this get the recognition all deserve.<br/><br/>The tension in this movie is wonderfully built up by the director and writer alike. At no point does it have one of those Hollywood moments of sheer idiocy, where one of the characters does something superhuman and instantly kills the believability of the story. No strange camera angles to ruin the flow and jar the mind and no screaming music to distract you from the action on screen. Just plain and simple good craft throughout, with superb supporting roles from the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>I give this 9 out ten. Excellent work all round."

The close-ups in this movie are fantastic, and you really sense the pain these men have to endure in order to reach (or not, as the case may be!) their goals, both physical and metaphorical. My one great problem with this movie, and this is true of most westerns, is the role of the women, who are seen as classic examples of the Madonna/whore paradagm. This aside, the movie does capture the atmosphere of the west wonderfully well. You can feel the dust on you face, the snow falling on your clothing, and smell the smoky insides of the saloons. Also, my local cinema has a great sound system, so the shots really do whistle around your head. If it is a good, old fashioned shot 'em you are looking for, this is the movie for you!"

But because he cannot, he chooses to accept an offer for dangerous, high risk but high reward. odyssey to redeem himself, come what may--and what may, comes. But what may come comes with more surprises, the turns that ultimately turn this movie from good to special.<br/><br/>A standout movie in a year that's been remarkably full of them, maybe the best year in movies since 1938.

"evanston_dad","8","2","5","1 October 2007"," This Wild West Belongs to Christian Bale and Russell Crowe
","I went into ""3:10 to Yuma"" with fairly low expectations, given James Mangold's track record as a mediocre director and the fact that I'm not necessarily a fan of westerns. How pleasantly surprised I was, then, to find that this particular western is slick and supremely entertaining.<br/><br/>""3:10 to Yuma"" has all the trappings of the traditional western -- outlaws, humble ranchers, gunslingers, salty old-timers, buxom saloon barmaids -- but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, the outlaw and humble rancher, respectively, bring a contemporary sensibility to the material that feels integrated rather than incongruous. Bale's rancher, Dan Evans, is suffering from feelings of male inadequacy as a result of being on the brink of losing his farm to debt (he's already lost a leg to the Civil War). For two hundred dollars, he joins a group of upright townies who are escorting Ben Wade, vicious bad guy (Crowe), to the train that will take him to Yuma prison. But Wade's loyal band, led by Charlie Price (Ben Foster as the film's one weak link, giving a grating performance), won't let Wade go without a fight. Through clever writing and wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe, the two men almost become allies in making sure Wade gets to the train on time. Wade is so impressed with Evans' integrity, even though he doesn't understand it, that he almost wants to see Evans succeed, even if that means he himself goes to jail. It's really a fascinating relationship, and it's that element of the film that makes it more than just a standard genre exercise.<br/><br/>The last quarter of the film is a nailbiter; Mangold falls back on that old reliable convention that westerns practically invented, the real time show down, with clocks placed here and there keeping time for the audience, and he does it well.<br/><br/>The film belongs to Bale and Crowe, but there's strong acting throughout by the rest of the cast, notably Gretchen Mol in a few brief scenes as Evans' wife and Peter Fonda as the requisite crusty old-timer.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Everyone's saying it. This is the Western of the 2000s like Unforgiven was for the 90s. I liked Unforgiven, and I liked 3:10.<br/><br/>I like 3:10 better, though. I dunno bout those of you who have seen the original of this film, and I dunno if they modified the story for this version, but it seemed to be one of the most original westerns I've seen. Or maybe its that I love Westerns without clichés. The supporting stereotypical characters seemed very grounded and real. The acting by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale is worth paying for alone. And the direction was great. The maturity of this film is priceless, something Hollywood is starting to dish out nowadays. My hat's off to James Mangold and his crew.<br/><br/>I will probably have to tame my vote back down to 8 when I've psyched down a bit, cause it is a little slow in the earlier part of the film. This works for character building--and some great dialogue--and tension building, but the tension doesn't really get built until towards the end of the film, so that slower pace is definitely noticeable.<br/><br/>Thats my only grovel, though, for a film that is personally a 9.5 out of ten, but I don't wanna build your expectations.

"reel_emotion","9","2","5","18 September 2007"," Destined to be Another Classic Western
","After the great Johnny Cash/June Carter Cash biopic, Walk the Line, director James Mangold tries his hand at a western, 3:10 to Yuma. Expectations are highwith this being a remake of a classic western and with the hopes of this movie resurrecting the genre.<br/><br/>I purposely avoided watching the original Van Heflin/Glenn Ford 3:10 to Yuma. I also haven't read Elmore Leonard's short story that it is based on. I want the remake to prove to me alone its merits as a movie, as well as a western, without having to compare it to other things.<br/><br/>Besides focusing on the two main stars of 3:10 to Yuma--Russell Crowe as criminal Ben Wade and Christian Bale as rancher Dan Evans--, 3:10 to Yuma has a great ensemble cast. Some people claim that Ben Foster steals the show and out bad-guys Crowe as Charlie Prince, Wade's second man in command in his gang of outlaws. Peter Fonda gives a convincing performance as a bounty hunter who is not afraid to smart off against Prince or Wade against better judgmentWade, handcuffed, throws Fonda off a cliff for insulting his mama. There is also the nice character of Doc (Alan Tudyk) who tells off the man responsible for burning down Dan's barn. Look for Luke Wilson in an excellent cameo performance as an evil, racist railroad flunkywho kidnaps Wade when he manages to escape from Dan and the other men. Wilson takes Wade's gun with a crucifix on the handleaccording to Wade, the gun is cursed, and Wilson is shot down by Foster, who in turn takes Wade's crucifix pistol. Guess what happens to him.<br/><br/>I see the main story in 3:10 to Yuma as down-on-his-luck Dan Evans trying to prove himself to his family. The other story is Wade's robbery of the bank coach and his capture, which leads to Dan's quest of delivering Wade to the train bound for the Yuma prisonthe only way for Dan to provide for his family at this point. All these stories and the characters make for a good western.<br/><br/>Dan may seem like a wimpnever mind how disrespectful his older son William (Logan Lerman ) is to him--for letting Wade steal his horses, but this character will do anything to protect his family. By the end of the movie, we know Dan is not a foolthe truth comes out about how he lost his leg to friendly fire in the Civil War and why he continues to live on the dying ranch in Arizonabecause the climate is best for his youngest son suffering from tuberculosis. Dan tells Wade that he was no hero in the war and saw no actionand says, try telling that to your sons. Before Wade constantly annoys Dan with accusations that he doesn't take care of his family properly. At one point, Dan pushes Wade to the ground, gets right into his face and says, I'll cut you down right here. Dan is willing to stand up to Wadeperhaps killing him even if it would mean losing his gravely needed $200 to keep his home. With Dan's confession to Wade, who always wants to know how he lost his leg, Wade lets Dan escort him to the traintelling Dan that he has already escaped the Yuma prison several times. This is the turning point in the movie--white hats and black hats together.<br/><br/>Although all the other stories and characters are interesting, a valid criticism is that the movie doesn't focus more on the complex relationship between Wade and Dantheir scenes are the most interesting parts of the movie. Wade is a ruthless killer/criminal, but he acknowledges that he is rotten. Dan is an honest, hard-working man who believes on keeping his promises. In the hotel room hours before the train is to arrive, Wade offers Dan money to let him go, but he refuseseven though Wade makes a convincing argument that this is the money that the crooked bankers have cheated Dan out of. Who is the worst criminalthese men or Wade?<br/><br/>The ending sequence is suspenseful. William sneaks out of the hotel room to help his fatherwill he get killed? Who will finally kill the psychopathic Prince? As Prince compliments Dan on being a tough old rancher, he shoots him in the backall the while Wade tells him no. Prince, holding the crucifix pistol, is shot down by his hero, Wade. William has a chance at revengeto shoot down Wade, but he lets him go on the prison train, proving that Dan did the right thing as he told Wade that William would never turn out a criminal because he taught him how to be decent. The lesson is learned.<br/><br/>The main theme of 3:10 to Yuma is redemption. We have the redemption of Danwho, though in doing the right thing, has made the ultimate sacrificeliterally dying for the salvation of his family. Crowe and Bale each give incredible performances. I think Bale's acting is the most impressiveplaying the quiet desperation of his handicapped-in-many-ways character. Certainly Wade is the flashier cowboy, but Dan is the heart and soul of this story. We have the redemption of Wade who in spite of his willingness to shoot down even his own men is a sympathetic character. You think he is doing the right thing when he kills the man who burned Evans' barnalthough Dan says that he was an a s s hole that he didn't necessarily deserve to die. Wade is funny and quirkysomething of a thwarted artist who is always sketching. We also know of his abandonment as a child. Wade's redemption is letting Dan be the hero. He willingly goes to Yuma prison, but we suspect he may escape as he whistles for his horse who runs after the traina great ending for a western."
"sonofgodtrujesus","10","2","5","17 September 2007"," Christian and Crowe were crack a lacking, just taring up the screen; wonderful performances.
","I loved this movie because it reminded me, with sincere passion, that although bad (evil) men spend most of their time being bad and by their actions are bad, there is a capacity and a knowledge of good and to do good, even in the midst of a spoiled and a wasted life. The other reason why I loved this move is that it was such a pleasure to watch professionals enter their characters and refuse to budge even for an instant in front or the camera; such acting forces you to identify with the characters and submerges you deeper into the film.<br/><br/>Christian and Crowe were crack a lacking, just taring up the screen; wonderful performances. Mr Lerman can act; has an uncanny ability of putting on an alter ego and reducing his own; hope to see a lot more from him in the future. Peter Fonda gave a certain old school credence to this film. A lot of modern film lack texture due to the box office draw of pretty boys and healthy hunks; Fonda certainly gave this film depth and time perception.<br/><br/>James Mangold cannot make a western but he is a good story teller. This film looked too new and pretty, the film was too clear, the sets were too new and not dusty enough; no one chewed tobacco and their were no prostitutes or mangy dogs; everything was just a little too polished. Good casting and good filming of the story, only the ability to create real fear and danger was almost non existent."

The gun violence is way, way over the top. Much too Hollywood, as they say. The acting is excellent and there is thoughtful devotion to those things that make great westerns -- scenery, dialog, music, and plenty of livestock and authentic weaponry -- but the spent cartridges (even excluding a Gatling gun) and body count strain belief. Anyone who merely likes westerns should see it and will probably enjoy it, but if you love westerns, keep your expectations in check."
"pyrocitor","10","2","5","12 September 2007"," Breathtaking and consistently quality modern western
","The Western, a genre often associated with dusty studio sets in the 1950s, had more often than not been considered retired in today's film industry, the last noteworthy effort being Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven back in 1992. With that in mind, it is nothing less than exhilarating to see a modern take on the genre seem so fresh and bursting with life and vitality, making 3:10 to Yuma not only the strongest western in decades, but also one of the most consistently quality films in recent memory.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold of Walk the Line fame should be given tremendous credit for extracting a great premise from a mostly unknown film (the original was hardly recognized as a timeless classic, making its remake status a bit suspect...) and translating it into a superb adaptation, nearly unanimously considered superior to the original. Mangold's firm directorial touch, working off the film's near flawless script is a sight to behold indeed. Crafting a nearly airtight blend between introspective musing, slowly festering psychological tension, and good old hardworn Western action tradition, all with enough of a modern spin and injection of energy, the film is made accessible to a contemporary audience, without forgetting its traditional western roots. With pitch perfect cinematography and editing exquisitely drinking in the dusty trails, rickety saloons and lone prairies among other western visual trademarks, complimented by the traditional yet never clichéd score, the audience feels fully immersed in the Old West setting. We feel the bullets tearing past (in some of the most exhilarating shootout sequences in years), feel the sand blowing into our faces and shake from the clamour of approaching horses. <br/><br/>The already stellar film is fuelled by its dynamic cast, each giving performances which would normally qualify as ""show stealing"", were it not from the unanimously strong work from all the others. Russell Crowe once again demonstrates his astonishing prowess as an actor, making Ben Wade one of the most compelling villains in years - suave, silver tongued, with a clear sense of honour, yet still unapologetically self serving and malevolent. His antagonist is perfectly complimented by the ever reliable Christian Bale, on top form with yet another brutally affecting performance as beaten down yet proud rancher Dan Evans. Working with a character who could all too easily fall into the mould of the stereotypical ""doing right for the sake of doing right"" hero figure, Bale instead embraces the emotional foibles of Evans, providing a downtrodden charisma complete with a malevolent glint in the eye, making him a consistently intriguing protagonist. The depth the two stars instill their characters with is flooring, and countless accolades should justifiably be bestowed on both.<br/><br/>Adding to the immense prowess of the two leads, Ben Foster is a cinematic powder keg as Wade's fiercely loyal and sadistically homicidal right hand man, both genuinely terrifying and incessantly watchable - one would be hard pressed to find a more menacing villainous sidekick. It's also wonderful to see Peter Fonda in the genre made famous by his father, giving his most impressive performance in years as a grizzled, aging bounty hunter, and the always wonderful Alan Tudyk gives a strong and fittingly comedic contribution as an unconventional doctor. Relative newcomer Logan Lerman is impressively powerful as Bale's impressionable yet fiercely rebellious son, easily outshining the usual lack of emotion produced by most young stars. In fact, the only weak link in the cast is Gretchen Mol as Bale's wife, who, while not terrible by any means, comes across as disappointingly flat in a cast full of such immensely capable performers.<br/><br/>All things considered, 3:10 to Yuma is not only one of the strongest westerns in the past few decades, but arguably among the most beautifully crafted additions to the genre. With a steady and capable directorial hand throughout, and fuelled by mesmerizing performances from an immensely powerful cast, in particular the dynamic Crowe and Bale,the film excels in showcasing all the traits which made its trademark classics successes, while still accessible and appealing for a contemporary audience. One begins to wish that the title train would never arrive, that the film might continue on immersing its audience in its consistently classy splendour long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>-10/10"
"fchousemdpc","10","2","5","11 September 2007"," 3:10 to Oscar for Christian Bale-Screenplay
","Absolutely the best western since Clint Eastwood's ""The Unforgiven"" !!This is a magnificent screenplay rewrite of Elmore Leonard's original 1953 short story , first screened with Glen Ford starring in the 1957 version. This 2007 edition demands consideration for 'Best Screenplay'. Christian Bale is superb as the down and out Evans, securing his place as one of the most versatile actors of this generation, besides Russell Crowe, who as Ben Wade personifies a mixed message of virtuous evil in this modern day great American relativist morality play. You somehow sense that when Evans tells about how he lost his leg on the Union Side, he is speaking in a more global sense ,addressing the pathos of a generation of Vietnam and Iraq veterans. The plot nuances between Evans and Ben Wade and Charlie Prince conjures up an existentialist dilemma, that blurs the lines between good and bad ,while at the same time delineating both. A multi-level masterpiece!<br/><br/>'Pardner', you will miss a bunch if you don't catch this train before it pulls out of the station! -f.c.h."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","11 September 2007"," Finally, a western that is almost as good as the classics
","I have not seen ""3:10 to Yuma"" (1957) but I can well imagine how good Glenn Ford and Van Heflin are in their respective roles. The following comments are straightly on ""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007) and nothing more.<br/><br/>The villain (Ben Wade, played by Russell Crowe) is an arch-villain personified  cool, cold-blooded, stylish and artistic (our first sight of him is at sketching a wild bird perched on a tree). And brains too  a task that a dozen gunmen on horseback can't handle, of stopping a payroll convoy stagecoach equipped with a machine gun, a herd of cattle driven down a slope easily accomplishes. This also sets the tone for the entire movie  it's a movie with brains.<br/><br/>The story of the hero (Dan Evans, played by Christian Bale) is a little more complicated, but is essentially one of a down-trodden hero and a familiar story of the rich trying to take land from the poor. His 14-year-old son William (Logan Lerman) has an important part to play too.<br/><br/>The setup takes about 40 minutes, a tension-fill 40 minutes: through a chain of somewhat random events, the hero finds himself among a group of 5 with the deadly mission of taking the villain to the station for the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison where he is to be hanged. Variations of this plot line have been used in many movies, in various genres, that latest of which I can remember is ""Assault on precinct 13"" (2005).<br/><br/>The main body of the movie is an odyssey that unfolds in alternating moods of pensive dialogue and chilling action. Except for those who cannot sit still for 5 minutes (and many of these, I suspect, are not pre-teen kids), the movie entertains in many different ways, not the least of which is the psychological duel between the two main protagonists. There is also a large watchable supporting cast, the most remarkable among which are a bounty hunter in the escort group played by Peter Fonda, who needs no introduction, and Wade's second-in-command vowed to rescue his ""boss"", played by Ben Foster, who steals the show, and not just once.<br/><br/>The 30-minute finale is as good as any you've seen in the action department. But the real challenge in the movie is not one of who draws faster, but something that the 14-year-old throws at the villain, that there is still some good in him, despite the villain's assertion that he wouldn't survive for 5 minutes in the kind of life he lives without being ""completely rotten"". The vindication comes with the twist at the end."
"joyous456","10","2","5","10 September 2007"," Fabulous!
","Russell Crowe and Christian Bale and all the other actors were superb! I think this will stand out as another one of the great westerns to see and re-see over and over. Really happy we saw it! (And I didn't know I would like a western like this.) The plot, action and anticipation were right on. The great acting is the most important thing to me, no matter how good a story it is, and that didn't disappoint at all. It makes me want to see another movie with Russell Crow and Christian Bale, either together or separately, it doesn't matter. Christian Bale's ""son"" also did a great job acting very convincingly. I will definitely buy this movie on DVD later and watch it again and again!"

","This will not spoil the ending, but anyone who saw the 1957 version with Glenn Ford and Van Heflin and remembers the stunning drama of that conclusion will probably be disappointed in the remake's alteration. That's a shame. In a way, the entire film sacrificed suspense for melodrama. That, too is a shame.<br/><br/>But the big question is whoever decided that the Old West was a tobacco free zone. I mean, here are the rottenest, meanest, whiskey-swillingest outlaws on the frontier, and there's not a stogie, chaw, or home-rolled smoke anywhere to be seen. I think there was a sniff of snuff, but it happened so quick, no one probably saw it. In this period, tobacco was a part of life. To omit it is to throw any attempt to recreate historical period out the window."
"joestank15","10","2","5","8 September 2007"," Another great performance from Bale, and Crowe's most interesting character yet.
","3:10 to Yuma - James Mangold's remake of a Western I haven't seen starring Russell Crowe as Ben Wade and Christian Bale as Dan Evans. Ben Wade (Crowe) is an outlaw seemingly too smart to be an outlaw who, in the celebration of his latest robbery, was apprehended. Dan Evans (Bale) agrees to hold the captured outlaw who's awaiting a train to go to court in Yuma. A battle of wills ensues as the Dan and Ben travel closer to Ben's punishment.<br/><br/>Let me just say firstoff, that the performances are captivating. Christian Bale, who I've never known to give a bad performance, brings quiet intensity and a desperateness to his part. He wants his family to have a future, and for his son to be proud of him. Russell Crowe gives possibly my favorite performance of his, as he chews the scenery, kills people (not much new there), and barely lets you know what is going on in his character's mind. His intentions are never clear, and just as muddled is his take on morality. The Western genre has been famous for muddled character desires, though money and the killing of others is usually among them. Ben Wade is famous, has all the money he could desire, and has killed ""more people than the Drought"", so the ambiguity of the character and his chemistry with Dan Evans (whose fate he showed more interest in than his own) made for great viewing.<br/><br/>Alan Tudyk (one of my favorite ""that guy"" guys), Peter Fonda and Luke Wilson play small parts. The action is intense, but doesn't overpower the character driven screenplay, as two of this generations' best actors go toe-to-toe. Not everyone will appreciate this film perhaps, but I found it to be very good and quite moving (esp. at the end). The film's is a little over 2 hours, but very well paced. I'd see it again in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>I give it an A."
"nogsy11","10","2","5","8 September 2007"," The perfect pair for a western
","Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are both spectacular in this film. A real enjoyable film. Had this movie been made 15 years earlier it'd have had Clint Eastwood in it. Crowe's character was the most interesting and he played it perfectly. Bale was amazing as usual as the complicated rancher. Peter Fonda's character was brief but interesting. Ben Foster stole the show in every scene he was in. This movie kind of reminded me of Unforgiven just with some of the scenery shot and the pace. The clothes they wore in the movie were really cool especially Crowe's. Bale's son in the film did a pretty good job. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good western."
"mgtbltp","6","2","5","8 September 2007"," Remake has a different emphasis
","spoilers <br/><br/>Just got back from the theater, audience was a mixed bag but I did notice a lot of gray haired folks, more than usual, the Western's demographic is definitely in evidence.<br/><br/>Over all first impression I'd say that this film was a 8/10, I liked it, it amped up the volume on the action from the original version emphasized different parts of the story while neglecting some others. Its definitely an improvement over the dialog driven TV Westerns of late.<br/><br/>But it did have a few faults which I'll enumerate later.<br/><br/>It starts out in the ranch house introducing the Evan's family, and this version has Evans with wooden leg which he lost in the Civil War.<br/><br/>The whole beginning stage coach hold up was very SW in feel and the action sequences during this were well done and exciting. Wade seeing the coach, despite the heavy attack upon it, beginning to pull away from his crew drives the Evans cattle herd into the road (like in the Original version) to stop it. Ben Foster as the creepy cold blooded gunslinger Charlie Prince dispatches the wounded.<br/><br/>The gang rides into Bisbee with their loot. Charlie Prince tells the sheriff about the hold up in the canyon and meets up in the with rest of the gang in the Saloon & their they splits their cash. Most then leave for the nearby Mexican Border. Ben Wade stays behind & seduces a willing Emmy Nelson the bar girl. They go upstairs, make & love. The whole sequence of how Dan Evans & the town sheriff capture Wade in the saloon in this version is totally garbled, in the original it was crystal clear.<br/><br/>The Bisbee Sheriff, Butterfield, and Evans plan to take Wade to Contention City pulling a switcheroo (as in the original) at the Evans Ranch. A new twist for the story is having the oldest son of Evans join the party escorting Wade.<br/><br/>The new version spends a lot of time on the trail adding more action that is all pretty good also has an added sequence at the rail camp where a work crew is blasting tunnels for a new rail line.<br/><br/>At Contention the whole sequence of taking Wade from the Hotel to the Station was again amped up by the device of having Charlie Prince offer the town folk a bounty on the sheriffs posse (believable?, no) but the result is a grand shootout as Evans & Wade make a run for the station.<br/><br/>The actual 3:10 coming into Contention was anti-climatic in this version.<br/><br/>Over all the town sets and costuming all looked fantastic Flaws: The biggest first, 40% of the movie was missing. I don't remember to much of a score and I sorely miss the hypnotizing Spanish guitar from the original version. That was Wades leitmotif and this was a big mistake, it lent an extra dimension to all Wades dialogs & actions.<br/><br/>A bit PC, remember the original and the smoke filled bar, I don't think I saw anybody smoking, give me a break.<br/><br/>Initial Western Feel. The whole beginning Evans family sequence doesn't evoke ""The West"". It needed an establishing landscape shot, then the Evans & just a bit more lingering on landscape shots it did have, but the cutaways seemed to come to fast.<br/><br/>Chronologically it pushed the envelope a bit . Evans looked what, 30 - 35 tops, he's supposed to have lost his leg during the Civil War, so he would have had to been young, 17, and the year 1864 at the time to make him 35 + by mid 1880's (when the Southern Pacific was running) its a minor quibble. They could just as easily have said he lost it in the Indian Wars.<br/><br/>The story line got garbled, it was crisp & clear and humorous (the bit with the town drunk) in the original version how Wade got captured this version fowled this up. I still think Ford & Farr did a better job with their sequence.<br/><br/>Both versions still suffer from the endings neither is all that satisfying or believable but this new version has much more action. I would have thought though (from the prowess displayed by the marksman on Wades gang during the stagecoach holdup) that he would have easily snipered out Evans on his break for the station with Wade. It would have been better to do the break for the station the way it was done in ""Last Train From Gun Hill"" , ie. Evans holding a scatter gun under Wades chin.<br/><br/>It needed more train shots too, but thats me."
"jaredmobarak","8","2","5","8 September 2007"," Even bad men love they mommas3:10 to Yuma
","It is interesting how having an Oscar nominated director and actor, along with an Oscar winning actor can make a film garner award season buzz rather than the backlash of being a remake. The stigma of remake usually spells the kiss of death for most films, but it seems almost an afterthought with James Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. Based on an Elmore Leonard short story, the original is somewhat highly touted, so it is not as though people don't know of it to have forgotten. Either way, I believe a film should be looked upon individually and not necessarily compared to what came before it. Sure, that will never happen, as comparisons are too easy to not be made, but if a remake works, it works on its own. As far as this one goes, hot on the heels of two remakes I did not enjoyThe Invasion and Halloweenwe finally have a winner. I have not seen its predecessor, however, the Western genre has been seeing somewhat of a revival lately. As far as those go, this does not quite match the brilliance of The Proposition from last year, it does ultimately warrant a look.<br/><br/>By far, it's the acting that really shines. Between the Oscar winner in Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, (no he isn't the nominated actor here, that's Peter Fonda, Bale still surprisingly hasn't been so honored), you have an acting clinic. These two are phenomenal as the outlaw being taken to his death and the rancher who volunteers to do it. Bale has shown that he is fantastic as the honest, hardworking, moral figure trying to do right by his family, but rarely have we seen Crowe as a complete villain. Even his L.A. Confidential badass was at heart a good guy that was working for bad men. Here he is great as the cocky, fast-talking, charismatic, psychopathic killer. Bale's character's son says, he is not all bad, when actually, Crowe says, he is. No matter how affable he can appear, it is always for his own devices in order to get close and pull the trigger. While this aspect is wonderful on the whole, it is also the one main flaw of the film. We are shown this dark side of Crowe for the entire duration, and, as a result, the evolution of the relationship between he and Bale becomes implausible. I just truly didn't believe that they would have opened up to each other as they do.<br/><br/>Those two leads are by far the reasons to check out the film. It's like the buzz surrounding Righteous Kill which all culminates to the fact that we will be able to see DeNiro and Pacino on screen together; these two have that same dynamic and possibly are a tad better at that. There are more good actors here tooAlan Tudyk plays a rendition of his usual persona, Gretchen Mol is a welcome sight having been away from the scene for awhile, and Ben Foster again shows why he is the actor of choice for crazed lunatics. The one bad casting call is Luke Wilson in a bit part. Being Luke Wilson is a detriment because all the audience does is laugh at him trying to be serious. He might have been spot-on in the performance, but I'll never know; you really can't get past who he is to actually find out.<br/><br/>There is a plot involved here too, and it isn't that bad of one. The tension and wonder at whether they will make the train weighs heavy throughout the film and the interactions between the characters help create the interest. Aesthetically, the filmmakers do a good job showing the grime and filth of the time period as well as the carnage and selfishness that was prevalent. Were it two lesser actors, however, I have to believe I might have been bored by the length of the journey. It is Bale and Crowe chewing scenery that keeps the film from falling into a slow, plodding pace. The finale saves everything with the action amped up fully, the shootout is orchestrated to perfection. Again, though, I didn't quite believe why Crowe does what he does during it. I understand his ego and him thinking he had the ability to help Bale's psyche while still not hurting himself, but it was a bit too convenient. The bittersweet ending did help save any problems I had with it and in the end I will say I had a real good time."
"Homer_J_Sherman","7","2","5","8 September 2007"," great music by Marco Beltrami, and Bales and Crowe are as cool as ice
","Funny how the elements of this western, a quintessentially North American genre, that really stood out to me--the composer's score, and the leads' acting--were supplied by foreigners. Another foreigner was responsible for the excellent cinematography. <br/><br/>While funny, it's not surprising given the rich Italian spaghetti western tradition (Beltrami's score definitely has some of its flavor) and the rugged geography, and perhaps personalities, of much of Wales and Australia (where Bales and Crowe, respectively, hail from). And pretty much all European cinematographers have great eyes for sweeping landscapes and sensual lighting.<br/><br/>The movie overall was very good, never boring, but never quite splendid in either emotion or action. There is something frustrating about watching characters risk life and limb to escort a cold-blooded killer to some far-off train station just so he can get shuttled off to some kangaroo court to be sentenced to death, when they could (and should) just shoot him in the head immediately and save themselves inordinate trouble and expense. But the characters have to learn valuable life lessons, of course, and that takes time and effort and unimaginable sacrifice. At least their suffering was entertaining, thanks to the aforementioned elements. But whenever a plot feels somewhat unnecessary, as this one did, it's hard to feel true sympathy for the plight of its characters, and that's why the movie seemed to fall short of its ambitions as a tale of morality and redemption."
"ringhawk2000","8","2","5","8 September 2007"," Surprisingly good mix of drama and action...
","I didn't go into this movie with much expectation because it is a Western after all, a genre that is practically dead in mainstream movies. I went with my uncle who is a huge western fan and does not care much for today's movies. But I came out surprised and so did he. The movie was much better than my expectations.<br/><br/>The characters were well cast. Christian Bale played a father you could relate to, a sympathetic character who is introspective and reveals what caused him to become what he is by the end of the film. Bale comes up with another good performance in what must string of good performances in the last few years. Russell Crowe plays the cool and suave bad guy character who has psychopathic tendencies. He also reveals some of what caused him to be what he is leading to the climax. The other supporting characters did good also. The character of Ben Foster did not stand out to me like mentioned in some early reviews. He seemed to have less parts than it was made out to be, but it was enjoyable. Peter Fonda had some good lines and such in the film but he also had too little of a part than was made out to be. The other characters like Butterfield and the oldest son of Evans did quite good in their parts.<br/><br/>The story was a little slow in some places, especially in the start. But once the plot of transporting Ben Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma started it was a good ride. The climax was somewhat unexpected and a good change from the norm. The movie showed that each person had some redemption from their previous misfortunes or actions. The cinematography was not extraordinary but was decent and did not interfere with the movie. The sound was very good, the gunshots, horses stomping etc.. were still ringing in my head after watching..<br/><br/>It was a well spent 9.50 I would say. This movie should win some awards for the coming year or at least be nominated."

","It seems unlikely that someone could pinpoint what portion of a western makes it a classic. Is it the action? Is it the over the top performances of archetypical hero's and villains? The list may go on and on, but 3:10 to Yuma shows what makes a western, if not a classic, an entertaining and memorable film; a great morality play with great performances.<br/><br/>The films central characters turn out to be anything but archetypical. Dan Evans (played by Christian Bale) is a down on his luck rancher. Life is made all the more difficult with some locals who want him off his land so they can build a railroad. His wife and his children seem to be losing faith in him as a provider, husband, and father. On the other hand there is the notorious Ben Wade who is wanted for robbing stagecoaches and trains. Wade is caught under some unique circumstances and the people of the town decide they must send him on the next prisoner train to the Yuma prison. What follows is a journey that plays like a psychological battle between Wade and the group of men who want to bring him to justice.<br/><br/>Evans' circumstances make him someone who is more than willing to escort Wade to the town, for a price. Initially, it seems Evans is doing it purely for the money. But a closer look at his situation with his land and his family makes it seem like this is his last hurrah. The journey to bring a criminal to justice is his own personal attempt at redemption and proving something to his family and himself. Wade however, never shows any uneasiness at being caught and potentially being hung for his crimes. There are parts of the film where it seems that Wade is almost happy to have met Evans, since Wade's gang members are a bunch of merciless hoodlums.<br/><br/>I personally can't decide what the best part of the film was; the writing, the directing, or the stellar performances from Christian Bale and Russell Crowe. Bale's performance was terrific but it's really Russell Crowe that stands out in this film. The Ben Wade character is someone who instinctively understands people and their nature. Wade is able to size someone up (accurately) at a glance. Crowe might not be built like the typical hero, or villain for that matter, but Crowe plays Wade with a hardened intensity that presents him as a tough criminal. On the other hand, there are more subtle portions of the performance where Crowe really shows that Wade is considerably more intelligent than anyone gives him credit for, and this is why he's been able to elude the authorities for this long.<br/><br/>This is the best of 2007. Go watch it now!"
"the_Poppuns","9","2","5","7 September 2007"," Bale and Crowe are terrific together
","They really make this movie. I don't know how good it would have been with other actors. In the trivia, I just saw that Cruise and Bana were originally considered for this. Well we dodged a bullet there. Crowe and Bale just seemed so comfortable on screen not really playing against each other, but it was more like playing together, like two guys in a band. Bale, as Dan Evans, would be on bass and Crowe, as Ben Wade, on lead guitar. And I guess in a weird way the frontman would actually be one of the supporting cast members, Ben Foster as Charles Prince. The other members of the cast did a great job too.<br/><br/>I don't see this as a real gunslinger type of movie. I mean it has shootouts and action scenes but it's very deliberate and not too showy. I haven't seen the original yet so I can't compare it. But compared to the other westerns I've seen this is one of the good ones. I believe it's rated R but I'm not too sure why. Maybe an 'F' word flew past me that I didn't notice or something, but apart from normal Western type violence (the kind where you see the bullet go in, not the shooter standing there), there wasn't much in it other than that there was a half-naked bum. But that's it. So I'd say it's great for anyone 13 and older. Even maybe a little younger if you have a younger Western fan in the family.<br/><br/>edit: I have seen the original now and I have to say this one is better. I'm not a remake fan but this is how remakes should be done. It's different enough to be worth making and it's the still the same story so it's not just an excuse to make money off of a recognizable title. The main differences are the length of it, maybe half an hour more, and the characters are more complex in this one."

","I don't know who wrote the previous ""review"" of this film giving it ten stars, but they were either a studio plant or completely insane. ""3:10 To Yuma"" is absolutely the most by-the- numbers Western you have ever seen. Not a single thing is surprising or original here. It's like a checklist of clichés and awful dialogue. Then again, what could we expect from the guy who also brought us the most by-the-numbers biopic, ""Walk The Line""? It's like he's phoning in his entire career.<br/><br/>I'm no film buff by any means, but even I have seen a movie or two by Sergio Leone, and I just don't understand how a movie like ""3:10 to Yuma"" could even be made after that. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale don't even come close to having the charisma of a John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, or even Kevin Costner (from that ""Open Range"" movie a few years back). <br/><br/>The only spark of anything surprising or enjoyable in this movie is Ben Forster's performance as Russel Crowe's lunatic/quasi-gay sidekick. If you see the movie you'll notice it's him that's on all the posters, not either of the leads... perhaps because he's the only thing worth paying attention to (if you can keep your eyes open.) <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie takes a huge step backward for the entire genre of Western films. What a waste of time."

You don't have to miss anything, if you ask for the poor farmer, his almost grown-up son, the dramatic intensity between the bad and good, the apaches, the saloons, the typical Western town.<br/><br/>So far it's quite funny, but in the final scenes it really is too much and the whole thing starts to take itself seriously.

","At least they waited fifty years to remake this which means that most of the popcorn brigade wouldn't have seen the original and have probably never seen an actor half as good as Van Heflin who makes Christian Bale look like the cardboard cutout he is. A lot of critics have been salivating over this remake and hailing it as the Second Coming. Actually it's a fine piece of film-making boasting good visuals and a strong central premise - if we draw a discreet veil over the ridiculous ending - back in the thirties you could just about get away with Jimmy Cagney screaming in terror as he went to the chair in Angels With Dirty Faces so that the punks who idolized him might think twice about emulating him; but Russell Crowe walking onto the train voluntarily just so Christian Bale's son will admire his dead father is just a bad joke - and Good versus Evil is, after all, what the Western has always been about but this one wants to have it both ways so that Crowe's Ben Wade is subtly elevated to a Huey Long figure who does bad in order to do good. If they WERE bent on changing the original - and they WERE because the bulk of that took place in the hotel room allowing Ford and Heflin to spark off each other, whereas in this version the hotel room sequence is probably less than ten per cent of the total footage - then they would have been better to give more screen time to Gretchen Mol as Bale's wife and explore their clearly troubled relationship in more depth. Of course nothing I say here is going to affect the obvious success of this remake so I'll content myself with reserved praise and disappointment for what might have been."

He grows a heart, apparently, out of the blue. Out of character. When a guy does something out of character at the end of a film, it's because the writer needed a lazy way to tie things up. A prime example here. Horribly unrealistic change of heart for Wade."

","""Unbelievable"" is the key word when it comes to describing ""3:10 To Yuma"". Unfortunately, not in the positive sense. That's not saying James Mangold's movie isn't very entertaining, because it is, but you really have to turn off your brain for it. Firstly, there's a father-son relationship that may be common in this day and age, but not at the period of time in which the movie is set. And secondly, characters behave irrationally all the time to a point where you could only buy their motivations if you were 10 years old.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are pretty good actors, but they don't get much chance to shine here. After all they're just in another fast paced action movie. For a western this here moves way too quickly and just isn't epic enough. Fair enough, maybe a modern western needs to be loud, fast and chatty. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the genre, so it suits me fine that Mangold doesn't really play by the rules. One thing is for sure, though: ""3:10 To Yuma"" will neither become a classic, nor does it belong among IMDb's Top 250 movies. Time will tell."

","When I saw the original fifty years ago,and a time or two since, I felt the story had a bit of plausibility to it. This remake doesn't even try to flirt with reality. There is no character development whatsoever, little interaction of personalities, just a whole lot of bloody violent murder for the apparent sake of audience titillation. Attempts to add twists and new situations to this version fall flat and do nothing to alleviate the lack of credibility here. It is difficult to provide examples, which would be numerous, of the silliness in the plot segments without an eruption of spoilers. Suffice to say that the last few minutes, a complete diversion from the '57 film, is an almost laughable conclusion but an appropriate one for what precedes it. Peter Fonda must have been in dire need of a new pool liner to have signed on for this one. Bad decision, Ulee!"

","I was 12 when I first saw 3:10 to Yuma with Van Heflin and Glen Ford. Two years later, something of a remake appeared. Kirk Douglas was trying to get a somewhat companionable Anthony Quinn to jail in Last Train to Gun Hill.<br/><br/>The star vehicle state of modern Hollywood films is now making it more difficult to remake these western morality tales.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, a desperate rancher on the verge of bankruptcy and facing foreclosure of his mortgage is supposedly the lead in the new 3:10, but Russell Crowe playing the outlaw Ben Wade is the real lead. Fifty years ago, Van Hefflin played the Nester making some money on the side to take Glen Ford to jail at Yuma prison.<br/><br/>Looked at closely, both 3:10s and Last Train are buddy westerns. The films are about a pair of hard men gradually warming up to one another, becoming friends. But there's a lot more company on the stagecoach to Contention to catch the train this time.<br/><br/>There's Christian Bale as the failed farmer Dan Evans looking for some quick money for delivering Wade. His son William complicates things by following Wade and his father without the old man's permission. Also along for the ride is a grizzled, gray and wrinkled Peter Fonda, as a Pinkerton Security Man who has been a mercenary in many a Pinkerton black bag job.<br/><br/>Fonda is gut shot early on in the game, during an elaborate stage robbery, in which the Pinkertons have equipped the stagecoach with armor, a Gatling gun, and Pinkerton men to guard the payroll. Normally being gut shot in a Western means certain death. But the law of the Western has been abrogated here so Fonda can get something more than a cameo in the film. A Veterinarian in nearby Bigsby removes the bullet so Fonda can stay on. Later though, Fonda becomes disposable. Wade, responding to Fonda's goading, gets an opportunity to rough Fonda up some, then casually throw him off a convenient cliff to his death.<br/><br/>That's another problem here. Since Russel Crowe is the lead, he gets special privileges in his role as an outlaw. He makes sketches of benign birds, betrays knowledge of books he's read, chides the Pinkertons about their lack of education and a philosophy. This leader of an outlaw band is a renaissance man. Worse, when Bale runs into trouble evading Wade's gang, which is trying to spring their boss, Wade sometimes changes horses midstream and helps him. This happens so often, the audience is in doubt about just who is going to be the hero of this horse opera, Evans or Wade. Who's going to leave the larger mark on impressionable William Evans, Ben Wade or Will's father Dan?<br/><br/>All through the film, the dwindling group delivering Wade to the Train, is dogged by Wade's gang. But good guy opportunities are missed. The marshal of Contention has enough firepower in the hotel room to simply scatter gun all seven of Wade's men on the street below. But the gang starts offering money to all the murderers and scalawags in town to help recover their boss, Hearing this, the Marshal and his deputies throw in the towel, put down their weapons and are wiped out to the man, by Wade's gang, when they step outside.<br/><br/>After this, Dan Evans and the last Pinkerton are having their own doubts. But Evans sticks it out and agrees to deliver Wade to the train. All along the trail, Evans and Wade have been trading bits of their pasts to one another, warming up in their respect for one another and warming up audience respect too. Now they've made it to the train station. Lead is flying everywhere and both are revealing secrets. Evans dumps the last chapter of his biography on Wade, who admits that he's been to Yuma twice before and escaped both times. This leaves a relieved Evans off the hook for Wade's proposed hanging at Yuma.<br/><br/>Wade is enthused about his new pal too. So enthused that he resolves to help deliver himself to the train. Just then Wade's second in command Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) arrives and pumps five bullets into Evans, meaning its more than a flesh wound this time: its certain death. Wade amazes the audience after being handed his gun and holster, by promptly shooting all five of his remaining associates to death in an elaborate bit of gun play, in anger for the wanton killing of his new friend, even though Dan isn't quite dead yet. Wade's son Will watches his father slowly die, then turns his colt on Wade, who has one in his own hand. But Ben turns his pistol over to the lad with some consoling words, then hops cheerfully aboard the train to Yuma.<br/><br/>My own thinking is that the Western died in the Sixties when Americans realized they had no more frontiers in the face of the endless Cold War and the failure of the war in Vietnam. The appearance of two westerns in a single weekend- the other one is Shoot 'Em Up With Clive Owen and Paul Giamati- causes one to reflect that Americans may be rethinking their destinies. Maybe we can conduct a war while spending what we want at the mall, enduring a sub prime lending crisis, with Wall Street demanding lower interest rates to lift the Stock Market. We can do it, that is, while undercutting the moral firepower of our new Westerns. We're not likely to win many wars this way either."

Anyway, the acting is very good - that's what actually saves the movie and makes it to stand out. Russell Crowe does a superb job - as always -, Christian Bale proves again that he is a very talented, versatile actor, and Ben Foster - as Charlie- is great.

They are dated, both in quality of filming and acting and in freedom of expression. This 3:10 to Yuma captured the spirit of those old westerns with today's more serious acting and improved cinematography and special effects.<br/><br/>The plot was the very definition of a western: war veteran family man, failing ranch, greedy railroad men, gang of outlaws with a dashing leader. Much like the previews suggest and enjoyable the entire time. The acting may not have been ""oscar caliber"" but everyone was right on character. Ben Foster had no problem on screen with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe, and even the young Logan Lerman (had to go look his name up) held his own. Nice to see Peter Fonda and Alan Tudyk, minor characters but memorable moments.<br/><br/>The violence was stronger than back when, though not deserving of the R it was given. PG-13 only I would think, comparable to the X-Men series or teen horror movies. The eldest son was played by an actor too ""young"" to see an R movie!

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is a 2007 western film directed by James Mangold. The movie is produced by Cathy Konrad. The movie stars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in a story that is about the capture and delivery of a criminal to Yuma prison. Dan Evans, played by Christian Bale, is a one-legged rancher that aids in the capture of outlaw Ben Wade, played by Russell Crowe.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is a well-written movie. This movie is based on a short-story 'Three-Ten to Yuma' by Elmore Leonard. The movie features a great villain in Ben Wade played incredibly well by Russell Crowe. The villain feels believably distinct in the movie and offers a fresh perspective whenever Ben Wade is on the screen. Ben Wade has his own code that becomes more apparent as the movie goes on. This code made me and other audience members respect him. The presence that Russell Crowe provides makes the movie much more exciting and enthralling to watch.<br/><br/>The performance by Christian Bale is excellent. His character of Dan Evans had a nice progression through the movie and it showed in the acting and story. Dan Evans has a backstory of being a Civil War veteran that is revealed throughout the movie. Even in the more emotional parts of this movie Christian Bale's acting holds up and provides nice moments for the audience. Dan Evans' relation with his son is interesting to watch. The final revelation that Dan Evans had done the mission to give his sons, a good memory or makes the earlier portions of the movie more rewatchable.<br/><br/>Both Dan Evans and Ben Wade's onscreen chemistry is great. The two actors, and characters have great lines and delivery that make the movie much more enjoyable. Each of the moments with the two characters serves to make the audience understand more about the characters in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>James Mangold's direction should be praised. He delivers an incredibly beautifully shot movie. The movie features many classic western settings that are delivered in an exciting way. There are many scenes that are gorgeous to look at. Even the distinction the towns and countrysides are apparent in the direction.<br/><br/>The only fault the movie may have is its slow pacing. This movie feels out of its era as the movie is a slow burn to the climax. I do not consider this a weakness of the movie as it is also a reason why I like the movie. The beauty of the movie is seeing the western setting and themes realized on the theater screen. There are not many gun fights in this movie which can let down some audiences expecting an action movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend '3:10 to Yuma'. This movie is everything I look for in a solid western.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"tabuno","7","1","2","21 January 2019"," Nice But Not Great
","13 October 2007. 3:10 To Yuma tries but doesn't quite succeed in being great. The lines, the plot, and acting all seem to call out for increased applause and appreciation because of the nice flourishes and added touches that make this movie rise above many others. Russell Crowe's character Ben Wade has suggestive resemblances to the most famous of criminal heros - Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector but never quite becomes that evil person we would like to take home with us, except by the end his character seems to decompensate and fracture into a somewhat confusing and perhaps too American movie studio caricature that loses a lot of its authentic appeal. The plot is strong, except with glaring flaws, such as when one counts the number of characters that Ben Wade is forced to kill later in the movie, two instead of three. Or when there is a stagecoach fire and no one appears to be screaming. There are number of overly convenient contrivances introduced in this movie in order to supposedly improve the movie but instead seem more artificially imposed on the story, particularly where and what happens when Ben Wade briefly escapes. There were even more opportunities for the script to have become even more edgy and emotionally compelling, like when Ben Wade's band of outlaws shoots some people in cold blood later in the movie that emotionally diminished one of the most important scenes in the movie where Dan Evans played by Christian Bale has to make a crucial decision regarding what he was going to do with Ben Wade. There is also a scene where Dan Evans's son, William Evans played by Logan Lerman, who comes to the rescue a number of times and one scene where he confronts Ben Wade and it is resolved in a fashion that appears too pedestrian without the sort of Ben Wade panache that would have been more likely to have been on display. Overall, this movie retains good pacing, nicely developed plot situations, consistency, and compelling emotional intensity while at the same time retaining a human sensitivity often lost among Westerns. This Western feels like a new and improved version of the genre, yet it failed to succeed in making it to the breakthrough that the producers, writers, and director sought. Seven out of Ten Stars."

""Jackie Brown"" is based on another Elmore Leonard story, just to give you an example. Lots of dialogues in this western. Not too much action. And what those Leonard stories also have in common is that the characters are true to life people. Although there are better westerns to be found, this one has got its merits because of its great story and reasonably good acting by Russel Crowe and Christian Bale."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Based on the core story as the 1957 original, it tried to honor it on the 50 year anniversary. Again, a local rancher Dan, for the sum of $200, assists with escorting the dangerous and clever-minded Ben Wade to the 3:10 pm train to Yuma to go to trial for his years of robbing and murdering. Dan agreed to this as he is desperate for money to help save his ranch and his personal pride. Will Dan and his crew get Ben on that train? How many will survive this adventure as Ben's gang is hot on their tail? This movie had some very exciting action scenes, a nice constant tension formed the spine of the story and there were frequent morality jabs back and forth. There were also a few moments you questioned why a character did this or that like how a key charter took a bullet to the gut and was trotting on a horse again within hours without a grimace. So if you don't pick it apart too bad, it is a fine and entertaining movie. It was a high quality production with solid acting."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","2","21 May 2018"," As good as it could be.
","This is a great example of how good a traditional raw plot can be. The characters in this movie and the structure of the story are very straightforward and easy to dissect, but it delivers really solid movie. By doing basic things very well, 3:10 to Yuma sets itself apart from all the generic and formulaic movies that display all the typical story tropes by doing all of them very well. This story features a simple through-line: get Ben Wade onto the 3:10 train to Yuma to bring him to justice and allow Dan Evans to preserve his farm. The characters are not extreme in any way, but they are treated with a lot of respect by the writer and that makes them better than most. Plus they get all get really good performances, which never hurts.<br/><br/>Although Ben Wade is definitely the antagonist and Dan Evans is definitely the protagonist, the movie feels a lot like a two-hander. Typically movies are about the defining time of a person's life in which they change forever, and that is definitely the case for Dan, but not for Ben. Bringing Ben to justice is the one thing that Dan has ever done that he can feel proud of and Ben almost becomes his ally in this, whether he is actually helping Dan reach his goal or resisting him. In fact, Dan needs the task of getting Ben to the train station to be difficult, because if it is not difficult, then it gives Dan no chance to prove himself. This is actually sort of true of all movies, or at least many, but it is more pronounced here. The events of the movie are not exactly a defining point in Ben's life, but more of a point where everything he has done to that point comes to a head and he is sort of okay with the fact that his life of crime is probably over. He doesn't want to go to prison, but he doesn't seem to really want his band to rescue him that much either. What I loved about his character was the way that he was always able to sort of be in control of the situation and give the sense that ""I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me."" And for better or worse, Ben lives up to this badass line better than the Watchman who actually said it.<br/><br/>One concept that is intrinsic to Westerns and is very on display here is frontier justice. The fact that the law has a very loose grip on the land means that justice is really in the hands of anyone who wants to enact it. Both of our main characters, and even Dan's son William to an extent, use this to their advantage. Ben and his gang obviously use the loose justice system to run rampant and commit crimes. Dan uses it as a way of doing something noble that matters, as does William. And throughout the movie, there are hints that the justice that Ben is being brought to is not frontier justice in which someone actually pays for his crimes. The railroad companies and such that Ben has robbed from are just removing a threat to their business. I only mention this because I think it adds to the characters, particularly Ben, and makes them easier to root for because they are sort of rebelling against the system in some ways.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend watching this because it's just an all-around solid movie. A lot of times, people say that aspiring screenwriters should study Tarantino movies or Wes Anderson movies or other movies that do unconventional or strikingly different things to help them find their voice or maybe show them how to break the ""rules"". But I really think this is a better movie to study as a writer: A movie that does nothing fancy but does everything right. I think every writer has a simple story like this in them and if they care enough about it, they can make it as good as this movie is. Overall Rating: 8.1/10."
"cliftonofun","7","1","2","21 April 2018"," A solid throwback
","I will fully admit that this movie goes well beyond slightly implausible to fairly ridiculous (especially over the last 20 minutes or so). But here's the thing: it earned the right to do so with great performances, stellar direction, and a perfectly paced story. Everything works. So when it inevitably devolves into a clichÃ© Western shoot em up, you care way too much to be bothered by it. Crowe and Bale alone make this one worth a couple hours."

 Christian Bale and Russell Crowe successfully live up to what I expected from them with their well-depicted characters. I don't want to expatiated on their performance, you'll understand why they are considered among the top actors when you see the movie. <br/><br/> Scenario, I can assure you about non-stop action, after some point it doesn't start to make much sense still you continue watch it because of its mesmerizing atmosphere.

"coasterswitch","Null","1","2","28 October 2017"," Good old fashion Western
","The best part of this western is Russel Crowe. He steals the movie from everyone else. Crowe's performance is enigmatic as he makes it cool to be an outlaw. From his mannerisms to his outfit he personifies a cool bad guy. He also makes his bad guy character intelligent too. Apart from Crowe; here is a terrific story. At the end of the day its about telling a story. This story is paced well and linear. The movie also provides a realness in its use of gun play and explosions. One cannot critique this movie without mentioning the performance of Ben Foster. He plays a more deranged bad guy than Crowe and without the charm but he does so in a mesmerizing fashion. 3:10 To Yuma is a great example of how a great Western can be and illustrates that they still can be made well today. I encourage everyone to see this movie. If you have never seen a Western this movie will make you a fan of the Western genre!"

"ivo-cobra8","8","1","2","24 June 2017"," Russell Crowe's fine western flick that i was blown away
","3:10 to Yuma (2007) it is a fine western film from Russell Crowe and Christian Bale directed by James Mangold. It is a remake of the 1957 film of the same name, making it the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard's short story ""Three-Ten to Yuma"". Filming took place in various locations in New Mexico. 3:10 to Yuma opened September 7, 2007, in the United States and received positive reviews from critics.<br/><br/>I am big fan of Russell Crowe and I love his movies and this was his second western film he did. The first one was in 1995 The Quick and the Dead with Sharon Stone which is definitely one of my favorite western films. I love Clint Eastwood western films such a: A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Pale Rider, High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales. I love Young Guns, Tombstone, I already mentioned The Quick and the Dead, 3:10 to Yuma is also one of my favorite western films today. <br/><br/>This movie is about so many things. Good and Evil (or right and wrong) and the blurry line that sometimes separates them, what drives a man toward one or the other. It's about desperation and self-preservation. Ben Wade is a criminal who from the first moment in the story we see has redeeming qualities, and as many criminals, he is also charming. Dan Evans is a good man, who comes close more than once to crossing that blurry line, out of desperation. There is Evan's boy, who is in a position to choose a hero (there are no heroes in this film). There is a lot at stake for both ""sides"" in this movie. While there are some negative opinions about the ending, I don't think it would have been satisfactory any other way.<br/><br/>The pacing is good, the movie goes fast around it is not boring or overlong, the acting from everyone is solid, the action is good. I like the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. I must say Russell Crow is a talented actor and his movies are really good of course he is not great like is Keanu Reeves but he is way better than fat pig Arnold today. I love the characters in this movie and the chemistry between two leads (Crowe and Bale).<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is a good western movie some say it is a classic I don't think it is, but it is close to a classic. We have a lots of shootouts and of course a real explosions. Ben Wade and Dan Evens are fine characters to watch, we have Peter Fonda as a bounty hunter Byron McElroy. This was a damn good western movie and I wish they would make more movies like are this one today. I hated Django Unchained to death I thought that movie sucked a hairy dick but this movie was a fine western that I was blown away. <br/><br/>I had no clue this was even up for Oscar nominations. But, I can certainly see why with such a competent script, great storytelling, and even greater characters played impeccably by Bale and Crowe. I particularly enjoyed watching the chemistry that grew between them as the film progressed, which was elaborated upon even better due to their opposing personalities (Evans being the giver, and Wade being the taker). In fact, there were many a scene that I'd like to say I found thoroughly heroic and almost inspiring, in a sort of bittersweet retrospect, but at the expense of not ruining some of the more dramatic plot twists, I'll leave the viewing to you, the audience. The film presents a terrific balance of action, drama, and character development, all while being very realistic to the old west in terms of design and production. Aesthetically speaking, I'd probably go so far as to call it the best looking Western to date. Critically, I'd almost put it as one of my all-time favorite films, but I thought the overall length was just a tad too short for all the material to really stick with me by film's end. <br/><br/>The rating I give to this film is 8/10. Anything under 7 would be ridiculous, as anyone claiming this isn't at least a GOOD western film (it is sure as hell better than all the remakes like Django Unchained that get high scores) needs their head examined. I give it another point because what it does attempt to do it accomplishes so easily and perfectly. (For reference, I gave Eastwood movies a ten.) Any true weakness it has is simply that it's just an western movie, and that's it. It's hard to say anything bad (other than nitpicks) about the film itself.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is a 2007 American Western film directed by James Mangold and produced by Cathy Konrad, and starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the lead roles, with supporting performances by Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts, Alan Tudyk, Vinessa Shaw, and Logan Lerman.

"zkonedog","6","1","2","12 March 2017"," Interesting Themes, But Very Sparse Acting
","In the old heyday of Western films, the 1960s, the genre was categorized by the panache of John Wayne, who came into town with his six-shooters blazing and cleaned up one town after another of evil-doers. Lately, however, with the Western genre on the very fringe of Hollywood, directors tackling this specific art form have taken a different approach. Instead of the ""Duke model"", the focus is shifted towards the gritty realism of the time period.<br/><br/>This film continues that realism tradition. When Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a salt-of-the-Earth sharecropper just trying to eek out a decent living for his family, volunteers his services to make sure the seedy criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) catches the 3:10 train to Yuma, the journey turns out to reveal much more about each character. While Evans struggles to uphold the law at all times and still keep some semblance of his manhood, Wade begins to realize that perhaps Ben is fighting for the nobler cause. These themes are slowly and carefully explored over the course of the film, and by and large are very interesting.<br/><br/>However, the lack of great acting (or, more specifically, the lack of opportunities for great acting to shine) really bogs this movie down. I know that Bale and Crowe are top-notch actors, but they really aren't given a chance to take center stage. Bale's character is nearly silent the entire film, while Crowe has a few great moments but ultimately isn't fleshed out enough to truly believe/understand the film's conclusion. Only Logan Lerman, playing the part of Dan Evans' son William, truly shines in his role.<br/><br/>Thus, while the themes in the film are rather interesting, the action backing them up is extremely lacking. If you are a fan of the new ""minimalist"" Western genre, I would suggest Robert Duvall's ""Broken Trail"" over this film, as you will find it much easier to understand the issues that men in the Old West faced."

","Teaching your son morality and ethics is an admirable endeavor, but it should at least be rooted in realism and feasibility. There are so many illogical scenarios in the plot that teaching lessons from them seems ridiculous. In real life, different decisions most assuredly would have had to be make. An admitted killer, who also kills members of the party taking him to the prison train, is not himself dispatched by the remaining members? Dan asks his son to warn him when Ben's gang approaches Contention, but when the gang of 7 is gathered in a group outside the hotel window (and could easily be eliminated), does nothing? These are sworn killers, inexplicably left to kill more. They then enlist the help of the townspeople (for $200 each) to help in killing Ben's captors. Now Ben must be transported to the train station with 30 to 40 gunmen looking to kill whoever is escorting him. When everyone else abandons the effort, Dan still accepts it and, unbelievably, succeeds (with Ben running towards the train rather than trying to escape). Would this really happen in real life? Finally, when Dan is killed, Ben inexplicably kills *all* of his remaining gang. This is the gang who has doggedly pursued him & his captors to eventually free him. Then he willingly climbs aboard the prison train, probably eventually to be hanged. Really? How can Dan's son be expected to learn anything practical from these unrealistic scenarios?"

","I wouldn't call this movie a total mess because I really enjoyed certain elements of it but I really hated a lot of other things. First of all, I really liked Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in this, especially Crowe. I thought his character was very interesting and had a lot of depth and Russell Crowe does a pretty good job. The parts I enjoyed the most about the movie was some of the banter between Crowe and Bale. <br/><br/>The main problem I have with the movie is the script and some if not most of the dialogue. It felt very clunky at times, like they were trying too hard to get the Western dialogue going on but a lot of it didn't work. Speaking of the dialogue, there were was just too much expository dialogue in the film and very little was actually explained through actions. Some of the things the characters did were just retarded and stupid. Some things in the movie make no sense whatsoever and the characters aren't fleshed out enough for us to care. Except perhaps for Bale and Crowe, every other character in the film was like a cardboard cutout, with no layers to them. <br/><br/>I thought most of the directing and cinematography was serviceable, but nothing spectacular either. There was nothing really memorable in the movie for me I just liked the confrontation between Bale and Russell Crowe but that's pretty much the only thing I enjoyed about the film. Not a terrible movie, but considering the talented cast it should have been better. Also, the movie felt an hour longer than it actually was."
"Hey_Sweden","8","1","2","3 March 2016"," Not always logical or probable, but the acting makes it a must see.
","This modernized second adaptation of the Elmore Leonard short story stars the reliable pair of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Bale plays Dan Evans, a Civil War veteran turned rancher who's going through some difficult times. He's deeply in debt, so he seizes upon a chance to make some money. The job is to watch over a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Crowe), and eventually help to escort him through the desert, so he can make it to a train depot and thus be transported to prison. The outlaw, however, has other ideas in mind, and does his best to mess with the ranchers' head, while his scruffy gang relentlessly pursues the posse.<br/><br/>The 2007 version of ""3:10 to Yuma"" may not always make sense (some reviews have pointed out admitted holes in the plot), but technically it's wonderfully made, and in some ways it has the feel of a classic Western. The widescreen photography is beautiful, and the location shooting (mostly in New Mexico) likewise impresses. Director James Mangold does a fine job telling an entertaining and riveting story, succeeding at maintaining viewer interest for the better part of two hours.<br/><br/>The primary asset is a well chosen and exemplary cast. A charismatic Crowe and sincere Bale offer low key, nicely nuanced performances; Wade may be a bad man, but you can't help but like him to some degree. Evans, who's stuck with a sullen teenage son (Logan Lerman) who doesn't respect him, feels the need to prove himself worthy. The women, Gretchen Mol and Vinessa Shaw, end up with very little to do, unfortunately, but actors such as Peter Fonda, Dallas Roberts, Kevin Durand, and Alan Tudyk are a pleasure to watch. But it's Ben Foster who tends to steal the show in his role & performance as Charlie Prince, the most ruthless member of Wades' gang.<br/><br/>Best recommended to fans of the actors involved.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

Yet when the good guy is small time rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and the bad- ass bad guy Ben Wade is Russell Crowe that does not really matter. Shot on location, not on sound stage, the story has an epic sweep to it, the scenery and cinematography is magnificent. With the benefit of a big budget, the action sequences are impressive, and offer the sophistication of modern special effects.<br/><br/>Women are in short supply. They are either in the kitchen (Gretchen Mol), or in the bad guy's bed (Vinessa Shaw). Peter Fonda is wonderful in the supporting role of robbery victim, Ben Foster is a wide-eyed menace as baddie lieutenant.<br/><br/>At two hours, the story probably runs fifteen minutes too long, but the actors and scenery more than compensate for any lulls.

Although there's simply a huge plot gap whether how did Wade get to be so stupid as in escaping twice already but ending up to recaptured again and again, is quite a flaw for me about this movie. But the ending gives this movie the nice touch it needed to give itself an edge to differentiate it from other westerns. It's very neat to see that finally Wade changed as a character in the end, even that means sacrificing his own gang. The acting overall is good. Russell Crowe is strong as usual in giving life to this type of role he played. Christian Bale did very well in acting up the westerner, yawning up his mouth almost all the entire time. Logan Lerman succeeded in his role and get the attention he needed as a young actor. Having Ben Foster and Kevin Durand nicely completes the whole dangerous aura and mood of the movie."

","I enjoy western films, mainly newer ones and this is a pretty decent one. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale both are enjoyable to watch as Crowe portrays a quiet, but ruthless leader of a small gang of outlaws while Bale is a simple rancher trying to make ends meat. There was a decent amount of action and gun play in the film and a couple characters being especially well trained at it as usual there is. The deeper story throughout is pretty decent and makes you feel for the characters. It is not the best that I have seen of this genre but with a pretty good story and Crowe and Bale having good performances this a decently enjoyable film that I could watch again."
"Wuchakk","9","1","2","19 August 2011"," The price of redemption -- READ THIS if you had problems with the ending
","This remake involves the capture of a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), who is then escorted to the town of Contention to await the train to Yuma, where he'll be hanged. A desperate rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), hires on for the escort job because he needs the $200 for his family to survive. Wade plays psychological games the entire time trying to corrupt Evans, but things turn out differently.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding (which also features the beautiful Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda), the New Mexican locations are great and the score ranks with the all-time best. Most importantly the picture is engaging throughout its 2 hour runtime, not to mention the story gives the viewer a lot to chew on.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is realistic but what turned me off during my initial viewing was the second hour's mounting implausibilities. Thankfully, most of these can be explained.<br/><br/>One issue is when a man burns to death locked in a wagon carriage. The quibble is that he doesn't scream enough in fiery torment. But watch the scene and you'll clearly hear him yelling in the background. Evan's loss of a limp at the climax is more of an issue, although this can be explained by an adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>One problem I had was that Ben Wade (Crowe) came off as super-human. There was seemingly nothing he couldn't do, even while handcuffed. I suppose this could be explained by the fact that there ARE people who are incredibly gifted to the point of being nigh super-human. <br/><br/>In any event, this is not a realistic Western like, say, ""Wyatt Earp"" or ""The Long Riders."" No, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is a MYTHIC Western with an potent message. If you can't handle strong mythic elements in Westerns look elsewhere.<br/><br/>When I first saw the film I didn't get the ending and it turned me off. But it was clear that there was more to the picture than what first meets the eye so I decided to view it again. It DOES make sense, it's just that you might miss it on your initial viewing because the events flash by so quickly. When you DO see it, it'll blow you away.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FILM! <br/><br/>Wade is a confident and talented man who smugly looks down on others, acting like a disciple of Nietzsche who has no moral obligation to anyone, least of all God. He senses simple purity in Evans and plays the role of tempter, trying to corrupt Evans and win him to his way of thinking. But as they wait in the hotel room it is Evans who ""converts"" Wade, in a sense. Evans doesn't accomplish this in any type of contrived manner, he accomplishes it simply by being WHO HE IS -- an undefiled, courageous family man who stubbornly refuses to give up on hope, faith, life, righteousness and family.<br/><br/>As they're waiting, Wade sketches a picture of Evans in a book. It is later shown that this sketch was made on an opening page of a Bible. This reveals that Wade came to view Evans as a Christ figure, at least subconsciously, and that Evans is clearly a type of Christ in the story.<br/><br/>What exactly was it that caused Wade to ""convert"" and support Evans? (1.) He saw in Evans a man that refused to be bought -- a man who refused to be corrupted by filthy lucre, which was something he never experienced before. (2.) Evan's son insisted that there was still some good in Wade despite his wicked history. Regardless of Wade's denial, the kid was right. The idea that SOMEONE saw a glimmer of good in him, that SOMEONE out there BELIEVED in him despite his past evil deeds ultimately moved him and compelled him to support Evans. (3.) Wade turned evil because he was abandoned as a kid. He saw in Evans and his wife a REAL family -- parents who stayed together and refused to abandon faith, hope, righteousness and family come hell or high water. He became convinced that Evans and his family were worth supporting, even perhaps dying for. (4.) Evans made a deal with the Pinkerton that if he successfully got Wade to the train the Pinkerton would make sure Evans' family got $1000, which would bail them out of their hardships. Wade wanted to make sure the family got that money. Somewhere deep inside he wanted to redeem himself of his wicked past and this was the opportunity. This could be the beginning of a new life.<br/><br/>(5.) Wade's relationship with Evans lasted only a few days but he found something that was missing in all his other relationships - a friendship based on respect rather than familiarity or shared events. Great friendships like this can happen quickly similar to love-at-first-sight. Such relationships are conducive to transparency, which explains why Evans reveals to Wade the real reason he lost his leg in the war.<br/><br/>After Evan's brutal death Wade has an even greater revelation: To see a truly undefiled man -- a simple but GREAT man -- murdered by a group of immoral swine fills him with disgust. You can see it on his face. Yes, he should be thankful that his men remained loyal to him but this was about their only redeeming quality. To truly start a new life he would have to be judge and executioner of the corrupted souls who would pull him back down into the slime.<br/><br/>Why did Evans have to die? Because redemption can only be paid via the spilling of blood. It was the price for Wade to live and have a new life.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"Rodrigo_Amaro","9","1","2","6 August 2011"," Even with its flaws this is a truly great Western of the 2000's
","I was quite skeptical in watching the remake of one of my favorite westerns of all time since that was a film in which I wasn't expecting much but gained a lot of surprises. I love it! The 1957 version directed by Delmer Daves, starring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, is extremely surprising, tense, perfectly build and very interesting to see. But it turns out James Mangold update of the story was really interesting, very surprising and really great just as the classic. But there's some slips along the way...<br/><br/>The story is the same, the approach and how it unfolds in front of you is completely different. The masher and not much frightening villain Ben Wade played by Ford is played like an violent, smart and bloody guy on the hands of Russell Crowe; while the honest and at times peaceful Dan Evans of Heflin is played with the same integrity but more dangerously by Christian Bale. Aside these differences here's the plot: Ben Wade, the most wanted criminal of the west and his team got succeed in another money robbery but after staying on their first stop Ben was arrested by the local authorities. Their decision is to escort him to the train to Yuma, which leaves at 3:10 of the next day. Until then, he'll be on the hands of some Pinkerton guys and of rancher Dan Evans, who joined the team because he needs the reward promised so that he can save his ranch from the control of abusive men. However, escort these man won't be that easy. Ben's group, now led by the creepy and violent Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) will hunt them down wherever they go, leaving a trail of blood on the way. Get ready for the shots, persecutions on horses, and for a frantic cat and mouse game where nothing is predictable and fairness might even surpass injustice when it seems Wade is willing to cooperate with the poor Evans.<br/><br/>This is a truly great western as we haven't seen it in ages. The quality of performances couldn't been better, not only Bale and Crowe bring some innovations to the classic roles, but this new version has the advantage in two things in terms of character development and performances. Ben Foster playing the mean Charlie Prince was terrific, the guy has a natural quality of making everyone terrified, and he was more like a villain than Crowe/Wade was. The other great role of ""3:10 to Yuma"" is the rebel teenage son of Dan, played by Logan Lerman, who helps the almost trained team in their hard duty. Here's this underrated boy who always wants to make part of things along with his father, always wants to pick a gun and do some justice and he's always pushed back, but when the moment comes he's ready for action. The way Logan played the character, with a constant tension in his eyes, a mix of fear and curiosity in what's going to happen next was amazingly great.<br/><br/>Now, here comes what's bothered most viewers and myself. We've seen the Wild West in films or tales as being something brutal, violent, no country for weak or dumb men and what ""3:10 to Yuma"" presents is something that quite gets there but it differs in quality and presentation of it. There's so many inconsistencies, plot holes, absurd things that one might think this was a place for idiotic moves, ridiculous ideas, and intriguing things that could make someone wonder why such things happen and how did it happened. If you don't notice while watching the movie, just take a look at the boards here and see for yourself the amount of problematic things the screenplay has. It bothers me not knowing how can three armed guys let Ben run away, they didn't shoot him because he had Evans gun and he just shot the Indians who were shooting at them; the way they handcuffed Ben throughout the whole thing, allowing him to kill two members of the team, that was awful; and there's plenty of others. All that didn't ruined the movie for me, a movie is more than just little technicalities that can make it believable or not. But the one that really annoyed me was the ending (completely different from the original, in theory they have one little similarity). Why's that? I won't say what happen but I'll justify why it didn't convinced me: 1) it was totally unexpected, okay, sometimes this is good but here it went way absurd what it followed after one principal death and 2) the reason why the ending of 1957 worked was that the whole way Ben had the chance to know what kind of man Evans was, therefore he didn't caused many troubles along the way and go for the train. Let's say, the bad guy has some ethic. Here, Crowe never gets evident or gives a possible, plausible explanation of why he took the train (the film gets a little lousy after that, but nothing that could ruin it). The script tried to sound poetic in this particular moment saying words without speaking, leaving possible interpretations for us but it wasn't that convincing.<br/><br/>I enjoyed for its tension, its action, the thrills of great sequences (the climactic final shootout with Evans escorting Ben through a whole city against them is outstanding), the good performances of the cast and for showing that the Western genre hasn't died yet. 9/10"
"nightixu","9","1","2","10 July 2011"," One of the best Western flicks!
","This personally is one of my favorite western flicks and one of my favorite movies of all time as well. The movie is basically about Dan Evans played by bale who volunteers to escort the outlaw Ben Wade played by Crowe to the 3.10 train to Yuma. One of the most important factors in a movie to me, are the quality of the stories and the character and it excels in both. Peter Fonda, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts all did very well in their roles adding more depth and quality to the story. What comes to mind when i watched this movie is Crimson Tide, Unforgiven and Point Break. Character-Driven stories with a protagonist and an antagonist with protagonis-tic qualities. It's weird but that's how i see it.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with characters you'll love or hate because of the opportunities for them to show it. The dialogues are excellent. What i especially love is the chemistry between the characters Dan Evans and Ben Wade. They seem like complete opposites but there's something similar about them. Most likely the conviction they have and their belief that the way each lead their live is the right way and the two continually argues about the subject throughout the movie due to Wade repeatedly bribing his way out; Dan Evans as the good and responsible family man and Wade as the street smart asshole who gets what he wants. The portrayal and the relationship between the two main characters, Its not the cliché good vs evil type<br/><br/>The other supporting cast are great as well. Ben foster does a particularly good job playing the main antagonist, not crowe but Foster. He's a bad ass with style. The action scenes are good old western style with gunfights on horses and in towns.<br/><br/>The whole story proceeds with a smooth pace and it always keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Great action must always be preceded by great story and characters and that is why the action scenes are marvellous taking you back to the old western shoot'em ups. I highly recommend this movie. Truly one of the best western flicks with great soundtrack."
"screenman","6","1","2","28 March 2011"," The Train Was Late.
","The train was late and frankly, the way this movie dragged out, I wasn't surprised. Probably the wrong kind of baddies were on the line.<br/><br/>Its original 1950's version never struck me as being a classic by any definition. More a poor man's 'High Noon'. But this remake tries to do better, and for the most part succeeds. Though it does this by robbing a few ideas from other westerns. To begin with, there's a raid upon an armoured stage-coach with a reverse-mounted Gatling-gun. It's an idea straight from 'The War Wagon'.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is Wade, captured leader to a bunch of outlaws. Christian Bale is Evans, the down-at-heel rancher with cash-flow issues who accepts a job too many. Taking pattern from Eastwood's revival, there is a lot more attention to period detail and authentic ambiance - oil-lamp lit interiors, scruffy attire and so on. Which makes for a believable but all too gloomy view. Crowe trades his Roman or nautical trappings for those of a western outlaw and offers-up his stock character delivery. It could just as easily be 'LA Confidential' with horses. Somebody needs to tell him that there's more to acting than just putting on clothes. It would also help if he discovered a voice. Another 2 hours of General Maximus Gruntus gets a bit too much for my ears. Bale, on the other hand, is as Baleful as ever: Believable, but not exactly likable. He needs to laugh once in a while. I grew up with westerns that were almost operatic in their presentation - a concept even Sergio Leone endorsed despite his many modernisations. This 'new realism' needs a very careful hand to make it work as well. Eastwood managed the transition, but this one throws a shoe.<br/><br/>A lot of the movie entails a chase. The small posse escorting Wade overland to catch the train is seldom more than a couple of steps ahead of his gang, now led by a second-in-command about as homicidally-disposed as 'The Terminator'. Along the way, there are various 'issues' and psychological 'conflicts' most of which are scarcely believable. You just don't let a dangerous villain have his hands free, to attack his escorts, snatch guns and shoot them. It would be daft enough once - but 3 times? I mean; c'mon! And if he talks too much (hints of Hannibal Lecter) - you just gag him.<br/><br/>Towards the end, the gang catch up whilst they're waiting for the train, and there's the sort of preposterously over-the-top and frankly unbelievable shoot-out that made 'The Wild Bunch' so memorable. Even here it's taken to excess. The ending is also turned on its head.<br/><br/>I never understood the psychology of a hardened villain facing life imprisonment at the very least - and more likely the gallows - suddenly experiencing a 'Damascus episode' and assisting the man who would take him their. It seemed implausible in the first movie and no less so here.<br/><br/>What the movie does well is commendable. But it's basically a hodge-podge of other ideas shunted together to make an over-long, excessively violent melodrama. It's like a fantasy staged in a museum.<br/><br/>Worth a watch for the good bits, but not exactly collectible. Try 'Last train From Gun Hill'; it's a similar theme but in the grand 1950's operatic style."

","3:10 to Yuma is one of those movies that are trying to make the western genre popular again in Hollywood. I think they got popular again with the recent success of the Coen's True Grit. I am not a big fan of westerns but I did enjoy Dance with the Wolves greatly.<br/><br/>This movie is a remake of the western that came out fifty years prior. it's about a poor rancher who wants to bring a murderous outlaw to justice by transporting him to a train that will take him to prison. But he will face many dangerous factors along the way.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect. Russell Crowe is a great actor and he continues his line of excellent work. The same goes along for Christian Bale. I haven't seen a movie of his that I hated.<br/><br/>The music by Beltrami is great. I see why it was nominated for an Academy Award. Even though this is a western and reminds me of the older westerns, there is enough sense of modernism here to make it seem new. I rate this film 10/10."

"kenjha","7","1","2","9 April 2010"," Routine Remake
","In this remake of the 1957 Western, a rancher escorts an outlaw to a train so he can collect a bounty. Bale is pretty good as the rancher determined to complete his mission. Crowe is OK if underwhelming as the outlaw, never quite believable as a man of the West. Fonda is fine as a crusty old bounty hunter. The original was well made but was marred by an unsatisfying ending. The good news is that this remake changes the ending. The bad news is that it is even more unsatisfying. In fact the ending is nonsensical. The plot has also been expanded from the original, losing some of the tension in the process. If nothing else, the filmmakers should be applauded for keeping the genre alive."
"maverick-vishal","9","1","2","28 February 2010"," Characterization at its best....!!!!
","Any movie which has great effort put upon making the characters damn great always excite me. 3:10 to Yuma has each and every character so well etched that you'll enjoy and stay connected till the very end. Russell Crowe as 'Ben Wade' gives a terrific performance. His wit rides over the senses of the person confronting him. As for Christian Bale(Dan Evans), playing the limped, honest and 'hard to defy person' was not a tough job. He does all of it brilliantly. There's not a single scene in the movie when anyone of the two proves to be better than the other in terms of acting. <br/><br/>The story revolves around Ben Wade who needs to be sent to yuma prison. The train is at 3:10 and the rancher Dan Evans agrees to escort him to the train. In the journey the battle of thoughts and ideologies is persistent and also there are external elements which need to be fought off. This movie sets a perfect example of how thoughts, words and deeds can provoke the good or even the bad amongst any human being. As rightly said ""Every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord ponders the heart.""<br/><br/>Cinematography is excellent. The sound and Background score is also great with superb pieces composed by 'Marco Beltrami'. The director James Mangold does a good job with the flow of the story and characters at a steady pace with a bit of sequence at the end wherein viewers may share mixed reactions.<br/><br/>Coming back to characters, Crowe and Bale have given excellent performances in their respective roles. The fierce intensity of Wade and the lowly intense but highly focused nature of Evans are thoroughly reflected...!!!! Catch this 'train to Yuma' to enjoy watching these two great actors together....!!!!"

"pfgpowell-1","8","1","2","29 September 2009"," The Western rehabilitated
","Once the staple of Fifties cinema-going, Westerns have gone out of fashion. The Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns started a trend towards stripping them West of glamour, and filmmakers in the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate oil-price inflation disillusioned Seventies soon picked got in on the act. Mud and misery, disease and everyone more or less in rags became the norm. Cowboy heroes were no longer incorruptible men in white hats, but just as savage as their nominally bad adversaries. Life in the new order Western was hard and brutal, and the only concession Tinseltown allowed was that the heroine was still desirable, unlike the women photographs of the era show us. Film heroines, after all, are film heroines and we can't have them being though ugly. By the Eighties anyone trying to raise money to make a Western was given short shrift by the financiers. There were, of course, the few brave exceptions, such as Unforgiven, the TV series Lonesome Dove and, more recently, the excellent The Assassination Of Jesse James etc., but they, too, embraced the new orthodoxy of a depicting a brutal, bloody, muddy and miserable West, and The Assassination etc, was perhaps not even a Western in the accepted sense. Neither, for that matter, was Altman's McCabe And Mrs Miller. So remaking 3.10 To Yuma was a brace decision and director James Mangold has come up trumps. But before I lay on the praise, I must vent my one gripe: the transformation of utterly ruthless killer Ben Wade (an excellent Russell Crowe) into a man who does, after all, have a streak of humanity doesn't convince. Well, it doesn't convince me. I watched this on DVD and re-watched it listening to Mangold's commentary in which he says he tried to get away from the idea of 'the villain' and wanted to portray Wade as a more rounded character. Well, it is true that he does, yet I cannot buy Wade's almost altruistic transformation. And as that, after all, is one of the film's main themes, it is quite a large faultline. Wade is utterly, utterly ruthless, a man for whom life means nothing. He kills without compunction and shows no remorse of any kind. The only kind of character who might behave as director Mangold wants us to believe Wade behaves would be a sociopath, and that was exactly the kind of character (according to the commentary) Mangold did not want to create. We are given a kind of explanation for Wade's complete lack of scruples - after his father died, he was abandoned by his mother as an eight-year-old, but that, in itself, is rather too pat, if not to say rather too glib, and explanation. We are also shown that he has an artistic streak - he likes sketching - and it is obvious that he is intelligent and self-aware. He even has a dry wit. But surely to goodness none of this even goes a little way to explaining is about turn when he assists Dan Evans (an also very good Christian Bale) against his own gang to deliver him to the train which will convey him to the gallows. Well, not for this viewers it didn't. There is one coda which might provide and explanation: as the train with Wade on board trundles on its way to Yuma, Wade whistles and his horse (I should imagine, although if it is his horse, it has changed colour) runs off to accompany the train. Wade has previously claimed that he has escaped from Yuma twice before and that often judges, guards and lawmen have helped him escape simply because they like him. The implication is that he will manage to do so again. And it is true that there is something - almost inexplicably - likable about this ruthless killer. That interpretation would, at least, be in keeping and, aesthetically, would stay in harmony with the rest of the film. As I say, Wade's apparent redemption - he even guns down the remainder of his gang - his my main gripe, although an important one. Two minor gripes are that in the final dash to the station, he loses his handcuffs. The keys were thrown away by Dan Evans earlier on. Perhaps they were taken off when he first entered the cell in the train, because that is when you first see him without them. They must have been taken off pretty damn fast and there would have been no reason to do so, anyway. Wade is, after all, a ruthless killer. So why take any chances? Then there is the surprisingly fast recuperation of Peter Fonda from being shot in the stomach. Uncredible just isn't the word. But having got those those points off my chest, I am bound to admit that, otherwise, Yuma scores on every level and then some. The plot is less than straightforward, we have an admirable hero in Christian Bale, whose determination and motivation to live up to his promise to deliver Wade to Yuma against all odds rings very true, we have a great coming of age performance by Logan Lerman as his son, there is plenty of ambivalence to satisfy even the most ardent modernist, the action sequences, though undoubtedly the result of clever editing, have none of the artificiality of too many other action movies - cut, cut, cut, and you haven't a clue what's going on - and it is only fair to say the Mangold comes up trumps. One last point is worth mentioning: neither Bale nor Crowe is American, and I do wonder whether that might have contributed to them bringing something fresh to their parts. Also convincingly and irredeemably nasty is Ben Foster as Wade's No 2 Charlie Prince. Finally, Peter Fonda turns up: I though his career hit the buffers years ago, but here he does a great job as, in his own way, an equally nasty Pinkerton's Agency mercenary. But boy does he look old, which means, unfortunately that so, probably, do I."

Superbly acted, directed well, and its story was engaging, with nice subplots. Its not extraordinarily original, but doesn't need to be, for what it is, one of the best films of its kind. I liked it more than Tombstone or Unforgiven, which were two of my favorite of the newer western films i had seen. I thought Russell crowe shined as the antagonist, while Christian Bale did a pretty good job as well. Its shot and edited very well and has a very suitable score from Marco Beltrami. Its not a film i would watch over and over, but i enjoyed it a lot the first time around. Ben Foster Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol were great in supporting roles while Logan Lerman wasn't bad as Bale's character's son either, decent job for a young actor. I think for what it is, this film is good, real good, don't expect the most realistic action sequences, though, as that is not exactly the case with the shootouts, but then again, its still a bit more realistic than most films of its kind, thus i rate it highly.

It's one of those rare remakes that turns out to be a terrific western with plenty of action, character development, and spot on performances by the whole cast. Russell Crowe makes for an effective villain. His character Ben Wade is a man whose seen a lot of bad things in his life and those experiences are what made him the man he is an outlaw who's willing to kill to get what he wants. Crowe continues to establish himself in 3:10 To Yuma as one of Hollywoods most talented actors. Christian Bale is equally impressive as the hero Dan Evans a rancher who was injured in the Civil War. Bale's Evans is a man desperately looking for a way to support his family and sees his way of doing just that by joining some lawman to help escort Ben to the 3:!0 To Yuma in the city of Contention with Wade's gang hot on their trail. With films like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and Terminator Salvation, Christian Bale continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today. Well done. Ben Foster plays Charles one of the criminals in Ben's gang another man whose probably seen his share of terrible things as well. Foster does a solid job of the role he does have in the movie. Peter Fonda does the best he can with the small role he does have in the film as Bryon McElroy a mysterious lawman with a violent past and the rest of the cast are good in their roles. There were however a few flaws like the pacing at times was slow and the ending which wasn't that bad but it could've been a little better. Overall 3:10 To Yuma has a good story, interesting characters, great performances from the cast, and plenty of action thats even spaced throughout the whole film that makes it an enjoyable western to watch."

","Well it seems like every once in awhile a great western seems to come along , well i guess the time is A Fistfull of Dollars by now means, but you have to consider that today Hollywood has all but abandoned the Western and folks that is pretty darn sad to see that happen,, this is the best western since The Jack Bull 1999 and The Unforgiven 1992. Russel Crowe is great in this one as the killer without conscious Ben Wade,, Christian Bale is a rancher who hires on to help the local law bring Ben to justice, the story is all about there travels and adventures on the way to the 3:10 to Yuma, you gotta love that once scene where they got that gatling gun in the stagecoach,, now that was fun to watch,, and all of the gunplay action in here was pretty darn good,, all in all it was a very good western, not epic,, but pretty darn good."

","The western now days is a pretty dead genre. Only a couple of times every now and then a wonderful genre movie gets suddenly released again, of which ""3:10 to Yuma"" is the most recent example.<br/><br/>The movie isn't really a classic western, in terms of that it uses all of the clichés and techniques you would expect from the genre. It above all is a modern movie, that also takes an original approach to the genre. It of course features lots of tough looking and talking man but in the end the movie is all about trying to be a better man, no matter how black your heart seems.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a movie that is being driven by its story and characters but it's also a movie that has plenty of action in it. It still makes this an action movie but one with some more heart and soul to it. You can of course expect a little bit more from a movie starring both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale opposite each other.<br/><br/>The movie is of course being almost completely carried by its two principal actors but luckily the movie doesn't forget that it also has other great actors playing some nice roles in this movie, such as Peter Fonda and Ben Foster. The movie gives its actors plenty of opportunity to shine throughout.<br/><br/>It's perhaps a bit of a long movie and it perhaps isn't always interesting enough but it builds up nicely to its ending, that is more than another big action sequences or shoot out but also shows how the characters have changed and most importantly grown throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>It's a visually impressive looking movie, with nice scenery and settings. The movie has a visual and technical modern approach to it but it still feels like an old fashioned genre movie, mostly due to its pace and settings. You don't have to be into westerns to like this movie and you don't have to be afraid when you are into westerns that this movie might not be faithful enough to its genre.<br/><br/>A movie well worth seeing.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Wow. I am coming to the shocking reality that most of the voters on this site must be children. To give this picture 8 stars on average? Are you kidding me? Is common virtue and morality to get completely stolen from the original 1957 version, and a reward to follow? Yeah, the entire good vs bad format for construction of reality is missing from this one too. Not that the film-makers have'nt got certain skills in special effects and technical editing. But, come on!! Bad gets rewarded. Plus the film is so full of plot holes as to defy common celluloid. Believe me, if you want to go to a virtual reality video theater, this film is for you. The action sequences are ridiculous. It could not have happened in a zillion years like this. The typical 10,000 near misses and just barely(s). This kind of video game reality is too absurd to accept as a workable paradigm for constructive entertainment. Nor, for me at least, is it to be construed as anything other than basic junk."
"anonymousmoose-1","3","1","2","23 February 2009"," What kind of a silly story was this
","OK, I'm a huge western fan. Yet modern westerns have always been disappointing to me. Gone are the days of Clint Eastwood and this movie proved that the good times have left on the 3:10 train... maybe going to Yuma? First the story... It starts off good but then Ben Wade LETS himself get caught. OK, not that bad. Then they do a switch where the 'good guys' make the 'bad guys' think Ben is in a coach by putting one of their own in. The funny thing is they LOCK their own guy in. Which means he gets burnt to death later on cause he cant get out. I cracked up laughing it was so funny.<br/><br/>OK, then Ben kills one of the guys with a fork. They don't shoot him. He throws the old bounty hunter off a cliff, they still don't shoot him. Then he escapes. So they shoot the guys who capture him. OK, so they are hell bent on getting him on that train and upholding the law. But its just getting to the point of ridiculousness.<br/><br/>OK, then there is the end scenes. Even though there are gangsters in town, who just shot the sheriff and his deputies the townspeople in the background still go about their daily business. I found it funny watching one guy do the shopping in the background whilst they were shooting people. By now, the sheriff is dead and they still don't kill Ben. Its crazy.<br/><br/>OK at the end the main star runs out and tries to get Ben to the train. Ben Wade ends up helping him SHOOT his own men. But I guess that OK as they keep multiplying. When they ride into town they count 7 men. But they end up shooting about 12 of them.<br/><br/>Then at the end Ben Wade ends up shooting the only guys who actually cares about rescuing Ben Wade. This movie was so ridiculous it ended up becoming a comedy for me.<br/><br/>The only thing missing was a 70 year old Clint Eastward coming out with his poncho and shooting Ben Wade and then making a cheesy catch phrase. But that would only make the movie better IMO.<br/><br/>To give it some credit (4 out of 10) I'll say the cast was good and the acting great.<br/><br/>Its worth watching but don't take it seriously."

","I've seen this movie while ago and since this time i cant think about any other western movie that can top it. A great performance by Russell Crowe,Christian Bale and Ben Foster.. Well my best part of the movie and i call it the secret deal when Ben Wade and Dan Evans were running at the end of the trip to the train then Dan said that he ain't stubborn about keeping his family on a dying ranch and Ben saying that he have been to Yuma Prison before and Escaped twice too then we can notice the deal that was done as Dab can get the cash and be the real hero in front of his son eyes and the town also Ben can escape from Yuma Prison as he did it twice before! The movie takes as slowly through the growing relation between Ben and Dan by the time they are together to the train and which made Ben kill his guys after they shot Dan, And as a great sacrifice he got on the train after Dan's death to make the history of Yuma remember Dan and as a hint he whistle to his horse making it clear that he has the chance to escape after. Also the Great music by Marco Beltrami gave the movie the real Western Taste also the Sound Effects were great that gets u in the scenes.. I think this is a great movie with a great Performance especially by Russell Crow who acted many scenes by his eyes... If you are not a western movies fan i recommend this movie for you to watch if u care about the art and the story and the end.."

","Good novels, movies are not about logic, plot holes and storyline but emotions, motivations and connections.<br/><br/>Same here. This could be a remake into a non Western movie but the impact would not be the same - not the same connection. The emotions and motivations would be there but not the connection. The connection of father to child, dignity to integrity, responsibility to honor, in a somewhat more simple time - when traveling wasn't easy; legend grows out of rumors, communities are small, but courage - like it has always been - hard to define.<br/><br/>And we as the audience won't feel the same if this story wasn't set in a Western environment - the best of which are about hardship, dignity, and psyche of the New harsh World.<br/><br/>the Scot, Christine Bale is amazing as always - understated and sure, disappearing into the role. Crowe is more himself I thought."

","This movie has a thrilling adventure which keeps me more interested in the characters and gives me a little taste of what actually went down in the old west. Ben Wade and Dan Evans are smart and intelligent characters who add strength, excitement, and suspense to the movie along with superb acting. The Supporting cast did a great job as well and in particular, Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, and Logan Lerman. Although I do have to say that I was surprised to see Luke Wilson in this movie but I guess he can fit in the western style and he pulls it off pretty good.

","I must admit I have always loved westerns. So, when I heard that Christian Bale and Russell Crowe were going head to head, I was very exited. I saw the original years back and liked the film. This movie is considerably better. The acting is solid all around. I love seeing Peter Fonda. I wish he was a little more active. His career never got the bounce it deserved after his ""comeback"" film, Ulle's Gold. The two leads are predictably excellent. My main problem with this film is with Crowe's character. His transformation from beginning to end seems forced. There is nothing in the movie which seems to pull him towards his actions at the end of the movie. The bond between him and Bale does not seem authentic. The best Westerns are usually clear cut stories about good and bad. This movie is more about redemption. The rest of the movie is good enough that it's flaws are forgivable. I would recommend this movie to fans of Action movies as opposed to Westerns. It just doesn't feel like a Western."
"tlannin","8","1","2","28 February 2008"," Fine remake of the 1957 original
","This is a very fine remake of the 1957 Van Heflin, Glen Ford version. Director Mangold sustains tension between his characters throughout his film. The acting and editing are top-notch and help this film transcend other works from this genre. Crowe's portrayal of Ben Wade is ruthless, artistic, humorous, and tragic all at once. Bales' Dan Evans is less rich in texture, but he clearly conveys the emotions of someone struggling with definitions of heroism and honor. When all other lawmakers demonstrate cowardice, only Evans and his son, a potential outlaw like Wade, do what's right. Bales' Evans is stoic and relentless, yet his existential doubt about the task at hand is abundantly evident. What motivates him is having to transcend his guilt over how he lost his leg. Next to Wade, Ben Foster's Charlie Prince character is the most interesting. Prince is sinister and darkly comical at the same time. We understand why he feels no remorse gunning down Pinkertons and cheer him when he shoots sadistic railroad bosses, yet we loathe him when his gang and he kill defenseless lawmakers. For these reasons, his brand of violence is easier to swallow than that of sociopathic Richard Widmark, the grinning killer in ""Kiss of Death."" Peter Fonda, Logan Lerman, and Dallas Roberts also perform admirably and leave us with memorable images of their characters' actions. ""Yuma"" is aligned in tone with ""The Unforgiven"" and similar revisionist Westerns, and it carries an underlying social justice motif with contemporary parallels. When Evans finally reveals how he lost his leg, we understand his stubborn drive to deliver Crowe to justice. It's fair to compare his fate to those or our neglected, mentally and physically wounded soldiers from the Iraq War. That's the subtle, universal power of the film."

","Ben Wade and Dan Evans; two men on opposite sides of the law. Evans is a Civil War veteran-turned-impoverished rancher, husband, and father of two driven by an uncompromising moral conviction that he hopes will allow God to grant him a break; Wade is a nefarious, elusive, immoral outlaw whose reputation makes him a lucrative target for lawmen. Their interaction is the basis for this test of wills tale set in the Old West, as the rancher goes on a courageous mission to turn the outlaw in despite the insurmountable odds that face him, including the outlaw's bloodthirsty henchmen hot on his trail. Long, with direction that's a bit too leisure, but made worthwhile by strong acting and good storytelling. Aussie Crowe and Welshman Bale are an uncommon casting choice for a film of this genre, but they're both effective in creating believable characters. ***"

Brad Pitt, maybe, but more for Hollywood political reasons because he was excellent. I don't know if this guy has been secretly getting some acting lessons but he's definitely improved in the last 10 years. Instead of thinking ""Oh look.

Cristian Bale continued his recent success with another powerful and Oscar-worthy acting, Russell Crowe made it clear that he has his own reasons with a fabulous performance as Ben Wade...<br/><br/>I think this movie would be one of the years best even with only those two stars in the whole movie, but others really didn't damage the view. Diferently, i would gladly give out Oscar trophy for best supporting actor - Ben Foster in role of Charlie Prince.

I guess you've got to expect a certain amount of unbelievability in a Western, such as people running through a town with dozens of people firing on them and they don't get shot. What really bothered me was the almost surreal stupidity of the guys transporting a dangerous prisoner. His only restraint was having his hands loosely cuffed in front of him. The first night he kills one of his guards. So you'd think maybe they'd add a few ropes and chains to limit his movement. Nope, they just carry on like nothing happened. Next day he kills another one. Same reaction. Later he escapes and steals all their horses. I was shaking my head in disbelief.<br/><br/>If a bad guy offered me $200 to kill a good guy I'd be thinking ""hmm, well he's probably got a lot more than $200 in his pocket, so maybe I'll just kill this guy and take his money"".<br/><br/>The last movie I watched because of the over 8.0 rating on IMDb was King Kong, but don't worry, this movie doesn't suck nearly as badly as King Kong."

What more could a West dreaming city-boy ask for? This remake of an old classic has brought new life into a genre that's been ""playing possum"" since Unforgiven in 1992. James Mangold, director of Walk the Line, demonstrates an understanding of the depths and capabilities of a cowboy tale, and exploits the story for all it's worth. Through genius cinematography he infuses a supernatural symbolism into the piece, while maintaining the basic human pull of a heroic tragedy and a family drama. Christian Bale has lost enough of his pretty boy appeal to be believable as a beaten down rancher, and Russell Crow delivers a complex villain to rival John Wayne's ""Ethan Edwards.""

I thought Christian Bale was playing the hero but the true hero of this movie was his son played by Logan Lerman. A truly great movie must have a great bad guy, this movie had two of them, one played by Crowe and one played to perfection by Ben Foster(Charlie Prince), you just knew that if he got his way people were gonna die.

One of the first introductions we have to Crowe's character is when his sidekick, Charlie - appears and has a very annoying voice and facial expression. Plus, he shoots everybody he can get his hands on. Charlie, in ONE SCENE, shoots Peter Fonda in the belly at POINT BLANK RANGE for NO REASON. Couldn't he have just shot him in the head or heart? So, Fonda's character bleeds for about 10 hours and can't move. Finally, he's lugged back to town and some doctor sticks a tool into his belly and pulls out a BULLET!

Great cast--Russell Crowe (in his second Western) is marvelous as the villain; Christian Bale is fantastic: if his career ever starts to tank, I'll call down curses from heaven; the other supporting actors who's names I can't remember except for Luke Wilson and I think Peter Fonda, all were top notch.<br/><br/>Second, the action was fantastic. There was a lot of space between action sequences and Bale only is involved in one firefight, but everything was well done, exciting, ACCURATE (as in nobody shot forty bullets from the same gun without reloading), and none of it was mindless gunfighting for the sake of gunfighting (true, that kind of thing can be quite entertaining in a Western, but if there's a purpose for it then it's so much better).<br/><br/>Also, the storyline was exceptionally deep for a Western. There is great character interaction and development driving the story along, something you don't get in your typical Western. Impressive.<br/><br/>Trust me, YOU WANT to see this movie. The only reason why I don't give it a ten is something that I don't want to spoil for you. See this movie!"
"adrongardner","8","1","2","7 October 2007"," Welcome Home
","I'm a tough customer when it comes to westerns. I grew up watching the likes of westerns as diverse as Tall in the Saddle, The Searchers, The Sheepman, Shane, and of course my all- time favorite, Rio Bravo. I like the old style westerns. Unforgiven never truly sold me. The other Eastwood spaghetti jobs were good for what they were, but still not what I would call good westerns. Dances with Wolves was a yawner. The Aussie set movies of Snowy River and Quigly Down Under were refreshing. Tombstone and the Young Guns, though cheesy as hell, get a pass for effort. More recently, I did enjoy Open Range.<br/><br/>So here is the remake. Thanks to the wonderfully drawn characters, both in the script and on the screen, 3:10 to Yuma scores high in my book. The landscape is there and so is the tone. The characters seem to really exist in the frame of their world and not in ""a western."" Some of the Eastwood movies are chock full of people who just seem to know they are caricatures of a western. Russel Crowe and Christian Bale are completely believable, sympathetic and fascinating in their polar opposite roles. I loved to see both of them on the screen. Their faces, body language and voices really feel right here. The only weakness i can point out when pressed, is probably Ben Foster's Charlie Prince. Foster just doesn't seem right here. Both in the movie and among his co-stars, he seems a bit out-gunned, so to speak.<br/><br/>Overall, this remake does a good job. It is in fact, a better movie than the Glen Ford original. <br/><br/>One wonderful thing about this film that has nothing to do with the film-making is the landscape. When I saw this film, I was doing an internship in Orange County, California and languishing in the daily traffic of Los Angeles and Orange County. Being a New Mexico native, it was really wonderful to see Santa Fe on the screen. The filmmakers did justice to the wonderful terrain of my home state."
"TheGOLDENWALRUS","8","1","2","6 October 2007"," Nice to see a great western
","This movie wasn't perfect but it was very good. I mean, you got Christian Bale and Russel Crowe in the same movie. That's enough to put shivers down my back (ok, that might be just me).<br/><br/>Dan Evans (Bale) needs money. He is so desperate that he'll even help escort the very dangerous Ben Wade (Crowe) to a train so Wade can receive his punishment. But is this really about the money to Evans or is this really about pride and respect? The pacing of the movie may be slow at first bit it has some great action scenes that will keep you on the edge of the seat. I loved Crowe's character as he was so ruthless but yet we all routed for him. Bale delivered another solid performance as he was the very likable good guy, Ben Foster played the sidekick of Crowe and felt he might of overacted at some parts but that seems to be the only roles that Foster plays these days (11:14, Alpha Dog, Hostage, etc.) <br/><br/>This year has been very disappointing compared to last year especially for dramas but 3:10 and The Lookout are the two best I've seen."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","5 October 2007"," A successful modern Western (spoilers throughout)
","3:10 to Yuma has one major flaw: at the end Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) doesn't half seem keen to help Dan Evans (Christian Bale) out. Through the town they run, dodging bullets, and then they even take to the roofs and leap between buildings. Really, would a hardened criminal who wanted to avoid jail be so compliant, especially when his gang is there, trying to shoot down his captor? Plus, why does Ben run at all? He could quite easily just stand there and refuse to move  not for one second did I believe that Dan would gun him down in cold blood.<br/><br/>Of course, Ben's motivation is explained somewhat. He develops a grudging respect for the herder and in a scene near the end when he briefly displays some obstinacy, he stops himself from killing Dan when Dan tells him the true story of how he lost his leg. So basically Ben goes along with this man so that Dan can be a hero to his son. Very noble, but not entirely believable. Although having said that, the end, where Ben whistles to his horse as the train leaves the station, suggests that Ben never had any real intention of going to jail, that he was always going to escape. So maybe his playing along with Dan isn't quite as ridiculous as it initially feels.<br/><br/>That aside, though, I thought the film was marvellous. And although the ending still nags me somewhat, I did love the final few moments. The gunning down of Dan took me completely by surprise and I almost cheered when Ben smoked his gang. And bloody hell is Ben quick on the draw  I loved how quickly and casually he gunned them down. Plus I loved the way that sound of the train standing in the station became the soundtrack for the sequence  it added a whole layer of tension that would have been missing had it been scored.<br/><br/>However, it can't have been just me that noticed a homoerotic undercurrent in the relationship between Ben and his main underling Charlie. Charlie seems to go to almost superhuman lengths to free his boss. Plus there's the way that he seems almost disappointed that Ben wants to score some poontang. There they are, hanging out in a saloon, and Ben wants to nail the broad behind the bar rather than the skinny geezer sitting next to him. But Charlie doesn't take it to heart. He tells his boss that he'll be near, and then once Ben gets arrested he's free to express his longing in more physical ways.<br/><br/>The best example is when Charlie beats one of his gang members. The man's crime? Bad-mouthing Ben. Really, Charlie may as well be some sassy broad on Maury Povich, screaming, 'Don't talk no smack about my man.' But this doesn't detract from the film at all. Indeed, Charlie is a pretty fine underling. He doesn't take any crap, he's ruthless (I loved the way he burnt a man to death) and he's completely immoral (dig the way he shot the pussy lawmen who try and cut and run). Plus you know a villain has done their job when you almost cheer their demise. 'Take that', I thought, as Ben finally penetrated him (albeit with hot lead rather than the sweet, sweet love pistol he was gagging for).<br/><br/>But can you really blame Charlie for developing a man-crush on his boss? Certainly the scene where Neanderthal poet Russ he picks up the barmaid is very sexy, and you can't help but feel that both Dan's wife and son would happily betray ol' peg leg for this hunk of a man if he made a bona fide move on them. Indeed, Crowe's performance is one of the best he's turned in for quite a while. He's got the edge that the character demands and he also seems to be enjoying himself immensely  his performance is infectious.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Bale pales somewhat in comparison. He's certainly just as good a performer, but he never stands a chance with his character, a man who is entirely decent but also just a tad dull. There's not really a whole lot of complexity to him. He's just a good man who has to go to lengths to secure his family's financial wellbeing.<br/><br/>Therefore it's Crowe who gets all the great moments. One of my favourite bits was when he threw Peter Fonda over the edge of a cliff for bad-mouthing his mother. Take that you old bastard! And then as already mentioned, there's the scene with the barmaid. But I also liked the way he killed the guy who spent all his time taunting him  he stabs him with a steak fork in the middle of the night. Nice.<br/><br/>But the film's actually pretty brutal. As well as the stabbing you have a gruesome surgery scene, more shootings than you can shake a stick at and a prolonged torture scene where poor Russ gets electrocuted. The film doesn't pull its punches.<br/><br/>And there are a couple of fantastic action sequences. There's the bit with the Gatling gun on the back of the coach (which is kind of a nod to The Wild Bunch) and there's also the chase along the railroad. Sure both are fanciful, especially the moment where Dan shoots the stick of dynamite that Ben throws in the air, but it's done with enough verve to make one forget such silliness.<br/><br/>But as to whether the film deserves to be an Oscar contender, I'm not so sure. It's a simple film well done, but that shouldn't be enough for awards. It's certainly no Unforgiven. But still, it's a successful stab at a modern Western."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","30 September 2007"," It won't rejuvenate the genre but fans will love it!!
","It wasn't until the last three years that I became an enormous Western fan so it was with great excitement that I drooled to see '310 To Yuma' the newest Western to hit the big screens in a long time. Although some reviewers hailed it as the rebirth of the Hollywood Western I won't go that far but for us Western starved fans it fulfilled my quota and there aren't many out there any more. The characters and actors that played them did a magnificent job and director James Mangold knows how to bring a story to life and really get the most out of his characters so that you become completely attached to them as he did with the outstanding Walk The Line as well as other of his films. He has only 7 film credits to his name and almost every one can be heralded as terrific stories. You can just tell he puts his heart and soul into it. Nonetheless he certainly makes sure that everything is in place that you would want from a Western. The villainy and the shootouts, and the small western town, the cattle farmer, the gangs, the sand and tumbleweeds, coach robberies, horses, camping under the stars and the railway. There isn't anything missing and you feel like you're immersed into this world and that is the key to a great Western.<br/><br/>I do like Christian Bale. Please don't anyone think I don't. He has done some terrific work but I'm beginning to feel he might be slightly over rated. I thought his performance in Rescue Dawn (see my review) was ridiculous and over performed and I think I've come to realize he might just be someone who really over acts his roles. In 310 To Yuma he plays down on his luck family man and cattle farmer Dan Evans. He does a decent job but he just seems so hyped up and on edge that it's almost hard to watch him. I mean I understand he is playing a desperate man but still the performance was overdone I thought. Russell Crowe literally steals the show as absolutely notorious villain and killer Ben Wade. Crowe's Wade should probably be considered for Oscar Nominations because his suave, polite, and yet diabolically disturbing performance just draws you in and makes everything worth while. This is truly his best role in a long time!! I would love to see Ben Wade come back in a sequel with Crowe returning to the role. He is brilliant and him and Bale have good chemistry but I think it's more from Crowe's performance than Bale's. Terrific young character actor Ben Foster is Ben Wade's right hand man Charlie Prince. His character could have easily carried the film as the villain and he is just as terrifying in a far less subtle way than Crowe's character. Foster is terrific and I was convinced he would turn on Wade rather than stay loyal to the very end which is part of the irony of the film I think. The infamous in his own right Peter Fonda plays a small yet very important and distinguished role as a bounty hunter of sorts and Wade's long time nemesis. I would have absolutely loved to have seen Fonda and Crowe go head to head more than they did. You could sense the tension and it was terrific. Not to leave the rest of the cast out because they all did their fair share including strong performances from Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman (was really terrific in his role as Bale's son), and Luce Rains. They all basically supported Bale and Crowe in their respective performances and they were all terrific.<br/><br/>It really boils down to this. If you're a fan of Westerns than 310 To Yuma is really going to impress you because it has everything you could possibly ask for. And if you're not a fan of Westerns you won't like it because it's Western through and through. The story is terrific, the characters are great and it is a film that will likely stick around because I think it's got classic written on it. I have never seen the original 310 To Yuma although I'd like to and I don't know if it was good or not but this remake certainly brings it to a new generation because remake or on it's own it definitely gets it's point across for it's genre. Not life changing but a damn good western. 8.5/10"
"zetes","7","1","2","30 September 2007"," The original is in general better
","I guess you can't complain too much that they remade 3:10 to Yuma. After all, the original is a pretty shameless rip-off of High Noon. As much as a rip-off as it is, though, I thought it was better than High Noon. And, while Delmer Daves' original is fantastic, it's not like it's perfect or anything. It can be improved upon, I suppose. Unfortunately, James Mangold's remake doesn't improve upon it, except for maybe one bit, which I'll get to in a minute. The remake adds over 20 minutes, but it doesn't bother to flesh out the characters. In fact, the roles are flatter here than they were in the original. The extra plot points are unnecessary. They should especially have excised an entire sequence in which Luke Wilson makes a cameo. Not only does that sequence have the distracting, ""Hey, look! That's Luke Wilson"" factor, it just doesn't add anything. It has been a while since I've seen the original, but, as I recall, it was pretty close to a real-time thriller, with Dan Evans guarding Ben Wade until the 3:10 arrives for most of the film. This is only a short portion of the new one. It is the best portion, though. It doesn't solve the problems of the original, although I don't personally consider the characters' actions too problematic in either version, as many people do. The reason that the remake might be worth seeing is the ending. It's quite a bit different than the original (unless I'm misremembering), and it brings the story to a higher level than the original achieved. As for the acting, it's mostly passable. But again it pales in comparison to the original. Both Van Heflin and Glenn Ford have some great movies and performances to their names, but I think 3:10 to Yuma was the peak of both their careers. I'm not a huge fan of either Christian Bale or Russell Crowe, but they've both done better. Crowe is great in that final sequence, however. As for the other actors, most are not worth remembering. I did really like the kid who played Dan Evans' son, Logan Lerman. Watch for him in the future. And Ben Foster can add his name to the list of the classic superbad henchman characters in Westerns. He was wonderfully evil. I probably sounded like I didn't like the film much. That's not true. It's just that it's not as good as its predecessor, which, to me, means it doesn't have much reason to exist."

","The year; 1868, the place; Bisbee, Arizona, the time; three years into the reconstruction era post Civil War: where life, living, and love is as savage as a mindless bullet coming out of the end of the barrel of a gun, pointed at you! Every man, woman, and child wears a scar, either visible or in their hearts from the ravages of the War between the States. Ben Wade (Russell Crow) is the man in black, the leader of a ruthless band of cutthroats but an existentialist just the same. As incongruous as this may seem Mr. Wade is a lover as well. Enter Dan Evans (Christian Bale) a down on his luck, poor dirt farmer, and with a wooden leg to boot, compliments of a Union Army Surgon after a battle with a Confederate Army Regiment. Evans and his family are literally standing on their last leg, no pun intended, when after Wade is captured and a reward is offered to transport the bandit to catch the 3:10 train to Yuma Prison. Evans volunteers for the job to save his farm and his family. Wade the 'lover' has this profound effect on most everyone he meets. Either it is hero worship or out and out physical desire, the pheromones of Wade's chemical makeup has the same effect whether you be male or female. Then the existentialist, Wade comes out to play. If Wade cannot have the individual to play with, no one can. I nominate for The Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor of 2007, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) who portrays Ben Wade's sadistic knife-edged sexually undefined Second Lieutenant. Prince brandishes a matched pair of 45. caliber Scofield break-action revolvers as Wade's side-kick and fellow roust-about. Directed by James Mangold and shot on location in New Mexico, the cinematography may well have paid homage to both John Ford and Robert Altman who directed McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Both of these 'giants' created and gave direction to actors, writers, directors, and others of the film industry whose debt was never expected to be repaid. Strange, how a 15 page, short, story, by an unknown copy boy by the name of Elmore Leonard, could influence Hollywood twice, over a span of 60 years and produce two separate and different examples of the western genre. The American Western, often copied, imitated, and mimicked, but never duplicated. The 3:10 to Yuma, best not to miss that train."
"BJBatimdb","8","1","2","28 September 2007"," A good, honest western
","This is not a film that exceeds its Western genre, but it sits so nice and firmly in the saddle of that genre that I give it a solid 8.<br/><br/>The script is really pared down and careful. It's written like a 1950s/60s Western - with honesty and a nice lack of fussiness. Russell Crowe's outlaw is the more seductive of the two leads but Christain Bale's scrawny, uncertain wannabe hero is the more interesting.<br/><br/>The film almost careens over a cliff of Shane-style cliché surrounding Bale's rebellious son, but does just manage to avoid that fall with good casting of the boy and the downbeat ending, which is nonetheless satisfying.<br/><br/>It's a pleasure to watch a Western that doesn't cave in to postmodern winks at itself, inappropriate humour or over-staged violence. Instead, 3.10 to Yuma rides quietly and unpretentiously into town, does its job with honour, and disappears into a well-deserved sunset."

Why, if Wade had had a sudden change of heart and wanted to see his certainly doomed captor succeed in getting him to the train, knowing that his ruthless gang was still surrounding them, would he leave Dan to die in a hail of bullets just outside the train? Wouldn't he be smart enough to know that it would happen? Shouldn't he have dragged Dan onto the train WITH him, to drop him off safely somewhere down the line? The implausibility of it just ruined it for me, but I still appreciate what WAS great about the movie."
"brad-kruse","7","1","2","24 September 2007"," Disturbing, gritty western, with predators circling the new railroad line.
","We have petty land barons burning out their neighbors to horde land for sale to the new railroad. We have robbers (Crowe) robbing the railroad payroll coach. There are realistic hails of bullets where few people get hit, and occasional marksman-class shots with one body per round fired. We have a 'Mexican' sharpshooter, that in closeups doesn't seem to have hands steady enough to make use of the Wm. Malcom style telescopic rifle sight.<br/><br/>I found the story uncomfortable. There were too many killings for often capricious reasons. Crowe repeatedly chatted with one of his captors, usually just before killing him. The morality of capturing the gang leader and leaving the rest of the gang marauding around Texas and Arizon seems somewhere between absurd and ignorant. And the movie seems all too apt to inspire modern day 'trigger happy' people. The violent actions seem too relevant for today to take lightly. The bad guy rides off to a prison he has already broken free from twice, the greedy land baron is thwarted from one grab, but remains greedy and unpunished.<br/><br/>This truly is a story of a wounded Civil War veteran turned broke family man on a drought-stricken farm in Arizona. He manages to find self respect, protect his family, and recover his initially trigger-happy, killing-advocate son to responsible adult behavior.<br/><br/>The telling of the story is very compelling, but the story wanders a bit at times."

Russell Crowe brings masculinity and hardness to the character of Ben Wade, but also shows a sly, cool gunslinger who manages to win our hearts. And not to mention the relationship between Bale And Crowe is absolutely perfect. And we welcome to the big time Logan Lerman. And its always great to see Peter Fonda and Vinessa Shaw.

"KUAlum26","8","1","2","19 September 2007"," The Western is back!!(Well,for now,anyway.)
","Since the mid-1970s--I'd say,since about 1976,about the time ""Gunsmoke"" went off the air and John Wayne did his last movie--the Western as a genre(for movies AND TV)has been tapped less and less,with sort of a polar divide between edgy,darker,""anti-OAters""(i.e. Unforgiven,""Deadwood"") and safe,pat,emotionally provocative(""THe Young Riders"",American Outlaws,Young Guns I & II)even Politically Correct(I'm thinking mostly of DAnces With Wolves) being the running link between the occasional horse opera fare that would hit popular culture. I suppose in a growing,more diverse culture of movie making,something a distinctly pre-civil rights and(if you make it right)unapologetically un-P.C. as a Western would find less of an audience now than it might've some,say,forty or fifty years ago.<br/><br/>So,I suppose it should come as no surprise that instead of making a new Western,the producers of this film decided to bring back this story,culled off an Elmore Leonard short and scripted by Halstead Welles,Michael Brandt and Derek Haas,directed by JAmes Mangold(the able director of Walk the Line). The story of how the paths of two men--the moral,gimped rancher DAn Evans(Christian BAle,another chameleon-like turn)and the calm,measured,cold-blooded and mostly amoral thief and killer Ben Wade(Russell Crowe,like Bale,just shape-shifting into another distinct and strong character)--cross is something as old as High Noon or Shane(particularly the slow build-up of the confrontation between Evans and the small band of locals who are attempting to take Crow to the eponymous train to prison,and Wade's brutal gang),but the saltier language and the drawn out character study make this as contemporary as any other movie genre in this era. <br/><br/>Some strong turns by Ben Foster(getting a little TOO good at playing creepy and scary,as a clearly sociopathic and clever second-in-command to Crowe's Wade),Logan Lerman(As the rancher's son),Gretchen Mol(as the rancher's wife),Peter Fonda(As a grizzled Pinkerton bounty hunter)and Alan Tudyk(as a timid Vet who goes along for the ride) give character to this movie. While I cannot call it5 a great movie or a favorite of mine,I found this movie impressive in its scope,feel and intensity,and can't help but feel like if future Westerns(whether original or remade)are put together like this one,I think the genre may see a new up-tick in viewer-ship. In the meantime,3:10 is mostly a rarity,but to me(and I suspect to many moviegoers),a rare film(or anything in general)is seen as a good thing,and that's how I feel for this film."
"ClaytonDavis","8","1","2","17 September 2007"," 3:10 is just about a TEN
","From director James Mangold comes the remake of the popular 1957 film starring Academy Award winner Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. The film tells the story of Ben Wade, (Crowe) a thief/gunslinger captured by local authorities and awaiting to be transported on the 3:10 train to Yuma for trial and conviction. Being accompanied by an array of lawmen, in the middle of all this is Dan Evans (Bale) who takes on this daunting task to support his family and get enough funds to save his ranch.<br/><br/>Mangold has complete control of the film from beginning to end and never loses focus of the old western. He revolutionizes it and alas, keeps the same character and charisma it had in the early years of cinema. Deciding on shots and creating moments that sends sheer fear down the viewer's spine is the least of the director's achievement. He commands this ship and leads the players in some of the finest performances of the year. However there are some flaws with the script and pacing of the picture but all in all, you cannot ask for more from the film.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe who may not be the friendliest person in Hollywood to most is undoubtedly one of our finest actors working today. He captures a strong grip on Ben Wade and chooses to chew up all scenery he's in. His villainous turn which is reminiscent of past performances such as Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York and Leonardo DiCaprio in Blood Diamond has the viewer rooting for him when you know you really shouldn't; a compelling turn for the actor indeed.<br/><br/>Christian Bale which has been Hollywood's best kept secret for some time and is a household name is terrific as always. While being the most sympathetic of any characters on screen, he gives the viewer encouragement and anguish; a task not easy for many actors. His Dan Evans is completely lost in his life, while being nearly estranged from his older son and being permanently ""scarred"" to say the least from war, Dan is the champion of the story. Bale has been an up and comer for some time as far as awards consideration goes and exceedingly been left off many a time. With acclaimed performances in American Psycho, Batman Begins, and The Prestige and early year raved performance in Rescue Dawn, Bale may find himself amongst the list of candidates come Oscar time. Although he does share a co-lead with Crowe and may find himself pushed in supporting as studios sometimes do. But with amazing supporting performances in the film, he is overshadowed there as well.<br/><br/>Ben Foster is the triumph of the picture as Ben Wade's right hand man and turns in the actor's most frightening turn to date. He might be seeing himself with a few breakthrough awards this coming awards season if momentum builds. Peter Fonda has a very simple role but dignifies the old western man so profound. Fonda which has been long ignored by the Academy with only one nomination to his credit doesn't have enough scenery to chew on to get the glorified veteran nomination. Dallas Roberts and newcomer Logan Lerman turn in excellent performances respectively. Gretchen Mol is also quite staggering in her blink and miss role.<br/><br/>The film is quite the triumph and rolls out the red carpet for more western to return to Hollywood. The film will be followed later this year with The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and we look forward to a few more instances of great westerns to come.<br/><br/>The film will have an uphill climb for Oscar season especially with hopes of a Best Picture nomination. Being a remake, two co-leads and slew of bigger pet projects coming in the months of Oscar, its true shot will lie in the Original Score category for Marco Beltrami, which along with a great cinematography by Phedon Papamichael are the best technical aspects of the film.<br/><br/>It looks to be a great movie year thus far with a much surprise love for western cinema back in the light.<br/><br/>Grade: ***1/2/****"

","A remade version of the '57 Glen Ford picture of the same name, James Mangold's amped '3:10' is as pure a Western as there's been since 2005's 'The Proposition.' Tacking on an extra 25 minutes to his adaptation, Mangold proves a knack for the Western style, bringing to life a genre that seemed to have been gasping its last breaths, and stylishly retelling a model story for a modern audience.<br/><br/>His film, like the original, focuses on two men: Ben Wade (played marvelously by Russell Crowe), the fastest, most feared gun in the West; and Dan Evans (Bale), an unconfident, self-demoralizing rancher and Civil War vet. As Dan and his two sons go looking for their lost cattle, they approach the scene of an overturned armored carriage, which had just been maliciously attacked by Wade and his trusty gang. As it turns out, Wade had taken Dan's cattle and used it as a diversion in the robbery. Subsequently, Dan and his boys head back to the town of Bisbee, after gathering their livestock, to report the incident to town officials and inform them of Wade's intent to arrive there sometime shortly.<br/><br/>When Wade is captured off his guard with a woman in Bisbee, railroad director Grayson Butterfield offers a fine reward of $200 to anyone willing to escort Mr. Wade to contention, from where a train will depart to Yuma prison at approximately 3:10. Reluctantly, given the much-needed sum of the reward, Evans  whose unproductive land has been plagued by droughts and harassing attempts to force he and his family out for the sake of the railroad's construction  accepts the task, alongside four other volunteers (including a bounty-hunting Peter Fonda).<br/><br/>From then on, the film explodes into one of this year's most exhilarating films  as Wade's grisly right-hand man, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), leads a murderous brigade after the rescue of their leader  and culminates with a blood-bathy, gun-blazing conclusion that will have every hair on your body standing straight. Additionally, the performances are truly absorbing, especially those delivered by specialists Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, who delivers a performance that is heart-breaking, captivating, and uplifting all in the same. In fact, his character's struggles  the burdening thought that he is unable to aptly perform on his land due to an injury he sustained in the war that cost him one of his legs; and the exhausting notion that he's failed his family and himself because he can't provide for them as much as he'd like  are so despairing that we hurt for him on a very real, even physical, level.<br/><br/>The summation of all of '3:10''s gleaming aspects is a very big one  a valuable reward we get for the price of admission  and comes without the danger of escorting a vigilante as brooding as Ben Wade. Since the release of his previous film, 'Walk the Line,' James Mangold has been knocking on stardom's door. Well, '3:10 to Yuma' blows that door down  and does so fashionably, with a heap of the Old West's most volatile dynamite."
"brandonplantz","7","1","2","14 September 2007"," Good Flick, Morally Confused
","3:10 to Yuma is a great genre picture with superb acting. This combo doesn't happen often. Crowe and Bale offer a weight and subtly that are commonly absent from recent Hollywood films. Because of this craftsmanship, the film is freed to be simple; an essential element to a good Western. 3:10 doesn't need, or attempt, to pad the movie with complicated action scenes or superfluous exposition. Instead it is driven by acting talent and the uncomplicated tale of a wronged ranger trying to do the right thing when no one else will. <br/><br/>The ""right thing"", however, is confused by the movie's relativistic moral compass. As a result, the traditional good guys  the noble avenger and the stagecoach escort  are an embittered anti-theist (Bale) and a Bible-reading, hypocrite (Peter Fonda). The moral landscape becomes even bumpier when Crowe's traditional bad guy  the robber  quotes Bible verses and is tacitly labeled the hero by the film's structure and supporting characters. This moral confusion and the film's efforts to compensate with Hollywood star charisma is the most glaring sign of the film's post-modernity and why 3:10 to Yuma sends the very un-western message that virtuous ambiguity can save the day. <br/><br/>Ironically, in the film's third act, the broken compass that guides the film is traded for the Judeo-Christian guide -- self-sacrifice and betterment of community -- in order to give the film the true Western treatment. The filmmakers seemed to realize a relativistic world view can only guide one so far. In 3:10's case (and maybe in life), it can get you to the final moments, but no one can successfully ride off into the sunset without absolute Truth."

They kill everyone onboard except Pinkerton guard, Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda) whom Wade shoots in the belly. Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and his two sons find McElroy and take him to the vet's office in Bisbee, Arizona. Ben Wade is in town without his gang and the sheriff immediately surrounds the hotel. Dan distracts Ben Wade, and he is captured without a shot being fired. Railroad representative Grayson Butterfield (Dallas Roberts) asks for paid volunteers to join McElroy's posse to take Wade to the train station in the town of Contention three days away. The train arrives at 3:10, and they must put Wade on the train's prison car bound for Yuma. Once Wade arrives in Yuma, he will receive a quick trial in Federal Court and be hung. Dan Evans is a struggling farmer, desperately needing money to save his farm. Dan will help transport Wade to Contention, but he must be paid $200. The other paid volunteers who join the posse are Tucker (Kevin Durand) and Doc Potter (Alan Tudyk), the town's veterinarian. Unfortunately for the posse, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster), Wade's right hand man, sees what has happened to Wade, and he goes after the rest of the gang to help liberate Wade.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The remake of the 1957 movie 3:10 to Yuma stayed true to the tradition of the Old West. You actually get the feel of the real events from chase scenes and stampedes to gunshot wounds. You have your villains and your unknown heroes who come to the forefront to save the day. It has your perfect setting of a small prairie town with a saloon and loose women just waiting for a gun fight with the local sheriff and the posse that is taking Ben Wade to the train. Russell Crowe plays a great villain with his charm, callous conscience, and fast gun, who goes from cordial to lethal and back again at the speed of a bullet. The character of Ben Wade using the psychological weaknesses of the men on the posse was absolutely superb. The gun play was first-rate and very well done. Ben Foster as Charlie Prince did a terrific job of playing Wade's right hand man. I believe both Crowe and Foster will be nominated for Oscars. The story line is especially true today, when a father wants to teach his son what it takes in life or in death to do the right thing, and become a good and respected man.

","Christian Bale might have been a far better villain than that of Russell Crowe. Bale is still the 'up and coming' actor, or not exactly the household name such as Crowe, which would lead to a more convincing character here. Yet, this is the finest I've seen Crowe; whereas typically, I haven't any tolerance for what he's done to date ('A Beautiful Mind' was dreadful, and I'd sooner have a listen to aural wallpaper than take in 'Cinderella Man'). Bale is always good, and to think he's from my country! What I wouldn't give to take on such a consistent Yank accent. In fact, the both of them sounded genuinely American throughout. Certainly worth seeing. When there's only the first season of 'Benson' to purchase, also look into the original of this film."

Although i can't take away from Russell Crowe's performance, each scene had me guessing what his next move would be.

","This film not only has great acting by two ultra-fine professionals in Bale and Crowe but has wonderful dialogue that unravels the story and explains the action taken by each character. Logic would dictate one to ask why Crowe is running across alley ways and riding quickly with the posse toward the gallows- but the dialogue explains all of it while creating a larger scope of who these characters are. The dialogue was wonderful and concise in so many aspects. In fact, there are 3 or 4 separate verbal exchanges Christian Bales' character has that so perfectly develops the essence of the character I can not describe it as anything less than poetry! This film is excellent and is no boundaries for which audience would appreciate it- it is a great date film regardless of age or gender."

As the movie goes on you really start to gain an understanding of the history and mentality of each character.

","I was so wanting to love this movie but the extremely tedious pace and poorly written Wade character, who so obviously should have been written better, destroyed this movie. I'm all for subtlety and a certain degree of ambiguity in characterizations and I prefer it in fact to blunt exposition but this film managed to do blunt exposition that revealed little of interest about his character. It did all this while appearing to subtly reveal a strange kinship between the two that never really materialized in any satisfying fashion. The main characters spent their time grimacing a lot trying to look like they were undergoing some profound exchange but it was just fluff. The acting was terrific but even the great Prince character became dull. No consistency in the characters (specifically Wade and Prince accepted) and a what I thought was the films obvious sense of its own importance overshadowing good storytelling. Terrible leaps of logic expected of the audience in the end when the first part of the film is so pedantically realistic it felt like I was watching the stuff that DIDN'T make it into the most boring reality TV.<br/><br/>A real, REAL disappointment.

Maybe its my background as a corrections officer and having to 'escort' inmates that made me look at this with a more critical eye; but its ridiculous how much 'help' Crowe's character gives to his captor in getting him to the train on time over unbelievably stupid odds, and with no advantage of their own (ie. superior firepower, secret route). Knowing that Ben Wade's gang would be coming for their 'Boss', they add another layer of difficulty by holing up in a motel room across town, instead of taking the prisoner directly to the train station and holding him there....Its completely asinine. Movies that insult your intelligence do not deserve an 8+ rating; and there is no way this is ""the best western since unforgiven"" as the commercials suggest. I'd give that nod to Open Range."
"zardoz-13","4","2","7","11 September 2007"," This Remake Is A Pale Imitation of the Original ""3:10 to Yuma""
","""Walk the Line"" director James Mangold's noisy, violent, bullet-riddled remake of the classic 1957 Glenn Ford western ""3:10 to Yuma"" won't spur a revival of western movies. If you've seen the Columbia Pictures version with Van Heflin as the desperate, drought-stricken rancher who keeps Glenn Ford at gunpoint and manages to get him to the train on time, you'll see why even the best intended remakes are doomed to failure. Naturally, Mangold and his writers have punched up the action with gratuitous gunplay galore. A sturdy cast has the acting credentials to pull it off, but the characters that they play are overwritten. We're supposed to cry for the misguided villain because his parents abandoned him as a youngster. Meanwhile, the crippled hero worries about everything, especially that his son no longer worships him. Worse, the gloomy ending for the new ""3:10 to Yuma"" will disillusion anybody who prefers to feel good at fade-out. Perhaps the DVD will contain a suitable alternate ending. Anything resembling subtlety and suspense is absent from this pretentious western, too. The only reason to watch ""3:10 to Yuma"" is to brag that you've seen a big-screen western. As a remake, ""3:10 to Yuma"" needs to be put out of our misery. As a western in general, ""3:10 to Yuma"" scrounges few of the sterling qualities that distinguished sagebrushers like ""Silverado,"" ""Unforgiven,"" ""Tombstone,"" and ""Open Range."" <br/><br/>The people that produced ""3:10 to Yuma"" fix up a classic that needed no alterations. A small-time cattle rancher at the mercy of inclement weather struggles to preserve his herd despite a shortage of water. Mangold and his writers up the ante so that heroic Dan Evans (Christian Bale of ""Batman Begins"") must not only contend with an evil landlord who wants his property because the railroad will cross it but also with the inhospitable weather that is killing his cattle. This landlord subplotnot in the originalresembles on a small scale the Sergio Leone classic ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" about a widow with property that refuses to sell out to the railroad. Meanwhile, infamous outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe of ""The Quick and the Dead"") wages a war against the Butterfield Railroad. He has robbed their payroll stages over twenty times when he isn't sketching pictures of birds and naked babes.<br/><br/>As the film unfolds, the Wade gang waylay a Butterfield stagecoach equipped with a Gatlin gun. A Gatlin gun amounted to the nineteenth century equivalent of an Uzi. Historically, a Gatlin gun could deliver up to 600 rounds a minute. Although the good guys possess superior firepower, they don't have the expertise with the gun to vanquish the enemy. Clearly, Mangold borrowed this convention from big dumb action movies where nobody but a hero can hit anything with a machine gun. In the Glenn Ford version, the Wade gang held-up a stagecoach, and the villain shot only one man, the stagecoach driver after he took one of the Wade gang hostage. Nonetheless, in this remake, the entire scene recycles the gimmick from the John Wayne western ""The War Wagon"" where an steel-plated wagon with a Gatlin gun in a turret transported the gold shipments. Unfortunately, the ""Yuma"" stagecoach doesn't boast a turret to house its rapid fire weapon. When his army of gunslingers cannot stop the stagecoach after basically killing everybody on board, Wade steps in and stampedes a herd of cattle to halt the coach. As it turns out, the cattle belong to our hero.<br/><br/>After the robbery, Wade and his gang ride into town. Later, they split up, but Wade malingers in the local saloon to sketch a saloon girl, Emmy Nelson (Vinessa Shaw), in the nude. When the posse returns to town, they get the drop on Wade with Dan's help. Penniless Dan jumps at the chance to escort the outlaw to Contention for the prison train to Yuma. The pay outweighs the risks, so Dan assists the authorities. Along the way, Wade offers our hero a bribe for his freedom, but Dan Evans proves incorruptible. The two suffer through an agonizing wait for the train in an upstairs hotel room while Wade's gang assembles outside with everything that they have to rescue their boss.<br/><br/>Mangold, who helmed ""Copland"" with Sylvester Stallone and ""Identity"" with John Cusack,"" is no slouch as a director. However, he clutters up a simple story with far too much exposition, additional characters, and unwarranted violence. ""3:10 to Yuma"" dangerously borders on burlesque with its high body count. They could have renamed it ""The Thick Red Line."" The glut of violence dilutes what little moral ambiguity survived from the first film. Whereas the Glenn Ford original was a polished, spartan effort brimming with intensity to spare, Mangold's version of ""3:10 to Yuma"" leaves little to the imagination. Of course, today's audiences abhor westerns, so Mangold exaggerated the violence to compensate for the harsh realism. The hero displays only a trace of humanity; instead, he emerges as a tragic figure of epic proportions, hounded by his own upstart 14-year old son who refuses to obey his father at every turn. Make no mistake; Christian Bale gives it everything that he has in a bravura performance. Sadly, his character is so grim that you cringe at the sight of him rather than sympathize about his plight. Ben Foster excels as trigger-happy Charlie Prince, Wade's second-in-command, who kills without a qualm. Russell Crowe brings his hulking physical presence to bear, but he generates none of the charisma that Glenn Ford conjured up to win audience sympathy. Crowe comes off as a tactless lout, an absurd figure who does what nobody would do at the end. While it pales by comparison with the Glenn Ford original, ""3:10 to Yuma"" fares somewhat better as a western in general."
"cultfilmfan","8","2","7","8 September 2007"," 310 To Yuma
","3:10 To Yuma is a remake of a film of the same name made in 1957 and based upon a short story by Elmore Leonard. The film is set in the old west and is about a rancher named Dan Evans who agrees to escort a captured outlaw named Ben Wade to the next town to be taken on a train to the Yuma jail. Dan is a good man with honest intentions and good principles and he is also short on money and wants to support his family, so he agrees to go along with a group of other people to take Ben to the train station. Along the way they encounter difficulty with members of Ben's gang trying to prevent them from getting to the train station and getting Ben there proves to be a more difficult task then they had planned. I haven't seen a lot of westerns before, I mean I have seen some, but not enough to make me an expert of the genre, but if they are done well I do like them and I did like this remake of 3:10 To Yuma. Keep in mind I have never seen the original, so I can't compare the two films, so I' am rating this film purely on my unbiased viewing of it. Technically the film was very well made with good direction, editing, costumes and the film looked exactly like the old west and the attention to details with the costumes and sets were well done. Also this film was different from a lot of other westerns I have seen in the way that I found there was a lot more depth and personality in these characters and there was more to this film than simply action scenes and shootouts, which was another thing I admired about it. Granted when there was an action scene or shootout they were done with good editing and stunt men and it ended up being very entertaining. Probably my favourite part of the film was getting to know both Dan and Ben and what makes Dan a good man and why he is so devoted to his family and being a good citizen and why Ben is an outlaw and why everything he does leads to violence or something evil. At one point in the film the characters do talk to each other regarding something similar to this and in a way you almost get the feeling that Ben admires Dan and has some respect for him and perhaps wishes he wasn't so late in life as to not have a chance to change his whole life around. So in between the action I found some good comparisons between characters and because the acting by the two main leads were so impressive it was pulled off very well. For being a more intelligent and different western which I admired and because of being well made technically and good performances I recommend the remake of 3:10 To Yuma to fans of westerns and even to people like myself who haven't seen many, but might want to give them a try and here is a good place to start."

","When we last saw Ben Wade, he was chewing (sipping) the scenery in Ridley Scott's ""A Good Year"". Nobody saw that film, prompting Mr. Wade to lament that people should trust him and his judgement in film. Well, I do. I am happy to report that Mr. Wade's latest outing, ""3:10 to Yuma"" proves yet again that Mr. Wade is the finest judge of scripts and directors in (and outside) of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Since Mr. Wade's introduction to America in ""The Quick and the Dead"", he has captivated audiences in one quality production after another. ""Yuma"" abandons the camp of the ""Q&D"" and gives us something straight out of the '50's and '60's'. No cynicism here: this is the mythic Western of my youth, where America's westward expansion focuses the morality of a man into Biblical proportions. No wonder that most Westerns of the classic period were set in deserts. No wonder that the excellent dialogue and delivery exposes the purity of a man.<br/><br/>Supporting Mr. Wade is Christian Bale, who himself is proving a most versatile actor, with a similar ability to judge the quality of a script. His struggle is the central focus of the film, with Mr. Wade's as that of muse or guide through that journey to redemption.<br/><br/>Heartily recommended....but stay through the credits...they're quite entertaining, especially if you admire Mr. Wade's ability to bury himself in the part!"

","I know there is supposed to be an element of depth as rancher and father Dan Evans (Christian Bale) struggles to find out what kind of man he is, but the process of how this plays out is just painful. Aside from Bale's performance, the majority of this movie is really just silly in it's ridiculous story execution. Too many elements don't play true to the old west. In this movie the setting of the old west is just that and nothing more; it's a backdrop to a story. But it's not real enough for the environment and place-in-time to be something that really impacts the characters.<br/><br/>As an example, in Tombstone, the atmosphere contributed to the circumstances. The time and place, and the political entanglements, fed directly into what was going on with each of those characters. Conversely, in Yuma, the ""Old West"" is just a back drop and the setting and characters are worked to fit the twists and turns of the plot. It could easily be told in modern times, or probably any other time.<br/><br/>I do think that the movie could be a lot better if the characters were shaped to behave more like real people from that time. However, as a fun western it is totally understandable that the average movie-goer would enjoy it, but as a well-done western it really is lacking."

This is in the middle of a gun battle with bullets flying everywhere, Christian bale turns his back to the gun fire to say goodbye to a convict he is sending to jail by putting his life at stake. 'Turning your back' to gunfire is making everything in the movie useless. What is the point of the movie, even if it was a remake. Time to retire, if basic logic evades you. If you want us to believe your premise and unrealistic sense of a convict helping his capture, please throw us a bone, keep the simple stuff logical.

","Wow. Do I really need to write any more than that? Writing ""wow"" 2,000 times would serve as a fitting description regarding how I feel after watching this film, twice, for the purpose of this review, but it would also make for a lousy review of such an incredible movie, so I'll do my best to bring justice to what a darn good movie this is. 3:10 to Yuma plays out like a perfectly choreographed dance. It is a film of perfect harmony, tempo, and movement, showcasing film-making and all that implies at such a level of perfection that I don't know how any other movie could ever rival this one in conveying its simplistic plot yet also complex characters with such grace. 3:10 to Yuma could easily have been just another action movie with pretty faces that become progressively bloodier as the film moves along. Instead, the film presents viewers with the unfolding of a new chapter in a man's life and shows the influence that the strength and determination of another can have on even the staunchest and coldest of hearts. 3:10 to Yuma packs quite the emotional punch while maintaining a pace complete with terrific, well-staged action and luscious scenery. This is film-making at its finest. <br/><br/>Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a poor rancher struggling to keep his land. He's nearly broke, and his land is declared worth more with him off of it. One night, those to whom he owes money burn down his barn. He and his two sons head out the next morning to recover their cattle that were driven off by the fire and witness the robbery of a railroad stagecoach orchestrated by the notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). After a brief, tense meeting between Evans and Wade, the two go their separate ways only to meet again in the town of Bisbee where Evans is witness to Wade's arrest. For $200, Evans offers to travel with the gang accompanying Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma, a prison train that will take the criminal to his trial and execution. With Wade's gang hot on their trail, Evans and Wade come to know one another, and each man must choose his own destiny as the hour draws nearer to 3:10. 3:10 to Yuma is absolutely brilliant as a character study on human interaction and the bond that forms between men, a bond that stems from respect for a man's soul and not from the barrel of his gun. The characters of Dan Evans and Ben Wade are anything but archetypical movie characters. While they are simple men on the surface--a poor rancher and a criminal--they reveal a deep and profound sense of humanity, and the slow reveal of this trait, especially in the Wade character, makes for a stunning finale to this film. Wade's revelation is perhaps best epitomized in the film through the theme of his three drawings. I won't tell you what he draws, but when you watch the film, pay attention to them, especially his final drawing. I felt his drawing of each subject represented those things in which he felt peace and comfort, those things that allowed him to, even for an instant, forget he's wanted for 22 armed robberies and believe that he's a simple man enjoying the simple pleasures of life. Taken in this context, I found the ending of the film all the more powerful and relevant. Both Bale and Crowe are brilliant in their performances. Each actor is so good and the chemistry between them and the characters they portray is so strong that even the terse looks each gives the other is literally sometimes worth a thousand words. Watching these two fine performers in action is alone worth the price of admission. <br/><br/>Technically, 3:10 to Yuma is a standout film. As an action film, I was completely impressed with the staging of the action as well as the realism and accuracy in the use of firearms in the film. Anyone that has spent time handling and discharging firearms knows that all too often, Hollywood glamorizes the use of weapons and gives them unrealistic actions and sound effects. This film is one of the most accurate I've seen. I was particularly impressed with the audible quality of the shots. The reverberation and hard hitting sound and power of each shot is amazingly reproduced. Directing the action is James Mangold, who has a wonderful variety of films under his belt, ranging from the edgy and underrated Cop Land to the Oscar winning Girl, Interrupted to the creepy horror flick Identity and finally to the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line. This eclectic mix of films shows the director has real talent, that he can venture from one genre to the next, and he has now proved himself worthy in the genre of the Western, one of the most storied and beloved genres in American cinema history. The movie also contains an absolutely wonderful score by Marco Beltrami."

Westerns have virtually disappeared as a film genre but if you were raised on them, as I was, you've seen variations on this plot 1000 times more or less.

","I am no great fan of westerns, but I do like them occasionally. Maybe I am a traditionalist, but sometimes you have to have some sort of line between average folks, lawmen and ruthless killers and thieves. This movie makes the good into bad and the bad into good, not all the way, but close to it. The hero is Christian Bale as down on his luck family man rancher Dan Evans. He was the only bright light in the movie and played a decent man trying to make the best out of dangerous job. But he is supposed to be missing a leg which really doesn't slow him down a whit. Russel Crow is Ben Wade, our charismatic bad guy, charming anti-hero, that is the charmer almost everyone wants to love, it seems. The lawmen seem to be all crooked or almost as bad as the criminals so when they get killed by our charming anti-hero, we are on the anti-hero's side. Chief example of this is the bounty hunter Byron McElroy, played well by Peter Fonda. He is full of Bible quotes and is brave, but our charming anti-hero knows him well and lets him live after the initial hold up. But later, as the motley crew is leading our charming anti-hero to Contention, where the train in the title was to be boarded, he informs us that Byron McElroy killed a bunch of renegade Apache women and children in some mop up campaign. Then when Byron McElroy went and insulted Wade's parents, this after Wade killed one of the crew earlier, Wade jumps Byron McElroy, grabs his guns, and turns the table on his escorts, who he lets live after taking the horses but throws Byron McElroy off a cliff for insulting his parents. Great, a rude Apache civilian killer is killed off by the charismatic bad guy yet no one is appalled by another killing cause being a cool bad guy, he only kills people who deserve it somehow. To throw another detail in, Byron McElroy only reads the Bible and is a believer. Not that I am some right wing commentator, but why throw that detail in too in a time when many people were like that. Of course, our real hero and our charming anti-hero bond together as they respect each other's manhood. Time after time, our charismatic anti-hero is in control and simply lets his escorts bring him to the train. Meanwhile, his murderous wraith of a second, Charlie Prince, leads the rest of his band on vicious ride to liberate our charismatic anti-hero. He actually played that part well as a totally dedicated psycho, a Hollywood staple. But once again, the good guys seemed incapable of killing him or the gang off and he just kills and kills. For instance, in the end he offers the citizens of Contention $200 a piece for every lawman they kill, but as the locals join in to help, he goes and kills them off, why? When the movie ends, it is because our charismatic anti-hero decides it's time to go to prison, what? In that way it is better than the ""Unforgiven"" where a killer bad guy Clint Eastwood ""hero"" gets ""redeemed"" by going on a hit-man job and killing off half a town full of vigilantes, who lack the moral purity of the criminal who somehow atoned for his crimes by living ten years murder and alcohol free and had a couple of kids. I know, we are all supposed to be so hip that we know the good guys are all crooked and the bad guys are charming, but this movie just rubs that into our face so much I wish for the simple days when bad meant bad."

The story may not be the best scripted, but the acting, cinematography, the score, the directing, and the action are above average. Most enjoyable are the characters portrayed by Russell Crowe (Ben Wade) and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince). Wade and Prince are the 'bad' guys. Crowe and Foster shine in these roles. The hero is an odd character, but Bale portrays him perfectly for the script. The supporting cast add to the movie and do not distract. Watching this on Blu-Ray, I must say the surround sound was awesome. Overall, this may not be a must see movie, but if you ever enjoyed a good western, this one should sit well with you."
"Danny_G13","8","1","3","7 March 2008"," Modern western hits the target
","Bale and Crow put in a masterclass in a serious and western-set version of Midnight Run.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is a modern western, a genre which is rather fading out these days, which is not something to sadden me greatly as I was never a fan of the theme. So when given this DVD to randomly borrow, I went in with as open a mind as I could muster, and was certainly attracted by Bale and Crow as both are actors I can watch.<br/><br/>Bale is Evans, a former military sharpshooter now trying to get his ranch into some kind of fruitful state and his family comfortable, but he has to battle against the odds with authorities wanting to tear him apart given his location on wanted land, and a son who looks at him with contempt not respect.<br/><br/>Crowe plays his nemesis Wade, an outlaw with a black heart and rotten posse.<br/><br/>Initially the point of the movie seems unclear until Evans volunteers his (paid) services to aid in the transport of Wade who will be trialled for his various crimes.<br/><br/>Just like Midnight Run, this is basically a tale of two arch rivals one of whom has to take the other to justice. Difference is this is anything but a comedy. Sure, it isn't the most serious movie you will ever see, and even manages a little humour (if not a lot), but it is certainly a fairly deadpan drama.<br/><br/>The performances ensure this; Crowe oozes charisma as the colourful Wade, a truly 'bad man' but who elicits charm throughout and even hints at a humane side. Bale's Evans is a successful display of a man who simply has to battle everything, who is not a dominant personality by nature, and whose own chidren seem to lack respect for him.<br/><br/>This escort is his chance to make things right.<br/><br/>The directing in this movie is impressive - fast moving and never boring even for a second. Serious work went into this and the cinematography flows seamlessly as a result.<br/><br/>And the acting makes you care about the characters, even Wade. However, Foster puts in a cracking shift as Prince, a truly rotten and despicable killer with not an ounce of decency in him - he is a lot of fun. He is very much the villain of the piece.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is an impressive piece of cinema, and the 3 main leads steal the show - which is really the point."

","The production of traditional cowboy (or more commonly known as Western) movies swiftly ended with the retirement of actors such as John Wayne. The occasional Western film is brought out from time to time such as Dances with Wolves and the Magnificent Seven which still contained elements of their classic forefathers. Yet today, Western films have taken a different turn, amplifying the evil wills of the bad guys and developing character plots far more than the classics, such as ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". 310 To Yuma is just that, it's another newly produced film of the present breed of Western films. The character development between the ""evil as hell"" Russel Crowe and ""pride wounded"" Christopher Bale is surprising and memorable at the sacrifice of logic. Towards the end the viewer is left with many unanswered questions and left to assume with their own interpretations. The storyline was fairly adequate to a real western story of crime, not blowing the whole thing out of proportion. I personally enjoyed the malevolence of the supporting actors it made the film more memorable. Commendable mentions to Ben Foster who whenever talked had an affect on the audience. There weren't any clear messages of the film, besides looking out for your family and die hard. Just another tale of good vs evil. It's not exactly an instant classic but it's worth seeing on either the big screen or television set. The action certainly won't let you down and you won't be left disappointed. This movie seems to be a building block for new generation audiences and will help guide the path for more Western films in the years to come. Overall, I give it a 3.5 stars and it's worth watching a second time."

","Up until a specific turning point I really, really enjoyed this movie. A poor and crippled farmer who is trying to raise money to his farm and at the same time wanting to restore some self-respect decides to escort a criminal to a train in a small town with a small group of men. It's a long way to the train and on the way the farmer and the criminal develop some sympathy towards each other. It is something that the criminal is in denial of which is made explicit in a scene where he is confronted by the farmer's son who believes that he has seen some acts of the prisoner that shows that he is also a ""good"" person. This he denies. The sympathy that develops between the two has been seen before, I personally came to think of ""the contract"" in where Cusack takes his son on a trekking trip and during this they find an escaped convict (Morgan Freeman) which he decides to deliver to the police and thereby regaining the respect from his son. The challenge is to understand why that sympathy develops. As I see it the farmer is somewhat bitter because his life hasn't turned out well despite the fact that he is honest. Therefore I think that he secretly admires Ben Wade who totally disregards society and maybe he doesn't find it difficult to identify with him - he has the same urge himself and maybe he has even played with the thought of becoming an outlaw. On the other hand you have the prisoner who meets the farmer's family and very quickly understands his situation. The knowledge that he gets from the visit is at first used in a scene where he tries to bribe him but later on I think that he both respects him for his courage and - as the rest of us -understands the necessity behind his choice to escort him to the train.<br/><br/>So far so very, very good. But the before mentioned turning point is so radical that I found it impossible to believe and therefore my summarization is ""3:10 to Disneyland"" because it becomes way to sentimental and pathetic. The turning point I am referring to is the scene where Ben Wade decides that he no longer will fight the farmer but instead actively help getting on the train in order for him to win the respect of his son who is watching. When you think about it its actually quite sad that the farmer has to risk his own life to get some respect. That Ben Wade now has had some ""corrective emotional"" experience that has made him one of the good guys to the point where he is willing to get hanged is beyond my wildest comprehension.<br/><br/>And that he finally decides to gun down his own gang - although they are lawless - is again way to difficult for me to comprehend.<br/><br/>To summarize I must still say that I was very much entertained and that I really enjoyed the movie - especially the dialogue which I think there was put a lot of effort into. I will recommend it and although you end up agreeing with some of my thoughts it doesn't necessarily make the movie a lousy one.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>ps. Very nice seeing Peter Fonda again.<br/><br/>PPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."
"HeadleyLamarr","6","1","3","19 January 2008"," Outlaws a la Robin Hood?
","Watched this film with so many great expectations - very few were met. The film started out as a standard tale of heartless monster outlaws and lawful upstanding men that vow to bring one of them, Wade (played by Russel Crowe), to justice. But it rapidly derailed into a politically correct farcical piece that ended most senselessly with the outlaw trying to uplift the honest man, decimating his own gang and voluntarily boarding a train to Yuma prison. What is wrong with that, you ask? Maybe he was ready to do penance for his sins, but the makers were not happy to even throw us that bone - they showed him whistling for his horse and the animal running alongside the train in an implied escape.<br/><br/>Along the way the Pinkerton man was shown to be a Bible thumper who killed three year old Apache children, the outlaw had so much appeal for the women, and could charm children too. There were no moments of real tension in the film, no character that pulled me in, the situations were extremely contrived and the last 30 minutes were cobbled together in a laughable manner. Mr. Crowe was his usual suave lady-killer self - no matter if he was supposed to be an outlaw. Mr. Bale was more in character and did do a fine job, but could not salvage the film. Top 250? This one is eminently forgettable. To get the dubious taste of this travesty out of my mouth I will have to watch the modern day Western masterpiece Unforgiven yet again."

","I had heard so many good comments about this movie, that I was excited when it came out on DVD. My Saturday afternoon was planned; entertainment and relaxation - a well spent way to procrastinate.<br/><br/>I think I am a Christian Bale fan, and even though as a person Russell Crowe may not be great, his acting has, in the past, entertained me.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was quite entertaining and I was, at first, happy with my video rental and the decision to put off my work to watch it. I like westerns and this supplied all of the facets of the genre that I enjoy.<br/><br/>I probably would have given this movie a rating of 9 if I had turned it off just as the clock tolled to indicate that it was time to go to the train station. Perhaps it is puerile to judge a movie primarily for its ending, but that is your last impression. The ending just didn't make sense to me. I can't imagine what the writers were going for here, because everything up to this point was well done. Then, Wade decides to risk his life to get on the train (that is possibly taking him to his hanging) so that Evans can earn his son's respect. OK, I get it, personal redemption and all that, but seriously. I did have to rewind to see if I had missed something. Maybe Wade had a terminal illness and was going to die anyway. Not so, he just wanted to do something nice for someone he hardly knew.<br/><br/>In this case, the guilt I felt over my work procrastination was warranted."
"fwomp","8","1","3","11 January 2008"," A New Retelling of the 1957 Version
","Westerns are a tough sale to many movie buffs. They tend to be overdone, cliché, and ho-hum on action. And although 3:10 TO YUMA has a few of those strikes against it, it does stand out as a good film for a couple of reasons.<br/><br/>First is the acting. Russell Crowe (CINDERELLA MAN) as the bad-ass Ben Wade was a great choice. He's a ruggedly good-lookin' fella with a heart of stone that melts just a tad when faced with a good man trying to raise a good family. The good man is Christian Bale (THE PRESTIGE) who plays Dan Evans, a one-legged rancher who decides to help out the local constabulary by hauling the murderous and thieving Wade to the 3:10 train destined for the Yuma federal prison. But the biggest surprise wasn't from Crowe or Bale but instead from Ben Foster (30 DAYS OF NIGHT) as the gruff and deadly Charlie Prince, lead member of Ben Wade's outlaw gang. His creepy and maligned gunslinging attitude was well-honed and goes beyond anything you've seen of bad guys in past western films. A surprisingly decent addition in the form of Peter Fonda (WILD HOGS) as a roughshod Pinkerton also adds a bit to the acting caliber throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, although 3:10 To Yuma is basically a remake of the 1957 film by the same name (starring Glen Ford and Van Heflin), the script of this re-envisioned version weaves a new ending that goes a long way to helping it define itself as something more than just a remake. Keeping us guessing about the strengths and flaws of each of the main characters added a fresh element to what could have been a stale retelling.<br/><br/>And finally, the action. There's plenty of old-style sequences that many will be familiar with (blowing up a tunnel by shooting a wad of dynamite in midair, a stagecoach shoot-out, etc.), but there's also some great chase-and-shoot scenes in the beginning and end of the film.<br/><br/>I do have to mention that Hollywood has seen fit lately to remake just about anything some movie studio still holds rights to, and this trend appears to be gaining steam rather than diminishing. 3:10 To Yuma is no different in that respect, but it doesn't simply follow the same script of the 1957 version, which makes it an unusual hybrid: a film that treads over old terrain but leaves a new imprint via its ending."
"charchuk","7","1","3","6 January 2008"," An exhilarating ride elevated by its characters
","I quite loved it. Westerns are the one genre that I always seem to enjoy but are rarely made, and this was a fantastic, old-school, kick-ass genre flick. Not only does it have some exhilarating action scenes and some good 'ol shootouts, but it's got a great story with ample amounts of depth, solid characters, and a terrific ending. Crowe and Bale play off each other perfectly, with the former's charisma and wit contrasting excellently with the latter's subtlety and stoicism. And the finale, while eschewing logic and reason for an adrenaline rush, makes perfect thematic and even narrative sense. It's not overtly stylistic or artistic, but it is a fantastic thrill ride of a movie that's a near-masterpiece of the genre."
"fung0","7","1","3","3 January 2008"," As the Crowe Flies
","It's so great to see a really whole-hearted Western again, that it's easy to overlook this film's (admittedly subtle) faults.<br/><br/>Its greatest virtue, of course, is Russell Crowe's performance, predictably superior to Glenn Ford's in the original. Crowe is at once likable, evil, amoral and philosophical... perfectly representing that strange mixture that's really the core of this story.<br/><br/>The greatest failing is Christian Bale, who once again emotes most proficiently without ever kindling any real fire. Van Heflin, a fairly wooden actor at best, is far more sympathetic as the rancher desperate to prove himself. As with his previous travesty of Bruce Wayne, Bale seems unable to underplay, to create the sense of suppressed emotion that these roles emphatically require.<br/><br/>Direction in this new version is visually dynamic and highly entertaining. It's only when you compare scene for scene that you realize how much more economical -- and hence powerful -- the original was. Best example: the original sets up Heflin's need to impress his son largely in a single shot. The new version inserts a whole sub-plot without achieving that same emotional tension.<br/><br/>Another key change: the focus of the original is on the long, sweaty wait in the hotel room, during which Glenn Ford tries every trick to undermine Heflin's resolve. The new film abbreviates this brilliant philosophical battle of wills to a single exchange, and substitutes new action scenes that are fun, but far less substantial. (And do nothing to advance our understanding of either Crowe's or Bale's characters.)<br/><br/>All in all, the new 3:10 to Yuma is a very good film, that does better by the source material than most remakes. But the original remains the superior work of art. Still, I'd be happy to watch either one any day of the week."

Everyone who hasn't seen it, start thinking about it because believe me, its worth your money and time.

I think he will have a huge acting career.<br/><br/>Christian Bale - For a long time, he was one of my favourite actors but that rising sled is falling.

"Joel25","Null","1","3","12 December 2007"," cowboys and indians
","As an action-adventure Western this is competent enough to permit enjoyment. It overuses much-used cinematic vocabulary to situate us in a fairly structured and very familiar world, but it comes at a cost. Into this world of ready made notions and symbols it pours the ingredients of a transformational psychological drama and leaves it to the characters to work or not.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, the characters are ideas rather than personalities. Rusty Crowe;s character is more god or mystagogue than human (he plays this role very well, I must add). He plays the manufacturer of myths, which is great, but he is also the model, which is not. The specific notion of manhood that he defines is adolescent, idealised, and unlivable. He is the fulfilled wish of a 14yo boy with an ordinary dad who lacks an heroic myth to insulate his identity, not someone who bleeds real blood.<br/><br/>For a psychological drama that requires a solution of a moral conflict to succeed, I think, it needs real human emotion rather than a language, visual or otherwise, that represents emotion. How do you achieve real human emotion in a movie? An Ariadne thread that provides a connection to reality no matter how deep into the labyrinth of illusion they tread. The ""Western"" is so stylised by now that to aspire to this reality of emotions with a straight bat seems misguided. Ironies, folds, and other quirky calculations are surely needed to communicate to the audience the nature of this problem and a reasonable resolution. This didn't have enough awareness of itself. <br/><br/>It is up to you to decide whether the resolution you observed was acceptable. But if you do accept it, you;re not pushing hard enough on the skin of your mind."

","For some, including me, this film represents a dream pairing of two of the greatest living actors of our time in a set up ensuring 117 minutes of deftly delivered dialogue and widespread death and destruction. The result: the most rewarding Western since Clint Eastwood's 1992 Unforgiven. The pace is relentless; no sooner does the film begin than we are introduced to Christian Bale's perpetually stepped on protagonist being attacked by the railroad and Russell Crowe's 'Darth-Vader-there's-still-good-in-you' villain mercilessly holding up a stage coach. Between Crowe's Ben Wade being captured and Bale's Dan Evans eventually delivering him to the eponymous 3:10 to Yuma there are several graphic gunfights, each as memorable as the last, which actually serve to enhance the plot rather than occur solely to keep the attention of the audience. These action set-pieces (of which the finale could rank alongside The Wild Bunch in terms of violence) are interspersed with Evans and Wade's psychologically fought battle against one another, Crowe's character seemingly fascinated with Bale's, needling him and forcing him to take charge throughout. Evans responds in kind by using this as an opportunity to show his son, having long since lost his sense of hero worship towards his invalidated father, that he has the courage to step up to the task at hand when nobody else will. Bale plays this part with an understated excellence, never piling on the dramatics or attempting to emotionally sucker punch the audience, and this is why Yuma works so well. This is also a reason why any film with Christian Bale in has to be worth a look.<br/><br/>In regard to secondary characters, Ben Foster proves once again that he is more than capable of playing the psychotic right hand man without hamming it up (see Hostage) and portrays his character's borderline obsession with Wade admirably. He also receives the best dialogue. Peter Fonda plays Byron McElroy, another term for 'total bad ass.' When he takes a bullet in the stomach he doesn't wimp out like a certain black-suited, skinny-tied undercover policeman crying and bleeding like a wuss, he goes to the doctor, gets the bullet removed WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND and saddles up to lead the posse taking Ben Wade to Yuma. That's what real men are made of. The doctor who accompanies McElroy to make certain he's OK (as if he needs any help) is very formulaic, being reduced to committing a single act of spontaneous violence in order to help the gang and subsequently boasting about it moments before being killed, but not before uttering something like ""We made it, didn't we?"", a line taken straight from the Clichéd Book of Screen writing, Volume One. Evans' son is played with professional maturity by Logan Lerman, whose character, in the wrong hands, could have ruined every scene he appeared in. Instead he is an asset to the cast, allowing the audience to easily identify with his character.<br/><br/>Criticism to the film mainly appears in the form of a recurring horse noise, recognisable from the PC game Age Of Empires 2. While it may be sad to pick up on this, there is no excuse for using this identical sound of horses whinnying at no less than FOUR different points in the film. How hard is it to record the sound of a couple of horses making noises? It is the horse version of a Wilhelm Scream, lazy and irritating. Additionally, the capture of Wade at the start following his totally unnecessary rendezvous with a bar woman is a little contrived, as if the filmmakers could not imagine any other way Wade could be detained. Finally, the presence of the 'cursed pistol' serves no purpose to the story whatsoever.<br/><br/>Overall, Yuma is a magnificent Western brought to life by star turns from several actors bringing enough depth and emotion to their characters to balance out the fact that ""They had a lot of weapons, Mister - and they were shooting bullets."""

"timsiepel","Null","1","3","14 October 2007"," strong acting almost saves improbable plot
","In this morality of wishful thinking, hardened criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) becomes so impressed by the decency of his captor, rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale), that he decides to voluntarily assist him in his almost impossible task of delivering himself as prisoner to Yuma in time to catch the 3:10 train to prison, where he will face certain and well deserved execution. Strong directing and especially strong acting almost save this film from its improbable plot. The most ridiculous scenes I thought were in the final chase when the prisoner, leading the way to the train station, has to jump from one roof to another. Before he attempts the jump, he turns back to his captor and says, ""Can you make it?"", as though, if one legged Dan can't do it, the 2 legged prisoner won't try it either! Heavens no, he might get away. Then , when Ben's devoted gang finally does rescue him, he shoots them all and jumps into the jail cell on the train! Even though Dan is already dead, it is still important to impress Dan's son, who appears at times to be wavering on the path of righteousness. Those of you who work as marshals, delivering prisoners to court and having to transport them on public conveyances, should not expect them to behave according to Mr Wades standards. Expect the worst instead, as a man's instinct for survival and freedom is more likely to overpower any passing affection for 14 yr old kids he met 2 days ago. It's hard to believe Elmore Leonard ever wrote a piece of crap like this, but it was in the 50's , and that's what was selling in those days. A man's got to eat. Harder still to believe is that many sophisticated reviewers like Roger Ebert thought this was a good movie."
"jzappa","8","1","3","12 October 2007"," I Realize Very Late the Raw and Real Force of Genius Russell Crowe Is As an Actor
","3:10 To Yuma thrives on the fascinating human chemistry of the two main characters, Christian Bale's unlikely hero and Russell Crowe's intimidatingly self-aware villain. The dynamic between them is so brilliantly indescribable and ambiguous in its portrayal of personality. When you leave this film, a bloody, fast-paced western, you're going to be pondering the subtextual motives of these two characters as a reaction to the unmatchably entertaining and fascinating climax. What you should remember is that we ourselves rarely know the reasons for things we do. Russell Crowe's character is such a richly drawn villain, especially for a western, because amongst all of his ruthless murder, ability to take charge of a vicious, rotten gang, and shark-like expressions is a man with a mind that's aware and open enough that he is capable of surprising himself. The expansive outreach of his character to his opposing company throughout the film just consumes you.<br/><br/>The root of the film's expert delivery is the depth and intricacy of the script, which claims solid development to the point where it can be free to to take thematic liberties and create an unpredictable hot-cold-and-lost-in-inconclusiveness relationship between everybody.<br/><br/>I was at first turned very much off by the frustrating animal violence early in the film, but I was progressively turned back on. Russell Crowe completely embodies a rugged manliness that suggests that he was born in the wrong era, as if he were a walking museum exhibit. It's almost alarmingly lifelike to see how genuinely he wears his scopically perfect character. The expansive intellect, not to mention the artistic and romantic sensibilities that are filled in around the edges, are not unequal in realism in Crowe's performance. He is making me realize very late the raw and real force of genius he is as an actor and a movie star. Alongside him, there is just no real way Christian Bale can match him. No matter how affecting Bale is, Crowe's villain is the sort that steals the show and pinches for every penny of it. However, the unlikeliness I speak of in Bale's hero is personified unreservedly as a farmer with such a good-hearted nature that he doesn't even recognize his own breaking point, which comes when he volunteers to assist the transportation of Crowe's notorious character to the gritty town of Contention. Bale shows us a tough everyman with a rifle who can carry himself just as well as anyone else despite his bum foot, but traces over him with the sad, innocent scavenging of a lost ego. Crowe and Bale are doubtlessly the best hero- villain coupling I've ever seen in a western.<br/><br/>This western is doubtlessly the best American western I've seen in a life. If only they hadn't bothered with the stupid animal violence early on."

","Westerns have been a mainstay of Hollywood since the early years of the motion picture industry. 3:10 to Yuma is a classic story with, clearly defined characters. Russell Crowe having previously proved himself a well rounded actor in movies like ""The Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"", once again amazes the audience with his role as the antagonist, bad guy, Ben Wade. Ben Wade has a clearly defined, dark edge but, is also portrayed as a thinking man who seems to be more of a victim of circumstance, than evil by choice. However, one thing is to be noted about this film: I am a fan of video games and this film seems be cut directly out of the game, ""Gun.""

Crowe excels in any role. In Yuma, Crowe is rough, but smart and gentle at the same time. Crowe does not dominate a leading role, but dominates an entire film. It does not matter what the role is, Crowe adapts and becomes that character. I love the ending where Crowe is a bad guy only for the adventure, not the money, and wants to see Bale impress his boy.

He's not a bad guy. Ben doesn't kill out of spite.<br/><br/>In a purely dumb luck encounter, Dan ends up helping to capture Ben. The sheriff is going to play completely by the book. Ben won't be hung. He will given a fair trial in Yuma. But Ben's gang is sure to try and stop them. The local sheriff decides to hire 4 men to get Ben to the train on time, Dan being one of them.<br/><br/>Dan's oldest son, William, is so enamored with Ben he can't see straight. On the side, he reads dime store novels about Ben's adventures. He is ashamed of his father and his supposed weakness. After all, his dad hasn't been able to protect the family from fires intended to drive the family out of coveted land. William ends up following Ben against his father's strict orders and joining this band of make-do deputies.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the journey to deliver Ben to the authorities, Dan is wary to get too close to Ben. But whenever a group of men spend time together, a bond of brotherhood is inevitably formed. Dan ends up saving Ben's life on more than one occasion and vice versa. You can't help but like Ben more than any of the ""good guys."" When he starts knocking his captors off one by one, he only goes for the annoying people. One man actually helped burn down Dan's house. This is not a guy we miss. The other casualty is Byron, a man who insults Ben's mother. And he sure knows how to woo the ladies. He talks to them and makes them feel like they are better than their lots in life.<br/><br/>The strongest thing about this film is the two lead actors. At first glance, they appear to be two sides of one coin: the wholesome family man and the glamorous criminal. What could they possibly have in common? Ben is constantly surrounded by mindless thugs, especially Charlie Prince, a man who is apparently in love with Russell Crowe, though subconsciously. He kind of enjoys talking to the ethical, rational Dan.<br/><br/>In an amazing set of circumstances I can't explain fully, Ben ends up aiding Dan in his attempt to get him on the train.

This time, however, instead of picking up a bunch of Johnny Cash CDs, viewers are sure to run to the stores and pick up some classic westerns.<br/><br/>With ""3:10 to Yuma,"" Mangold and crew have re-vitalized the Western in a new style that still manages to hold on to what we all love about Westerns. The film stars Christian Bale and Russell Crowe as two men divided by the law and by their sense of justice. Bale plays the ""good guy,"" but he still manages to have some serious gray areas. Crowe plays the villain, though he's perhaps the most likable character in the film. Early on in the film, we see just how much influence Crowe's character holds over his crew, but it's completely believable. As we see more and more of him, we start to like him, eve if he is a brutal killer. What's interesting is that he acts in a way that he considers just.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, though it is full of character development and intensity. There are some scenes that actually manage to be very emotionally true. There are some scenes that make you laugh hysterically until you realize how twisted the humor is. There are some scenes where the intensity goes on full-blast and we get that cool ""Western"" feeling. Al in all, it's a great story with enough great scenes to fill a whole city.<br/><br/>What brings this film to the next level is the acting. Christian Bale is very restrained and subtle as the protagonist, and his performance suits the film well. Peter Fonda gives a great minor performance that is sure to arouse memories of his father's older roles. Still there are two performances in this film that should surely be nominated for Oscars. Russell Crowe deserves a Best Actor nod for his fun and likable portrayal of such a complex and gray-shaded villain. This may be his best performance so far in his career. However, the show-stealer here is really Ben Foster as Charlie Prinze, Wade's (Crowe's) right-hand man. He embodies the classic spirit of a western villain. His lines are the best and most quotable in the film. His expressions and accent are also pitch-perfect. He utilizes his heavily-made-up face to create some of the most intense moments of the film. He also plays one of the most interesting characters in the film. He has a devotion for Crowe's character that is so strong and so passionate that it borders on (if not crosses) some unwritten lines that were only barely touched upon in past Westerns, with the exception of a particularly ""different"" one that came out a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>See ""3:10 to Yuma"" for the acting. See it for the upsetting but powerful take on violence. If none of these things appeal to you, just see it for the chase and shoot-out scenes and for the sheer fun spirit that the film embodies."
"AndrePhilidor","8","1","3","24 September 2007"," A great western spoiled.
","All of the ingredients of a great western - stagecoach hold-up, townsmen forming a posse, wonderful horsemanship, rugged scenery, and an Indian ""attack"". I deplored the ending, and the incomprehensible turn-about of the villain (Russell Crowe). I immediately got the 1957 original with Glen Ford as the villain. A great actor, but he appears too clean-cut in the role, while Russell Crowe appears much more ominous though cultured, a fine sketch artist and bible scholar.<br/><br/>There were some definite improvements over the 1957 version. SPOILERS to follow - please see the movie first before reading these comments.<br/><br/>The film (both versions) opens with a stagecoach hold-up. The stagecoach driver seizes a gang member and holds a gun to his head, telling the robbers to ride off or else. Ben Wade (leader of the gang - Glenn Ford/Russell Crowe) instantly shoots his own man through the head and then shoots the stagecoach driver.<br/><br/>Wade is later captured and a half dozen men deputized to take him to the nearest railroad town where the 3:10 will take him to the penitentiary at Yuma. Rancher van Heflin/Christian Bale, desperate for money to save his ranch, agrees to join the men for a fee of $200 offered by the owner of the stagecoach line.<br/><br/>Rancher van Heflin's wife comes roaring into town on a horse and gig to plead with him to give up his suicidal mission. In the 2007 film, this is much improved upon. Crowe's 14 year old son (Logan Lerman) pleads to accompany the men taking Crowe to the town where the 3:10 train will bring him to the penitentiary, saying, ""I can ride better and shoot better than any of the men."" Of course his father (Christian Bale)refuses. On one of the several occasions where Crowe bests his escorts, he has seized a shotgun holding it on the men who would take him to prison. Unbeknownst to his dad and the others, Logan (the 14 year old)had been trailing silently all along and steps up behind Rusell Crowe holding a pistol,to his head, saving the day and the lives of his Dad and the other men. A fine touch, far better than the wife coming to town in the 1957 version.<br/><br/>Taking a shortcut, the men choose to ride through Indian territory, although advised strongly against it. Sure enough, they are attacked in the night by Apaches. Russell Crowe, having obtained a gun, crawls out into the darkness and dispatches the Indians, ALL THREE OF THEM (?!) In all of the western movies of the past, the Indians attack in hordes. Crowe later explains he did this to save his own skin.<br/><br/>Encountering railroad tracks being laid by Chinese coolies, Wade is nearly shot by the gang boss who recognizes him as the killer of his brother in an earlier robbery. Managing to escape, Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in a well timed feat of horsemanship and shooting toss a bundle of dynamite into the tunnel, setting off an explosion by accurate marksmanship ending the pursuit.<br/><br/>Ben Wade's gang are relentlessly following the posse to prevent them from putting him on the train, and the inevitable shoot-out follows in the town. Just as in High Noon, the townspeople at the last minute abandon the escort refusing to risk their lives. When the sheriff steps out and lays down his guns on the ground, holds up his hands in the air, he is ruthlessly shot down by Wade's second-in-command, a vicious killer wearing an old Confederate Civil War tunic.<br/><br/>Crowe, having failed to buy his freedom from rancher Bale, runs along with him to the train. Just as his gang is about to free him at the very train tracks, he turns and shoots each of them dead. Not surprising since he readily killed one of his own men at the beginning of the movies. (So why were they all so dedicated to saving him???) And then, Ben Wade and the rancher (van Heflin in 1957) run for and hop on the train which has started moving and picking up speed. The rancher, puzzled as to why he so willingly ran along and hopped on the train, asks Wade to explain. Wade simple says, ""I've escaped from the Yuma penitentiary twice before."" As they stand in the cattle car, van Heflin's wife (1957) arrives on the scene and smiles in relief that he is alive, that he has made it and that he will collect on the promised $200. At that climactic moment, the rancher, about to lose his ranch and cattle due to a prolonged drought, the heavens open up and heavy rains begin, van Heflin waves to his wife as they break out in smiles, as does the audience.<br/><br/>In the 2007 version, the rancher (Christian Bale) is shot to death in the rail yard. What a depressing ending to (until then) a terrific western movie."
"bobbobwhite","7","1","3","24 September 2007"," OK, but nothing great
","Too many historical inaccuracies to ever get my nod as great, as the much too lenient way in which Ben Wade(Crowe) was escorted to justice just never would have happened in the old frontier west. Look at an old west crime history book with photos sometime in your library and see that captured criminals were chain-shackled from head to toe, hardly able to move a finger let alone kill two men en route and still, yes still, be treated with the kid glove leniency and poor security shown in this film. No way this would have ever happened, and the presence of 21st century security and emotional softness toward criminals in a 19th century, hard scrabble, tough-guy western story was laughable to me as a frontier historian.<br/><br/>Eastwood did this too with Japanese soldiers in his Letters From Iwo Jima, putting the same 21st century body language and belligerent attitudes towards authority in Asian soldiers who never in a million years would have ever acted that way 65 years ago. I think both of these filmmakers feel that modern movie goers need to relate to speech patterns and attitudes they are familiar with, as honest 19th century speech, manners and social practices would be too foreign for viewers to relate to? I don't think so. Why don't they try it sometime for accuracy, integrity and honesty, and see if we like it? I, for one, would be a lot more happy with truth and realism than with someone's fictionalized tall tale of what sells better to movie goers.<br/><br/>The obvious, but never overtly expressed, devoted hero worship angle tending toward homosexual adoration expressed toward Wade by his psychotic #2 in charge was probably missed by most viewers, but that subdued part was possible in real life then even among cold blooded killers, as almost all feelings and emotions in the old west were heavily repressed and thus seldom surfaced except in nuance. It was not an age for touchy feelie sentiment or for being overtly ""queer"" in the manly world of frontier crime. <br/><br/>That being said, with all true-to-life story realism put in your pocket and never given a thought again while you watched this film, it was entertaining as pure shoot-em-up escapist fare but was certainly no Shane or Red River or Once Upon A Time In The West. Not even close."
"dmgrundy","6","1","3","24 September 2007"," Passable entertainment riddled with problems
","The assumption seems to be made too often nowadays that the western was 'killed', if not by the Spaghetti western boom, and if not by expensive 1980s failures such as 'Heaven's Gate', by Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' in 1994, with its grimy town, unpleasant/flawed/complex characters, and relentlessly downbeat myth-busting. Not only this, but it needs to be 'reborn', and critics seem to arguing that '3:10 to Yuma' is the film to do that. At first glance, a strange movie to fulfil this mission - it's yet another Hollywood remake, though thankfully not of an absolute standout like 'High Noon'; instead, Delmer Dave's minor classic from 1957, a tense, taut little film focusing as much on characterisation and psychological drama as on gun play, which ratchets up the suspense in a way clearly influenced by 'High Noon'. At second glance, how this film could rebirth anything is a mystery. Everyone's praising the performances, from Russel Crowe as the murderous/thoughtful/charming/witty gang leader to Christian Bale as the fallen-on-hard-times/war veteran/family man/rancher who has to put him on the train to Yuma prison to Ben Foster as Crowe's psychotic, blue-eyed lieutenant (interestingly, one review I've read elsewhere suggests that Foster tries to suggest a homo-erotic edge to his character's relationship with Crowe, but Crowe's interpretation of his own role shuts this avenue off). True enough, they're good, as would be expected - but nowadays, I'm beginning to feel that a lot of 'good performances' are given not so much in service to the story and the film as to ensure an Oscar nod - cynical, I know, but it's a feeling I just can't shake off.<br/><br/>A major flaw is apparent in the inconsistencies that riddle the film, inconsistencies that, in a movie which is attempting to be a psychological drama as well as an action movie, strike a particularly jarring note. For instance, why does Crowe's apparently cold-blooded, ruthlessly efficient killer return to the posse, including an injured Bale, an incompetent doctor and a 14-year old boy, having just killed 3 Indians, when he could have easily got away? Why does he help Bale in the final shoot-out, when he could easily push him into the line of fire or slip round a corner and leave Bale at the gang's mercy? And finally, why does he shoot 6 gang members (in a feat of gunsmanship far more unbelievable than Clint Eastwood's in the Dollars films, or the climax to Unforgiven) when they've rescued him? Then put himself back on the prison train to Yuma...then whistle for his horse? Dude, where's the logic? And I'm not even going to start on Peter Fonda's impossibly leathery, tough old bounty hunter, who seems to be impervious to close-range stomach wounds...What's more, as well as these serious motivational and plot inaccuracies and anomalies, there are wildly over-the-top action sequences which jar with an attempt in other parts of the film to present a more 'realistic' version of the 'Wild West,' the climactic gunfight being the worst offender, closely followed by a horseback chase through a mine.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's go back to the assumption that the western is dead. I don't see why: of all genres, it has always seemed to me to be particularly rich, offering numerous opportunities for explorations of themes relating to masculinity, civilisation, violence, crime, the relationship of individual to community, the imposition of values in a lawless country, the development of a problematic, rough-and-ready approach to justice and morality arising out of physical necessity...etc. What's more, many of these ideas are relevant to today, as 'The Proposition' (which I think we can characterise as a western, despite the Australian setting) showed, with its exploration of colonialism. To be sure, '3:10' touches on some of these ideas. The trouble is, it touches on them in a very obvious, crude, non-naturalistic way, through dialogue that is almost psychobabble; the film-makers don't seem to have learned the lessons of old westerns which would have for blunter, less well-expressed, more homespun philosophies. I can think of two examples from Peckinpah: Joel McRea's ""all I want is to enter my house justified"" from 'Ride the High Country' (one line expressing so much of the motivation behind the heroes in both Peckinpah's, and other's, westerns), and William Holden's ""let's go"" from 'The Wild Bunch' - just two words and a glance before striding out to certain death (which could be walked away from) - the ""a man's gotta do"" cliché taken to its furthest extent so that's it's maybe not even a moral decision, more of an existential act of defiance.<br/><br/>My main criticism is that this is a conflicted film, striving at once to take the western back to something more traditional, as Kevin Costner's 'Open Range' did, and to accommodate the more excessive touches introduced by the Spaghettis and the more downbeat, 'realistic' touches which were developed to perhaps their fullest extent in 'Unforgiven' (this attempt at 'realism' is quickly subverted by the numerous far-fetched, inconsistent, nonsensical elements). Not sure whether he wants to deliver action-packed box-office Hollywood product with big stars, or a showcase for these two stars to flex their acting muscles and earn some Oscar nominations, or a serious western, Mangold in the end creates a compromise which doesn't fully realise any of these options, despite the critics' almost unanimous praise."
"kenpo1970","7","1","3","23 September 2007"," Three things make this movie worthwhile....
","Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Ben Foster. This movie is basically your run of the mill Western but the acting is what brings this movie from just okay to really good. Those that compare this movie to Unforgiven probably need to go give that movie another look because it certainly isn't in that league but it comes close. The direction of James Mangold and the performances of the three leads are clearly what make this film work. Russell Crowe is in his usual top form confirming my belief that he will go down as one of the greatest actors of the last twenty years. And Christian Bale continues to prove that there is virtually no limit to his versatility. But the real surprise of this film is Ben Foster. He looked familiar but I didn't place him as the same guy who played Claire's dysfunctional boyfriend from Six Feet Under until about a third of the way through the film. All I can say is that he pulls of playing a bad guy with ease and he has a magnetic screen presence. This guy is the real deal and I predict great things for him. I don't know that you have to see this in the theater but if you choose too it certainly wont be a waste of your money."

"michaeldenis","10","1","3","21 September 2007"," 3:10 to Yuma: The Legend
","There's something very special about James Mangold's ""3:10 to Yuma,"" a prince among remakes. Looking back, it's possible to recognize this in the first few scenes of the film. A bandit gang plans to rob a stagecoach in the American Southwest of the late-1860s. The bandits mount-up, but not before we see one of them place a few fistfuls of dynamite into his saddlebags. Surprise-surprise, a few minutes later we're in for a treat: the first use of ""shoot the gas tank""-tactics in a Western. It's an unlikely occurrence, brought to us for pure enjoyment.<br/><br/>And so it is, I suggest, with the entire film. Unlike the 1957 original, which tells it straight, this version tells it crooked. We're not watching how events actually transpired. No, we're watching how we *wished* they'd transpired. If you want the truth, then check out the 1957 version, herein lies ""3:10 to Yuma: The Legend.""<br/><br/>You should remember that when you first heard the 3:10 story you were lying asleep at night as a child with your older brother. He lit a match and told you of when it was ""your old man and Ben Wade to the station, when no one else would"""
"tynesider","7","1","3","20 September 2007"," Twenty-first century remake of classic western.
","A remake should always add something extra to the original and this one does. New characters, old characters with different roles or emphasis and played by contemporary actors, authentic-looking production design and locations, and colour all add up to an entertaining and exciting picture, and well worth seeing.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is Ben Wade, leader of a gang of outlaws who open the film by robbing the stage and then riding brazenly into town to tell the law about the robbery, omitting their own part in it naturally., the posse then going off to chase after the robbers. Wade, however, lingers a little too long in town, having made a conquest of the saloon's (female) bartender, and is kept talking by impoverished rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale) until he can be arrested. Now Wade must be taken to Contention City and put on the 3:10 train to Yuma after which a likely hanging awaits. Evans needs the money on offer for being part of the escort.<br/><br/>The rest of the film tells what happens on the trail, with some wonderful set pieces like the incident in the railroad worker's camp, and climaxes in a brutal shoot-out at the railroad station with unexpected consequences.<br/><br/>But there are quieter moments too, especially in the hotel room (where Wade is being held to await the train), exploring the developing relationship between Wade and Evans in response to events.<br/><br/>But how does it compare with the original version from Delmer Daves? Well, in that film the leads are played by Glenn Ford and Van Heflin, giving standout performances, with Wade's lieutenant Charlie Prince here played by Richard Jaeckel, a less ruthless characterisation than that of Ben Foster in the 2007 version.<br/><br/>The black and white cinematography is so good that you quickly settle for it not being in colour, and the slower-paced story allows more time for character development even within a shorter running time.<br/><br/>The scenes between Glenn Ford and bartender Felicia Farr are outstanding and the two male stars are, I believe, more charismatic than their modern counterparts, with character actors Robert Emhardt and Henry Jones also good. There is also an appropriately mournful song from Frankie Laine sung over the credits. The new picture has been criticised for some implausible moments but the 1957 film also has its ambiguities. No-one guesses that the drunken stranger sleeping it off with a newspaper over his face in the hotel lobby where Heflin is holding Ford might be a member of the gang on a spying mission. And the hotel scenes take place between 11 till 3 yet the shadows in the street are long and not short as they ought to be when the sun is high in the sky.<br/><br/>But these reservations apart, the 1957 version is, in my opinion, superior, and one of the classic Westerns, compared to the new one which is very good but for me falls somewhat short of classic status, but certainly one of the best 'modern' westerns.<br/><br/>And Glenn Ford has the best hat."

","Finally the western genre has returned. In 1993 ""Tombstone"" was released and was a big hit; it revitalized the dying, or already dead, western. Since then, even with as big as hit as it was, Hollywood just hasn't released any westerns, at least not mainstream ones. There just wasn't money to be found in them, and audiences largely ignored them, until now. Talk abounded surrounding a trailer for a movie called ""3:10 to Yuma"" starring some of Hollywood's biggest stars. For once, wanting to see a western was the ""thing"" again. And the movie that promised a ""cool"" western really delivered.<br/><br/>""Yuma"" is based on a 1950s movie based on a short story. This time directed by ""Walk the Line's"" James Mangold and starring Christian Bale and Russell Crowe. Bale plays a down and out farmer, Dan Evans, who has a huge debt to pay to the local baddies, so when notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Crowe), is captured and sentenced to death in Yuma, Ben is more than willing to collect the ransom to take Wade to the 3:10 train to Yuma. But Ben's old gang isn't about to let that happen.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is once again brilliant as he will be for every movie he ever makes. Crowe is equally great as he balances on the line of pure evil and showing some good side. And that's the cool thing, Ben is such a dark, suave, well mannered guy one second, the next he's putting three bullets into his gang member for messing up. Other notables are Ben Foster as Wade's right hand, Charlie Prince, who is so extremely evil he makes Wade look like an angel. And Peter Fonda as a mean-tempered, revenge bent sheriff is great as well. The cinematography is stunning switching from the serene desert, to a fast-paced, intense gun battle. Everything is just so well paced and directed, it's all around a great movie. <br/><br/>""3:10 to Yuma"" is chock full of heart-stopping shoot outs and non-stop intensity, so fans of modern action films will love this, as will fans of westerns, and anyone who just likes a good time."
"meeza","10","1","3","18 September 2007"," Take the ""3:10 to Cine"" to see ""3:10 To Yuma""
","Do not be a train wreck by missing the exhilarating western ""3:10 To Yuma"". It is quite the entertaining western that we have been waiting for. Director James Mangold struck gold in his delivery of this remake of the 1957 western starring Glenn Ford. Mangold was quite fortunate to lasso thespian megastars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the title roles this time around. Bale plays Dan Evans, a crestfallen rancher who is so broke that $3.10 is about the estimated total cash he has on him to support his worried wife and his two melancholic kids. Crowe plays Ben Wade, the wily outlaw who leads a posse that robs armed stagecoaches carrying lots of ""Big Ben Franklins"" for Big Ben Wade to steal. Wade's luck runs out when he is captured by lawmen in the desolate western town of Bisbee. The ""financial desperado"" Evans is then hired by the Bisbee lawmen to join a posse which will take the baddie Wade to the town of Contention in order for put him on the 3:10 to Yuma train; that will lead him to Yuma jail for an eventual hanging. Let's just say that they want Wade to hang it high as the basketball Wade does when he dunks the ball. Anyway, Evans accepts the offer and what follows is a cerebral & physical duel between Evans & Wade that is quite the roundup I have been waiting for in a suspenseful & creative western. Along for the ""take Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma ride"" is Peter Fonda playing Byron McElroy, a former grungy outlaw who joins the Bisbee entourage because he himself despises Wade; Kevin Durand as Tucker, a loudmouth cowboy; Alan Tudyk as Doc Potter, the town veterinarian who is used to hanging out with a bunch of desperate old dogs himself; and Dallas Roberts as Grayson Butterfield, the railroad lawman who is as soft in the inside as butter itself. Not exactly the dream team of Western Bad-Asses; which does make it easy for the clever Wade to always be in contention to escape on his way to Contention. However, I will hold my guns here because to say more would be a misfire in adequately reviewing the film with no spoilers. Ben Foster plays Charlie Prince, Wade's right hand man (no not Shaquile O' Neal) whose devilish demeanor is western bloodcurdling at its apex. Yes, this Prince definitely does ""go crazy"". Let's just say that Prince and his bandit posse will go to any means to save their boss Wade. Many of the acting performances of ""3:10 to Yuma"" are deserving of Oscar nominations at the Kodak Corral. Crowe and Bale were simply brilliant as Wade & Evans and will probably be dueling out again in the Best Actor category in numerous award shows. Foster means ""American for Best Supporting Actor nomination"" for his wicked work as the monstrous Prince. I was also fond of Fonda's fun acting as MCelroy. Logan Lerman who plays Dan Evans' son William was also a nice addition to this winning acting posse. Director Mangold ""walks this western line"" with a triumphant psychological western touch that makes the ""3:10 To Yuma"" the yummiest cinematic experience of the year. ***** Excellent"

But yet again, he delivers a grand performance as the captured outlaw Ben Wade. Christian Bale was another fabulous thespian in this film as the protagonist whose duty is take the outlaw (Crowe) to the 3:10 train that leads to Yuma. Bale's in another serious role like his previous ones for Batman Begins and The Prestige. But he seemed more believable and a bit more mature, particularly with having a beard and portraying a war battered character that only had one leg.<br/><br/>The other supporting cast members were also great, including Peter Fonda, Logan Lerman, and Ben Foster, who was a real hellion. The gunfights and chases were splendidly done and very long with defiant violence and a shaky camera, which pulled me deep, into the action sequences.<br/><br/>Despite the elongated action scenes, which indeed are long, when one goes away, the movie drags until a new one arrives.

The film broaches lots of dark topics (Indian massacre, Civil War experiences, dark pasts) but never to any degree of satisfaction. The plot points, however, are where it falls very short. There are holes big enough to drive a truck through, with both the good guys & the bad guys making bonehead errors reminiscent of 60's Bond films (or even mores, Austin Powers films:) At its core, Kane's 'transformation' comes across as unbelievable and pretty random.

I am not a fan of ""layered ambiguity"" or ""emotional complexity"" or whatever was being sought in the ending. Because of uniformly strong performances, many viewers like me will have a lot invested in the climax of the final showdown. I'm not saying it had to go one way or another, but don't leave me trying to figure out what the hell just happened. (My friend and I came up with at least five possible interpretations.) So for that reason it cannot be an A or even a solid B. Has to be a B-minus. ... And don't make the ending inconsistent with the characters, which for at least one I think it very much was. We think we know what these men want: honor, redemption for Dan; freedom and power for Ben, and then in the last few acts of the movie all that came before is undercut? If you're telling me a story this good, don't cop out in the last few scenes and make it a no-resolution resolution. Everyone has to make choices: screenwriters as well as moviegoers.

","The original 3:10 to Yuma with talented, magnetic, and sexy actors Glenn Ford and Van Heflin is one of the best Westerns ever made.

Get it from your public library or on NETFLIX and you'll spend a worthwhile hour and a half.<br/><br/>I always have doubts when a classic is remade. It is usually not as good, but this one is bloody awful! I've read so many pithy critical reviews of this version that there is really no need to add any details. I WILL say, during my viewing of the DVD I kept backing it up and replaying scenes, saying to myself, ""I must have misunderstood, cause that makes no sense!"" or ""I can't believe that just happened; that is absurd."" Sure enough, the movie absolutely insults our intelligence and our credulity, over and over again.<br/><br/>I liked the review that was titled ""plot holes that can be seen from outer space."" Amen to that. SEE THE ORIGINAL 50's VERSION if you want to see a good Western, which bears no resemblance to this remake."
"gavin6942","7","1","4","24 March 2008"," Solid Remake With the Bale-Crowe Combo
","A notorious bandit (Russell Crowe) is witnessed in the act by a local rancher (Christian Bale). After meeting up later in town, an agreement is made between the police, the rancher and the bandit for the rancher to escort the bandit to the prison train to Yuma. Along the way, they begin to learn and respect each other's life views.<br/><br/>What sold this film was clearly the cast -- Crowe and Bale. Westerns do not easily sell themselves anymore, and this one probably wouldn't have made a dent in the box office without the stars. Its value as a remake was most likely minimal. And what interests me about this is how Crowe takes the lead as an actor, leaving Bale to catch up. Bale is often a powerful actor (perhaps among the best in the business, along with Edward Norton) but this is probably his weakest role to date. Crowe dominates, being both an intimidating villain but also somehow lovable.<br/><br/>Luke Wilson makes a brief appearance. While he really isn't the best casting choice (his presence always carries a subtle ""comedy"" vibe), he does alright. The best support is Ben Foster with the memorable role as right-hand man Charlie Prince. Foster has an unusual voice that made him seem silly in ""30 Days of Night"", but in this film it works for him to a point. If Foster becomes a bigger actor, it's this film he has to thank for it.<br/><br/>The drawback to ""3:10"" is that there is precious little action for a Western, at least until near the end. So those looking for action are going to receive drama and that may be a disappointment. Personally, I found much of it to drag (though the last third really does improve the action as well as the story overall). If you like westerns, check it out. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere. Bale fans are going to be let down."

","I have actually seen a few bad reviews in here and I'm very surprised by them. This movie was really terrific. If you are looking for realism, I'm not sure where I could point you. 3:10 to Yuma is based on a story from about 40 years ago so of course it is going to have some points that seem ""far fetched."" They are all within the context of the movie. The acting is outstanding. I'm convinced Russell Crowe hasn't made a bad movie since ""Virtuosity."" Christian Bale is rapidly ascending the ranks with Crowe and Edward Norton as guys who simply don't put their names on to bad films (the Norton clown movie aside). Suspenseful the whole way through and great viewing. Nothing bad to say about it. One parallel I will draw though that may be a bit abstract but for those of you who have seen it I think you'll get the gist .... 3:10 to Yuma has a lot of ""A Bronx Tale"" in it (or should I say vice versa since this is a remake). Either way, watch it."

","Russell Crow was born to play an outlaw. This is the best role I've seen him in since A Beautiful Mind, making up for a few clunkers, and despite his high profile recently for an apparent attempt to make the Australian Olympic free-style phone chucking team, I found him utterly compelling as Ben Wade, in this good Western remake. Or perhaps it's because of his high profile for being a bad boy, that he seems born to play this part. Either way, I loved the movie, I loved Russell Crowe in the movie, and I loved just about everyone else in it too! This was a blissful two hours in Santa Cruz' Del Mar Theater for me.<br/><br/>3.10 to Yuma is that very rare endangered species - a remake that actually works. It is very well cast, with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale squaring off as the Bad Boy and the Good Guy in a classic Western. I've been a sucker for Westerns since I was a little kid and watched Bonanza with string stirrups and reins festooned around a dining room chair. I was born 100 years too late and the wrong sex; I should have been a cowboy. <br/><br/>As in all the best Westerns, the plot is not overly complex and I'm not going to attempt cheap psychological analysis. This is a movie about the people, rather than the plot, so it allows the actors to get their teeth into their characters. Dan Evans (Christian Bale) volunteers to help escort prisoner Ben Wade to Yuma, to be put on the prison train which will take him to custody. Evans is a Civil War veteran, injured but surviving. He is running a small ranch with his supportive wife and two half grown sons, and fighting off the wicked railroad barons who want his land. Times are tough. He takes the escort job because he needs the money. His older son William gets in on the act too, turning it from a dangerous escort duty into a dangerous escort duty with parenting duty thrown in too, but it never descends too far into cliché. This is yet another great part for Christian Bale, who just goes from strength to strength. He is rapidly becoming one of my favorite actors. He squares off against Crowe's outlaw Ben Wade, an intelligent survivor who leads a gang of train robbers. The showdown in Yuma is a classic of almost High Noon proportions, and all concerned can feel satisfied that they have produced a Western to match any of the old greats. <br/><br/>The whole cast was good, but worth mentioning are Ben Foster, whom I found utterly chilling as Ben Wade's sidekick, Gretchen Mol as Mrs Evans and Logan Lerman, as William."

While one is better off following directors rather than actors, I find myself seeing every movie that Bale and Crowe star in, and I'm rarely disappointed. I won't bother summarizing the plot. The film has all of the necessary elements of a true Western: a dangerous and outwardly heartless gunslinger, a truly heartless land owner, and decent family man (protagonist) who's adherence to a strict and honorable moral code is constantly tested and often ridiculed in the harsh frontier. The movie takes these basic elements and peals them back. The actors are able to give the characters depth without becoming cliché. The action is well performed and well shot.

","I'm a fan of railroads and railroading. One thing that struck me when watching this movie was that the railroad tracks in the background, when Dan Evans was hauling Ben Wade from the hotel to the railroad station to catch the 3:10 to Yuma, roll up and down the hills. What the heck. Railroad engines were not made to go up and down hills like an automobile or bicycle or virtually any other conveyance. Railroad engines of any type, steam or diesel, are only capable of climbing gradual grades, and thus cuts were made in hills for trains to travel through or, in the case of some mountains, tunnels were created. To a railroader, those tracks going up and down the hills stretched the imagination and for me, virtually ruined the scenes in which they appeared because the goof distracted from the action. The movie producers should have paid better attention to detail for the sake of authenticity."

Bale stars as Dan Evans a civil war wounded vet who's behind on his ranch payments needing help and hope that comes in somewhat an unexpected form. As Crowe stars as Ben Wade a rugged outlaw who robs a stagecoach, is captured by small town enforcers, so then to earn money Evans promises the law and government he will help transport Wade to the Yuma court for trial and possible prison sentence.

"paulvancraeynest","2","1","5","23 August 2018"," Absurd plot. Big stars and nice photography
","All we can say is that this movie shows some nice landscape photography and that the cast is good.
But the plot is a disaster. It starts with a stagecoach, equipped with a gatling gun, being held up by some outlaws. One of the outlaws is such a sharpshooter that he can shoot the drivers of the moving coach from half a kilometre away. Then Russell Crowe, the chief outlaw shoots a Pinkerton man in the belly, while saying he has no intention of killing him. He then shoots one of his own men for being careless.
Christian Bale, a troubled farmer and civil war veteran shows up with his sons. The outlaws don't even think of shooting these witnesses but just borrow their horses.
The Russell Crowe, for some reason goes to town and has a chat with the farmer. He pays him for the inconvenience and for the cattle that somehow died. The Pinkerton man with the bullet in his guts is operated on, 19th century style, with no anaesthesia whatever. He doesn't mind, because it ""wasn't the first time he got shot"". Although the doctor says he lost a lit of blood (yes, he got shot in the guts and was carried for hours, bleeding), he gets on his horse to catch the bad guy right away. Blood loss is exaggerated. The Jehovah's witnesses will confirm that.
Instead of running away, like outlaws do, Russell Crowe has a chat with the barmaid, long enough for the sheriff to catch him.
The farmer is then promised $200 to help bring the outlaw to justice.
Why don't they shoot or hang him on the spot? He is a sadistic psychopath, his gang already did 22 hold ups and killed countless people in the process. Some guy actually proposes killing him there and then. But it turns out that the townspeople are afraid of the gang.
To prove this, the second in command of the outlaws threatens that the town is going to ""burn"", and to make himself clear, he shoots a few innocent citizens.
Why don't they free him at the same time?
Then they send a decoy stagecoach off, carrying a guy disguised as Russell Crowe (they change hats).
The outlaw gang is not fooled so easily. Outlaw enjoys a cozy dinner at the farmers home. He is the perfect guest, saying grace and chatting about the civil war. They even let this murderer alone for a chat with farmer's wife. Farmer's wife, notwithstanding the hardships of trying to make a living and raising a family in the Arizona desert, looks like a model.
Nobody notices him smuggling a fork in his shirt.
At night, outlaw sticks said fork in one of his captors throat, killing him.
No need to tie him up any better of course. He then overpowers the healed Pinkerton man, and disarms the whole posse,with his handcuffs still on. He throws Pinkerton in a ravine. The farmer's son arrives to save the day. 
It appears that the farmer lost his leg in the civil war but he doesn't even limp. With one he runs, jumps and rides.
The posse generously forgives outlaw for killing two of their men and head into Indian territory. The entrance is marked by 2 dead bodies.
At night, they set up camp and are attacked by the Indians. The Indians somehow miss their target. Russell Crowe, still handcuffed, crawls up behind the Indians and cuts their throats.
Then Russell Crowe escapes again, with the posses horses, and arrives at a railroad construction camp. Most workers are Chinese, wearing Chinese hats.
When he tries to convince a female Chinese blacksmith to undo his handcuffs, he is caught by the railroad men.
The posse arrives at the camp and find the outlaw being tortured (with electricity, these are state of the art thugs). They have to keep a straight face, claiming that the man that walked in the camp with their horses is actually supposed to be their prisoner. And that he should not be tortured. One of the railroad men's brother was killed by outlaw, so he prefers to kill him himself.
The clumsy posse then beats the whole railroad gang by beating a shovel and off they go again, with outlaw.
Eventually they arrive at the town where the train stops (3:10 to Yuma). Instead of keeping him at the station to wait for the train, they prefer to rent the bridal suite (I'm not making this up) in the local hotel. There they get help from the local marshall and his deputies.
In the meantime, the outlaw's cronies also arrive. They promise $200 to every citizen that kills of the marshall's men and free outlaw. The cityfolk happily comply.
The marshall turns out not to be so though after all, and they decide to surrender at once.
Outlaw is allowed to appear at the window to inform his gang about the escape plans.
The marshall and his men come out to surrender and get killed at once by the outlaws.
Then the farmers decide to take outlaw to the train. He has to run a gauntlet through town, with citizens and outlaws shooting at them. Farmer has one leg, but has no trouble running and jumping from roof to roof with his prisoner, shooting his assailants left and right. The second-in-command-outlaw is afraid the townsfolk might accidentally shoot his boss, so he shoots a few of them to make his point.
For some reason, outlaw follows the farmer all the way to the train station. The train is late.
Then for some reason, outlaw decides he prefers to take the train, to his trail and inevitable hanging, rather than running away to his gang.
When his second in command outlaw shoots farmer, outlaws kills him and his whole own gang. He then gets into the train and lets himselfes locked in a cage.
I gather that it is a movie, and that one can't expect the plot to be flawless (if all characters were doted with logic, the movie would be 2 hours shorter), but this....
Russell Crowe is a good actor, but not for the role of a remorseless killer."
"galensaysyes","4","1","5","21 April 2008"," The first movie, messed up
","The script of this movie is a revision of the script of an earlier movie, which was adapted from an Elmore Leonard story. The first movie devoted two-thirds of its time to the original story, with embellishments, and kept perhaps two-thirds of the major incidents. In the remake both proportions are closer to one-third, and the embellishments are considerably more extensive. For one thing, the reason for the deputy's working alone has changed. In the story and the first movie, the main body of the posse traveled by a different route, to fool the outlaw's gang. In this movie, he and the rest of the posse travel together, and the second act consists of the others' being killed off one by one, as in a revenge-stalker movie, until he's the only one left: this is not an improvement.<br/><br/>In the story, the deputy was an underpaid professional who hoped some day to make marshal. Both movies turn him into a rancher recruited out of need, but possessed of an ability rivaling that of a seasoned lawman. This makes the situation less plausible to begin with, but here he has a bad leg besides, and is still spry enough to engage in a chase-cum-gunfight rivaling the Hollywood version of the OK Corral. And further implausibilities are piled on top of these. He has a kid as a sidekick, who from a combination of motives--desire to prove himself, want of confidence in his father, and mixed disgust and admiration for the outlaw--has left home to tag along after them. Never mind that this character has ""movie"" stamped all over it; more remarkable is the screenwriter's failure to see that the big conflict in the boy, his mixture of feelings toward the outlaw, should have belonged to the father; the story should have centered on the relationship between the two men. This was inadequately developed in the first movie, which in this respect was basically a morality play, with the outlaw as tempter. The midsection of the remake, detailing the posse's ill-starred journey, would have been an opportunity to deepen the interplay of the two characters, but to all intents this remains unchanged, until a series of incredible sentimental twists at the end. <br/><br/>In addition, I didn't understand the rancher, as presented in Christian Bale's performance. This was executed in the actor's usual manner: that of a sepulchrally voiced catatonic who's fairly sinister himself. Russell Crowe also plays in a mannered style, but one suitable to the period, and is audaciously convincing until the script confounds him. Between the actors' mannerisms and those of the director, who's prone to shoot a scene any way but head on, the movie never attains the fill-your-hand-you-sonofabitch straightforwardness which a good Western requires.<br/><br/>Once the original story kicks in, and the characters are holed up at the hotel, the movie is on more solid ground. Then it goes off on a tangent. There is a marshal with deputies, and then the robber gang, and then an announcement by the gang's lieutenant offering bounties on the lawmen, and then the townsfolk getting all het-up and running off to grab their guns. Instead of shooting the lieutenant to shut him up, the marshal listens respectfully, then shakes his head and says, it's no use, boys, we've got to surrender our weapons. This they do, whereupon they're immediately shot dead. One would suppose that the gang might think twice about this, since it robs the townsfolk of three-quarters of their promised bounties; one would also suppose that the gang would have thought twice about urging the townsfolk to arm themselves, since a few civic-minded ones, acting in concert, could take out the gang. <br/><br/>The movie's reason for giving all those people all those guns becomes clear when the rancher begins his walk to the depot. It's so the movie can turn into a video game, with cowboys instead of zombies. Again, if several of the shooters worked in unison, the rancher would be dead immediately. But--here's the first big twist--the outlaw has come to like him so much he _helps_ him kill the townsfolk (i.e. helps himself toward prison). And then--here's another twist--the gang who initially egged on the citizens now start killing them, for shooting at the prisoner and the deputy indiscriminately. One would suppose that once they were being fired on, the townsfolk might start firing back. But no, so they all die, and so the rancher gets his man to the depot. <br/><br/>And now guess what? The train is late! This sets up the joke that trains never run on time, but kills off the suspense generated theretofore, and the title of the movie. Suppose that in High Noon the killers decided to come later?--noon, one, two, what's it matter? <br/><br/>There follows a gunfight. The rancher's kid unpens a cattle herd; the outlaw lieutenant falls under their hooves--that's what it looks like--but later pops up, unhurt, for the final showdown. He shoots the rancher dead, almost, but with enough life left in him for a tearful farewell to his son. On hearing this his prisoner is so moved that--last and best twist of all--he turns on his gang and shoots them all dead! And then sees himself onto the train so the rancher can share a last Little House moment with his boy: ""Did I do it, boy?"" ""You did it, Paw."" etc. So the rancher dies happy--not knowing, as we do, that the prisoner's horse, just like Tom Mix's Tony, is galloping alongside the train, in position for his owner to make a flying mount and escape. (And what will he do then? Form another gang and kill them, too?)<br/><br/>The old movie started with a title song, sung by Frankie Laine; this one would have been improved by having Russell Crowe sing it in duet with his horse as they trotted off into the sunset together. I think it would have been in keeping."

Throughout the remainder of the movie he is left to kill at will-which he does and he escapes but returns, after killing some dumb Indians. Besides the dumbest posse you have ever seen, we also have the dumbest and worst shooting outlaw gang in the west. How did they get this far? I could go on but it makes me sick to think about how bad this movie is. Go rent any old B-western and your time will be better spent."

","This film doesn't deserve the hype. The promotional materials compared it to ""Unforgiven."" That it fell short of that high standard is certainly understandable and doesn't diminish the film. But in comparing this film to Eastwood's, the studio sets the viewer up for a similarly thoughtful, anti-romantic experience. Which is to say, it sets the viewer up for disappointment. ""Unforgiven"" detonates the many myths of the western, while ""3:10"" incorporates almost every one. It's also contains many unbelievable moments.<br/><br/>There is a ruthless villain who has killed hundreds of men to take money and escape the law. Yet, after committing a brutal murder, he inexplicably leaves alive a few witnesses to make life difficult for himself. He's very clever and resourceful, but he fairly walks into custody. Thereafter, he attempts escape but also helps his captors. His gang can shoot anything that moves, except when the plot demands otherwise. His captors are inept and cowardly. The good guy is similarly iconic--a simple but moral everyman, misunderstood, resented, and surrounded by corruption. There are instant recoveries from gunshots and beatings. There's dynamite and a Gatling gun. And you can pretty much guess who's going to die in what order. The ending attempts some bogus moral statement and comes off as completely unbelievable.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen ""3:10 to Yuma,"" forget ""Unforgiven"" and any presumption of believability--you might have a chance of enjoying it."

","Possibly the stupidest western I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them. A great cast with good acting all around and realistic costumes and set, can't save this film from a ridiculously unbelievable plot. If you want to make an unlikely hero, at least make him likable. Not a suffering loser who does what is supposed to be construed as a heroic act but is in fact a suicide leaving his family to fend for its self. And if the villein is true to his character through 9/10's of the movie, you had better give him a better reason to change character than to respond to a two line lame explanation by the ""hero"".

The two most outstanding actors throughout the film were Russell Crowe and Ben Foster. My reasons are, that they both firstly were the best choice for the two roles they portray and their acting is inconceivably fantastic. The action is very realistic and brutal. It's also nice to see a descent western brought to the big screen and pulling of in such great flair. It does not dwell on any previous westerns instead 3:10 To Yuma is fresh from the fridge.<br/><br/>The music add's a lot of context and layers the overall film with a thumping soundtrack, that reminds me of the The Good the Bad and the Ugly.

","While the performances are good, I found this remake to be a disappointing, mean spirited western, and not the old fashioned western I thought it was going to be. The over the top violence just ruined it for me. For my money the Van Heflin Glen Ford original is miles ahead, and a character driven western, that doesn't dwell on mean spiritedness. Best performance comes from the only classy actor in the movie, Peter Fonda, who wasn't given enough to do. In my opinion, stay away from this and rent or purchase (you won't be disappointed) the original.

People don't act like people and it very early becomes clear that this is the Russel Crowe show and we are supposed to see how awesome and cool he is and everyone around him with the possible exception of batman are incompetent.<br/><br/>The setting is cool and the idea that a group of men need to transport a dangerous criminal to a train station is a nice idea but you can only see the guards turn their back towards him so many time until you stop taking it seriously.<br/><br/>The movie is really pushing the crowe/batman duo and the whole thing makes no sense to me. In the final action scenes i was completely confused on the characters motivation and why characters were doing what they were doing.<br/><br/>All in all the messy script ruins the movie, sure it looks nice and the actors did a nice job and if it was a dumb action movie with a run time of 1.5 hours then that would be fine.

There was nothing in this movie that stood out to make it something special only basic stuff which we've all seen, all the gunfights at least one person died on the goodies team which was a failed attempt to make them look realistic, Bale had a long range sawn-off shotgun which could kill someone from about 30 metres, Crows character Ben wade had a personality change, one minute he's a ruthless killer the next he's a nice guy who helps Bale do his job, the ending was not what you expected in a bad way and cause's Crows character to have a even bigger personality change.<br/><br/>Over all 3:10 to Yuma was a disappointment which did a good job of getting me excited over nothing, in fact the characters were so stupid at times it almost makes you think ""why the hell is he doing that its such a simple thing to get out of a building thats surrounded by men, why don't you just kill them with the long range sawn-off shotgun like a classic western would do"".<br/><br/>i give 3:10 to Yuma 4 out of 10 its better to watch a 50's,60's western."

","If you're looking for a western on the same lofty level as Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"", HBO's ""Deadwood"", or even the original ""3:10 To Yuma"", this remake ain't it.<br/><br/>While Christian Bale and Russell Crowe give strong performances, everything else about this film rates a ""C"" at best. The quality of the cinematography is uneven throughout the film, looking more like a series of dailies than finished product. While some films purposely strive for a dated look, ""Saving Private Ryan"" being one example, ""3:10 To Yuma"" just looks sloppy. Wash-out in one scene, uncontrolled glare in the next. It simply looks cheaply done.<br/><br/>The dialogue, storyline and edits aren't much better than the cinematography. Scenes that should be longer are truncated, while other scenes just run on and on, with no apparent rhyme or reason. Somewhere in the 120 minutes of mish-mash, there's a reasonably good film, crying out for an editor who understands dramatic timing.<br/><br/>The storyline and dialogue seem more suited to a shoot-em-up video game than a serious film. As the body count grows, there are practically no realistic reactions from any of the characters, good or bad. Just another dead guy ... 30 points ... ""ding!"" All that being said; ... if you like westerns, see this film. At best, you may enjoy it. At worst, you'll have the mid-range of the graph that this film represents as a reference point with which to judge the truly great westerns."
"Lord_Crypto","10","1","6","15 September 2007"," Obviously one of the best westerns ever made
","Even the biggest critic could realize the potential this film has. The only thing you have to do is look at the cast. Christian Bale, Russel Crowe, Ben Foster, Alan Tudyk, Peter Fonda: a better cast could not be asked for. Although you can assume the film will be good based on the cast, you should expect 3:10 to Yuma to be a good movie which it is. 3:10 to Yuma is probably the best modern day western film.<br/><br/>The cast delivers in this film. Christian Bale has a good performance as a good hearted rancher named Dan Evans. Russell Crowe delivers a terrific performance as Ben Waid, a dangerous and disturbed character. His character is an absolutely unstable and deceitful criminal. His character is just as dangerous psychotically as his character is physically aggressive. The best performance comes from Waid's right hand man, Ben Foster! Foster's character is just as dangerous a criminal as Crowe's character if not even more dangerous. Foster captures the anger and ferocity of his character in such a beautiful performance which makes his character dangerously scary. Peter Fonda who plays a bounty hunter and Logan Lerman who plays Bale's son, Will Evans, deliver two great performances as well. The casting of this movie was chosen perfectly and the performances were delivered just as well.<br/><br/>The story of the film is perfect. It is a very gripping story and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was expecting more from the film in terms of gunfights but the film delivered in showing a brutal, violent, and vulgar West. The film took not only an approach of showing how violent criminals were back in the Old West but also showing how vulgar they were and just how mentally unstable they were. I absolutely loved the film for that. One of the central themes surrounding this film is morals. You will see this theme continually evolve more and more throughout the film. The ending is more than what I expected!! I did not expect the movie to end the way it did and put it simply, ""The $hit hits the fan!""<br/><br/>The music of the film is terrific. It fits the tone of the film perfectly and adds to the tension of the film. The film is shot beautifully with what seems like little reliance of special effects which makes the film fantastic.<br/><br/>I know this film is a remake and I have never seen the original! But I can say this movie is absolutely fantastic. 3:10 to Yuma is a must see film whose brilliant acting is the pinnacle of the film. Westerns don't come around very often anymore and when they do, they come out in the form of 3:10 to Yuma; A True Masterpiece!"

If someone merely told you the story you would not believe them. Russell Crowe and Christian Bales went beyond their normal good acting to move into an even higher category. All of the supporting actors were right on task in each scene. The exterior scenes shot in New Mexico were spectacular and were on the same par as John Ford films of the past.

","From a Christian viewpoint, Crowe & Bale do not offer any Faith-based acting values, or three-dimensional spiritual character portrayals. Crowe hasn't performed in a half-decent role, reflecting conflicting moral values since 'LA Confidential.' 'Gladiator' was a pseudo-moral conflict from the very beginning scene. As to Bale, his recent arrest for domestic abuse against his mother and sister, and his on-set rant against a Lighting Grip on ""Terminator: Salvation"" speak volumes about how misguided he is not just as a professional actor, but as a human being (God-fearing or not). In my humble opinion, Crowe and Bales are H'wood stars whose acting choices are driven by very bankable massive egos, self-idolatry & the mortal temptation to serve fame. They've cut their deals w/ the Devil and it reflects in their disappointing acting choices. I pray they repent, accept Jesus, and choose roles that seek rewards not handed out by the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences.<br/><br/>That aside, this is a passable remake. The screenplay writing, location selections, production design, supporting roles, and direction work. It's just that Crowe's 'I'm playing yet-another-variation of my everyone's-seen-it, bad-tempered, tantrum-throwing self' (thank God this film didn't have a scene in a hotel w/ his character wanting to place an overseas telephone call), and Bale's 'I'm due on the Batman set soon blank stares' ruin the entire effort put forth by the film's commendable production team. It's two hours hours of watching vain egos at combat with one another. There's no performances from either Crowe or Bale. The ending shot of the train with the landscape beyond it is visual magic and the director of photography deserves favorable mention."

","If you liked the original Glenn Ford/Van Heflin starrer, there is much to relish in this remake. This is not sloppy story telling (see the Hitcher remake for that).

But the film for me is not completely satisfying. With character developments and revelations that strike me as being intended to reflect the complexities of today, the makers strive for ambiguity and achieve it, much to my disappointment. To me, westerns, even those that are deeply layered, have a certain simplicity, elegance and an unwavering moral compass. I offer UNFORGIVEN, OPEN RANGE, VERACRUZ and RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as examples. This one, however, does not fall in that category. But it comes close..."

","3:10 to Yuma is an example of a good film (the 1957 version) being remade into an even more memorable one. Directed by the ever consistent James Mangold, it is a suspenseful, beautifully paced western, with a great cast creating many memorable characters. The changes made to the original film, based on an Elmore Leonard short story, only enhance the storyline and give it greater relevance in the 21st century.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is outstanding as the highly intelligent, but deadly, outlaw gang leader Ben Wade imbuing him with a degree of sympathy viewers can't ignore. Christian Bale never overplays his up against it, Civil War veteran Dan Evans and he especially shines in his third act interplaying with Crowe, where his character's courage and quiet dignity are fully revealed. But it's not just the leads that stand out. Ben Foster's creates an arresting psychopathic, but loyal, Charlie Prince, who's Wade's second in command. And it's a pleasure to see Peter Fonda filling a significant supporting role, as Byron McElroy, an elderly Pinkerton agent hired by the Railroad company to hunt Wade and Alan Tudyk turning up, as a dubiously qualified medico, with an adventurous streak.<br/><br/>In a storyline that doesn't feature a huge number of female characters, Gretchen Mol's scenes as Dan's wife, Alice, are both realistic and affecting and I loved her dinner interlude with Ben Wade, as he attempts to both charm her, whilst hopefully making preparations, for a possible future escape. Logan Lerman does just about the impossible, in what is a far more beefed up role from the original film. He turns Dan's (at first) brattish, impressionable, teenage son William, into a young man who we see has come of age by the film's exciting climax, which again has been very smartly tweaked, from the earlier version.<br/><br/>The action scenes are really well choreographed and the cinematography from Greek professional, Phedon Papamichael, is never less than impressive. By story's end, it's abundantly clear that James Mangold's exceedingly well-made remake isn't as simply expressed as its predecessor, but more layered with elements of morality to consider for our modern sensibilities.<br/><br/>Catch the 3:10 before it leaves the station."

A western was luckier. A bad guy, sometimes illustrated by gunfights, and a sheriff in white hat ... a film maker's dream compared to the other movie genres.

Nice guy, but where are the acting chops? They are there only in westerns -- where everything is over-the-top dramatic due to death being around the corner (something not true of the real ""old west"" of the 1870s onward). The Old West is another Hollywood invention, devised again to sell movies. In this genre, they played it safe. Nothing ventured, but a lot to gain, so why not ... ? So many great musicals could have been done, so many comedies and dramas produced, but the money went toward the safe venue...the western. As much of a cartoon as Bugs Bunny ever was.

","In this 2007 Lionsgate production, directed by James Mangold, Russell Crowe and Christian Bale showed forth excellent acting abilities in this tense ""High Noon""-type western. Russell Crowe plays the outlaw Ben Wade, a man so heartless that he does not care if even one of his own gang members is killed in front of him. Christian Bale plays the poor, mistreated farmer Dan Evans who must go after Wade and put him on the train the 3:10 to Yuma, since he needs the money so very much. Gretchen Mol is very appealing as she plays Dan Evans' wife. Ben Foster plays the mean, ugly cohort of Wade, and is was hard not to hate him. Although Dan Evans is a Christian man, he doesn't think twice about asking for the money that's coming to him, nor does he think twice about being brutal toward Wade. While, in the movie, it is a long distance to where Evans must put Wade on the train, the movie is not a bit boring, but is tense and exciting. Again, both Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are very convincing. The action is exciting all the way, and the color is beautiful in its own way.

This isn't a bad movie by any stretch but it just wasn't my type of movie. The movie takes place in late 1800's in the western United States. I don't like western movies with horses and lots of shootouts so this isn't a movie that i am eager to watch again. Bale, in particular seemed out of place in this film. Russell Crowe played the lead antagonist well but I never felt like it was a classic performance such as Gladiator or Beautiful Mind. I had no idea that this was a re-make so I couldn't make any comparisons to the original.<br/><br/>7/10 Not bad. I was able to make it through the whole movie but westerns are not my favorite. There was some tense moments that i enjoyed and the movie has a great cinematic feel to it."

","I saw the original 1957 Glenn Ford/Van Heflin version a few years ago, and I remembered the two leading actors of this remake, I was interested to see how it would compare, directed by James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted; Walk the Line, Knight and Day, The Wolverine). Basically in August 1884, rancher, Civil War veteran and broken man Dan Evans (Christian Bale) rides into the town of Brisbee, where he owes powerful man Glen Hollander (Lennie Loftin) a large amount of money for the purchase of his land, while there he witnesses a stagecoach robbery led by famed outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). Following this heist the criminal is captured, for a fee of $200 Evans agrees with coach owner Grayson Butterfield (Dallas Buyers Club's Dallas Roberts) to escort Wade to the town of Contention to be delivered to the authorities, there he will board the 3:10 train to Yuma to be transported to his trial, Evans does this to save his land, but also to prove himself as more than a naive rancher to his impulsive gunslinging adolescent son William Evans (Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief's Logan Lerman). Also enlisted in the posse are Byron McElroy (Peter Fonda), Doc Potter (A Knight's Tale's Alan Tudyk) and Tucker (Kevin Durand), and during the journey they are attacked by Apaches, members of the posse are killed for their treachery, and throughout they are followed by Wade's criminal gang, with new leader Charlie Prince (The Mechanic's Ben Foster), who are trying to rescue their boss, but also Evans finds himself getting closer as a friend to Wade, and of course the father and son connection is improving. In the end the father, his son and the outlaw do make it on time for the arrival for the 3:10 to Yuma, but the gang catch up to them, the villains are defeated, but Evans is mortally wounded and dies in his sons arms, feeling remorseful Wade decides to freely hand himself in to the authorities and board the train, following a trial he will most likely face execution. Also starring Gretchen Mol as Alice Evans, Vinessa Shaw as Emma Nelson and Luke Wilson as Zeke. Bale gives a good performance as the understated but hard rancher, and Crowe is also good as the dark sided man with some morals, I admit I was not engaged with absolutely all the conversations and more focused in the guns blazing, showdown and chase sequences, significantly different to the original, but a worthwhile western. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Marco Beltrami and Best Sound Mixing. Good!"

","Having Russel Crowe as bad guy and Christian Bale as good guy and putting them in single frame almost whole of the running time does raise your expectations for a western crime thriller but this one leaves you underwhelmed because of few unconvincing twists in the story. Plot is simple, broke Christian Bale gets the paid job of delivering criminal Russel Crowe to a prison train to Yuma while Russel's wild friends are after them . Whole plot revolves around how they influence each other throughout the journey. Tight direction, confident performances, stylish western atmosphere makes for a cinematic treat until in the last half an hour, the change of hearts become unconvincing and director look confused how he should end all this chaos. So low down your expectations and you can enjoy big actors in a compelling crime drama."
"jbirks106","8","0","1","12 October 2013"," Solid Western morality tale
","""Unforgiven"" it ain't, but ""3:10 to Yuma"" is as close to a modern Western classic as we've seen since. Crowe and Bale are completely convincing in their roles of rogue outlaw and the man who's determined to bring him in. Crowe gives great depth to the Ben Wade character, though his actions in the last half-hour are a bit of a stretch. Bale, likewise, captures the haunted, desperate Dan Evans brilliantly.<br/><br/>The audio commentary by director James Mangold is quite good. Director commentaries are a mixed bag -- many times the commentary is either bogged down in minutiae or lacking in objectivity -- but Mangold acknowledges his debt to the earlier film (50 years old at that point) and in general provides interesting details about the shooting process."

"dume-officialinbox","8","0","1","21 October 2012"," A great movie, even for western ""haters""
","I hate westerns, but this movie got me involved from the very beginning. It's amazing the way it catches you. This movie it's great, because is not a typical type of western, with all the clichés and obvious turns, is because some modern themes were included indirectly into the old west also by the camera angles and shots you have the feeling of being with the characters, not to mention the wonderful performance by those amazing actors that leave you speechless until the very end.<br/><br/>Starts with the mood of the west, you see this poor place with so little population in a desert- like ambient. By the close- ups in the characters natural facial expressions with no talk actually it makes your mind construct that emotion transmitted so that you may have some empathy with the characters. Example, in the scene that we see Dan Evans with his son William in the hotel room, telling his son that he will see that his father will be the only man that takes Ben Wade to the train when nobody could, in other words, that his father will become a hero. In this particular scene we can also see Ben Wade sitting in the background, the camera focus in his facial expressions and by his face we can clearly notice that his respect for Dan Evans grows bold because there he sees a father that wants to give his son a good example not longer a man in search for money. This one reason alone make this movie be really good, because it has the capacity of transport the feeling of the scene and characters into your own subconscious mind.<br/><br/>Dan Evans is a poor farmer who lost one of his feet in war, now he have a family of two boys and his wife, his economical situation is very low so that he's very near to lose his house. One day, he sees face to face Ben Wade, the most wanted criminal at the time. He volunteer to be one of the men taking Ben Wade to the train station by the time of 3:10 to Yuma which is a prison waiting to hang him, for this journey he will be paid $200, the money he needs to pay off his deeds.<br/><br/>As the story develops, we see the long journey and all the events they passed. His son William secretly followed them to help his dad, Ben Wade started to kill some of the men, and his most confidant fellow Charlie Prince organizes the gang to get him back. All of this plus conflicting emotions, changes of thoughts and even change of plan. They began the journey all against Ben Wade, those all want him dead at Yuma but they are also afraid of his hidden intentions through the way. There's a character approach between William Evans and Ben Wade, in some scenes we can see how these characters get along with each other, not to mention that William was the only one to not fear Ben Wade, he even thought that Ben wasn't such a bad and cruel person like he portrayed, and have the guts to tell it to Ben. We can see some approaches of Ben Wade and Dan Evans a example of a scene is when Ben and Dan are near the train, there is seen Dan telling to Ben why he is not stubborn, and when they finished the small talk they smiled to each other, as if each other understood the point. The scene when he proposed Dan $1,000 in cash for let him escape, Dan refused, and there we see how Ben realizes that Evans is not like everyone else. So that in the last scene, when he saw Dan Evans dead, he got out his gun and killed all his gang, when he was about to kill Charlie Prince, his most intimate fellow, he looked him into the eyes and we see Charlie's expression as a ""I came here to get you back, I stayed loyal, why you do this to me"", and then we see Ben Wade's expression as a ""There was no need to kill this man, you deeply disappointed me"", in my opinion, a great scene that shows a fantastic example of how to let people understand without any words.<br/><br/>3:10 to Yuma is a movie based on Elmore Leonard's story and is better, it even explains a lot more from the characters. It's a western composed by action, crime and drama with good dialog lines, for example when Dan Evans tells his wife ""If I don't go, we gotta pack up and leave. Now I'm tired, Alice. I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry. I'm tired of the way they look at me, I'm tired of the way that you don't"". This movie is worth to watch, there we see the sacrifices a person is willing to do to obtain their goals, also the economic crisis which we all live day by day, there's also the message of a father showing his boy an example of how to be a great man, how the raising of a kid can affect in his adulthood. It leaves an open ending, in which you can think that Ben Wade will escape again to keep being a criminal, or to escape and live a different life (because he killed all his gang like if he don't want to know anything else from them). Very enjoyable movie, suspense filled with action. I highly recommend this movie, even if you hate western, when you watch this film it will blow your mind away and probably will be the only western film that you can call your favorites of all times, like me, or to open your mind to a different movie genre, the westerns, and watch more films to enhance or enrich your point of view and enjoy your entertainment interest."
"CinefanR","10","0","2","12 July 2012"," It works... as a comedy
","If you're in a mood for high camp, ""3:10 to Yuma"" is sheer entertainment. It never gets boring, thanks to its two leads, who are cheerfully chewing the scenery.<br/><br/>Outrageous plot holes make for an endless source of humor, the unintentional type. Funny details like why Wade isn't handcuffed properly with his hands behind or how is it possible that his face looks intact after a severe beating, will keep you wondering what brand of entertainment this is.<br/><br/>With a gunshot wound to the stomach, Fonda's character shouldn't even be alive, let alone travel and talk back. Dan gets to jump off roofs despite his handicap, the most dangerous mass murderer is allowed to sit next to Dan's children at the dinner table Not to mention something that all viewers must have wondered: why don't they just kill Wade? Why are they willing to risk their own lives to save a murderer from torture? ""You can't do that. It's immoral"". Wow, this is a masterpiece of the unintentionally hilarious. Are these people politically correct police officers transported with a time machine back in the Wild West? Such blatant disregard for plausibility makes you wonder about the filmmaker's intent.<br/><br/>The conclusion is tragi-comical and mind-blowing, for sure. Characters are elusive and inconsistent; we never really know what's driving Wade, and why Dan is ultimately drawn to him. The perplexing punchline, dripping with ""moral ambiguity"" had me laughing out loud. The soundtrack made it epic. I almost felt sorry for poor Charlie Prince."

","'3:10 to Yuma' was fantastic, I think the actors fitted their roles perfectly, the story was epic, the characters were great. It's good to see a modern Western film that doesn't suck. The story is about a Union civil war veteran who is desperate for money and takes on the task with a few law men to escort the leader of a gang called ""Ben Wade"" to a train at 3:10 to Yuma station that will take him to a prison. But all is not what it seems..<br/><br/>Personally my favourite character is ""Charlie Prince"", who is portrayed by actor Ben Foster, he is a reckless Confederate veteran who is in ""Ben Wade""'s gang. I hope more epic Western action movies like this are made soon.<br/><br/>I recommend you watch this film if you enjoy Westerns'."

","I watched this movie on the suggestion of a friend before reading the vile and vitriol filled comments about it here on IMDb. And boy , did I like it. It was an amazing movie to say the least. Completely actioned packed and amazingly emotional. More than you can ask from a western.<br/><br/>In fact I think this is the best western I've ever seen, and I rate it ahead of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Unforgiven. Don't get me wrong... the above two movies were beautiful. but the former one was a bit too long for my taste and I couldn't connect to the characters in it as much as I did here while the later didn't have much action to make it a real classic. While 3:10 to Yuma has all the ingredients to make it a classic. The haters mainly contend that this movie has too many corny and unbelievable elements. Well, yeah, you might die after taking that first gunshot in real life, but in movies there's always that chance that you survive and live to walk the next day. That's what makes it a movie. I mean, Isn't the number one ranked movie Shawshank redemption (also one of my favourites) based on impossible events too?. So are almost all other movies. So haters, get real, we're talking about movies here. Also many of the points they address are pretty lame, but I am not going to speak of it here, as I want to keep this review, spoiler free.<br/><br/>Movies are made to be enjoyed not to reflect real life. If you want that, then go and watch some documentaries for heaven's sake. Also I think as much as this movie is concerned, because of the initial pre and post release hype it was getting, some people just have taken it as a personal crusade to bad-mouth this movie and are waging a personal vendetta against it. Maybe this movie is just too good for them. So, please don't let the haters spoil this movie for you. This movie succeeds in every level that a movie should succeed in: acting although not brilliant is certainly not slacky and is praise worthy (although Russel Crowe didn't reach gladiator level's of perfection in my eye, Christian Bale, Logan Lerman and Ben Foster where more than amazing), the action sequences were incredible throughout and the imagery was excellent, overall the direction was pretty good, but more than anything I felt this movie was able to connect with me, the audience. And despite what the naysayers tell, I absolutely loved the ending. I thought it was what the movie deserved, as it shows that we can all be heroes, no matter what. <br/><br/>So, all said and done, go and watch it. This might indeed be the best western you will ever see."
"rshs2012","9","0","1","15 March 2011"," Western Railroad Portrayal
","I have seen the film only once, so I may have missed something, but at first glance the railroad scenes look good. The locomotive used in the film is a ""Mogul"" type, with wheel arrangement 2-6-0. This type was produced from 1864-1910, so it's a realistic choice for the period of the story, 1884, and Moguls were used by the Southern Pacific Railway. The train appears to be mixed passenger and freight, not uncommon in the American West at that time. The train has a wooden ""caboose"" on the end, which were in use on SP freight trains after 1875. And yes, the SP line did, and still does, run to Yuma, though now SP is part of Union Pacific. The terrain in the film does not resemble Bisbee, Arizona, which is rather hilly, but could pass for Douglas, Arizona. Further scrutiny of the film could reveal other technical problems, but at first glance, it's a good representation of an 1884 train."

","This is a western that a lot of the younger generation can really sink their teeth into. It's a very well crafted western and I really enjoyed watching this from beginning to end. Now I haven't seen the original yet, but I can tell by just watching this that this is remake done right hands down. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe was perfect for these roles, especially Russell Crowe who plays the charismatic and yet complicated badass leader in crime. His performance was engrossing and very entertaining to watch. I found the trailer to be pretty good, but this is one of those movies that offers way more enjoyment than what is in the trailer. Yeah few aspects of the movie might not make sense, but it's not irritating at all. Ben Foster who plays Ben Wade's loyal but psychopathic sidekick did a performance that stood out a lot as well. The few final scenes was just awesome to watch, and if your a western fan most definitely check this film out. If your not a western fan, watch it anyways.<br/><br/>8.2/10"
"ferguson-6","8","0","1","26 October 2010"," They Were Shooting Bullets
","Greetings again from the darkness. (Sept 3, 2007) Remakes always cause me to pause, especially when they are of films I enjoyed ... such as the 1957 ""3:10 to Yuma"", which was probably Glenn Ford's best screen performance. Still, having only seen the preview twice (remarkable in this day), I was instantaneously curious to see Batman and Gladiator in the lead roles!! This is a fantastic traditional western film with good guys and bad guys and muddled minds, when the time comes to decide what is morally right and what might actually be an easy way out. As we have seen in ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""High Noon"", choosing the easy way out is rarely heroic and certainly doesn't create the high intensity story line played out in ""3:10 to Yuma"". The old west is the perfect playground for writers who enjoy showing the complexity involved in manhood, especially when fatherhood is involved.<br/><br/>The two leads are exceptional. Russell Crowe exudes badness and coolness and brilliance as the legendary outlaw, Ben Wade. Watching his psychological games with his captors is creepy, yet humorous and at times, downright frightening. Good guy Christian Bale captures the desperation of a man continually wronged by his country, politicians, and even his God. He struggles to maintain his character for his sons and wife, but this is no ordinary man. He is possessed by character.<br/><br/>Supporting standouts include Ben Foster as Crowe's right-hand man, Charlie Prince. Think Michael Biehn in ""Tombstone"". Foster is a scary guy, but also has a couple of the film's funniest lines. Gretchen Mol plays Bale's wife, and though she is given little to do, I must ask again ... ""Why doesn't this woman work more often?"". She is excellent in every role she takes, but she needs more screen time. If you doubt Ms. Mol's talent, please see ""The Notorious Bettie Page"". Also of note is Alan Tudyk who plays Doc. Tudyk gives another fine performance on the heels of his zany role in the excellent ""Death at a Funeral"". Also, I would be remiss to not mention Peter Fonda's all too brief role as the bounty hunter. Fonda spews his lines at the camera.<br/><br/>What makes this updated version slightly better than the original is the gritty, dusty approach taken by up (""Walk the Line"") and down (""Kate and Leopold"") director James Mangold. We FEEL the gunshots, stampedes, chase scenes and dirt in the wounds. This realism helps build the tension of the final few minutes. Also, a tip of the hat to Mangold for not beating us over the head with shots of watches and clocks. There are enough for effect, but no so many as to ruin the moment.<br/><br/>This is a must see and probably one of the best of the year. Can't often say that about August/September releases, but I assume it was released so as to not conflict with the upcoming Crowe/Denzel Washington film. Regardless, this is a film to see."

","A bad outlaw is caught and his captors must get him on a train leaving at 3:10 to Yuma prison, but it's not easy with his band of outlaws trying to rescue him, not to mention Apaches and other setbacks.<br/><br/>Westerns were great back decades ago in America and then they just got wore out, Spaghetti westerns then came to be the popular thing and they were just absolutely amazing movies to watch, they brought so much to the big screen and made nobodies superstars and made violence popular in cowboy films. The American westerns suffered and few decent ones have came out in my opinion in 30 years. The Unforgiven, Purgatory, Young Guns to name a few and then there was this movie, but it's a remake so I can't give it as much credit as I'd like to.<br/><br/>An American western with an English actor as the hero and an Australian actor as the bad guy seems like a bad casting call to me, but it turns out it could've been worse. Christian Bale is a little too intense in all of his films and I think he has did some amazing films like American Psycho and The Machinist, but when he does action he goes a little over the top with it and I don't like him in these kind of roles. If I had to pick the worst actor on Earth it would be Russell Crowe, I hate him and usually will not watch a film he is in, but he surprised me by doing a great job in this film.<br/><br/>Logan Lerman played Bales son in this film and although he is a Beverly Hills, California boy he did really great as a kid in a western, he looked and acted the part. I would have to give the best acting nod to Ben Foster on this one, he was superb. He has played many types of roles and this movie and his next movie after this one, 30 Days Of Night really showed he can do a bad guy really well.<br/><br/>I wont talk about the comparisons with the original 3:10 to Yuma here, cause I think it has been one of those movies that have been forgotten by most people, and had never been heard of by the rest, so a remake was a fine idea. I will say the direction in this movie was so-so, I would've liked to have seen more excitement and just to have been taken away by the direction, but it was dull and basic. My other huge complaint is music, To me the single greatest thing that makes a western flow and makes the action jump off the screen is the score.....none of that here, I don't even recall hearing any music other than a cheap wanna-be Ennio Morricone ending credit tune.<br/><br/>This is my second time watching it and it lost its feel big time the second time around, my vote might've been a higher number the first time I watched it. If you like westerns and have seen all the classics, you need to watch this. If you don't like westerns at all, but like action or perhaps even drama you might give this one a chance."
"FightingWesterner","8","0","1","1 January 2010"," Mostly Enjoyable Remake, A Few Flaws
","While the original 1957 version of 3:10 To Yuma was a suspense western with qualities, this is more of a straight out action picture, albeit with some psychological depth, with both the story and the main characters a bit more elaborate this time around.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are perhaps the only modern A-list actors I really enjoy watching and it's great to see them in the same movie. Both give great three-dimensional performances that add a lot of nuance to their characters. Peter Fonda was interesting too.<br/><br/>However, the part where this goes off the rails (so to speak) is the climax where Bale and Crowe face the gang to catch the train. The whole movie Crowe is viciously homicidal and dead set against getting on the train. Suddenly, he appears to turn good and seems a bit too eager to walk himself to the gallows.<br/><br/>If you watch the 1957 version, it's a bit incredible too. However, Glenn Ford does make the entire walk under the barrel of a shotgun and really doesn't do Van Heflin any favors.<br/><br/>Couple that with the death of Bale and the result is a fairly unsatisfying ending, that is unless you're one of those post-modern nihilists that think the death of the hero always makes an ending better!"

I am thinking the positive reviewers both on line and in the news papers only saw the first half of the moviewhich was good. But the second half of the movie was terrible.<br/><br/>Caution this review contains some spoilers.but you may thank me for them.<br/><br/>The movie starts off very good. Bale's character is set up nicely as a father who is trying yet failing in vain to provide for his family. The setup for the first wagon chase scene is good and the shooting (both camera and bulletsha ha) are brilliant.<br/><br/>I am happy to see that Peter Fonda's character survives this scene because his character one of the few bright spots of the movie. He plays a tough, worn and battle tested bounty hunter / coach transporter / tough guy.<br/><br/>But soon after Crowe's character is captured the story goes south in a hurry. Now do not get me wrong I do not expect script and story line perfection but this movie had holes so big you could drive a stagecoach through them.<br/><br/>First of all no experienced tough guy would handcuff a guy with his hands in the frontduh you handcuff them in the back. This ends in the death of the most colorful character in the movie. Then after that nobody bothers to tie up the bad guy during the night timewhich ends in the death of another guy? Then the bad guy kicks one of the good guys in the headand none of the other 3 armed good guys bother to stop the bad guy? All during this time the Bad guys gang makes up 80 miles and ends up being only minutes behind themhuh does anyone remember that horses do not move that fast for that long? But the ending takes the cake, in some attempt to not end in typical western format (so many have been done that there are very few new endings) they have the bad guy help the good guy so he's not shot by the bad guys gang, because the bad guy all of a sudden develops a feel good conscious for the guy who is trying to send him to prison and be hung? What. To reduce the payoff even more neither the good guy (or the good guys son) gets to kill any of the bad guys gang which truly deserve it, no instead they are killed by the guy they are trying to help escapewhat the  kind of ending is that? Ohh I was not the only one disappointedthere were other people shouting out ""ohh mans"" and ""what kind of ending is that"" You are better off renting one of the old Sergio Leone's movies or Eastwood flicks than burning money on this movie."
"Terrell-4","8","0","1","10 August 2009"," 1957: Great story and fine craftsmanship. 2007: Thirty minutes of angst are added and the story suffers
","My take on 2007's 3:10 to Yuma? Ninety-two minutes for the 1957 original versus 122 minutes. Thirty-two listed actors of which 11 are credited (according to IMDb) versus 43 listed actors of which 32 are credited. <br/><br/>Taut craftsmanship with few obvious lessons versus morality Hollywood-style. No angst, just a great Western story versus so much angst (morality, redemption, failure, father/son, husband/wife, and so on) that I thought I'd never get the angst out of my clothes. <br/><br/>A tension-filled duel of wits and stubbornness between Van Heflin and Glenn Ford which ties them closer and closer together versus odd and unnecessary (except by Hollywood standards) hints of an attachment that dare not speak its name featuring Wade's psycho sidekick, <br/><br/>Great character acting versus great character acting. <br/><br/>Two fine lead performances versus two fine lead performances...but for Dan Evans I'll take Heflin's straightforward doggedness over Christian Bale's modern-day intensity. While I like Ford's and Russell Crowe's performances as Ben Wade, just as a matter of personal preference I like Ford's particular style of slyness and charisma as Wade a little better than Crowe's. <br/><br/>An ending that is tidy and quite satisfying versus an ending that tries to carry too much meaning. <br/><br/>Is it fair to judge a contemporary remake against the original? I think it probably is when the remake suffers (in my view) from contemporary Hollywood bloat. The original was a tight, small story put together by Hollywood craftsmen who knew how to tell and present a story on film. There just isn't, in my opinion, 30 minutes of better movie in the remake. I've watched the Ford/Heflin version a couple of times. I doubt that I'll revisit the Crowe/Bale version. For those who like movies, whichever version you wind up liking, watching both might be a worthwhile way to spend three-and-a-half hours."

One would expect nothing less from a Western, especially a remake of a classic.<br/><br/>This is a simple time-honored popcorn movie with updated character depth which reaches surprising poignancy by the conclusion, particularly by the 'is he or isn't he' a bad guy, Russell Crowe. As in life, I think we're still trying to figure that one out.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is a Civil War hero with a fake leg; a rancher simply trying to support his family. However he's being elbowed off his land to make way for progress, all he needs is cash to restore his farm and his pride, particularly for his two impressionable boys.<br/><br/>Enter, Russell Crowe. The subsequent meeting of the two central figures is not exactly unpleasant. What evolves is a curios character study of the unchanging and also shifting nature of ideals. You can see why the accomplished leads were attracted to the script.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold (Walk the Line, Heavy) is competent and keeps the action moving whilst never losing sight of where the real story lies.<br/><br/>As is often the case with big Hollywood stars at the center, a number of the supporting cast are allowed to stretch, Ben Foster (Six Feet Under) as Crowe's right hand man and in particularly an indistinguishable Peter Fonda who often dominates the scenes he's in.<br/><br/>It's tense as you would hope from a ticking bomb film, even Crowe wryly observes, 'You can't stop time.' Thankfully the two leads ensure it's more than just a thrilling journey, it's a stimulating one; almost a precursor for Stockholm Syndrome. Almost.<br/><br/>An old fashioned steak with no fat, as Crowe's character says, 'I hate the gristle.'"
"happyendingrocks","8","0","1","17 July 2009"," I could put a pun about a train here, but that might derail the serious nature of this write-up
","It's really a shame that the Western genre is considered a dead horse in Hollywood, because the vast majority of contemporary films made in this vein have been vastly successful in artistry, if not in box office gross.<br/><br/>In the 90's Unforgiven and Tombstone re-defined the notion of the modern Western, with one of those films netting a Best Picture Oscar and the other supplying countless quote material for movie geeks everywhere. 3:10 To Yuma is certainly the best Western of this decade, and though it can't boast either of those specifications, it can take pride in presenting two of the best actors in the game on the screen together.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are at the height of their powers in this film, and their rugged, man's man disciplines translate perfectly to the Western motif. Seeing these men believable in their roles is no surprise, as both have a track record spotted with far more exceptional films than duds. What is impressive is watching how well these two first-time co-stars play off of each other. Both men have reputations for being difficult to work with, but seeing them here, we can't help but imagine that their experience sparring with each other was worthwhile for both of them.<br/><br/>A great Western doesn't need to add anything new to the formula, and in fact, simple plots are often the most effective to insert into these surface-simple worlds. What's fascinating is watching how many emotional and character-driven nuances can be wrung from these basic scenarios. Our culture mythologizes gunslingers, and one senses that the moral structure of the basic outlaw is disregarded in favor of the romanticism of a solitary life on the trail. This is explored heavily in 3:10 To Yuma, both directly and implicitly, as we can't help but like Crowe's murderous scoundrel, even once we've heard about his most heinous deeds. If Westerns have taught us anything, it's that even lawmen took great liberties with the values they swore to uphold in the burgeoning West, so if an outlaw is guilty of nothing more than the execution of fellow scoundrels, reward-hunting posses, and corrupt upholders of justice, are they really such bad people? Crowe is here (he even tells us so), but the character parallels painted between he and Bale's honest but destitute rancher create a fascinating interplay. As the men learn throughout the film, they really aren't that different from one another, and they both value honor (even honor among thieves) as a paramount virtue. Certainly, Bale has no qualms about shooting down the men who stand in his way along the peril-fraught trail leading to the titular locomotive. When a bribe is offered to Bale late in the film, he isn't concerned with the moral deterioration that would accompany his acceptance; he just wonders aloud how he could possibly take the money without others questioning where he got it.<br/><br/>So here, there are no heroes or villains. And this sets a perfect stage for a dramatic and character-driven study of the duality of man. To see two actors so perfect for these roles squaring off definitely sweetens the deal, and if we're being fair, that is really the main reason why this film unfolds as powerfully as it does. (It's interesting that Tom Cruise was originally pegged for Crowe's role... This film could have really sucked).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there are gunfights aplenty. After all, let's not forget that another defining principle of a great Western is loads of six-gun shootouts. Fans of that aspect of the genre certainly won't be disappointed here, but this film definitely offers much more to the thinking viewer as well. To short-change such a masterfully acted piece as a pure action vehicle is grossly dismissive. And here, our leads are surrounded by such a strong ensemble, it's a good bet that the film wouldn't rate much lower if the body count were diminished (consider that Unforgiven features almost no gunplay).<br/><br/>So, I return to my original point: Why is the Western genre considered such a gamble when nearly every contemporary Western made with any degree of seriousness has knocked one out of the park? 3:10 To Yuma, paired with the understated and underrated Appaloosa, shows that there is still plenty of life in the genre when the right people are donning the Stetsons.<br/><br/>Certainly, films like 3:10 To Yuma don't make a huge dent in theater grosses, but I would much rather watch Christian Bale and Russell Crowe trade monologues than endure two-and-a-half hours of plot-less CGI robot flashiness peppered with awful Shia LeBouf one-liners. However, the audience for quality films will always pale in comparison to the masses who go to the movies for escapism without substance and spend their entire journey texting each other. So, apparently supply and demand is how the West was lost.<br/><br/>I think I've answered my own question. Strongly-made character-driven films aren't a priority because they don't make as much money, and film-makers would rather guarantee big bucks by attaching their name to soulless exercises in redundancy than take chances on films that might actually entertain people on an intellectual level. Some people will do unspeakable things for money. Actually, that's pretty much the underlying theme in 3:10 To Yuma. A bit ironic, isn't it?"

","*******SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS*********** The following is the plot/summary of the original version: Synopsis<br/><br/>In the Arizona Territory of the 1880s, rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his young sons witness a stagecoach holdup. When the driver, Bill Moons (Boyd Stockman), overpowers one of the robbers and uses him as a human shield, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), the leader of the gang, callously shoots both men.<br/><br/>Wade and his men stop at the saloon in nearby Bisbee, posing as cowhands. When Wade stays too long to become acquainted with the pretty barmaid, Emmy (Felicia Farr), he is captured, but his henchman, Charlie Prince (Richard Jaeckel) gets away with the news. The townspeople fear what his men will do, so the marshal (Ford Rainey) decides to have two volunteers sneak the prisoner to Contention City to catch a train, the 3:10 to Yuma. Mr. Butterfield (Robert Emhardt), the stage-line owner, offers $200 for the dangerous job. Desperate after three years of drought, Dan jumps at the opportunity, but the only other man interested is the town drunk, Alex Potter (Henry Jones). When no one else steps forward, the marshal reluctantly accepts them.<br/><br/>Wade is placed on a stagecoach, which then stops (in view of some of the gang) for a faked repair; the outlaw is secretly taken off while the stage continues on with an imposter, in the hopes that by the time the outlaws figure out what has happened, it will be too late. Wade is taken to Dan's ranch, where Dan's devoted wife Alice (Leora Dana) serves supper to the family and their ""guest"".<br/><br/>Dan, Alex, and Wade leave under cover of darkness, reaching Contention City at daybreak. Butterfield has reserved a room at the hotel. While they wait for the train, Wade tries several times to bribe Dan into letting him go. Dan is greatly tempted. The local sheriff is out of town, but Butterfield hires five men to help escort the prisoner to the train.<br/><br/>Things go awry when Bob Moons (Sheridan Comerate) barges in unexpectedly and threatens to shoot his brother's killer. Dan wrestles his gun away from him, but in the struggle, it goes off. Downstairs, Charlie Prince, who has also come to Contention City, hears the gunshot, and spots Wade in a window. Charlie is seen riding off to fetch the rest of the gang.<br/><br/>The men Butterfield recruited watch as seven riders enter the town. Not liking the odds, they retreat, leaving only Dan, Alex and Butterfield. When Alex goes out to reconnoiter, he spots one of Wade's men on a rooftop opposite the hotel. Alex calls out, warning Dan, but is shot in the back by Prince. The gang hangs the wounded Alex from the lobby chandelier, killing him. Butterfield decides that maintaining Wade as a prisoner is not worth the risk, and releases Dan from his obligation. Alice arrives and also tries to change her husband's mind, but he is committed: ""The town drunk gave his life because he believed that people should be able to live in decency and peace together. You think I can do less?""<br/><br/>When the clock strikes three, Dan escorts Wade out the back door. Gang members take shots whenever they can without endangering Wade, but despite their best efforts, they cannot stop the pair from reaching the platform, where the train is waiting. Finally, the outlaws emerge to confront Dan as the train starts to leave. Charlie shouts for Wade to drop to allow them a clear shot at Dan. Instead, Wade unexpectedly tells Dan to jump into the passing baggage car. They jump together. The gang starts to run after the train, but Dan shoots Charlie and the rest then let it go. Wade explains himself, saying he felt he owed Dan for protecting him from Bob Moons in the hotel room, and confidently claiming he has broken out of the Yuma jail before (implying he can do so again), but whether these statements reflect his true motivations and prospects is not clear. Alice sees Dan safe on the train as rain pours down on her, breaking the long drought. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=3374650<br/><br/>The differences are mainly that the son is along in this, the wife is less present, Dan dies in this one, and Ben kills the whole crew rather than just Charilie. In the remake, it did appear like Ben was about to draw on Ben Wade, once he defended himself against him, he had to take the others out, being they, too, were attempting to draw, it's called self-preservation. He wasn't on the train, yet, as he was in the original version. Plus, he plans on escaping in both versions. In this version, he gets to keep all the money, and he let the other man look like a hero. It's idealism, you don't need realism in everything. Just because it's not a fantasy genre, doesn't make it not. Movies are just that. Not every movie is based on fact. Actually, even the 'based on' movies aren't always 100% fact. I didn't need to suspend belief for a moment, I've seen too many westerns, horror flicks, gangster movies, thrillers, romances, sci-fi etc, etc, etc to expect anything other than to be entertained. When a movie fails to do that, then that is when it has failed. Only, then.<br/><br/>This was a good film and it did make you care for the characters, and because I was able to get it, I cried. Not too many movies have done that to me, lately."

","This movie was pretty good. I wouldn't call it a typical western; it was more about the relationship between cattle rancher, Dan, and outlaw, Ben Wade. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are both good in this and what make the movie better than average. I liked the way they made Ben seem like this cold blooded killer, but for some reason he had some respect for Dan. Maybe he envied Dan for what he had.<br/><br/>There were a few things I didn't quite get. Like, why did Ben Wade just let himself be captured? Was he tired of running or was it because he liked a challenge? Maybe he wanted to escape from Yuma a third time. And at the end, why did he decide to try to help Dan succeed in getting him on the train. Did he really not want his gang to rescue him? And why was his gang just shooting randomly when trying to save Ben. They could have just as easily shot him.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I suggest watching it if you like Bale or Crowe. But I'm sure some will find this movie boring. I didn't."

"OldAle1","7","0","1","29 November 2008"," broad, flavorful remake doesn't improve on original but is solid on its own terms
","There is something to be said for attempting to view any remake of a classic film on its own terms, even if one has seen the original film on which it is based. Some remakes, certainly, have been made with good intentions in mind; some have been made with mercenary intentions for the most part in check; and a rare few even supersede the original to the point where they become the standard on which we base our opinions of every rendition of the basic story. Typically, large-scale stories with fantastic or fabulous elements tend to offer a wide range of interpretations and are, for me at least, much easier to envision in multiple versions. The 1940 ""Thief of Bagdad"" comes to mind as an example of the latter, as does Terry Gilliam's version of ""Baron Munchausen"". So three cheers for all the great remakes out there! ""3:10 to Yuma"", obviously, doesn't seem to fit into such a category. The original film is a spare, minimalist, rather low-budget B&W Western starring a couple of actors that never quite hit the A-list (Van Heflin and Glenn Ford) in what would be a defining moment for both of them. The new film broadens the canvas, literally (it's 'scope and color) and thematically, with the already fascinating parallels between struggling rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale in the Heflin-originated role) and brutal outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe, equaling and perhaps even exceeding Ford) deepened and expanded, the theme of the corruption that money brings to an essentially poor and land-based economy made much more explicit. The central story though remains simple: desperate Evans, a man unaccustomed to violence, agrees to help deliver Wade up for arrest for enough money to save his ranch.<br/><br/>For most of the length of the film, the original story and screenplay are followed fairly closely. The violence is obviously much more intense and explicit and the action scenes more drawn out, though never at the expense of the storytelling. We get more of an insight into the pasts of both men than the '57 version gave us; the gloomy Civil War wounding of Evans may have something to do with his feelings of inadequacy, his need to stand up for himself and the larger community of law-abiding citizens; Wade's artistic ambitions coupled with his awful childhood seem to have warped him into a psychopath with a veneer of civilization that increasingly threatens his brutal values as the film progresses. All of this, and an extended added scene in a railway camp, are offered I suspect to make the finale's striking reversals seem possible, if not exactly realistic  but it doesn't quite work. Bale's Evans is too weak, too introverted and fanatical all at once to seem much more than a ""character""; it was hard for me to buy Crowe's growing sympathy for him, or for that matter Bale's ability to go through with his mission. And Wade is established as just too brutal and self-centered to be really believable in the final moments.<br/><br/>Still, the acting overall  especially by Crowe  the pacing, and the staging of the action sequences worked well enough to keep me entertained, and the over-the-top nature of the final moments actually didn't seem implausible until a day or two later. Well worth a viewing overall, and certainly more ""true"" to the classic Western genre than many recent endeavors."

Russel Crowe is initially chillingly convincing as a bible quoting psychopath and Christian Bale's character as a desperate, if decent, loser is understandable and played with considerable pathos. Ben Foster is also notable as the Schofield revolver-toting minion of Crowe. Peter Fonda still has beautiful eyes despite his now rather craggy exterior and plays the part of a nearly indestuctible Pink to perfection.<br/><br/>It's just a pity that it all falls apart at the last hurdle.

","I knew that this movie was a remake of 1957 classic western movie. I normally do not like re-makes because they are never well made or come anywhere near the patch of the original. But this being a western  I love western movies  and that too released after so long, I was much more than excited to venture out to see this one.<br/><br/>Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) is an outlaw - robs money and kills people. He is brutal, but this complex character has also some humane side to him. He has his gang with his deputy as Charlie Prince (Ben Foster). They rob cattle from a ranch of Dan Evans (Christian Bale). Dan goes after Ben to get his cattle back and in process becomes ends up in getting Ben arrested. Their tasks is to put Ben on the train at 3:10 pm to Yuma  where he would be hanged. How they take Ben there becomes the remainder of the story.<br/><br/>I liked the moral twist the story brings at the end where Ben helps Dan to take him till the train, so that he can set an example to his son  that his Dad did not take bribe nor he was afraid of the outlaws.<br/><br/>All characterization of the movie was absorbing - especially of Ben Wade, and his relationship with Dan Evans; they share a complex form of understanding. Both of the two main protagonist Russel Crowe and Christian Bale have done equal justice to the role  beautifully portrayed. Ben Foster as the deputy was intense and a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The cinematography of any western movie landscape is mindblowing and so was for this movie. The ruggedness, the dirt, the soil, the horses  I just loved all of it. A treat to watch such movies on a big screen.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold did a fantastic job in making this remake. As I have not seen the original I don't have any words to compare with. But this movie is technically excellent and has a larger time space of 122 minutes (compared to 92 minutes of the original)  so that is nice.<br/><br/>One observation  why should anyone try to protect an outlaw and take so much pain to take him to a train station; in the process  let soooo many people die and killed anyways the outlaw is going to be hanged. Very stupid and silly  I say of those people and director.<br/><br/>But, I overlook this stupidity, otherwise there is no story, no adventure, no action and no pleasure given to audiences to watch two excellent actors in the backdrop of a western setting  on a BIG screen.<br/><br/>I thought of writing this review after I saw the original too, but later changed my mind. I will see the original later and write my comparative review covering both the movies  sometime later.<br/><br/>(Stars 7.25 out of 10)"

He is transferred by a convoy of people, including Dan Evans (Christian Bale), his teenage son William (Logan Lerman) and a handful of others.<br/><br/>The films plot line takes them on paths of self discovery, which shows a more emotional side to the western, as well as some old fashioned gun slinging with rival tribes and railway engineers, making the film action packed and very dramatic.<br/><br/>To me though, it is 16 year old Logan Lerman who definitely steals the show from the Hollywood heavyweights such as Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Peter Fonda to emerge as this fantastic young talent, who's character William comes of age in the film, and see's his father whom he never aspired to, turn from being a lowlife to a hero.<br/><br/>The film is very good, and cinematography of the film is incredible, and it definitely brings back the days of the old western to a moder glory."

"blackburnj-1","7","0","1","1 August 2008"," Solid piece of work which lets itself down a bit
","The recent revival of the western has been notable, but many of them have been neo-westerns or revisionists. Films such as ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" have begun to drastically re-define the genre for the modern day, but ""3:10 to Yuma"" has not attempted to do so.<br/><br/>An adaptation of an Elmore Leonard short story, which was made into a film in the fifties, ""3:10 to Yuma"" concerns a penniless and injured rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), struggling to survive in the drought-ridden Arizona of the late 1800s. In an attempt to raise some much needed money for his family, he agrees to escort the prolific criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to the eponymous train which will take him to his trial and execution. Evans' motives, however, may not be as simple as they seem, as he is haunted by secrets and lies from his past and is quite desperate to gain the respect of his oldest son. As they travel through the wilderness, the honourable Evans and the unscrupulous Wade begin to connect as the small group struggle toward the train, all the while being chased by Wade's gang, led by the vicious Charlie Prince (Ben Foster).<br/><br/>This film is not a special western. It is purely a character piece, with no great ideas on the table. However, it is a gripping piece and merits its near two-hour running time completely. It opens with a visually impressive scene and an exciting stagecoach robbery which get the audience's attention, and this high-tempo pace and tone is maintained throughout the film.<br/><br/>It is also well acted, and merited its SAG nomination for Best Ensemble. Bale and Crowe are excellent. Bale has the more interesting part and deals with it well, facing up to issues of inadequacy and dissatisfaction that are central to his character with his trademark intensity and complexity. Crowe pulls his part off with his usual charm and charisma but, even in the early scenes, it is clear that the standout turn is from Ben Foster as the sadistic and committed Charlie Prince. But the strong cast, despite their brilliant work, cannot cover up the film's major weaknesses.<br/><br/>Director James Mangold does a perfectly solid job here, but he doesn't display any of the flair that he showed in ""Walk the Line"". The film is put together well enough. It is pretty well shot by Phedon Papamichael and the film is supported by an excellent score from Marco Beltrami, but it doesn't strike you as particularly special in any way.<br/><br/>The real weakness, however, is the script. It starts well and develops nicely, but for all of its good dialogue and moments of interest, the climax is baffling. One piece of character development is just incomprehensible and makes no sense, perhaps suggesting that the writers felt that they had fleshed out their central characters and their relationship with each other a bit more than they actually had. It is a shame, because this makes the ending a thundering disappointment and after two hours of solid and entertaining film-making you can't help but feel a little let down.<br/><br/>Despite the late missteps, this was never going to be an exceptional film. It is however a solid and entertaining film, which makes decent if not necessarily highly recommended viewing.<br/><br/>3 Stars out of 5"

","2007's remake of '3:10 to Yuma' is a rather minor entry in the western genre, but an enjoyable one at that. Following the recent resurgence of the genre, 'Yuma' is the latest to attract an A-list cast to saddle up and hit the open plains of the west. Exquisite film-making doesn't always reflect its quality, nor does it help a padded running time, but this remains a picture worth hopping onto.<br/><br/>Following in the footsteps of its 1957 original, '3:10 to Yuma' follows a poor but honest man's (Christian Bale) quest to deliver a famous criminal (Russell Crowe) to a railroads to catch the soonest jail-bound train to Yuma, Arizona. This is a well-meaning picture that attempts to say something about doing what is right versus what is easy, but 'Yuma' doesn't have enough depth to carry the weight of such a message. The very talented director James Mangold keeps the project together, but at times struggles greatly to keep the whole thing afloat when a bogged down second act tested this viewer's patience. Things reach that high-point payoff in the end that makes the trip worth the slow wait, but a two hour running time becomes excessive when there just isn't enough story to balance with.<br/><br/>'3:10 to Yuma' is up to its head in capable and talented actors. From Russell Crowe to Christian Bale facing off in a psychological cat-and-mouse game to Ben Foster and Peter Fonda. Fine performances are delivered across the board, but much like the film itself, very few standout moments are found here. Ben Foster, perhaps proving himself to be a very underrated actor, is the best among the group here. His snide demeanor and piercing accent gives the film a great push whenever he fills the screen, despite how maddening his character may be.<br/><br/>'Yuma' is a good film, but I find it far from great. It seems to take Mangold a long time to decide just what he wants this film to be, and by the time he does, it's very possible he's already lost the attention of some. There isn't a great deal to truly criticize here, because this is an undeniably well-made film. But in failing to drive things home in truly memorable fashion, 'Yuma' doesn't define the modern western and doesn't compare to recent efforts. But it's a solid outing for everyone involved, and at the end of the day, '3:10 to Yuma' manages to be an entertaining and at times blood-rushing thrill ride. It's just unfortunate that its attempt at morality doesn't come off as powerful as it would have hoped, because it kept this western from potentially being something much larger than itself.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Crowe and the kid saw parts of themselves in one another, Bale wanted to please his son, or rather, have him look up to him--and maybe, just maybe--Crowe didn't want the kid to grow up as him--without a good or honorable memory of his father, also at the same time again, emphasizing with Bale too. Remember how Crowe said his dad died over a shot of whiskey, and his mom left after giving him the bible? Maybe this, and his father's legacy, was pivotal in his development as a ""ruthless"" gunslinger? I think the movie also presented a 'duality of man' theme that maybe sometimes depended on which side of the law and/or land situations these characters were in. Remember the man shot in the beginning who later had been found out to have ""killed"" the Navajo children, or Bale himself had shot many in the war. This also illustrates this 'duality' and shows that yes, we are all different, but not maybe all that far off. Crowe was so thwarted and angered by his attempt to do 'good' that he shot his gang. He fully realized the boy's, and the boy's father's dream by getting on the train and finally whistling for his horse. Thus, signifying the futility of it, as a manipulation, or false pride being a guide or reinforcement, while at the same time serving as the dream of this young boy. Crowe knows he will escape again, and this is the irony and tragedy of it"
"GethinVanH","Null","0","2","3 July 2008"," Plot holes and clichés abound
","There's so many plot holes in this movie that the whole movie quickly becomes unbelievable. The story involves a rancher (Bale) who needs money and takes a job transporting a dangerous killer (Crowe) by horseback. The killer eventually gets loose and starts killing people but Christian Bale and co. keep re-capturing him although Crowe's character does get loose again and kills another one of his captors. This goes on for an unbelievably long time. What's really unbelievable is that Crowe's captors never think of shooting him. There wouldn't be much a movie if this happened but the entire movie is based on a rather ridiculous premise.<br/><br/>Ben Foster's character is also annoying and completely rubbed me the wrong way. He's unconvincing as a vile little toadie to Crowe. The audience is mostly reminded again and again of how bad Foster's character is. Not just bad, bad-ass. Foster is a capable actor but he's completely out of place here. Where he was good was in ""Six Feet Under"" as a secondary character in an art school where he played a jealous, mentally ill art school student. He was more convincing in that. His 5'7 scrawny tough-guy persona is unintentionally funny at best."

","I actually liked the trailer for this movie when it first came out, but for one reason or another didn't go see it at the theaters. I'm sorry I didn't, as westerns are so rare these days and one on the big screen is even more of a rarity. I watched this first on InDemandPPV, and was wrapped up in the action from moment one. I don't see how anyone could say this film is ""slow"". For me, it was non stop entertainment. Even during the parts where there was no gunfighting or battling of any kind, the relationships between the characters kept me riveted to the screen. It really is all about standing up for what is right, having principles, and doing what you have to do even when the odds are stacked against you. It's about finding redemption and understanding in the least likely people and circumstances. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe simply are on fire together. I loved every moment of their interactions, and I would love to see them re-team in something on down the line. They, and their respective characters of Dan Evans and Ben Wade, made the movie for me. It was also nice to see Peter Fonda, and Logan Lerman as Dan's son William was also impressive. The cast overall was a stand-out (they weren't nominated for a SAG award for most outstanding cast for nothing.) All in all, I'd say, a great movie. Not perfect, but if you go in focusing on what you think might never logically happen, you'll miss the magic and beauty of it all. Worth a watch, or even owning a copy. You might need a tissue handy for some of the later scenes. I know I did. Two thumbs up, I loved it !"
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","7","0","1","17 June 2008"," What a movie?
","Here's hoping James Mangold's big, raucous, and ultra bloody remake of 3:10 to Yuma leads some moviegoers to check out Delmer Daves's beautifully lean, half-century-old original. That classic Western spun a tale of captured outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford)--deadly but disarmingly affable--and the small-time rancher and family man, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), desperate enough to accept the job of helping escort the badman to Yuma prison. Wade, knowing that his gang will be along at any moment to spring him, works at persuading the ultimately lone deputy to accept a bribe, turn his back on ""duty,"" and go home safe and rich to his family. That the outlaw has come to admire his captor intriguingly complicates the suspense. All of the above applies in the new 3:10, but it takes a lot more huffing and puffing to get Wade (Russell Crowe this time) and Evans (Christian Bale) into position for the showdown. Mostly, more is less. To Mangold's credit, his movie doesn't traffic in facile irony or postmodern detachment; it aims to be a straight-up Western and deliver the excitement and charisma the genre's fans are starved for. But recognizing that contemporary viewers might be out of touch with the bedrock simplicity and strength of the genre--not to mention its code of honor--Mangold has supplied both Evans and Wade with a plethora of back story and ""motivations."" At the overblown action climax, the crossfire of personal agendas is almost as frenetic as the copious gun play. (By that point the movie has killed more people than the Lincoln County War.) Best thing about the remake is Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, a Scripture-quoting career villain with an artist's eye and a curiously principled sense of whom and when to murder. As his second-in-command, Ben Foster fairly pirouettes at every opportunity to commit mayhem, and Peter Fonda contributes a fierce portrait of an old Wade adversary turned bounty hunter for the Pinkerton detective agency."
"jkd15-1","7","0","2","8 May 2008"," Good movie but not great or very good.
","I thought the final comment from Bale to his son was self indulging and actually, almost ruined the movie for me. Instead of being someone who believed in honor he just did it for himself and his own reputation. This was not a movie about honor but trying to make yourself look better to your family.<br/><br/>The blunder of this movie was having Russell Crowe in it. He is such a good actor and portrayed in such a good manner that he was actually the true hero. The movie should have been that Crowe is mistaken in what or how people thought he was and Bale realizing that Crowes character was not this person came to his aide.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were hard to believe and I wondered how the gang chasing them in the end couldn't realize that Crowe was actually not in trouble.<br/><br/>And the premise of a company man had the authority to bring Crowe to justice and get him to the train was absurd. By the way, Dallas Roberts is the hidden gem in this movie. He is a superb actor and deserves many more roles.<br/><br/>This movie could have been excellent but the premise was not legit.<br/><br/>Outside of the above it was watchable and enjoyable and mainly because of Crowe.<br/><br/>Bale is a good actor. I am not ready to say great yet. And as an earlier poster wrote about Bale being the next Gregory Peck? I don't think so. At least not yet. At this point he is certainly not in the same category as Crowe who is among the best today.<br/><br/>A good movie and watchable."

","This is definitely not your typical type of western movie one would be expecting, and this definitely will not be enjoyed by everyone. It doesn’t have that stylish cowboy shootout or killing everyone senselessly; but it is more of a dramatic western movie which works to the certain levels.<br/><br/>Three Ten started of very slow to the very point that I thought - well it actually be of any fun?, even with some gun fight it still felt very drag on, dull and unnecessary in the first hour, luckily the amount of pace start to catch up gradually and the last forty five minutes start to be something more like a cowboy movie. I don’t like my cowboy movie to go much off the track.<br/><br/>I guess the present of Russell and Christian are the main reason I watch this movie, plus I read a whole lot of positive review about it. The two were just awesome, actually almost everyone in this movie is awesome, and some of them even give a very decent performance even with unexplored character. At first I thought Ben was more of a miscast but after the movie went along I realize he wasn’t all bad at all.<br/><br/>The whole production was also pretty good, a very stylish wardrobe I must say, a very good lighting, good direction, brilliant location (not too deserted), and good editing. The only things that keep this movie from reaching its fullest got to be the uneven story and that unnecessarily overlong introduction. And that to me is the key point to any great movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, with so many positive reviews I might have too higher hope for it, which leads to a mere disappointment when it doesn’t reach that expectation. It is still a good film none the less but don’t get high hope on it. The good thing is at least the movie is more or less rewatch-able.<br/><br/>Recommendation: I Guess You Can Rent It.<br/><br/>Reason to Watch: Russell and Christian were great.<br/><br/>Reason Not to: First part of the movie is overlong and boring.<br/><br/>Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+) <br/><br/>Please Rate Y/N Only After Read."

","Rest assured, Hollywood has yet to find out how to make a credible western-remake. This is probably as good as it gets, and according to the generous rating here, many seems to accept all the short-comings of this movie. That's probably the best way to enjoy this movie. It has all the elements of a cool western; a bad guy with a gang, a hero with a nice family, a lot of shooting and a lot of dead people. Well, the last thing we won't care much about anyway because the one one who dies we do not know or don't like anyway. It's quite typical for a western, I'm sad to say. The atmosphere is right on the spot. It's wild west all right, where the boots always are dirty and the men mostly are the same. There is no real shortcoming of suspense, so you won't be disappointed of that either. <br/><br/>However, it won't go down to history as a classic, of obvious reasons. A great movie must have a credible ending. This has not. Other things that might annoy, is the casting. I would rather have seen the former serial killer (American Psycho) Christian Bale as the outlaw, and former hero (Gladiator) Russell Crowe as the rancher. However, that's an opinion that you might not share. But, you will get annoyed of how easy money can persuade anyone to take a mans life, and some moments you seriously will question how poorly people can shoot. Enough said without spoilers, you will enjoy two fine actors and you will have a good time watching this. Just don't think too much about the shortcomings and you will do fine. For me, it left me with mixed emotions. It's like being a small boy, and mama promise you candy. You expect a lot of fine chocolate, but all you get is toffee. Well, it's still candy, you know."

","Folks,if you are going to watch this movie, do not theorize. Just watch and enjoy.There are too many loopholes to talk about and a completely irrational yet thrilling climax,so leave your brains at home. The story is ultimately about heroism and courage(both misdirected, with some ego and stubbornness to spice things up).Small time rancher Dan Evans who is apparently trying to make ends meet for his family, is thrown into a perilous situation of escorting notorious criminal Ben Wade to a prison train heading to a place called Yuma where Ben Wade is supposed to be tried for 23 cases of felony of all sorts,barring rape which is not mentioned anywhere in this movie.Ben is by the way a charming womanizer who can rattle off any portion from the Bible, because his mother made him sit in a railway station when he was small and gave him a bible.For three days he waited for his mom and read the bible from cover to cover but mom never returned.Even for a mom like that Ben can kill a tough Pinkerton agent even though Ben is handcuffed.He just can fly off his horse and push the brat off a cliff because that brat made a nasty remark about mom and even bad boys love their moms.One can imagine what an arduous task this is to escort a criminal like Ben to a station and pack him on a train when his absolutely kick-ass sidekicks are in hot pursuit to free him under the leadership of second-in-command,a faithful psycho called Charlie Prince. For a character like Ben who can even kill 3 gun-toting apache Indians (this time too he was handcuffed)in the Apache territory, how he could remain captured till the end of the movie is a big question.When all of his captors die in one way or the other or flee the scene to save own life,it is up to the honest farmer,former civil war veteran soldier Evans to escort this rogue to the train.He gets assistance from his elder son,who becomes aware through the course of the movie that his father is not actually a wobbly coward but a hero who is preferring a glorious death rather than becoming labelled a coward.Please do not try to make sense of this ego/morality factor because Ben could have killed Dan anytime he liked but just plays along.I got the feeling that Ben was kind of having fun in getting guided to a prison train when all the time he was aware that either he himself or his band of mercenaries were absolutely capable of freeing him.In a town where gunshots are daily fare for the townsfolk,a final fight ensues where amidst the frenzied gunshots life goes on like normal.This is crazy by whatever standards.Just look at the scene during the last 6-7 mins where the Station porters are busy attending the train amidst a complete skirmish.Was this normal?Very hard to digest.As if to salute the moral courage of Dan,Ben gets on the train to prove to Dan that Dan is actually a hero who did his job, then gets off the train and kills all his fellow mates including Charlie Prince who bet his life to free him !!How more crazy can this be!!Then again he gets on the train and as the train pushes off, he whistles softly and his dark horse listens this whistle from quite some distance(wow!!) up and above all the noise a steam engine driven train can make and starts running beside the train until both disappear from the screen.Too much talent wasted for a film that is too irrational.Guys,do not apply logic."

He fights, he kills he offers money... and then what does he do. He cooperates with Bale completely. It's almost as Bale was protecting him at the end in a game of 'capture the flag'. There are several scenes in the hotel room when Crow is alone with Bale and Bale turns his back on him. Not to hard to hit him and roll out the window.<br/><br/>Then the running through the streets and Crow telling Bale ""look out"" when a man tries to kill him? C'mon. But the most incredulous scene of all is after Bale gets shot and Crow guns down his whole crew, then surrenders his guns and peacefully hops on the prison train. Yes, I know he whistled for his horse which leads us to believe he is going to escape, but c'mon... the guy is suppose to be this ruthless killer and we're suppose to believe that after a few days on the trail with Bale he sees the errors of his ways and does this 180.<br/><br/>Could have been good, but the ending required a little more thought.

","So I was born in 1950 and raised on Roy Rogers on TV when it was okay for a guy to get shot and get up again, or for hundreds of bullets to miss our hero... There are SPOILERS to come!! But since then I've learned to appreciate how John Ford made Monument Valley a character, how every face shot close-up by Sergio Leone of even the most minor character is a work of art. Tombstone gave us authenticity and a twitchy bad guy who almost approached Jack Palance happily sadistic villain in ""Shane"". In the original ""3:10 to Yuma"",(and in ""Shane"" and even ""Airport"") Van Heflin was THE everyman, beaten down by fate. ""Lonesome Dove"" touches your heart and can bring tears to your eyes again and again. I LOVE Westerns, so I had high hopes for a new one.<br/><br/>The new one is adequate, but on the whole, unsatisfactory. It could have been SO MUCH more. It comes close at times but, no, it's not a great Western. I blame mainly the writers, then Mangold, then the cinematographer, and finally the costume designer.<br/><br/>As for the actors, I give them an A for effort. Although Crowe can apparently play this character effortlessly, he does an admirable job. Bale has the much more difficult task, he's too pretty, but he won me over and deserves praise indeed. Ben Foster needed a different shirt and he was menacing enough but that was the character not the acting. Don't tell me you didn't know he would leave the guy to burn alive in the stagecoach.<br/><br/>And THAT brings us to the real problem with this film. Why was the guy still locked up in the stagecoach? There were 20 or 30 other little stupidities like this. I can suspend disbelief only so much and the writers kept foisting so much absolute idiocy and silliness on us that it overwhelms their skill in helping us understand Wade and Evans motives.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a video game battle of a stagecoach chase to capture those with a short attention span who need superviolence and action, meanwhile we're shown that Ben Wade is really an artist, a soul that loves nature, who soon guns down his own henchman for making a mistake. The grizzled well-cast Peter Fonda is gut shot at close range. And they expect me to believe that a few hours later he's riding along like Monty Python's knight...""It was only a scratch!""? Like I said, silliness. More silliness, the good guys have been riding toward Contention while the bad guys are chasing the decoy stagecoach, yet they are close enough to see the stagecoach burning in the distance? They camp in Apache territory at night and light a big fire? William, the older son, was acted well, but his character was a teenager who belonged in the back seat of a ""National Lampoon"" vacation station wagon, not the 1880's.<br/><br/>While Mangold may succeed in depicting the friendship/hate/admiration relationship between Wade and Evans that's about all I can compliment, and even that was watered down compared to the original. He and his cinematographer jiggled the camera, missed all of the opportunities to show they had learned something about Westerns from Ford and Leone. No use of the landscape, no unique faces in close-ups. Gretchen Mol is a nice Alice but did she look like a careworn wife or more like she had been a week too long between appointments at the hairdresser to get her hair colored properly? And then the ending...an 8-year old could have written a more logical, satisfactory conclusion. Why didn't the marshal and dead-eye Dan just shoot Charlie down in the middle of the street from the hotel window? Why are there women and children out on the streets after the local lawmen had been massacred? How did a 1000 bullets miss Dan and Ben? Why does Wade go part of the way, warning Dan of threats, then suddenly decide he's had enough, and then, when he could have left Dan alive and escaped easily (again!!!!) join him for another jolly jaunt across the rooftops? I am pleased that many people today LIKED a Western, but this is NOT what it should have or could have been. Go ahead and watch it for the story and tension and acting, but if you can't see the holes in this, what are YOU thinking? If this is a movie you liked, then PLEASE go watch ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""Shane"" and ""The Searchers"" or the complete first ""Lonesome Dove"", even ""Tombstone""!!!!! Finally watch the original ""3:10"" for a much better ending. Then perhaps you will see why I say this could have been so much more, but, sadly, it just is not what it SHOULD have been."

I never saw the original version of this one, but this version is fantastic! (I gave it a nine because ten should be considered virtually unattainable, to me anyway) The acting is excellent by all. There is action, humor, and a hint of ""romance"" (a veiled sex scene, I guess some people consider that romance). I've only seen bits and pieces of Russell Crowe in other movies. He plays the part of the extremely evil villain, that somehow seems likable, excellently. There are even a few good messages this film presents, but I don't want to discuss them, because I would have to check the ""spoiler"" box. The ""R"" rating is pretty much just for a few profanities, and fairly graphic violence, but it is much tamer on the senses than the current crop of gross-out movies. I think children as young as 12 (at least boys) could handle this movie without creating haunting images in their minds that could last the rest of their lives (like I still have from some movies I saw when I was a young teen), since the violence is on par with many video games they have probably seen or played before.

","This is NOT a genuine remake of the 1957 classic, but an entirely different movie, which introduces a large number of original elements(e.g. Peter Fonda as the grizzled bounty hunter, the mining camp incidents, the proactive 14-year-old son of ""Dan Evans"", the dangerous trek through Apache country, etc.,etc., etc.), lasts noticeably longer, and changes some of characters of the Ford-Heflin Yuma almost beyond recognition (the tortured and lame ex-soldier Evans (Christian Bale) of 2007 is quite different from Heflin's solidly sympathetic 1957 farmer, and ""Evans'"" 2007 wife has practically nothing in common with the luminously moving ""Alice Evans"" of 1957 (Leora Dana), while Russell Crowe's violently psychopathic second-in-command Ben Foster (much admired by most commentators for his performance) is worlds apart from the coolly pragmatic thug played by Richard Jaeckel in 1957. Ford and Crowe are closest as ""Ben Wade"", though the latter's exudes more quiet evil (as well as more talent and mystery) and seems occasionally far more Machiavellian.<br/><br/>That said, both movies were extremely enjoyable experiences for me (I played my DVD of the 1957 film a few hours after watching Crowe and company at our local cinema,and went to sleep with much contentment thereafter). The first Yuma was and remains a classic, deservedly so. Will the second Yuma become one? It could, if some of its ambiguities are satisfactorily resolved by critics and viewers alike."
"arowbee","9","0","1","11 September 2007"," The secret to the movie is the color of Wade's horse
","The key to understanding this movie is the color of Ben Wade's horse. It's black. Which makes him a Black Rider. This doesn't mean that Daniel Evan is a hobbit, but the whole movie makes sense if you interpret Wade as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. This isn't as much of a stretch as it sounds--Pale Rider and Tombstone specifically quote the Book of Revelation and when you look at the movie through this lens, things start to fall into place.<br/><br/>First, biblically, the Black Rider represents famine/drought. This is what Evan's is living through on his ranch. Second, the symbol of the Black Rider is scales, as in justice's scales. Third, the name ""Daniel"" means ""God is my judge"". If you recall, in the scene where Evans explains to his wife why he's going, he says ""I've been standing on one leg waiting for God to send a blessing and this is all I've got."" A man with one leg (lost ignobly) is off-balance--to be redeemed, he needs to get even (Evan). Finally, the name of the gun is ""the Hand of God"" and Wade warns that it's cursed--anyone other than it's rightful owner can't handle it. I take this to mean that Wade, though a ""villain"" is really God's agent in the movie. Also, the name Ben could be short for Benjamin which means ""son of my right hand"".<br/><br/>Consider this: Wade never kills an innocent person throughout the movie. The only two possible exceptions (Fonda and the other Pinkerton) are ruled out by the account of the Indian massacre and even then it wasn't until after Fonda shows his utter lack of remorse that he's finally finished off. All the other innocents who die in the movie are either killed by Wade's men, who display an almost fundamentalist fervor for their boss (as if they were doing the Lord's work of Vengeance on his behalf) or die through an act of self-sacrifice. When he kills off his own gang, there is a specific allusion to the scripture passage quoted by Wade earlier in the movie, namely that God judges the heart of a man (Charlie Prince is shot, by the Hand of God, through the heart). This interpretation also makes sense of Wade's enigmatic comment about busting out of Hell as soon as he gets there (God's agent gets a get out of jail free card).<br/><br/>Ultimately, Wade's helping Evan deliver Wade to the 3:10 train to Yuma, restores balance to Daniel's life and allows for justice to be served on the Evan ranch.<br/><br/>One last thing, Revelation 3:10 (NIV) reads: ""Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth."" I think it's an interesting passage in light of the movie. Admitedly, it's a bit of a stretch to make it work with this ending, but I believe the original movie didn't have Evan die at the end."
