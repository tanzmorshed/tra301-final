","Sicario was first released back in 2015. I just watched it for the first time last week...and I really have no excuse other than I'm an idiot. I knew I'd like it, I'd heard nothing but amazing things, and five minutes into the movie I completely regretted not watching it sooner. Sicario is, hands down, one of the best action/thrillers of the decade. Director Denis Villeneuve manages to create so much suspense and intensity throughout 120 minutes that at times it's almost unbearable. Needless to say, my fingernails did not survive this movie. The plot itself is fairly basic - the FBI teams up with some shady people to fight a brutal Mexican drug cartel. Emily Blunt plays the young FBI agent recruited into the fight, and for most of the movie the audience is just as confused and suspicious as she is. It delivers plenty of wonderful ""what the hell?"" moments, as you never really get a sense of anyone's true motivations until the end. The performances are universally terrific and the dialogue is sharp, but the main reason the movie works so masterfully is Villeneuve. With the help of some striking cinematography and a brilliant score, he gives us one of the most surprising, tense, and atmospheric thrillers in the history of the genre. If you've never seen Sicario, please don't make my mistake and see it ASAP."

","One of those select few thrillers that will have your eyes stuck to the screen from the opening credits to the very end, and I mean that literally: I changed my sitting position many times during the film, yet I clearly recall never ever turning my head away from the film, this is how intense it is.<br/><br/>With this Denis Villenueve has now consolidated his name as one of most important and gifted directors of our time and has shown us he is here to stay. I truly marvel at how this film is so tightly put together and even despite it faults, which it has, especially in script, it just never gives you a chance to breathe and take it all in, thanks to the atmosphere that is established from shot one until the last one, you are always anticipating something's going to happen and that is the sign you are watching a great thriller. You are always on the edge of your seat and in some occasions you are really biting your knuckles. The movie has a way to throw you into the action that is really rare to find, especially in a highway sequence where I literally felt I was there.<br/><br/>All of this is achieved thanks to probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Deakins does it again, once more playing with a lot of blacks and shadows and once more succeeding one hundred percent. Also remarkable is the use of helicopter shots which don't feel like connective tissue, but actually part of the organic, that's something really hard to pull off. The sound design of this film is flat out amazing, some of the best I have truly ever had the pleasure to experience. It is so in you face, so tight, it really contributes in making you feel a part of this even in the more intimate scenes. Music too is also excellent and while some may say it was a little too ominous and dark I felt it matched the tone perfectly and enhanced some parts magnificently, contributing to a nail-biting building of tension.<br/><br/>Of course one couldn't get past reviewing this film without nominating the three great performances at its center. Del Toro, Brolin and Blunt are each better than the other and continue stealing the screen to themselves scene after scene. There really isn't one stand out, the three of them just excel sky high and give depth to characters that are interesting. The characters are really what holds the film together, they are truly developed three dimensionally and explored in depths that aren't normally reached.<br/><br/>What makes the film stumble is the fact that in never has a good enough plot to make things as interesting as they should be. It really has a hard time in setting up which way it's going and in the end it actually doesn't end up with a satisfying resolution. You are certainly left with something to think about because of the themes, the characters, the atmosphere and the intensity, but all in all the plot doesn't offer interesting turns and not enough moral questioning, unlike ""Prisoners"", and so remains slightly one-note for the whole duration. It also has a totally useless character in Blunt's partner, which other than never understanding why he was there or what was his arch in the film, I never understood how he was being played.<br/><br/>Still there is nothing short of amazing in what Villenueve achieves in two hours. What could have been a screenplay turned into a very generic police drama, is actually one of the most atmospheric and tense movies of the year."

","""Sicario"" describes, with surgical precision, the fatal and bloody desecration of Mexico as a result of its decades long cartel war. And it does so by compressing this almost endless tragedy into a two-hour tour-de-force of filmmaking. <br/><br/>At its center we find idealistic FBI-Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who is recruited to pursue a Mexican drug-baron. She is being guided by a seemingly untouchable covert assassin named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Their investigation and methods are pushed further into unknown territory where justice and morality are no longer valid. The end not only justifies the means, it requires them.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve's masterful piece exemplifies not only filmmaking of the highest order, but carves out a place alongside the terrible news reports as a deeply regretful, angry and at times almost unbearable look into the abyss of a socio-political nightmare that is fueled by first world-habit and global economics.<br/><br/>Through the powerful performances by Blunt, Del Toro and Josh Brolin in the leads as well as the excellent supporting cast, do we get a sense of the human cost (physical and psychological), which the war on drugs has taken.<br/><br/>From an exploding prison population, to the destruction of Mexican agriculture, to refugees and a cycle of violence that is beyond barbarity; the pull that ""Sicario"" exerts over the viewer is undeniable and by skirting the limits of bearable tension, without ever becoming exploitive, it is never giving an inch concerning its subject matter.<br/><br/>Few movies this year will have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time, that life nevertheless continues.<br/><br/>Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't miss a single beat and without sidestepping anything frees itself from beaten movie conventions by using familiar elements in an extremely skillful manner.<br/><br/>All these themes, stories and characters are captured through the lens of veteran Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) who lets us always know how the micro- and macro-particles of any conflict are inextricably intertwined. We share the vistas of beautiful sceneries while having to witness their downfall. <br/><br/>Whatever ideals the likes of Emiliano Zapata once had, their country has now, as it is described in the movie, become the land of wolves"". <br/><br/>Fifteen years ago Steven Soderbergh's Traffic"" which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches. Now, all those years later we see in Sicario"" that even the faintest of hopes that Traffic"" held onto have been eviscerated. <br/><br/>What now? One might ask."
"hamish-25851","9","207","279","24 September 2015"," Tense, intelligent drama, with thriller overtones
","The badlands of the US - Mexico border and the viciousness of the drug trade running across it sets the background and the tone for this movie. It's grim. Human life is very cheap and the movie doesn't flinch from showing consequences. There are definitely some scenes that are not for the faint hearted, but there is nothing gratuitous here. If anything - despite the subject matter - the film goes out of its way to avoid Hollywood heroics.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt does an amazing job portraying Kate Macy, a career policewoman heading a SWAT team. Her accent slips slightly a couple of times, but otherwise she's utterly believable as born and raised in the deep south of the US. Kate is a fundamentally decent, honorable human being, trying to the right thing in a world where the rule book doesn't seem to work any more. She's smart, tough, and experienced - but right from the start of the movie, it's clear that she's in over her head.<br/><br/>The tension never lets up. An attack could come at any moment, from any direction. Anything could be a trap. All of it, no matter how extreme something is, plays as real. The director manages scenes expertly to avoid any clean and easy action movie clichés, and it pays off enormously as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>It's also a highly intelligent movie, made for an intelligent audience. It doesn't lay things out on a plate. Instead you have to pay attention and you have to think, just as Kate has to - because her first mistake could be her last.<br/><br/>Staging, costuming, sets, cinematography, and lighting are all perfect. Some airborne shots in particular stand out as both daring and stunningly original, clearly showing just how harsh the landscape is, while managing to propel the story forward - without showing anyone, no less. This part of the movie is in the ""As good as it gets"" category. The only part that I didn't like (and the reason that this doesn't get a 10 from me) was the music. It's used deliberately to heighten tension during some scenes which would otherwise break the feel of the movie, and generally it's done well, but some scenes are spoiled with a There Will Be Blood styled screech. It's really not needed, especially since Sicario's own score manages to build or maintain tension quite successfully in other parts of the movie while remaining low-key.<br/><br/>To my mind, this is much more of a drama than it is a thriller. It's certainly not an action movie. The acting from the support cast is exactly what it needs to be - good in general, and great when a minor character is the focal point - but look closely at how much Benicio del Toro manages to do with no dialogue and not even all that much movement. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>This is a great movie to see if you want to be challenged."

","Probably the best cinematography of this whole year. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro. Music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. It was powerful. Incredible action-thriller. It was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into intense n dark cinema. The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. I hav always been a fan of Brolin after no country for old men. His character was so relaxed n mean with those slip ons quiet opposite to del toro's who u slowly get to know as the movie unfolds. Del toro's character was emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. The only scene i couldn't digest was the dinner scene. I turned my eyes n was shocked for few mins."
"Ramascreen","10","295","411","17 September 2015"," One of this year's best thrillers
","More visceral than Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic."" SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn't allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villenuve reteams with master cinematographer Roger Deakins to take advantage of the desert, the weather, the landscape, the terrain, and use them as silent supporting characters that also serve to express the characters' inner demons. Deakins is a multiple Oscar-nominated DP that gets better with every work and in SICARIO, you will see that he once again experiments with even richer and newer ways of shooting, whether it's the night vision first person view or the angles to capture the intensity at the border, moments before weapons are drawn, it's like enrolling in another classroom taught by Deakins but with extra curriculums to learn. The man just knows how to leave his competition behind.<br/><br/>To me, what I think is impressive about Emily Blunt is that she is beauty and strength all in one. She can express torment and conflicted soul so effortlessly, she plays this FBI agent, Kate Macer who does things by the book, she always holds herself and others accountable for every detail, so when she volunteers to be a part of a black ops that practically throws the book out the window, her idealistic views are put to the test. And I think Emily Blunt does a nice job of executing that. It's somewhat of a fish out of water story where Blunt's Kate Macer knows she's being used but she wants to know what she's being used for. Oscar winner, Benicio Del Toro has walked through this territory before in Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" where he played a Tijuana police officer. In SICARIO, he plays a mysterious character, Alejandro, he's skilled, a man of a few words, soft spoken, but highly intense and has a sharp instinct. What has always been brilliant about Del Toro, in all of his works including SICARIO, is that he can say much without actually saying much at all. In the case of his character, Alejandro, there's a certain dark pain that's magnetic about him. It's all in the eyes. Oscar nominee Josh Brolin plays the leader of the team, Matt Graver, he talks way too damn much but that is also a part of his game, his game of manipulating others.<br/><br/>I've never been to Juarez, I've heard horrible stories about that place, and SICARIO, though it wasn't exactly filmed in Juarez, does manage to put the fear of God in audiences' heart by showing Juarez for what it is, there's no sugar coating, there's no hiding that it's one of the murder capitals of the world. It's a deeply harrowing part that will stay with you long after you've done watching the film which in and of itself wrestles with questions of morality.SICARIO means 'hit-man,' you'll come to wonder which of those three lead characters is the actual hit-man but ultimately, what SICARIO gives you is this dilemma,... if somebody could finally solve the drug cartel and drug kingpin problems for the rest of us, would you really care that they did it by killing instead of bringing the perp to justice?"
"plpregent","7","188","261","5 October 2015"," Splendid in all technical aspects. Slightly flawed fundamentals prevent Sicario from reaching that next level.
","The wait is over. Since the trailer came out, I watched it several times a week. That's how hyped up I was. I finally got to watch Sicario, Denis Villeneuve's latest film. It got a very positive reception at the Cannes festival, and got tons of praise from movie critics worldwide.<br/><br/>My very first recommendation to anyone interested in watching this film is to not watch the trailer, or don't watch it repeatedly like I did. Although it's incredibly exciting, it gives way too much away. Sicario basically consists of approximately 6-7 set-pieces. The trailer shows key moments from all the set-pieces, and leaves you knowing almost just as much about the story as you'll get to know watching the actual film.<br/><br/>Sicario features a pretty thin storyline, but to its defence, it's all part of a tactical approach at keeping things blurry, shady, and mysterious to the audience. Metaphorically, these mechanisms serve the story pretty well, as we watch official government agencies use unorthodox methods and people in this bloody war against the cartels, and the intent is to offer a glimpse at an ongoing situation and let the viewer's imagination fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>That came off as a bit of an odd artistic choice to me, as, in recent years, several films and TV shows have thoroughly explored all the horrors resulting from the war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. It's not exactly a brand new subject matter to worldwide audiences. My point, basically, is that it's an odd timing to choose such a broad approach to a subject that has become familiar to the masses. When my imagination had to fill in the blanks, it basically did it with memories of other films and TV shows exploiting the very same subject matter, and that dug deeper into it.<br/><br/>All the technical aspects of Sicario are off the charts. Denis Villeneuve's directing is spectacular. The sequence with the convoy of SUVs in Juarez has to rank among the most beautifully shot scenes that we have seen in a while, with a combination of breath-taking shots of Mexican landscapes, Juarez and its streets, incredible tension building up inside the vehicles, and how the different characters handle it. Roger Deakin's cinematography is flawless, as expected. Whether portraying a dry, sunny afternoon in Arizona or a nightly tactical operation with agents wearing night vision goggles, Deakins' contribution shines in every possible way. The same can be said about the soundtrack and the editing.<br/><br/>One thing that truly surprised me is how Sicario makes its point. It is intended to leave you with an overall impression on a global situation (the border war, the cartels, the way government agencies operate, etc.), and the actual story and characters become purposely subsidiary in that depiction of a broader picture. This is just another day in this war, just another set of dirty tactics, just another escalation of violence, just another dozen of people among thousands doing shady things in this mess of a war on drugs. <br/><br/>And if there is one flaw to this film, that's where it lies, in my humble opinion. Characters and storyline are fundamentals. Without saying that these two aspects were neglected, I feel like this is where Villeneuve's film could have reached that next level, but unfortunately didn't, by keeping everything so vague, and so volatile.<br/><br/>I'm not going to sugar coat it: Emily Blunt's character is one-dimensional. Her performance is good, but the character has a very simple purpose in the whole picture, and it never goes beyond that. Some secondary characters get enough screen time to let you think that they'll eventually have a true impact on the story, or be part of some sub-plot. Here again, some minor disappointments as a result. Again, it's part of a mechanism to make everyone look like a tiny dot in the big picture, but prevented me from being truly compelled by the story unfolding and most of the characters that were part of it.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin's and Benicio Del Toro's performances are both amazing, though. Again, you do not get to know a lot about them. That being said, the few times when you get to see more than just what's on the surface, you'll get enough hints to partly understand their true nature. But again, you'll notice that I had to use the word ""partly"", especially when it comes to Brolin's character. A lot is left unexplained. And while this opens up a world of possibilities where speculations get darker by the minute, I was left wanting to know more when the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>Overall, Sicario succeeded in leaving me feeling deceived, just like I was an extension of Kate Macer. The way it operates is quite unique, as a lot of unexplained details, characters, and events leave the viewer speculating in an environment filled with lies, shadiness, and broken ideals. The visuals and the soundtrack will blow you away. Also, the final scene was a perfect way to seal the deal, and goes perfectly in line with the ""big picture"" approach that this film takes.<br/><br/>Overall, a very entertaining drama/thriller, full of technical brilliance, and some slightly flawed fundamentals. Definitely worth a watch."
"subxerogravity","8","168","236","18 September 2015"," Well organized story with great characters, performed by great actors
","This is like the stuff you see on hour long serialized Television like Netflix's Narcos, but instead this police like drama is done in a two hour movie instead of thirteenth episodes.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt was amazing in her character, a good FBI agent who feels she's not doing enough on the streets and allows herself to get used by someone with more power, played by Josh Brolin brilliantly as a man who seems uncharismatic about his job in order to hide the covert nature of his mission to find the big man responsible for all the street crime.<br/><br/>Brolin played a necessary evil, that comes off brilliantly in the narrative that plays out. Loved how they go from the bottom and get to the very top. It's very surgical. <br/><br/>But the actor who stole the show in Sicario is Benicio del Toro whose character Alejandro, is a cloud of mystery that unravels slowly through the film, done both subtle and dramatic by Del Toro. Every time he was on the screen even when he did nothing he was doing something and you he demanded your attention.<br/><br/>Plus the music and sound combo of the movie added to the tension. it was powerful.<br/><br/>Incredible action-thriller."
"Kings_Requiem","10","132","193","26 September 2015"," Intensity incarnate
","Jesus.<br/><br/>This was intense. So much so that it made me kind of uncomfortable. I was squirming in my seat. And it was extremely dark. Not color wise, but the subject matter. Villeneuve really knows how to take the most vile subjects and turn them into wholly compelling cinema.<br/><br/>The cast was uniformly excellent. The big three of Blunt, Brolin & Del Toro are all crazy good. Even though Blunt has the lead role it's definitely not a showy part...it's very understated with a lot of it consisting of looks. An internal performance, for sure, but one that might just be the best of her career. Brolin is given a role that at first seems like nothing more than comic relief, but as the film goes on he keeps becoming more and more a part of the character until close to the end when all the jokes disappear and he becomes something else entirely. It was really cool to see that transition. Very good work from him and there are times where it feels like he's stealing the whole movie away from the others. Which brings me to Mr. Del Toro. What else is there to say except Ho Lee Sh!t. This man was just on a completely different level with this performance. Another one that begins very internal consisting of a lot of looks mixed with one or two word responses...then gradually as the film progresses and his background and motives become clearer he, like Brolin, becomes something else entirely. But at the same time never going overboard with it...still keeping that quiet intensity he's had throughout. All three performances are absolutely fantastic and among the best of the year. Hell, Del Toro's might even be the best of the year. Haunting stuff.<br/><br/>As mentioned above this a very intense film. The set-pieces in this are unbelievable. The opening raid, The Border crossing, The night- vision/tunnel sequence and finally The dinner scene. Just pure craziness.<br/><br/>With that being said - I don't think this is an Oscar movie. It's just way too dark for the Academy's liking. Very much like Villeneuve's Prisoners, both films are more than deserving of awards attention, but unfortunately the Academy rarely goes for films this dark.<br/><br/>See this movie ASAP. Preferably in a theater. Just know you might need a shower afterward."

","Feverishly satisfying with pulse-pounding energy that's sure to give your heart its full day's work, Denis Villenueve's masterful ""Sicario"" with Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, and Josh Brolin is an edge of your seat thriller that exemplifies the finest parts of the action genre. Filled with mystery, suspense, and outstanding performances, Villenueve's direction, along a tight script by Taylor Sheridan, brings a much needed sense of technique and art that's been sorely missing from the 2015 movie year.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" tells the story of an idealistic FBI agent names Kate (Blunt), who is enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. With the ""guidance"" of a mysterious agent Alejandro (Del Toro) and her superior Matt (Brolin), and influx of intrigue and morals will shake Kate to her very core.<br/><br/>First and foremost, ""Sicario"" breathes new life into contemporary cinematography, as produced by no less than the great Roger Deakins. A vessel for God's eye on the world, Deakins ignites the fire of his vision, capturing some of the finest shots seen this decade. His use of shadows, CGI, and choices in which to convey and portray emotions is downright genius. Becoming essentially another character in the story, Deakins gives a master's class on cinematography for future craftsmen and women to behold. It's a work that will surely land him his thirteenth Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Above that, we are treated to fantastic and awards worthy performances. Emily Blunt, as seen in nearly everything she touches, shows herself as one of the most interesting and endearing actresses working today. Her courage and vulnerability for Kate is personified by Blunt's ability to connect with the character's soul. She lays into Kate calmly, echoing great performances like Jessica Chastain in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" but with more reserve.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro is downright magnificent. As Alejandro, he delivers his best performance since ""21 Grams."" A dedicated sensation that calls back to all types of performances such as Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"" or Gene Hackman in ""The French Connection."" You won't be able to take your eyes off him. Josh Brolin utilizes every ounce of his charm that has made him one of the most sought after actor's in the business. A memorable, though understated and undervalued character that you do want more clarity about. Other cast members like Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan, Victor Garber, and especially Daniel Kaluuya are given their fair share of opportunity, which all take well.<br/><br/>As a technical endeavor, ""Sicario"" also succeeds in its vibrantly living sound design, and illustrious score by Academy Award nominee Jóhann Jóhannsson. The two are married in a blistering union of tension and heart palpitations. Editor Joe Walker is a shining star behind the scenes as well, thanks to his precision and patience in bringing a scene right to the edge, and knowing when and where to take it next. It's his most innovative work yet, even surpassing his nominated work on ""12 Years a Slave.""<br/><br/>Goes without saying that ""Sicario"" is Denis Villenueve's best work to date. Coming from someone that thoroughly enjoyed ""Prisoners"" and tolerated ""Enemy,"" this is his most accessible and compelling piece. If anything, he's just so damn exciting to watch these days, as he locates strange vehicles for actor's and craftsmen to come together. He takes on a genre that may feel familiar, like the drug cartel, but makes it feel new and smart.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" is hands down one of the year's best films."

","Hard to find a thriller like Sicario these days , watch it!

I must say though that this movie has a political opinions in it that you cant overlook and it can be a little con for some viewers.

","Sicario ('Hitman' in Mexican) is well worth your viewing time. The ever- reliable Emily Blunt excels here as FBI agent and hostage specialist Kate Macer. After a gruesome discovery in Phoenix, Kate becomes an idealistic fish-out-of-water in a complex CIA mission, run by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) against a notorious Mexican drug cartel. Key to the mission is Columbian-born Alejandro (Benicio del Toro): a man with a tragic past that directly guides his future. To tell more would spoil what is a dense and complex storyline that evolves in a most satisfactory manner.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, with Blunt giving a career-best performance (sadly overlooked by the major awards), Josh Brolin being convincing as the war-weathered CIA man and Benicio del Toro delivering his best stone cold killer in gripping style. His Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination is well deserved, albeit for the maintenance of a fairly standard and chilling expression. Finally a name to watch for the future is London-born Daniel Kaluuya as Macer's black FBI colleague frustrated at being sidelined as a 'spare' by the task force. <br/><br/>Equally praiseworthy is the epic cinematography of Roger Deakin (""Skyfall"", ""No Country for Old Men"") which is also Oscar nominated. Remarkable landscapes of the Mexican border are supported by breathtaking helicopter/drone shots of the CIA convoy of black vehicles in one of the tenser moments in the film. Outstanding (for both direction, editing and cinematography) is a scene set in and around a tunnel that is the best satellite/night vision scene since the 'electronic battlefield' in ""Patriot Games"" in 1992.<br/><br/>The Oscar-nominated music by Jóhann Jóhannsson (so good with ""The Theory of Everything"") is of the atonal electronic variety, undoubtedly effective in conveying the film's mood but difficult to compare against the more obvious Oscar nominations from the likes of Ennio Morricone and John Williams.<br/><br/>Directed by Denis Villeneuve (who specialises in single named features) this is a tense, intelligent and thought-providing film that does nothing for Mexico's tourist industry but a lot for Trump's presidential campaign!<br/><br/>Often brutal, this is not an easy film to watch. But it is a highly intelligent watch, requiring your full attention throughout, and is deserving of a place among the best films of 2015.

","I was really stoked about Sicario and went to see it the night it opened. Why was I excited? Well, the posters looked cool and I knew that celebrated director Dennis Villeneuve was expected to deliver a fresh and intelligent suspense movie with a nice dose of action.<br/><br/>That, plus Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin are in it, and I think they're cool.<br/><br/>What I got was a gritty action movie, but unfortunately it wasn't intelligent or thought-provoking. When I'm watching Expendables 3, I'm ready to sit back, enjoy the ride and hold back on the nit-picking. That's not really an option, though, when you have to pay attention to follow the story, and are promised new insights into a deep-rooted problem.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers ahead *** I thought it was clever that we see the plot from the perspective of an ingénue, this time in the form of a ""small-time"" FBI agent (Kate Mercer played by Emily Blunt). After her SWAT team storms a horror house run by the Mexican cartels in which two of her fellow officers are killed, she's ready to go after the big guys. Her new CIA-lead team is willing to use ""unconventional"" (read: highly questionable) methods. They extract a drug lord from a Mexican prison and torture him for information. Kate is told that she is there to ""watch and learn"", but ultimately she finds out that she is only there as a goon to legitimize the CIA operating in the homeland. Her function is not to ""watch and learn"" but to shut up, keep out and to sign a paper at the end. For the time being though, the team storms a tunnel used to smuggle drugs across the border in a scene that seems to take a page straight out of Zero Dark Twenty ...<br/><br/>*** Spoilers thick on the ground from here on *** Sicario really annoyed me because it brings together so much promise with an incredibly lackluster plot. I feel like I could write an entire book about it. What's the point of the horror house at the beginning? If the cartel is using it to dispose bodies, why would they shrink-wrap the corpses? Why are there gun-toting criminals in a house full of incriminating evidence? Why are the corpses behind dry walls (is the cartel planning on renting out the house)? Why is the trap-door booby-trapped? Why do police have to anticipate that in about six months every further crime scene will be booby-trapped if they don't stop the cartel now? When they are illegally extracting the cartel boss from the Mexican prison, why are they doing it in a highly visible convoy? If they anticipate being ambushed just before the frontier, why don't they keep a lane open? Why didn't they use a helicopter? Why don't they just torture the guy in Mexico? What are the ambushers trying to achieve? What is the role of the crooked cop? Could he be any hammier than carrying a gel bend around that the cartel uses to hold their bankrolls together? And on and on.<br/><br/>Five points because of the acting and the cinematography. For an intelligent thriller on the Mexican drugs war, I'd recommend Traffic over Sicario any time."

Nothing special happened really.<br/><br/>Also, usually if they give a woman such a role they tend to show them as strong and smart, but it was hugely disappointing to see Kate literally play a cow, a weak, dumb woman who has nothing else to do except giving curious looks! She is in a sense irrelevant to the film, the story and everything undertaken by that FBI team. The only thing of note that she does is almost having sex with a person from the enemy group!"

","The overall ideas and the way they present the scenes were intense and received quite the reaction it perhaps intended. First few minutes with scary death bodies inside the walls were very promising. However, most of the plots are poorly written, is it real that a big cartel was only guarded by few people? But the other (men) lead characters played their part okay, they lifted the poorly written story a little bit.<br/><br/>Most critics go to Emily Blunt's character. Up until now, I still don't get why was she even there. I don't get the ""tension"" or whatever it is she's supposed to be showing, maybe conflicts? To me, it is unrealistic for a field agent who's been ""kicking doors since day one"" really follow the rules by the book with no adaption at all. And the supposedly ""smart"" agent doesn't get how bad a cartel can be is beyond me - I'm no police but I get how bad ""cartel"" can get, and I only used imagination. I just don't get it, I feel only annoyed with the character, she is really unnecessary. <br/><br/>Overall, I only get this ""annoyed by Emily Blunt"" feeling after watching the movie, not much anything else. I'm giving some marks for the other actors and for the ""tense""."
"parleon-thedon","2","195","348","2 October 2015"," Sicario - Review:
","Sicario doesn't live up to the hype. Emily Blunt's character runs around and stumbles upon things like she's Bella Swan from Twilight: New Moon. Benicio Del Toro's character's story is the most interesting part of the movie but, his story doesn't come about until halfway into the movie. Emily Blunt is completely underutilized here; Her character makes some of the stupidest decisions but, some of it is justified. All Emily Blunt really does in this movie is stumble upon things, makes stupid decisions, and smokes a ton of cigarettes. Benicio Del Toro is a bad-ass in this movie and his scenes are the most interesting, but Del Toro's story isn't engaging enough because it is lacking what the rest of the movie is lacking... a story. Sicario plays more on beats, tone, images, and simplicity rather than dramatic story elements and sentimental emotion. This movie is extremely blood soaked, violent, and sometimes haunting, but that's all it has going for it. This movie means nothing, it starts nowhere, and it ends nowhere. The movie is 100% predictable minus a couple of moments with Del Toro towards the end. If you want to see a boring tension-filled blood-soaked horror feast than enjoy. If you want to see an engaging and emotionally charged character driven story (including all of the extreme blood-soaked horror violence) than pass on this one because it's not present."

","What is it with so many movies these days? Mumbling, diffuse dialog that can barely be heard, never mind understood. Worst offender - Emily Blunt.

When combined with a horrendous character that has no back story or dimensions whatsoever, her role is probably the most frustrating aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>Oh yes - there are long scenes of lines of shiny SUVs driving about. I won't spoil it by telling you where they are going or why, but in places this looked like a Chevy SUV commercial.<br/><br/>Ultimately, some stuff happened, and it did show the horror and tragedy of drug cartels. It also was a movie with a tissue-thin, predictable plot, awful character development, inane dialog.<br/><br/>This is yet another example of either padded ratings on the IMDb, or a public that really hasn't seen very many truly great movies.

"dnford","10","6","7","16 January 2020"," Harsh reality handled beautifully
","Of all the things this movie is, it is first and foremost honest.
Yeah we want Emily Blunt to kick doors down, shoot the bad guys, and overpower any of the men who consistently overpower her. However, the female FBI operative who is new to the drug war and constantly in the dark about what is going on cannot do any of those things and is forced to submit time and time again as the strong exploit the weak.
Set against the backdrop of the Mexican drug war but not about it, Sicario asks how far you would go to actually make a difference, and what it would take to push you further. Emily Blunt time and time again makes the right and good decision, and then gets shot, abused, or otherwise traumatized with no payoff. Real life is much like this: despite a hero's or-in this case-heroine's best efforts, the strong often just take what they want.
Backed by beautiful cinematography and a constant tension from the heartbeat-like soundtrack and personal camera work, Sicario weaves complex themes together into an intense yet digestible movie."
"lasttimeisaw","8","21","32","24 December 2015"," a big bravo to Villeneuve and his crew
","The premise of Denis Villeneuve's latest picture SICARIO sounds like a top-form police procedural, a CIA elite squad vs. a Mexican drug cartel, Emily Blunt plays Kate, acts a surrogate for audience, who is an FBI SWAT agent, wide-eyed but enterprising in her field of work, volunteers to join the special division, lead by Matt Graver (Brolin), to track down the big boss behind the cartel in Mexico. But as the film explains in its first scene, SICARIO means hit-man in Spanish, so who is this hit-man? This is a vital question.<br/><br/>We faithfully empathises Kate's perplexity as the mission goes on, where she begins to question the unorthodox method of Matt and Alejandro (del Toro), Matt's partner, and is constantly aggravated by being kept in the dark about their black ops. But the whole process will eventually evolve into a shock treatment for her idealistic faith, what behind the whole plan is beyond her widest imagination and comprehension, after being nearly strangled to death, shot by her own people and hectored to sign her signature to approve something sheer against her principle, until her final scene, a silent capitulation aptly and soundingly strikes the bull's-eye, a tough lesson about the unapologetic nihilism of our present society, which very likely is also the inconvenient truth. Emily Blunt pluckily takes up the gauntlet to challenge the glass ceiling, materialises as a tower of strength in this men's business, a tragic heroine, solemnly stomaches a nasty reality check.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays in his comfort zone with his craftiness and insolence, whose opportunistic characteristic positions Matt's seemingly-righteous métier in a grey zone. But the film's MVP title unequivocally belongs to del Toro's Alejandro, stuns with his all-out reserved gravitas and a steely resolution for retribution, gradually reveals his true colours as a cut-throat angel-of-death and a proficient marksman in the third act (he is the said hit-man we are looking for), leads towards a series breathless encounters with the wrongdoers of the drug ring and an ultimate face-to-face with Kate, he is the most chilling character on screen after Javier Bardem in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007), if ever the movie will collect any Oscar love in the acting branch, he is the most entitled one.<br/><br/>After his Hollywood one-two punch PRISONERS (2013) and ENEMY (2013), Villeneuve's directorial finesse again being appraised here, and he is such a first-rate ambiance deviser, together with the assistance of Jóhann Jóhannsson's stirring score, the thumping drumbeat in the opening is so palpable to set the mood upon that right vibe, yet, Villenueve knows the boundary, he doesn't overly resort to shock value to keep audience on the edge of the seat, which is brilliantly testified by the opening gambit with exchanges of fire, sudden explosion and ghastly cadavers. In a much wiser strategy, he makes good use of DP Deakins' majestic camera-work to varnish the film with a sublime tinge of poise and magnificence, like the breathtaking aerial shots, striking environmental palettes or the novel usages of thermal vision and night vision frames, they are where cinema finds its most glorious and enthralling achievement, a big bravo to Villeneuve and his crew, soon he will become a juggernaut in the Hollywood industry, and his next project on the slate is the long-waited sequel of BLADE RUNNER (1982), since it might actually be the rare kind that does not sully its predecessor's reputation, shall we all drink to that?"
"sammyxander","9","22","34","24 December 2015"," Awesome Movie. Story delivers..
","I found this movie quite enjoyable and captivating. Every moment lent its part to the story which by the way, was quite well written. Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin are the star actors for me. They all play key roles and deliver beautifully on their parts.<br/><br/>Having read the other comments especially those that rated it poorly for various reasons, I would love to address those I can:<br/><br/>1)Poorly written story/not up to potential: On the contrary, the story did exactly what it was meant to do..People who watch movies through genre-specific lenses would be disappointed of course.. I do not, instead I just follow the story plot step by step and watch it unravel.. They did an excellent job here keeping the viewer guessing what the objective could be until it finally unravels at the end. This made the movie a lot more interesting for me..<br/><br/>The dead bodies in the walls of the house that was raided at the beginning and the headless corpses hanging off the bridge are pointing to the same thing.. 'The grim nature of a drug cartel run world..' end-of!! To make or expect anything more of it is to your own peril..<br/><br/>2)Character of Emily Blunt (Kate) was useless: What?? Then such a viewer did not get the story. Again the very well written story supplied us with all the necessary details.. Kate (FBI agent) and her partner where recruited/needed to legitimize the operation of the CIA within that region.. <br/><br/>Secondly, Kate was the typical idealist from the black and white world where she reigned as something of a star.. Throwing her into the larger and darker world where the lines of good and evil are not well defined but rather a blurry mess of gray matter.. gives the viewer the opportunity to see the collision of these two worlds and the effect it has on the key players.. <br/><br/>True to her nature, Kate fails to realize when she is out of her depth; she fails to adapt.. even after her boss Jennings advises her to do so but in her small mindedness with little or no understanding tries to stamp her self-importance on the circumstance she finds herself in. However she is completely and expertly knocked-out.. Oh what a joy!! It is precious to see her character give in to defeat when she lowers the gun she has pointed at Alejandro at the end.. The disaster here would have been if the story gave her character some kind of triumph in her misguided quest for justice.. That would have been unrealistic and irritating.. <br/><br/>This is the reason for Kate's character, to present us with the dichotomy between the small fairy-tale land of rules and the much larger and darker land of the wolves..<br/><br/>This is a must watch!!!"

","Great story, yeah.<br/><br/>It's impossible to ignore such a poor dramaturgy. Is it a trending thing these days? Recently made Godzilla has the same major flaw - main characters are just... witnesses. Why should I care if I witness the same chain of events by myself? How come victims of circumstances became protagonists?? Aren't they supposed to act, to choose, to make decisions and deal with consequences? If not, what are they doing there? Watching this movie with me?<br/><br/>It could be a good solid story about Alejandro's revenge and his transformation from law&order man to merciless murderer. Or about his conflict with Kate. But since Kate doesn't do anything, it's not a conflict. She is absolutely useless element. So is her FBI partner by the way.<br/><br/>Cinematography is very cool but that's why it makes the film even worse. I could expect something like this from a cheap b-movie made by inexperienced team, but not from Villeneuve's product."

","Strong, raw and very well acted, enough ingredients to go and watch it. The script is very interesting, because unravels in a nonlinear process how Blunt and Del Toro become perfect nemesis. The film also shows the crudeness of the American border where anything can happen and that there are no limits to human misery. On the technical side, it was perfectly filmed, has appropriate sound effects and the soundtrack increases the tension of the whole movie. I recommend it, as long as someone is willing to accept very crude scenes, cause it is one of those movies where you immerse and lose consciousness of time and fell one more of the cast."

The ending of that scene reduces a lot of the shock by not taking in the account of checking everything properly in such a big operation as this seems to be.

Especially the final scene is laughable because Del Toro's entry into this big mansion is so easy it is hard to explain that such an important cartel boss who could expect something like this is so unprotected. I would at least expect something along the lines like they did it in ""scarface"" with Al Pacino and that was way back in the 80's.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt,Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin all played roles way beneath their top roles in other movies and a lot of characters and the overall story were written poorly and only some set pieces stand out and therefor it gets another star.<br/><br/>I'm amazed I saw hints for a sequel and I don't even wanna think what that would be like knowing how stupid this one was and I will definitely pass on that one.<br/><br/>This is just to much of a mess to be called realistic or even entertaining and for me I am done with this and hope everyone involved will go on and do something better.<br/><br/>Will not go so far to not recommend this but I'll never watch it again.<br/><br/>If you get something good out of it,I'm happy for you.<br/><br/>But for me personally.....neh!"

Not that the two have a lot in common, plot or character-wise, but rather they are both movies that were given ridiculously great reviews by critics, but left myself and others wondering, why?<br/><br/>The usually likable Emily Blunt has a dull character. She's one- dimensional, she has nothing distinct about her in any way, no quirks to suggest she's anything but a cardboard cut-out. This is a major problem when you feel that way about the lead character. How are you supposed to care about what happens in the story when you don't care about the lead? <br/><br/>The directing, also, it felt very detached and uninvolving.

","This is not an action movie, despite what the trailer suggested. However, even if you think of it as an drama-thriller type of movie you will be disappointed. Overall the movie makes no sense at all. The story is stupid and has no depth whatsoever to it. Despite some great scenes without cuts and good acting by some people this movie has nothing to offer. In my humble opinion good craftsmanship alone does not make a movie.<br/><br/>The character Emily Blunt plays is completely irrelevant in this movie. The role of this character could've been played by a manikin. Blunts acting is okish, but is ridiculed by the script. She has no influence on the story, just like the first Indiana Jones everything would've happened the way it did, even if Blunts character would not have existed in the first place. Instead of casting Blunt they should've went for a approach similar to ""End of Watch"".<br/><br/>The naivety of Blunts character is annoying to say the least, the story predictable without any twists.<br/><br/>The movie is perfect for people who watch it with an exact opinion about the US-Mexico drug trade derived problems and want to see their opinions endorsed."
"chaos-rampant","Null","29","52","21 December 2015"," Shifting the boundary
","This is simple but fine in the sketch; a horrendous border crime is uncovered in a house on the US side, it calls for a response of some kind, consequences. In an ideal world, the machinery of justice would whir into place and produce order, culprits would be apprehended, but it's not that kind of world, is it?<br/><br/>The whole point is that gears will turn, something resembling justice will be served, but the turning will shuffle morals, shift boundaries of what someone can get away with in a closed room or in the dark of the night when no one's there to watch. <br/><br/>The idea is that discord must be introduced, deliberate, planned disorder; a cowboy is brought in from this or that shady Washington agency to ruffle feathers, stir the waters to see what comes out from hiding. The film knowingly stirs all these elements on its surface, without the rat-ta-ta convulsions of the CIA airport thriller.<br/><br/>We have a medievally barbarous cartel on the enemy side so that even though the shuffling unnerves, we will wearily concede the necessity. But this makes it a truth demanding no less of our discourse; would you have it different? Is anything made right, or does any of it restore more than a passing order of appearances? A new head will be appointed the next day, the turning goes on.<br/><br/>But this will do just fine in the vicinity that it puts itself. Thriller in mechanics, but leaves room for anxiety that must be faced in the world. Tethers pulled taut in visual stretches, the land hums. With a little more ironic distance in the turn we would be in Coens territory, with a little more human friction in Sayles' turf."
"will-howlett","1","117","241","28 October 2015"," Total garbage
","Halfway through I wondered whether this might be a piece of experimental filmmaking to see whether its possible to maintain a lead character who has absolutely no agency whatsoever. It was afterwards, when I found out the script was by one of the bros behind Sons of Anarchy, where my having just sat through two hours of the only female character being ferried around by all the manly men whilst crying and asking what she should do next made perfect sense.<br/><br/>In terms of character development it's paper thin, and standard sexist tripe. Blunt's character's only moment of development is when we find out she hasn't had a boyfriend for years and hasn't been bothering to pluck her eyebrows. Del Toro's back-story turns out to be his need to avenge his wife and daughter's over the top murders. Yawn. Del Toro, to his credit, gives the best performance in the film, and reminded me of a manky Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>It's yet another male power fantasy, and a real waste of Emily Blunt's talents. After her great performance in Edge of Tomorrow I had been hoping for more butt kicking, but she literally does nothing in the whole film. The film could have almost made up for this, and had some kind of point to it, if it had allowed her a final moment of agency at the end by forcing Del Toro to kill her, but instead she just has another cry.<br/><br/>There are a couple of nicely made tense action sequences (involving the male characters of course), however they are lost in the dreary pacing of the rest of the film (I think the creators were aiming for prolonged artful suspense, but they failed).<br/><br/>Instead of watching this film I could have stayed home and done the dishes. As it is they are still piled up waiting for me. In an alternate universe they are done by now and I never wasted my time on this piece of garbage."
"teddyryan","5","35","65","5 October 2015"," Potential Hindered by Script
","SICARIO has the recipe for a delicious movie. You have the director of Prisoners, Benicio, Brolin, and a kick ass score. You provide drugs and a drug war - I am there. That being said, this movie has no climax and flat lines - another beautifully made clunker. The scenes waiver like a flounder off the coast of Baja.<br/><br/>Instead of ending with a strong finish, Sicario does the reverse. You're gripping your seat at the beginning. By the end, you want out and/or are praying for a fix. <br/><br/>I might give Sicario a 6 because the director threw the right ingredients into the chicken and his direction (shots and performances) is spot on - unfortunately, it collapses under the weight of a flimsy screenplay. I think this picture is on par with TRAFFIC (a movie that has great pieces but succumbs to the misguided written word). <br/><br/>*SPOILER Personal opinion, I wish the Emily Blunt character was casted with a dude. The female portrayal by the writer is like a Clarice Starling on a bad batch of Tylenol PM.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin must have lit the script on fire when asked to memorize one line. He improvises to such an extent, I started wondering if he knew the plot of the movie. Thank God he had some semblance of an interesting character to work with - I think he's enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>This is no fault of his own but due to circumstance.

"bnitcamela","6","27","49","22 September 2017"," Irresponsible in the way it depicts sicarios and drug war violence
","This movie gets way too much hype for the fantasy that it actually is. The vast majority of murders and kidnappings in the Mexico cartel wars are carried out by males in their 20s and in mostly amateur fashion. The depiction of the Super Sicario here is pure Hollywood. The idea of a Super Sicario who expertly hunts down American agents and moves within their ranks is absolutely ridiculous. Also, the idea that there are delta force (type) raids and assassinations going on with U.S. military or covert assets is simply not accurate. When a Mexican cartel boss or lieutenant is brought down in real life, it's generally in boring fashion while they hide in a hotel room or get involved in a shootout with a rival cartel. Finally, illegal practices such as torture are glamorized and depicted as effective, when all real-world intel gathering professionals will tell you otherwise. Cross border tunnel raids in which dozens are killed is just the icing on the Hollywood cake. <br/><br/>In any case, this is obviously fiction and the film does try to depict the nebulous nature of the war on drugs near the U.S.-Mexico border. The story is taut and very well directed by Villeneuve. The film does not take a stand on one side or the other - the drug trade and all the violence that it entails, especially in the 2000's, is the direct result of American demand for the product. Further, the movie attempts to demonstrate that the volume of drugs passing through (or under) our border crossings simply would not be possible without massive corruption on both sides. <br/><br/>All in all I was disappointed because I am very familiar with the areas in which it was set and the U.S-Mexico dialectic concerning the war on (some) drugs and horrific cartel violence in Juarez, MX. I thought that while the direction was more than competent, it wasn't Villeneuve's best work and that Taylor Sheridan took way too much creative license and that the end result was a highly stylized flick that doesn't capture the boring and even more horrifying aspects of the situation in Mexico. I suppose my main problem with the movie, however, was the idea of a super assassin and that it depicts the U.S. as way more interested in what is going on down there than it actually is."
"WildBullWriter","1","24","43","14 May 2016"," Poorly made flick, as anyone knowing the subject will recognize
","First, the female protagonist (played by Blunt) is not credible at all; very unrealistic. She's supposed to be the head of an FBI SWAT team, which would suggest a tough person but she is a wimp at every turn, totally bewildered by violence and the nuances of drug enforcement. She also lives/works in Arizona and seems to know nothing about the cartels or drug war politics. It's an insult to the viewer (and to women in general) to have such a character as lead in a movie like this. Total disappointment in this regard.<br/><br/>Second, the plot line is not credible. Rather than spoil the storyline (for those who haven't seen the flick), I'll just say that the big gunfight/conflict scene toward the end is completely unnecessary given the ultimate goal of the operation. In fact, real law enforcement would have avoided such unpredictable and unnecessary complications. So that part is total Hollywood crap, and could easily have been avoided.<br/><br/>Finally, the ultimate goal of the operation is not credible. Again, not to spoil it for anyone, I'll just say that the goal is completely unbelievable given the international politics of the drug war. A similar goal could have been credible but the one used shows the film's writer and director and producers know little about the subject.<br/><br/>So, overall a very poorly made flick, and a disappointment for those who value realism."

It's certainly a plus, and adds to the impending sense of dread and tension that are ever present throughout, but when looking back on it now you can see none of this really amounts to much.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's Kate Macer joins a group of operatives in searching for those responsible for a number of bombs and hideaways that have been located. Sure enough she finds the team aren't playing by the book. Seeming as she's been done over by her employers you can understand her inevitable resentment, especially when pitched against her occasionally uncompromising and unorthodox team, although her character almost resigns to being a caricature in certain moments, especially when in the final scenes she gets on her high horse over her superiors about what she sees as an unacceptable change in the mission objective (which is all for good really).<br/><br/>Indeed, Blunt's sturdy performance is undermined by her characters' clichés. She's supposed to be a professional and tactful FBI agent, so as she constantly wallows in her loathing and disgust against the system (which reaches its' apex in her final scene), it comes across as self indulgent rather than sad, probably because those clichés are portrayed as deadly serious and 'realistic', something the film tries very much to be, and heavily exert on the audience. It becomes increasingly irritating. Equally as frustrating is how a woman with her skill set can't successfully defend herself against a corrupt cop she fights with in a rather intense struggle.<br/><br/>There's solid supporting turns by Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro, the latter of which especially excelling in a role which barely gives anything away until the reveal in the climax; his world-weary tired expressions hiding a tortured and complicated persona. He has some of the most stand-out scenes in the film, especially in the aforementioned climax where he really comes into his own.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad brilliantly portrayed the whole cartel network as a dark and subversive world which has wormed its' way into normal society. It was both harrowing and thrilling to watch, not least because it was mixed into a solid story of an everyday man interacting with this world, which had lasting consequences for either side, but because it developed basically; constantly growing ever deeper and darker and complex, while never losing its true focus.<br/><br/>I can't say the same about this though. For all its' worth in how its' framed and constructed, you can't help asking yourself why did they bother making this film. Sicario is essentially a series of expertly staged but one-dimensional set pieces before moving along neatly to the end showdown, which incidentally barely involves the disillusioned Macer. It's a simplistic film disguised as a clever and intricate work of art.<br/><br/>This isn't all to say it's a terrible film, because it's not. It's engrossing and intriguing in equal measure, in certain parts of the film that is, notably the opening and ending. The landscape is portrayed as haunting and unforgiving, and is essentially the main star of the piece, because it lends itself to the whole aesthetic of the movie. You simply don't know what's going to happen next; it's one of those movies, and yes, first time viewing there is a couple of rather distressing scenes. Once seen though, and when you realise it's just a basic serious drama, you may find it hard to have the patience to then sit through again what has become a slow and rather pretentious piece of cinema, especially when considering this story has been told before, and much, much, better, on the small screen. Forgettable."
"gregsrants","9","49","98","20 September 2015"," Best Film of the Year
","Of the nearly 400 films being showcased at this year's Toronto  International Film Festival (TIFF), Denis Villeneuve's Sicario was the  one film at the top of my 'Must See' list. Having premiered at this  year's Cannes Film Festival where it went on to be nominated for the  prestigious Palme D'Or, Sicario stars Emily Blunt, Joh Brolin and  Benicio Del Toro as members of a government task force who attempt to  apprehend a villainous drug lord.   Director Denis Villeneuve is on some kind of roll. His previous films   Polytechnique, Incendies and Prisoners  were all thought provoking  character pieces offset by realistic and graphic depictions of  violence. Sicario opens with just such a scene as Blunt's Kate Macer  leads a rain on a Mexican drug house near Phoenix, Arizona and  discovers dozens of executed victims packed into the walls. Audiences  will have barely settled in their seats and scrunched on but a handful  of popcorn kernels when the shocking revelation is revealed on screen.   From here, Macer is forced to work with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and  Alejandro (Del Toro) who works as a sort of fixer on both sides of the  border. Their work leads them to drug trafficker Fausto (Julio Cesar  Cedillo) and the group then works to transport the criminal back across  the border. Their journey will be met with many obstacles with  shoot-outs at border crossings and a tense hunt and shoot inside a drug  trafficking tunnel connecting the two countries.   The focus of Sicario (which is Mexican slang for 'hitman') is clearly  on Blunt's lead character and Blunt is up to the task in being the  smartest person in the room while also being the one most left in the  dark as to the team's objectives. She will be continually conflicted by  her male peers particularly their penchant for instigating or  responding forcefully to appeared violence. The action settled between  Macer's first-hand education thrust the film forward to a very  satisfying and acceptable conclusion.   The supporting cast is equally engrossing particularly Del Toro who  will be on screen for most all of the film's most memorable shots. Del  Toro's character is clouded in mystery and unclear motives and Del Toro  gives his best performance since Traffic.  Sicario was penned by Taylor Sheridan who played Deputy Chief Hale on  FX's Sons of Anarchy. His take on the war on drugs and the violence and  human costs that surround the battle are dead on target. The realism  results in Sicario being hardly the crowd-pleaser. It is a bleak and  grim film that might just be Villeneuve's best work to date.   The photography by Roger Deakins is stunning. Expect Deakins to garnish  another Academy Award nomination for his efforts here to go with his  work on The Shawshank Redemption and Skyfall.   Also worthy of note is the music by Jóhann Jóhannsson that grabs you by  the balls while the action unfolds.   Sicario might be too bleak for Academy voters, but make no mistake of  Sicario's impact and brilliance. It was on my 'Must See' list for a  reason and did not disappoint. Easily the best film of the year so far."

","The movie is slow and pure drama. There are better plots and story lines that can be created to present how a drug lord is shot dead and how a tunnel is found. <br/><br/>I fail to find tension in the movie. It isn't an intelligent movie as it lacks the phenomenon of suspense that many thrillers and drama movies create. The visual effects and camera angles are poor at many times. There is hardly any use of technology besides the ""drone"" which is a let down for a movie projecting law enforcement in their fight against drugs.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt - one of her worst roles ever. She performs well but is more of a lackluster character. As an FBI agent she surprisingly has no physical strength or mental toughness. Her FBI partner is an unnecessary addition to the movie budget. <br/><br/>There are better movies to watch."

No story whatsoever, The chick's part is a sexist chick's part, has no taste, has no meaning, only a waste of time and cigarettes. No action- maybe 50 shots fired, and maybe 10 people killed overall (nicely done by an Del-Toro).

If it wasn't for the high rating and the awesome yet dull in this Del-Toro i would've never watched this movie or recommend anyone to ever watch it, ever. And ever and ever.

"LeonvanKamp","10","12","20","24 January 2016"," 'Sicario' comes from the Roman term for zealot...
","Sicario is technically speaking a great film; it looks beautiful, the score is suitably daunting and the acting of the highest order. But what makes Sicario a timeless film is the message it subtly delivers. <br/><br/>There are those who criticize both the role of Emily Blunt's character (Kate Mercer) and the plot as being overly simplistic. And while I see their point of view, I suspect that these critics, much like those who praise the film as being a vindication of the idea that the 'means justify the ends', are both missing the actual point of this film.<br/><br/>Sicario should not be seen as movie that argues for brutal measures against brutal forces. Although that is what the actual plot delivers, the plot is merely a vessel to deliver a much more important, and more difficult message to swallow; That the USA's and global posture of the war on drugs since the late 1980's has only made the situation worse for all in involved (especially those who live in countries where the production and mass distribution occur). <br/><br/>Brolin's character (Matt Graver) essentially plays the voice of the devil's advocate and Del Toro's character (Alejandro) acts as the devil's hand. Both of them believe that the only solution is to create some semblance of order. Even going so far as aiming to replicate the 'Medellin' period, when Pablo Escobar almost single handedly controlled the global drug trade (for those interested, I highly recommend Netflix's 'Narcos'). <br/><br/>Anyone with some idea of that period will know that any semblance of order that existed under the Medellin cartel, was just as brutal and violent, only it primarily cost the lives of Colombians rather than allowing the violence to spill over into the USA itself.<br/><br/>This film should be seen as an argument, a powerful one at that, of just what our global hypocrisy towards drugs is costing us. That the people of Mexico, Central and South America (and a whole host of others who find themselves in the ever expanding network of the drug trade) are soaking up most of the brutality so that the rest of the world can pretend our legislation and our redundant conservative stance against legalizing drugs of any form is working (for those who have watched the film, think of the end scene). <br/><br/>We do not need to ""figure out how to get 20% of Americans to stop snorting and smoking s***"". We need to come to terms with the fact that as long as any substance is illegal, there will always be those ready to take the risks and be as ruthless as necessary, to benefit from the absurd margins our legislation creates. <br/><br/>The world has created an artificial and highly profitable supply problem for drugs and it is becoming more difficult with each passing year, to wrest control away from those who profit of it, and I'm not just talking about drug-lords here. <br/><br/>The events in Sicario are still possibly fictional (in terms of the how the drug trade is being combated), but unless we take its actual message to heart, it will, sooner that we would like to believe, become an ever present reality. A reality where violence becomes the default solution, a reality where the 'lobos' and 'Sicarios' roam free and make dens from Juarez all the way to the national capitals of every nation on Earth."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","50","105","9 October 2015"," Froget about those 7~10 stars high ratings
","Actually, this movie sucks big time! Ginving it 5 stars is already too generous and too kind. Why? Because the screenplay and the casting were not that great. Why put a female FBI agent in this mix? Why chose a not so great and strong-minded female agent to be one of the team that needed 99% violence, extreme cruelty to do a drug war job? This female agent didn't show any potential and flexibility on par with the other team members, on the contrary, she was weak, clueless, unwilling, awkward and sometimes, even stupid. Her weakness seemed to be also the weakest part of this film. Why this drug lord hunting needed a pawn-like female FBI agent to make the mission legit? With the presence of a FBI agent and her signature on a paper would be able to legalize what they did, the constant killings, the cross over the border doing the hunting? Give me a break! <br/><br/>Why chose Emily Blunt to play such role? She didn't even look a bit like a competitive agent, albeit an agent with higher ranking position and well experienced. Blunt got a very embarrassing face, a victim facial expression no matter what kind of roles she played. Most of the time in this film and other films she was in, she couldn't close her mouth, her upper and lower lips seemed to have a problem to close; she couldn't keep her mouth shut. A face always looked so sad, seemed to burst into tears in any moment. She just looked so sad, like somebody in her family just died or had accident, or she was informed she got cancer or something. Her eyes always looked so sad. She was not a convincing actor who could make people believe that she is the exact right cast in any film. She also gives people an impression of weakness, weak-minded, unwilling to committing. None of her characters in any film really impressed enough to be great, yet her career seems prosperous. She's one of the actors that only make me wonder what's going on in the Hollywood casting business.<br/><br/>There were so many ridiculous or unnecessary scenes that proved the director is not a good one, the production team is incapable to the extreme. Why they used vehicles to paraded into Mexico and marched back to the U.S. and stuck-ed in the line at the border control? Why they didn't use choppers to bring back the drug guy in Mexico? So it's legal to have convoy on the road but illegal in the air? Or it's just because they needed such arrangement to shoot the scene of the ambush? To me, it's just a totally stupid and highly unlikely crappy scenario.<br/><br/>Then, the tunnel fighting scene. It's another stupid arrangement, totally. Guys used night vision devices at first, then it showed that the night vision goggles were absolutely useless in the tunnel. The firefight scene in the tunnel was also a stupid arrangement, simply for the purpose of creating an unnecessary tensified segment to patch up the already disastrous film directed by an over-the-top director with limited talent, together with a bunch of pea-brained screenplay writers.<br/><br/>The CIA guy with so much power like in this film? Should he be a DEA guy instead? Why we always made a CIA guy wear flip-flops, without tie, dressed so sloppy and gave him so much authority to do anything he liked? It's so clichéd too, man. A film just used the American tax dollars to carry out a personal vendetta. <br/><br/>There were lot of smoke on and on, but in the end, we never saw any meaningful fire. This film is like what usually heard in the dark night, ambulance siren coming along from afar, then passing where you lived, then the noise gradually died down. We never knew who was the patient, what kind of emergency, what kind of illness that needed ambulance to carry that person rushing to the hospital. We just heard the siren, but we didn't see anything. This is exactly like this film."

","Bad movies can be subdivided into the truly bad and those with heart, a world-view or something to say. ""Sicario"" sadly is merely bad. Though it certainly looks good with great locations, aerial shots and fine special effects, beneath its visual aesthetics, it is an empty vehicle. The story is the drug war on the US and Mexico border. It involves the interplay between local law enforcement, the Feds and other government entities. Though more details might also be spoilers, I have chosen to pass on illuminating more because the details matter little as the writer and director seemingly believe in nothing? This nihilism curses the film and makes every plot point, character and political statement vapid and disposable. From Mexico's corruption and America's drug use as enabler to this tragedy, everyone and everything are mere props used only to advance story and then willfully thrown away. The actors are skilled with Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin their usual quirky selves but Emily Blunt is used up as story vehicle / protagonist and like the rest of this film's caricatures; discarded once they are no longer of use. As one who loves bad film, there is a certain honor in an awful work where the creator failed but at least believed in something. Sicario was a bad film which frittered away a studio's money and the artistic abilities of actors and a film crew for nothing. The horrible real life tragedy that is the drug war and destruction of the once wonderful city of Juarez were treated as disposable shorthand for film maker's bereft of soul."

All are cookie cutter characters we've seen before so I just couldn't get into it. The one pleasant surprise was Jeffrey Donovan (Burn Notice) making a nice cameo.

","How this movie got a rating of 8.1 baffles me. The plot is idiotic, the filming is terrible, the characters are shallow, the acting is wooden, and the whole thing is predictable and boring, and it even tries to be routinely preachy near the end. A rating of 8 or more is rare on IMDb, so one would expect an outstanding show. This show is garbage. I seriously considered giving it a 1 instead of a 2 just to help offset the grossly misleading 8.1, but I decided in the end to give it the rating I thought it deserved, which is a 2 rather than a 1 because it does convey some idea of the violence of the Mexican drug wars and the viciousness of the drug lords.<br/><br/>The main character is Kate, an FBI agent who is good at what she does and so is recruited to join a special anti-drug unit. Kate is very idealistic, whereas the anti-drug unit does what it has to do. The point of the movie is to show the conflict Kate goes through in trying to reconcile her idealism with the violent reality of the anti-drug unit. The first third or so of the movie comprises close-ups of Kate's face as she takes in and tries to digest what she sees. We have Kate in profile, Kate in full frontal view, Kate in 3/4 profile, over and over and over. Emily Blunt, who portrays Kate, acts like a block of wood, so the close-ups completely fail to convey any emotion or any real feel of Kate's thoughts and emotions. The rest of the movie continues in the same vein but without so many close-ups of Kate's face.<br/><br/>The last third of the movie (3 scenes: the tunnel, the assassination, and the final scene) are shot in the dark so that the viewer cannot see what is going on most of the time. The most ludicrous passage in the entire movie occurs during the assassination scene, when the bad guy (a drug lord) tells the good guy (the US agent who is sort of a bad guy, too) that the people he works for (the US government) are no better than the drug lords. About the violence the drug lords perpetrate, he asks, ""Who did we learn it from?"" Ah, yes. Another Hollywood statement that beneath it all, the US is to blame for yet another world problem. Apparently the US taught the drug lords to cut off people's heads, throw live people vats of acid, and so on. Happens all the time in the US, right?<br/><br/>Other reviewers in the ""Hated It"" category have a done a good job of detailing the various idiocies of the plot, so I won't repeat them. Just take it from me that everything bad they say about the movie is true.<br/><br/>This movie pretends to be one of gritty realism. It is really just trash in every regard."

"ctowyi","8","19","39","17 September 2015"," Sicario... In Mexico it Means Hit-man
","After getting awestruck by Denis Villeneuve's Incendies (2010), I told myself I will see anything made by him. The spellbinding Prisoners (2013) came next followed closely by the only slight misstep Enemy (2014). Villeneuve is no flash in the pan. He has a terrific knack of grabbing you by the neck and slowly wringing it until you go white hot with nerve- wrecking tension. <br/><br/>I think the armrest of GV@Suntec Cinema 6, Seat G10 might have been broken by me because I had practically gripped and shaken it for 2 hours straight. This is one taut, lean and mean thriller. Every shot by DP Roger Deakins holds so much indescribable menace. Even a shot of a boy rolling a ball across table had my heart in my mouth thinking that a shot would ring out and his brains would splatter all over the dining table. A slow building wide shot of a looming mountain feels like it could explode anytime. Innocuous delicate scenes become fierce, primal and shattering in scope. They are almost Hitchcockian but yet they are their own entity. Nobody does white-knuckled mounting suspense like Villeneuve. <br/><br/>Our heart and mind is aligned with Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) as she leads a tactical team to storm a house near the Mexican border which ends up blowing in the faces of the team, literally. She is our moral compass as she becomes continually torn in how justice is not meted out by the book. Blunt is great in the role and she continues her amazing streak as a steel-edged lady justice figure with aplomb. As much as she is our 'go-to' character in the story, it is Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) who is the spanner in the works, the winning wild card. His intriguing role outshines Blunt's in spades. When he finally becomes the namesake in the film title (in Mexico, 'sicaro' means hit-man), your jaw would have dropped to the floor. Villeneuve's superb foreshadowing is masterclass. At one early point he says to Kate: ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears. You will doubt what we do. But, in the end, it will make sense."" As much as these slightly condescending words are meant for Kate, they are also meant for us. <br/><br/>Unlike the rest of Villeneuve's oeuvres, the action scenes here are more explosive than the drama. There are a few stupendous highlights like the fugitive extraction scene and the tunnel storming sequence, which any action movie cinephile would happily deconstruct with schoolboy glee. Villeneuve is helped by Roger Deakins' superb cinematography. His deft play with light, shadows and washed out colours is itself a character in the movie. If this doesn't earn Deakins his thirteenth Oscar nomination, I won't watch any movie for one year! Coupled with Jóhann Jóhannsson's pulsating score, Sicario is one of the essential must-sees this year. Perhaps the only quibbles I have is its doggedly opaque story that requires some work from you and its lack of a higher meaning. It is still not quite the perfect marriage between pure adrenaline action and high cathartic drama that I had wished for. Maybe, the Bladerunner sequel will be the one. I await its arrival in reverence."
"drjgardner","5","16","32","26 September 2015"," Ordinary
","Sicario is about as ordinary a thriller as you can make without going too wrong. The acting is generally good and the photography is beautiful. Where the film goes wrong is in two places. (1) The direction fails to take advantage of two situations in which enormous tension could have been built and built - the scene on the line waiting to cross the border and the scene in the tunnel. Instead of being masterpieces, these scenes are merely OK. The setups are excellent, but the execution is merely ordinary. (2) The character played by Blunt is not true to herself, in the end, yet there is no real compelling reason to explain the transition. Films where the protagonist changes as a result of some fundamental reckoning are great, but in this case, it doesn't hold up for me. This is why the film ends as it does, because there is nothing to sustain the ending around the main character.<br/><br/>All in all not a bad film, but highly predictable, not very subtle, and nothing you haven't seen already."

The problem, for me, was that you can't have suspense without a story and you don't know, until 53 minutes into the movie, what, exactly, is going on. <br/><br/>While the acting is good, I just can't bring myself to suffer through the entire ""greatness"" of this movie.I don't doubt that it may pick up and get better, but after an hour of ""wow, this is dragging and painful"" I just can't risk that it may continue on at the same pace. It's long periods of filler with moments of talking and Brolin smiling a lot, Blunt soul searching, and Benicio grumbling stuff.<br/><br/>There was also a 3-4 minute scene, where hardly nothing was said, that this kid wakes up dad, mom is cooking, then we see the dad in his police uniform, and then nothing further with those charactersand that was about 15 minutes into the movieso 45 minutes go by with them not being seen again? Maybe they appear at the 61 minute mark ;)"

","Usually I'd start with an assessment of the various aspects, acting (generally fine) screenplay (perfectly serviceable) plot (works in places, nonsense in others) etc., etc., but for one particular reason no-one should worry about any of that, nor watch this film nor encourage in any way the irresponsible idiots who made it.<br/><br/>The theme concerns the extreme violence employed by people running the Mexican drug-cartels and suggests that extreme measures, going beyond not only the law but normal decency, may be required to combat them. I don't have a problem with that, and it is left for the viewer to decide whether measures such as facilitating the murder of innocent children can be justified if it may be the only way to defeat these malicious, brutal, ruthless and amoral enemies. I hope and presume most would think not.<br/><br/>It is conceivable that an experienced FBI agent, drafted in to add a veneer of legitimacy to illegal CIA operations of this kind, could find themselves out of their depth. The problem arises because this agent is a woman, while all the people involved in the operations on the CIA side are men, and because of the way the movie then treats this woman. At the start she is shown as functioning well in a demanding job (specialising in storming hostile locations to rescue hostages). However, after joining the operation, she becomes entirely ineffective: every physical confrontation leaves her defeated and humiliated and every time she takes positive action, usually to try to temper the excesses of the CIA and their hired thugs, it always fails. Having achieved nothing throughout the operation, she fails even in her determination to expose the illegality. In the final scene, the nastiest of the thugs taunts and humiliates her yet again, (""You look like a little girl when you're afraid"") as he terrorises her into signing a declaration that all procedures were correctly followed. She is left apparently broken and abject, advised to find a safe small town where she can function, since she isn't tough enough for this real world.<br/><br/>Of course it may be a coincidence that a female character was used for this role and no other in the film. But that's about as likely as the squadron of wild boars doing aerobatics outside my window as I write. This movie has a second message and a far less ambiguous one, none other than the old misogynist lie that women cannot handle various roles, fire-fighters, infantry, whatever, and that when things get tough, they will fail before the men. Any actress who would accept a part which carries such a message should be ashamed of herself, and shame on all concerned for turning out something as despicable as an online misogynist hate-post. If this was done unintentionally, these people are irresponsible and foolish beyond belief, and whether their crime is idiocy or slander, it is equally damaging. Nowadays women work on many extreme front lines in law enforcement, the military, security services and so on. Reinforcing and thereby perpetuating these old misogynist lies can only undermine them and could possibly place them in harm's way.<br/><br/>If you hate women, enjoy seeing them humiliated, or believe their proper place is in the kitchen, then, who knows, you may well love this movie. If you are a reasonable human being who celebrates what women have achieved, then stay very well clear."

",",,, Benicio Del Toro.<br/><br/>This reviewer usually spends very little time in his reviews making Oscar predictions because usually the power and impact of a film is independent of any subsequent awards, so why bother...? Making an exception here. Leaving aside the compelling semi-documentary direction from Villeneuve (PRISONERS) and the other excellent performances, Del Toro doesn't merely ""star"" in this picture, he HAUNTS it. It is not until you leave the theatre that you realize he is often in the shadows, or often not in the scene at all, yet for the entire film you have been subconsciously keeping track of when and where his character appears. That, my friend, is star power.<br/><br/>Also, if they gave an award for films that deal in Moral Ambiguity, this film would get that too. This is perhaps not the forum for such a discussion but the point is aptly made that there is as much moral ambiguity (and sub rosa activities) in the so-called War on Drugs as there was in Nazi Germany. One wonders if we will have to wait another half-century for the truth to come out...?"

","I saw this film in a big cinema complex for over ten bucks. I sat through a 'pre show' that seemed to go on forever and seemed to be aimed squarely at younger teens with Blackberries. I found that depressing especially since the film was aimed at adults not at younger teens. After what seemed like an eternity and after a handful of not that interesting looking new movie previews the feature finally came on. When it was over I thought it was a very average film. I am a fan of Emily Blunt & one or two others in this film but I thought that despite its impressive casting it was basically nothing special. There have been quite a few films made about the drug war that exists along the Mexico/USA border and this one doesn't really say anything new. People get killed and them some more people get killed et cetera et cetera. You would think that by this time they would be creating more sophisticated plot lines. Apparently not. This film offers no hope for a brighter future for any of the characters it depicts in the movie and offers no solutions to any of the problems it includes in its plot line. Frustrating cinema disguised as nouveau intelligence stuff. This film has about three action sequences in the whole thing which last a total of about three minutes-also not the best action orientated film ever made. Not a dog but in the ballpark."
"jboothmillard","6","11","21","22 October 2015"," Sicario
","I saw the poster for this film on the side of bus, the three leading cast members certainly appealed to me, and the title that I did not understand the meaning of, I saw it was getting great reviews, so I went to see it, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners). Basically idealistic FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) survive an explosion in Chandler, Arizona, following the discovery of dozens of corpses within the walls of a house. Kate's boss Dave Jennings (Titanic's Victor Garber) recommends her to undercover CIA Special Activities Division officer Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who enlists her to aid in finding those responsible for the bomb that killed two officers. Kate is partnered with enigmatic consultant Alejandro (BAFTA nominated Benicio Del Toro), who has a questionable past, she thought they were travelling to El Paso, Texas, in fact they arrive in Juárez, Mexico, and the mission is to crack down on the escalating drugs war, and specifically to capture or kill cartel boss Manuel Díaz (Bernardo P. Saracino). At one point the transportation vehicles the officers are travelling in are caught in traffic, this is in fact some some of prior gathering of cartel members, Kate is appalled by the attack on these criminals, with no regard for the safety of civilians in their vehicles. Matt and his team are interested in finding Díaz's boss, drug lord Fausto Alarcón (Julio Cedillo), they target money launderers, Kate is ignored for believing she could be close to making an arrest on Díaz, and the situation gets worse when she recognises local cop Ted (Jon Bernthal) is wearing the same rubber wristband as a money launderer, he is one of many cops, that he names in interrogation, working for Díaz. On a night that Matt and his team plan to follow Díaz, using distraction, Mexican police officer Silvio (Maximiliano Hernández) is kidnapped by Alejandro, suspecting something Kate goes against orders and follows Alejandro, escaping his attempt to kill her she demands answers from Matt, he says that their goal is to restore power to the Colombian Medellín Cartel, this is apparently the best hope for the U.S. Alejandro and Silvio manage to catch up with Díaz, Silvio is killed by Alejandro and he kills Díaz at Alarcón's estate, it was Alarcón that brutally killed his wife and daughter, Alejandro kills the drug lord's wife and two sons so he can experience the same loss he did, before he finally kills him. Alejandro returns and Kate is ashamed and dishonoured by his actions, she refuses to sign a waiver stating that everything they did was ""by the book"", but she does so when her own gun is put to her head, Kate initially then points the gun at Alejandro, but she stops herself, lowers her gun and allows him to walk away. Also starring Daniel Kaluuya as Reggie Wayne, Jeffrey Donovan as Steve Forsing, Raoul Trujillo as Rafael and Lora Martinez-Cunningham as Jacinta. To be completely, despite great performances by always reliable Blunt, the interesting Del Toro and decent Brolin, I found this film a bit complicated most of the time, I don't know if it was too political, or I was just generally confused. I understood the main character being caught in situations she did not expect, and the title ""sicario"" means ""hitman"" in Spanish, but I could only just follow the action, I was however gripped by the gun-filled and explosive moments, overall I can't fully agree with five stars out of five that critics give it, but I did like it, it's a worthwhile crime thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Music for Jóhann Jóhannsson and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Original Music. Good, in my opinion!"

"erinkay641","3","13","26","16 December 2015"," Slow & Overrated
","I don't understand why this movie has such a high rating - I think people respect the director and actors involved so much that they can't see past that and honestly review it. <br/><br/>The score was unique and fit with the overall tone of the movie. By far, the crowning jewel of this movie was the cinematography. There are some gorgeous shots in this film. <br/><br/>The acting was good - but the characters and the writing seemed stereotypical and haphazard. It's like they wrote the outline to a high school paper but never actually made it an essay. The characters' motivations and back stories are glossed over, with the exception of Del Toro's character, and even his back story is explained in a matter of seconds, although that's all you really need to grasp the concept. His character is by far the most interesting part of the movie. <br/><br/>Blunt, despite playing the ""main character,"" gets NO back story, with the exception of knowing that she is divorced and for some reason her partner feels the need to constantly bring up the fact that she wears comfortable clothing in her downtime, like for some reason she should dress up and do her makeup to sit around at home as though that would signify that she has moved on from her ex husband. The one time she tries to hook up with a dude (apparently for the first time in years - which is a miracle, clearly, because her hair was in a bun and she wasn't dressed up - DEAR Christ), he tries to kill her because he is a rogue agent working for the cartel. This is a completely unnecessary aspect of the plot and it actually felt like they had to work really hard to fit this in, because Emily Blunt's partner has known this dude FOR YEARS. Overall, her character is written very lazily and it feels flat. She's a total stereotype - hardened female agent that somehow keeps letting these dang emotions get in the way of the mission. She does everything by the book and has a real issue with the....looser morals of the team she is assigned to work with. Except she gets over that issue in about five minutes, and then she wants to be fully immersed in this operation despite the illegalities involved. Until the end...when she OVER THREAT OF DEATH WITH A GUN TO HER THROAT tries to refuse to sign a paper stating the operation was by the books. She has suddenly reclaimed her moral high ground for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Let's talk about Josh Brolin's character. He is irritating. I can almost begin to see why Emily Blunt's character is on an emotional roller coaster, because they don't tell her anything. They interviewed her and brought her into this operation, yet when she inquires as to why they're doing something they just brush her off until she harps enough (gosh darn nagging woman, wanting to know what she's gotten herself into) for them to finally throw some tidbits of information at her. This is because they only brought her along to finagle through some legal loophole, yet this doesn't really matter in the long run, because everything they do is illegal or sketchy anyway, regardless of her presence. Brolin's character is flippant, not well fleshed out, and he is the epitome of the ""I've been doing this forever so I know better than you"" jaded agent. ""Just trust me"" ""You're in or you're out"" ""That's how the real world works, Emily Blunt, you annoying shrew"" sums up his character. He wears sandals to the office one time - HOW JADED!!<br/><br/>Benicio's character - the most interesting plot is given the least amount of focus. The leader of this cartel that they are after killed his wife and daughter a long time ago. He's acting as a hit- man for hire working alongside the agency to unearth the whereabouts of this guy so they can....I dunno....cut down on or eliminate cartel activity (because they found a house full of bodies at the beginning of the movie! Oh wait, did I forget to mention that?! It's because it's completely irrelevant and is never brought up again. It's a plot device to quickly and gruesomely say ""The cartel is bad. Look, they killed these people and stuffed them in walls. This movie is a thriller, remember?!"") So well into the second half of the movie, he goes off on his own and methodically kills his way to this cartel leader's house, where he is conveniently eating dinner with his family. I will not tell you exactly what happens, as it is the only scene in this movie I would call tense or thrilling in any way, but it's safe to say he gets his revenge in a somewhat unexpected manner. I would have honestly preferred it if the whole movie was told from his perspective and there were some flashbacks to his past included. This would have made for an enticing thriller. <br/><br/>So, in summation - flat characters, in addition to the fact that the movie drags and has an extremely disjointed feeling to it, really left me feeling like I had wasted a couple hours. Not much happens and not much progress is made in the first half of the movie, and you're left wondering how certain things are relevant to the plot at all. It doesn't feel like this was well thought out. This film was attempting to be a gritty action thriller, but I felt almost no suspense. I was bored for over 75% of the movie. I know all the people involved with this film are capable of much better work, so I'm not really sure why it turned out the way that it did. Something got lost in the process, clearly. I wouldn't recommend it."
"danielrgreene","1","7","12","13 July 2018"," Killed By Horrible Writing
","Powerful presentation of the reality of life in the hellhole of Juarez, of the struggle to escape into the US, of the ruthlessness of all sides of the cartel war, and US agency efforts to fight back; but the story is essentially killed by the absurd portrayal of FBI agents who are supposed to be 'idealistic' but come across as zombie wimps. And the whole premise of inserting FBI agents into a cross-border CIA operation just to give authority for stateside operations, and refusing to tell them what they are doing, is absurd, as is the FBI agents whining about questionable procedures. <br/><br/>Blunt's character is just annoying in her timidity, particularly when she is portrayed in the first scenes as a kick-butt, door smashing federal cop. Here is where the writing is horrible - FBI / CIA chief (it isn't clear) tells Blunt's character that she is volunteering for a joint agency operation, authorized by the President (or, an 'elected official'), and doesn't tell her the nature of the operation? And then she and her silent FBI partner spend the rest of the movie whining about the questionable nature of the operation.<br/><br/> This would have been a phenomenal movie if the conflict with the timid FBI agents had been left out. I'm hoping that Sicario 2 will delete the wimpy sideshow, and just show the reality of the cartel war."
"zivsoondie","1","7","12","25 August 2017"," this, a drama film. no thriller
","I didn't bother watching the whole movie. instead I read some bad reviews here, and it just confirmed everything I thought. In the beginning, there is some action, for a few minutes. then the main character volunteers for a job, but she does't get any info. that means the viewers don't know what's going on either, and it drags on. they drive into a Mexican city and they don't cut, we have to watch them driving all the way. and since no one knows whats going on, it's completely unnecessary. Emily Blunt gives a bad performance, but it's not her fault. The character is just a terribly written coward, in a male dominated sexist environment. <br/><br/>What's the point of a movie that does not reveal anything about the plot in the first 45 minutes???<br/><br/>I guess it's supposed to be a tense feeling about it, and artsy, complete fail."
"knight_c6","8","7","12","31 December 2015"," Great film
","I saw this without knowing what it was going to be about, rather than a drug cartel movie. Im glad I went in blind, I was pleasantly surprised at the pacing and characters. The plot isn't too original, but the true joy of this film is probably the hypotheticals involved concerning the war on drugs. What do we expect out of our justice system? What are we willing to allow in order to stop the drug culture? Or at least impede it? The characters involved are great, the point of view for the audience is basically that of the FBI agent who doesn't really understand the real face of the conflict. The audience is slowly let in on just what elements of the US government are doing and why, with the the main character having the same reservations and asking the same questions we, as the audience, want to ask. A great film."

","One long teenage whine, vaguely disguised as a thriller, and with a heroine so utterly useless, she could have come from a 50s rom-com. Never less than hyperbolic, the fact that the plot makes not the slightest sense is hidden by the way in the director throws in so many elements, the audience is bewildered into thinking something significant is taking place. In fact, it is more like a smoke-and- mirrors conjuring trick than anything resembling entertainment. I had thought self-important and dishonest film making had reached its nadir with Syriana, but I was wrong. Anyone who watched the cringeworthy 2016 Oscars would be aware that Hollywood is more a propaganda division of the party that gives then the huge tax breaks than an entertainment industry nowadays, the question is: Why do film critics so unfailingly give 'film of the year' status to such adolescent tripe?"

","This is a 2 hours movie that will bore you to death. The movie has some great actors, like Benicio del Toro, but an awful and boring script, and a direction that does not shine. At all. The script, you already know it, centers around the Mexican drug cartel and its horrendous crimes. This is what you see, minutes after the film has began. Horrendous crimes rise your neck hairs. Then you are introduced with one of the main characters, the female SWAT officer, who has to play her antagonist role throughout the whole movie, opposing the main character, in ways that defy credibility. You have some action, but not a lot, just some. You have a script that tries to say something, but fails to deliver. Childish comic-magazine solutions to some plots, like the tunnel one (can not say more).And you have the end,where you are relieved of the pain, of seeing this boring movie."
"Sophoclaw","1","14","29","28 September 2015"," Colombian Revenge Light
","This fictionalized story is surely based on events that have been press and news stuff, with more or less successful result from long time ago. And is probably based back in time when the war on drug-traffic supremacy was at its peak, when the Mexican kingpins took the lead in narco-traffic from the Colombian cartels, the traffic exploded in scope, volume and money value, and in consequence many cartels and narco groups were created to dominate each in their own region, with the unavoidable drug wars between these. It is also probable that it is based in more resent events when the Mexican police went tired of these wars and declared war on the cartels. It was a bold an daring action, but with not very good results because this new war actually developed even more crude and the number of deaths did not decrease, it went up on both sides and with negative consequences for the public. Unfortunately none of these issues are taken on the film even if the atmosphere and scenery superficially tells us about drugs and of course killings without even mentioning where and why they occur, they assume we have been reading the news. So in the end what is this film about? For me it was hard to tell, is it a film to show that chivalry and sense of justice among the arms of the law is in jeopardy? Is it a war between CIA and FBI? Or is it a story of revenge between Mexicans and Colombians? I must say it's all these things at the same time, and that's what in my opinion makes this film a little messy and hard to swallow. We see a lot of violence but in most scenes we don't know the motives or the reason for it, the film lacks to go in depth about this and without it, it just becomes another very violent film with some action. The dramatic scenes without action do not contribute to clarify what is going on, on the contrary. US squads are trying to get rid drug traffic from Mexico to USA but we really never know where the drugs are coming from or what kind of drugs. Is it marijuana? No because now it is allowed in many states in the USA and easily available. Is it cocaine from Peru or Bolivia? Is it heroin from Afghanistan? By whom and how came to Nogales? All these interesting questions remain unanswered and the film disintegrates in a personal family feud and vendetta. Which creates another controversy: a hit-man usually doesn't act with personal issues; otherwise the film should've been called ""Colombian Revenge Light"" The scene when ""Sicario"" dispatched a cartel boss is just not right these guys don't have 3 bodyguards they have dozens and dozens. The performances of the main actors are ambivalent. Emily Blunt is definitively miscast, and why is Josh Brolin laughing all the time? it doesn't have a reference of what is going on in the film or perhaps the script demanded a contrast figure from Benicio del Toro who is soooo serious all the time? It is a pity that with the resources used both material and human it could've become a good film to watch as long as it had resolved the above mentioned issues, but it's just another very dark, violent and eye shocking action film."
"afzk","3","6","10","11 October 2016"," Mediocre
","This movie is, simply put, disappointing. There is definitely not enough action, while instead the film - which is long - is riddled with slow and pointless scenes which I guess were intended to be suspenseful or tense, or to create some semblance of atmosphere, but in reality only serve to bore the spectator. The few action scenes that do occur, usually happen outside of the main character's reach unless she's just a passenger or a victim in them.<br/><br/>This main character, an FBI agent, claims to be interested in stopping drug and cartel related violence. Yet, she is completely oblivious of any and all aspects related to the drug war in Mexico: she knows less than any average joe with access to Google would know about it, even after apparently researching it online. Her character is irritatingly lame. None of the characters have any arc going for them, especially not this ""main character"" FBI agent.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is entirely linear and predictable, down to the last moment of the film. There are no real plot twists or unexpected events throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Performance wise it is mostly alright, save for the obvious miscasting of the ""Mexican"" family (a component that also, just like the rest of the film, goes nowhere), whose dialogues always seem fake and forced. Nobody in Mexico speaks like that.<br/><br/>After over two hours of my life I'm never getting back, I'd recommend anyone to avoid this snoozefest containing absolutely no revelations about the drug war in Mexico."

It is a shame as the cast is great, but the plot has way too many inconsistencies to enjoy.

"ferguson-6","8","9","17","24 September 2015"," The Land of Wolves
","Greetings again from the darkness. Really good thrillers – the kind that make our palms sweat and cause us to forget to blink - are increasingly rare in the world of cinema these days. Writer Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't choose the good guys, but instead highlights the terror and lack of rules and morality that guide the border wars and drug cartels. It turns out the border isn't the only line being crossed. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) elevates Sheridan's excellent script further with a strong cast and some outstanding camera work from the best Director of Photography working today, Roger Deakins.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is about as tense as anything we could ever hope for on screen, and it introduces us to FBI Agent Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt. We soon learn Kate is a focused and dedicated tactical expert, who also happens to be idealistic enough to believe the raids conducted by her team are making a difference  at least until this belief is later challenged.<br/><br/>Kate quickly finds herself ""volunteering"" for a special task force with muddled goals, uncertain tactics, and secretive leadership. Josh Brolin plays Matt, the leader of the team. He charms his way through answering Kate's questions without offering any substantive intel. When asked about the mission objective, Matt responds with ""to create chaos"" and a smirk. Adding to her confusion and wariness is the mysterious ""consultant"" Alejandro (the ""hitman"" of the title) played by Benecio Del Toro. Part of the brilliance of the script is that everyone seems to know what's happening except Kate and us (the viewers)! Our understanding comes through the slow-drip method and keeps us fully engaged.<br/><br/>Similarities to both Zero Dark Thirty and Apocalypse Now struck me as the film progressed, but the sheer number of stress-inducing sequences set this apart as something different. A family dinner with a drug lord is one of the more fascinating and tension-packed scenes of the year. The moral complexity is thought-provoking, and the abundance of corruption and politics in relation to the cartels and war on drugs, leave us wondering not just whether this war can be won, but through what methods is it being fought.<br/><br/>""Welcome to Juarez"", says Alejandro, as the SUV motorcade makes its way past the remnants of a brutal crime scene. Although there are some tremendous sequences of tactical raids (and the best traffic jam you've seen), this should not be labeled as an action film  it's so much more. Ms. Blunt's character is the conscience of the film, but it's Brolin's Matt that makes us curious as to his background and motivation. And as interesting as are those two characters, they pale in comparison to Benecio's man on a mission. Del Toro doesn't act frequently, but he possesses the gift that has him dominating the screen  forcing our eyes to follow his every movement. Rumors have a prequel in the works that will focus on Alejandro's roots. It's the ""land of wolves"", and Alejandro is an alpha.<br/><br/>Lastly, it must be stated that the film is a technical treat. The unique score from Johann Johannsson is never overbearing, and often mimics our pounding hearts. It's worth taking note. Best of all is the work of the great Roger Deakins. His photography is astounding and this could be his best work yet. The desert landscapes are just as crucial as the claustrophobic raids or the impromptu strategy sessions, and Deakins puts us right where we need to be. As a companion piece to this excellent film, I would recommend Matthew Heineman's extraordinary documentary from earlier this year, Cartel Land."
"russellingreviews","8","9","17","16 September 2015"," An amazingly disturbing look at the war against narcotics trafficking
","'You saw things you shouldn't have seen.' <br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... With all of the discussion on border control and the effects of the drug trade in the United States, Sicario could be redundant or timely. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4 stars Cinematic rating: 4 stars Bigger questions rating: 4 stars <br/><br/>Sicario: The name for first century Jewish zealots who desired to eliminate their Roman invaders, but was later taken on within Latin American culture to mean assassin or hit-man.<br/><br/>The life of an FBI agent on the US / Mexican border is a mixture of drug cartels and immigration law that never seems to come to an end. Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) leads a task force to find hostages who have been caught in the crossfire of this international legal battlefield. After an horrific situation on the job, she considers that there seems to be no end to this war. Afterwards, in what seems to be a debrief of the situation, she is given the opportunity to be part of a secretive task force that uses tactics to 'dramatically overreact' to the cartels and bring their leaders to justice. The unorthodox task force is lead by Matt (Josh Brolin), a CIA operative and includes the dark, enigmatic Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). They lead a mercenary troop to make noise and cause chaos against the seemingly insurmountable narcotic hoards. Kate realises that their methods of initiating justice are beyond her comfort level and initially wants out. Yet, seeing the opportunity to inflict justice on these criminal leaders keeps her on board until the mission is complete. An internal and external battle ensues for the FBI agent when she realises that the lines of ethics are blurred in achieving the results desired by the all of the governments involved. <br/><br/>Stories like Sicario that centre on law enforcement agencies and their challenges with drug lords continue to show that there are no clear winners in this war. It is a brilliantly portrayed drama, but carries with it the travesties that occur on this battleground. Director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) manages to provide a realistic glimpse into this continual fight through a well-crafted script, stellar performances from the lead actors and unsettling cinematography that provides the sweltering feel to the film. He manages to apply the appropriate pressure to effectively communicate this story with the disturbing realism. This realistic style shows that there are no winners on either side of this shadowy world. Villeneuve does not glorify the drug dealing or its usage, but shows that idealism may have to be compromised in the delivery of justice. Through effective story-telling he exposes the ethical dilemmas that occur throughout the various roles of law enforcement. Also, the subplots that are inner mixed throughout the film show that there is no such thing as a victimless crime when it comes to purchasing illegal drugs. Sicario delivers a well told story that will leave audiences entertained, but will leave them unsettled by the message that lacks any ethical answers or hope.<br/><br/>This narcotic narrative provides a multitude of intersections with moral and ethical discussion points. At the heart of every plot point there is an underlying message that there are no moral absolutes. The central characters of Sicario have to live without the comfort of a clearly defined right and wrong, which proves to be exceptionally unsettling. Outside the cinema, it is not a stretch to see that most of God's good creation has been tainted with evil. Even with that reality, that does not mean that people have to live without belief in truth. The Bible allows for hope and truth to pervade throughout this lifetime and into eternity. Even though the plot of this film leaves little hope for this world, thankfully we do not have to live that way with God being involved in all aspects of this world. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... This is a brilliant film, but it will not appeal to anyone with a weak constitution. The acting and direction are superb, but the heart of the story exists in a world without ethics or humanity and is exceptionally hopeless. <br/><br/>REEL DIALOGUE: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Can we find truth in this world? (John 14:6, 1 Corinthians 13:4-6) 2. Can we ever find justice? (Proverbs 21:15, Romans 12:19) 3. Is revenge ever justified?

","OK, first off, the directing and acting was good, no award worthy performances but still good. Special effects were also very good.<br/><br/>But ultimately i feel cheated, the trailers for this movie hinted at a fictional action flick; Highly trained people fight for their lives during a border crossing.. Benicio Del Toro taking a lead for a change to pull an inexperienced agent through the fire alive.. A nice escape from reality into a pretend America that may have never existed except in a plethora of action flix (and we all wanted to live there anyway lol)...<br/><br/>What i got could have been a documentary on how some U.S. agencies are run, without oversight or limitations, basically criminal organisations funded by the taxpayer; as they grapple for control of a criminal underworld. Though there are purely fictional parts, Benicio has a mission impossible moment near the end, but these moments seem inserted into the movie to break up the tedious grind of what most people recognise as reality, sad and depressing as that may be."

Don't get me wrong, Emily Blunt did great, but the character design leaves you thinking till the last second how the freak she accomplished being one of the ""tough"" ones at the FBI, and even more how the heck somebody sane could put her in the situation she ends up in the film. <br/><br/>This is just incongruent and frustrating, accompanied by a plot twist in the end which was (imo) very predictable. <br/><br/>TLDR: <br/><br/>A well crafted movie with great film style and good acting, lacking in character design and an unpredictable plot twist."
"mxbishop","6","5","8","21 December 2015"," A lot of tension, suspense, but some bits don't fit
","Sicario is tense and suspenseful, to be sure. But some of the bits just don't fit together quite right.<br/><br/>Spoilers: When Kate (Emily Blunt) emerges from the tunnel she sees Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) pointing a gun at the corrupt Mexican police officer. Kate then assumes that Alejandro must be a bad guy and prepares to fight him. However, she knows the Mexican police are likely corrupt and working for the drug cartel, and she also knows that hours earlier, Alejandro saved her life when he took down the assassin-guy that Emily had picked up at the bar. So it seems to me, Kate would not automatically assume Alejandro was bad when she first sees him at the end of the tunnel. Maybe I'm missing something here, but Kate's reaction in that scene did not make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Secondly, at the end, Alejandro shows up at Kate's apartment and threatens to kill her if she does not sign the report that absolves Alejandro's actions. She is shaken to her core during this scene. Terrified, she signs the paper, and Alejandro disassembles her weapon before he leaves. He walks out of the apartment, and Kate instantly reassembles her weapon and threatens to shoot Alejandro. What I find so improbable here is that Kate, who is really shaken up from this encounter, can instantly reassemble her weapon. From the way the scene is played, she's in no condition to do this. This is just my opinion, but when someone is really scared, it's extremely hard for her to muster the precise eye-hand motor coordination she would need to instantly reassemble the weapon like she did. Perhaps this is a nit picky point, but it did not feel honest to her character."
"cantlietofear","1","8","15","20 February 2016"," Eh
","I honestly thought it straight up sucked man, (Mild spoilers ahead ) 99% of the movie was needlessly hitting or just generally trying to hurt Emily Blunts character, and that my dudes, just straight up sucks. Actually, the majority of the movie is needless violence, And this is coming from someone who loves action/thrillers, I was disappointed not only in how they treated other human beings, But by the fact that in doing so the lead male is being viewed by other men as just, ""A guy trying to avenge his family"", As if that makes it okay to kill anyone that gets in the way of his goal, Honestly I just can't see how anyone thought this movie was good? But I mean, I guess it's all personal preference, If you enjoy watching a movie about women getting kicked around and huge plot holes than this is definitely your cup of tea."
"ClaraBosswald","7","8","15","27 September 2015"," Liked it, didn't love it.
","Sicario tells the story of an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) asked to cooperate with the CIA to take down a Mexican drug cartel.<br/><br/>This is Benicio Del Toro's best performance since Traffic which is no small praise. Josh Brolin delivers a good performance as well. I'm usually a fan of Emily Blunt, but I found her profoundly okay in this role. She doesn't bring anything personal to this character. She was never bad, but you could replace her with any other actress without changing much to the movie.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve is known for his dark, bleak tone and Sicario is no exception. The movie has very graphic violence, sometimes to its detriment. You see countless burnt, decapitated, amputated, tortured bodies of Mexican men without any attempt to humanize any victim of those drug cartels; who were they? why did they die? who cares? Not Denis Villeneuve apparently. It's a shame because it makes the movie feel exploitative and dehumanizing which probably wasn't Villeneuve's intention.<br/><br/>The story doesn't pull any punches, like Blunt's character, you feel powerless when confronted with the violence and the scale of the drug cartels. According to Sicario, Mexicans are unable to solve their own problems, Americans make everything even worse and you can't help but feel that this is a doomed cause. <br/><br/>This movie has undeniable qualities: Benicio Del Terro's performance is incredible, Deakins should get an Oscar for cinematography and Denis Villeneuve knows how to shoot action and build tension. Sadly, by the end of the movie, I wished I had watched the real story of the men and women who reduced Mexico's murder rate by 25% in the last three years, a fact Denis Villeneuve seems to ignore."

"JMJimmy","2","21","49","29 September 2015"," Drawn out American Propiganda
","This movie is the slowest, most painful, piece of American propaganda & drivel that I have come across in recent memory. The characters are weak, inconsistent, and uninteresting. Scenes are intentionally drawn out to artificially build suspense but do nothing more than make you sit through 90 minutes of pointless footage to get at the meat of the story which amounts to a 30 minute short at best. Its attempts to somehow rationalize murder, torture, and vigilantism come off as propaganda for a failed US war on drugs. The only reason it gets more than 1 star from me is one of the later scenes which speaks some sense but has no connection to the rest of the narrative.<br/><br/>I am incredibly disappointed in Emily Blunt for her abysmal choice of accepting this role. She makes women seem weak willed, immoral, smoke addicted waifs at the mercy of whatever men want of her. Truly shameful. This is coming from a man so I hate to think what women will think of this film."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","4","6","10 September 2017"," Crosses the tour-De-force border of film-making
","'Sicario' had me stoked from the start. It is hard to go wrong with the involvement of cinematographer Roger Deakins, director Denis Villeneuve, writer Taylor Sheridan, advertising that really makes one want to see the film, its critical acclaim and a cast like Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.<br/><br/>In no way was 'Sicario' a let down. It completely lived up to the hype and all of the attractions/reasons for seeing the film were among the things that made 'Sicario' so good. 'Sicario' to me really is one of the best films of 2015, one of the best crime thriller films in years and a standout film of the decade. Its one stumbling block was that more could have been done with the character of Kate, the character and her motivations seemed a little underwritten somewhat and not always as decisive or plausible as ought. However, it was nowhere near as big a problem as made out (also was completely masked by how brilliant the rest of the film was), because it was clear that she was meant to be something of a fish out of water character and that was brought out very well, meaning that to me some of her actions made sense somewhat.<br/><br/>Everything about the film in general is brilliant and a tour-De-force of film-making, though it is understandable if it doesn't connect with all. 'Sicario' is impeccably made for starters, the setting is both audacious and visceral in showing the horrors and brutality of the setting and the editing is tight, stylish and enhances the brutal atmosphere. Best of all is the cinematography (in close competition in that year's Oscar category with 'The Revenant, which was a deserved winner), with Roger Deakins demonstrating once again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story that 'Sicario' tries to tell. The music score is haunting and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation. Can totally see why it was nominated for the Oscar and an easy second to Ennio Morricone's work for 'The Hateful Eight'. Can also see the acclaim for the sound editing, which added a huge amount to the film's authenticity, again up against tight competition in the category that year at the Oscars.<br/><br/>The script is tightly structured and rich in complexity, while the story doesn't need attention-grabbing set pieces to impress or make its point and has more than that on its mind. And all the better for it. It is heavily reliant on atmosphere, this is brutal, harrowing stuff that effectively shows the horrors of the situation and setting without overdoing or sugar-coating it, also showing respect to it. It's wonderfully murky and dark, while also taut and kinetic in its energy (despite the sometimes deliberate, but never dull, pacing).<br/><br/>You couldn't have gotten better performances. The standout is Benicio Del Toro, with the most interesting character (especially in the genuinely shocking final act) and giving a magnificently shady performance that's chilling but also conflicted. Emily Blunt conveys great strength and touching vulnerability, while Josh Brolin is tongue-in-cheek and charming with a touch of ambiguity. Daniel Kaluuya is sort of a moral compass character, something that Kaluuya is movingly sympathetic bringing out.<br/><br/>Overall, a masterpiece tour-De-force with only one minor and ignorable stumbling block. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"jillf-25069","5","4","6","4 May 2017"," Well made but ultimately reactionary and pointless
","I was really excited about Sicario after being a big fan of Prisoners and other films by Denis Villeneuve. However while I enjoyed certain sequences of the film, I have to say that overall it was a disappointing experience. I guess what bothered me the most about the film was that it seemed very misogynistic to me. Emily Blunt is established as this tough female character in the first scene but then for the remainder of the film she's stuck as a fragile woman in distress. The way the film piled humiliation upon humiliation on her character started to feel increasingly predictable and almost sadistic. Some reviews seemed to suggest that this was to show the corruption of the system and the impossibility of a truly good character (ie:Blunt) making a positive change. Yet, Benicio Del Toro's character is given the opportunity to have a riveting action sequence and Blunt's character seems sidelined. I liked the soundtrack and a few of the sequences were well-directed and riveting. But the only message I could get from the film was a kind of might makes right viewpoint."

It's her only facial expression during the whole movie and you'll see it a lot. She also whine and complain a lot while the scruffy CIA\paramilitaries tells her to shut up or give her cigarettes. I wish I could say there is more to her character in the movie but...<br/><br/>As any law enforcement person will tell you, it's always best to have an unstable , psychopathic person in your ranks to do some serious-police-work/torture for you.

He also know how to resolve the cartel problem in Mexico, you shoot the evil boss! Why hasn't anyone though of that before? It's genius!<br/><br/>As a suspense drama movie based on real event, the plot is just too silly despite the beautiful scenes and able actors.

","SICARIO is an intense and gritty drug war thriller that follows an FBI agent as she teams up with some DEA agents to wage war on drug gangs in south-of-the-border Mexico. It's a film that features oodles of gritty realism, along with graphic depictions of violence and the like, much like Denis Villeneuve's previous movie PRISONERS. The grand, epic-style action sequences that fuel SICARIO make it a superior film to that, although I still found it a little lacking.<br/><br/>Despite the length of the film and the big speeches and the like, the story actually turns out to be very simplistic and little different from the story lines in an average low rent action flick. I'm no fan of Emily Blunt, aside from her role in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, and as in LOOPER she feels out of place here. Luckily you get veteran genre actors like Benicio Del Toro to balance things out a bit. Some of the establishing shots, like of the convoy of soldiers riding through the streets of Mexico, are quite breathtaking, and the film has an excellent soundtrack that adds plenty of suspense to the proceedings. Overall, I did find it all a little hollow though."

Emily's lead role is gradually left behind other character's pursuits, just as underdeveloped though. It ends up in the background as she plays a pointless and somehow pathetic role where she is unable to do anything useful at all to provide dynamism to the film.<br/><br/>The themes of secrecy, rivalry of agencies, covert operations, etc, don't help either since they become very cliché. We've all seen that before, and easily better portrayed too.<br/><br/>Venicio's quest for revenge doesn't seem to fit the mood of the rest of the film as it follows its own path where everything works out smoothly from point A to point B and we can't be really fulfilled with such turn of events. <br/><br/>At one point the narrative becomes a knot and the film can't even make its goals clear and audiences are left with nothing but a feeling that it was a trip without destination.<br/><br/>It sadly becomes just a ""one more"", which is a shame as I expected Villeneuve to draw a few turns here and there and leave a trail of cinematic mastery as is the case of Polytechnique, Incendies,Enemy or Prisoners."

","Lots of good reviews had me wanting to see Sicario. Well the drug wars are well known and still go on and this mishmash of a movie will hopefully prove how hopeless the war on drugs is and needs more than macho CIA guys killing other tough guys. Good action scenes and tension build up but all spoiled in my book by the mumbling characters which had me missing much dialog and left me wondering who was up who and who was paying the rent most of the time. I wished for subtitles; that's how bad it was. Some day I'll see it again on FTA to understand what was going on. The Emily Blunt character constantly smokes - I had the feeling she was being sponsored by a tobacco company. Did we really need that when we also have a more gentle war on smoking which she negated throughout the movie."

It's fun at times but make no mistake: there's no sex, no love, no romance, no mystery - nothing much to overcome or achieve for that matter. There's very little action (granted, when they finally do commence the ass kicking, it's truly glorious). There's a bit of a thrill, sure, but it's mostly about trying to wait out boredom until Blunt or DelToro do something. Commit. Alas, they never do, instead they act the unactable and vigorously play the dullest, the silliest and the least believable plights, like the highway shootout or the rendition of a single POI via a convoy of Suburbans through the Mexican border (what happened to using a helo?!)."

","That movie was a thorough disappointment. One could think than in 2 hours you just HAVE to have some plot to put all the visuals together. But not here. Director uses dialogue only when absolutely needed, so plot is almost non-existent.

(major spoilers ahead) Even first scene raised my eyebrows, when our agents find dozens of bodies hidden behind the dry-walls in a safe house. Let that stink sink for a moment... Dozens of decaying bodies in apparently occupied safe house. Why? Does the great boss like to torture his soldiers with stink? Does he fell awkward digging holes so he went with vertical storage instead? Or maybe it's just poor plot-vehicle to show our agent is angry enough and ready to go after big bad guy? DING DING DING So Kate joins the group and guess what they do next? They exfiltrate local gang boss... from a Mexico. Because Freedom goes wherever it wants to go. Not only that but they kill some gang members right on a crowded highway just before border. Just a normal day at work I guess. Kate (our main character) doesn't like it, but hey - they are big boys and she wants to be a big boy too. Why do they choose to torture local boss on American soil and prepare risky convoy ride instead of going by helicopter? Because (redacted), that's why. I don't want to go further, but every part of the movie is filled with stupid, inconsistent decisions that do not make any sense at all.

I went in with high hopes and... well:<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy Sicario at all. Bar a handful of well-directed action sequences, it was quite bland and had the clichéd plot mashings of any typical revenge flick slapped on top of a traditional crime thriller. Del Toro was a redeeming factor for sure, and I do understand and appreciate early Oscar shouts for Best Supporting Actor, but I draw the line there. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin brought very little to this film between them. Blunt has the spotlight stolen from her by Del Toro in the final third of the movie, and never recovers it back again. But the major problem is that I, as an audience member, preferred it that way. Blunt's character can be seen as a proverbial 'fish-out-of- water' type, one who is strung along by Brolin's intimidating mannerisms and Del Toro's shrouded persona. She is helpless in understanding what is going on, and whilst we can all appreciate that aspect as good story-telling, it gets annoying and boring when the movie abruptly changes gears, heading to its 'revenge-driven' climax. What was the point? Del Toro may as well have been the main character, and Blunt a secondary one who is used and discarded. Given her lack of back- story, which I'll come to in a while, it would have the same impact on the story-line: virtually none. <br/><br/>I suppose I can give the movie credit for setting up its revenge aspect with Del Toro's brutal actions beforehand, but it still wasn't fleshed out to a great-enough extent. True, anyone familiar with 'revenge cinema' will immediately know the clichéd reason for Del Toro's despondency upon first meeting him, but even that is never elaborated on, at least not until the final confrontation with an antagonist who was non-existent beforehand. Brolin said that the man ""was like a ghost"" and that certainly lived up to its billing, but not in a good way. All we know by the end, when a showdown occurs, is that he's supposed to be a purely black (evil) character, and Del Toro is... grey? He's certainly not the good guy, and it's very hard to sympathise with him when those he lost are never even given names or faces. A flashback would have worked wonders, but the director strangely chose to omit that idea entirely. <br/><br/>Regarding character development, Emily Blunt (Kate) has no back- story whatsoever, save that she is divorced with no children. For a movie with only a few female characters with speaking lines, this really isn't a good indicator of how to handle a main character in an equal manner. The end result is that Benicio Del Toro is given the reins, yet he's still considered a supporting character. Change the label to 'main' and nobody would notice - it's purely bad characterisation and nothing else. <br/><br/>I'll be honest and say there were a few good points. The opening scene is thrilling. The end climax is thrilling. The 'traffic jam' in Juarez was thrilling, although I feel it lacked a chase scene or out-and- out shootout. I'm not an 'action junkie', but for a movie labelled 'Action' by IMDb, Sicario barely delivers until the final fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>Final big paragraph. Here is my main issue with this film: it has a lot of good ideas, but fails to execute them in an original manner. Smokin' Aces, Lucky Number Slevin and Kill Bill all handle similar situations (either convoluted police work or out-and-out vengeance) much better than Sicaro. If Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt were removed, Del Toro's back-story slightly edited to make him a lone CIA agent and other people given supporting roles, you would basically have the same movie, and that is a damning indictment of something that's carrying the baited screams of ""Best Picture!"" and ""Best Actress!"" No and no. Neither are deserved. This movie is glaringly unoriginal, Emily Blunt shows no growth as a character and is completely uninteresting (think Edge of Tomorrow, minus most of her venom) and the plot is a bit of a mess. Any movie that splits in half based on thematic and characterised aspects, yet tries not to, has a major problem. <br/><br/>I left disappointed, and can fully understand the current box office stumbling."

","As I walked out of the movie theater I felt a little disappointed. What I had just watched felt incomplete. It finally dawned on me that I was overwhelmed by the massive hype created around the movie. It may be because I was carrying a lot of expectation from it built on days of watching the trailers/videos and reading reviews on the internet. <br/><br/>It's a typical hit-man film with a dated story line. Save for the excellent acting by Benecio Del Toro and the fantastic cinematography by Roger Deakins, this film failed to deliver on three basic fronts - the story line, character development and its supposedly ""lead"" actor acted out by Emily Bunt. The film failed to impress by giving Emily Bunt's point of view of the story while the real hero of the movie actually was Benicio Del Toro. <br/><br/>Emily Bunt's character in the literal sense was a highly irritating one throughout the length of the movie. She was highly vulnerable at the start of the movie and ended quite meekly as well giving up her so called ""ideology"" to the threat of bullet. What happened to her partner (Daniel Kaluuya) and Josh Brolin's character at the end is left to a guess. <br/><br/>The pace of the movie was surprisingly slow. I was expecting a fast paced thriller (which is actually what the trailers portrayed). The moment you felt the tension building up would explode into something the scene would actually roll into another one. <br/><br/>6/10"
"chrichtonsworld","4","11","25","18 November 2015"," Over hyped and overrated. I will tell you why.
","Before I get accused of someone who has ADHD or is only into action films I was not expecting this film to have action sequences at all. However I did expect more from the guy who directed Prisoners.<br/><br/>Sicario does have some tense and thrilling moments especially in the beginning. There were 5 of them in total. I don't know about you but being able to remember and count these moments is not a good sign. If a film was tense throughout there would be too many too count. And that simply is not the case. The biggest problem of this film that it is counting on the plot and nothing else. But what if the plot is not that interesting? What if you already know what the plot is going to reveal? Anybody who has been following the news on a regular basis and has been watching cartel related films already will know what this film is trying to tell. Seriously if you are so surprised at how this film unfolds then you need to ask yourself why you are so uninformed. You just have to type in the drug trade into any search program of the internet and you will get overwhelmed with the information about this topic. 98 percent of the plot is based on these supposedly super secret revelations.<br/><br/>Even if you never read or heard anything about the drug trade you could have guessed right from the moment when Emily Blunt's character is freaking out. Kate Macer who gets recruited to take part into a special team is oblivious. She is supposed to be intelligent and capable. At least that is what we are told. She never ever demonstrates this. Because apart from what you might except this is not about her. She just serves as the one the audience can identify with. The one who is innocent and ignorant and who will be forced to be confronted with some harsh truth. This gets increasingly difficult because she keeps crying and whining to a point that I wished someone would just shoot her. Yes she is that annoying. Anybody who claims that she has given a top notch performance don't know what they are talking about. Speaking of performances. There is only one that matters. That of Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro. Unfortunately while important he is not in this film as much as he should. Maybe the director thought he would be more mysterious and interesting that way. With an actor like Benicio you don't need to artificially create an environment or plot to do so. He is always interesting. Actually I think director Denis Villeneuve has undermined his performance by giving Emily Blunt so much exposure. Apart from Benicio all the other characters are insignificant. They are all just there to tell the plot and nothing else.<br/><br/>Like I said, most of Sicario is plot based. This supposedly brilliant plot is extremely thin containing surprises and reveals that actually aren't surprising at all if you could be bothered to read a newspaper once in a while. Another focus of the plot seems to be the destruction and devastation caused by the drug cartels and what needs to be done to set thing right in this war on drugs. It's like this film tries us to say that this is the only way to deal with the problems. And I say bullshit to that claim. There is only one way to stop this foolish war on drugs which is the legalization of drugs. With this measure you would annihilate the cartels and their influence and every crime related to this would stop. But of course this won't ever happen because of the greed for power and money.<br/><br/>Sicario does not offer anything else note worthy. The few tense moments aren't nearly enough to captivate you. You will only be impressed by the plot if you are uninformed. Characterization is weak and most of the time you will be bored out of your mind unless Benicio appears on the screen. Only there is not enough of him. Would I say that this film is super bad? No, I mean it's decent enough. But in no shape or form is this deserving of the praise and hype it is getting."
"Freedom060286","7","5","9","28 December 2015"," Could have been a classic but fell short
","Sicario wasn't bad but I found it a bit disappointing, perhaps I was expecting something better. <br/><br/>But I did enjoy the scenes with Benicio Del Toro, especially in the last 25 minutes. Also, the opening scene was shocking and certainly got peoples' attention. <br/><br/>The camera work throughout the entire movie was excellent.<br/><br/>Although I've enjoyed some of her work in the past, Emily Blunt really isn't suited for this kind of role. And Daniel Kaluuya is an annoyingly poor actor, and his role (after the opening ten minutes) wasn't necessary and much of the movie would have been more enjoyable without his character.<br/><br/>Ideally, the movie should have focused more on Benicio Del Toro's interesting character Alejandro and his story, and less on the naive and rather boring Emily Blunt character Kate Macer."
"Theodor16","2","12","28","24 December 2015"," You're Not Cut Out for This If You're Human/Female
","An extremely cynical movie that justifies a lot of things: to make a difference in the war against drugs the ""good"" guys have to become animals, murderers, assassins like the enemy. No law restrictions attached.<br/><br/>And if you insist on procedure by the book, giving the drug people a minimum of rights, you are considered weak and not cut out for the job. The female FBI lead (Emily Blunt) is actually not leading anything, just coming along as a legal requirement. She is an awful and stereotypical depiction of THE woman among REAL men.<br/><br/>As was told to her at the end of the movie - she should go to a small town where laws still mean something. - Movie not recommended."
"rohit1987","5","8","17","19 October 2015"," Overrated and slow; big disappointment
","I went to see sicario solely because of the 8.1 IMDb rating the film enjoyed - and boy was I disappointed.<br/><br/>I have been let down by IMDb only a few times in many years and this was definitely one of those instances.<br/><br/>The movie had an incredibly slow pace with nothing much really happening until almost halfway in; the plot was also confusing and poorly explained; and no it didn't lead to some massive mystery unraveling at the end when everything comes together; the end was as pithy as the rest of the movie with a dry feeling of ""this movie could've been so much better"" left in my mouth.<br/><br/>The cast: Emily Blunt's role was so weak and confusing that I struggled to understand exactly what she was supposed to be doing in the film. Her character was completely out of place in almost every scene she was in; she did NOT portray an image of a competent professional tactical FBI agent; in most scenes it looked like she barely knew how to hold a gun let alone fire it. Josh Brolin was fine as always; but Benicio Del Toro was definitely the saving grace that prevented me from walking out of the movie hall before the end; he was exemplary playing his role perfectly.<br/><br/>All in all: the movie was a major disappointment and waste of time. It could've been so much better with the cast and budget that it had; if only..."
"WinterbornTM","9","8","17","23 September 2015"," Superb
","Sicario is a crime thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve who also made Prisoners and Enemy, both fantastic films. <br/><br/>The movie begins with a short explanation of the word ""Sicario"". In ancient Palestine, the word described Jewish zealots who would kill roman invaders. However, in present day, in Mexico ""sicario"" means hit-man. The story follows Kate Macer, portrayed by Emily Blunt, an FBI agent who is dragged in a drug war that takes place at the border of Mexico and U.S. Emily Blunt is absolutely excellent in this role, one of the best female performance we've seen so far this year. Her character is smart and idealistic, however, we can see absolute fear in her eyes when she starts to realize that she entered in another world, a very dangerous world where the rules don't always apply. I will be honestly shocked if she won't be nominated for the Academy Award. Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin are also excellent in supporting roles, playing characters whose motivations are not fully clear until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie are absolutely gorgeous, the cinematographer, Roger Deakins, did an amazing job and I can't wait to see him work again with Villeneuve in the Blade Runner sequel. We see some beautiful wide-shots of Mexico, with great lighting and colors. Also the action scenes are beautifully directed, there's no shaky cam or quick editing, everything looks perfect. There is also night-vision sequence that looks absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>This movie is a great take on the war on drugs, with three- dimensional characters, with solid acting from the Blunt-Brolin-Del Toro trio, fantastic visuals and a very good script. All in all, this one of the best movies of this year! A must watch! 9/10"
"uvznab","2","11","26","19 December 2015"," If the movie wanted to convey pain, it worked!
","Outstanding cinematography, incredible cast ensemble, fair enough premise for an interesting catharsis... One would think all the ingredients for an OK movie at the least, no?<br/><br/>I get it when art tries to invoke emotions from the audience, but I don't think that ""pleeeeease, for the love of god, just get on with it"" is one of those. It actually gets me quite angry. Hey! Another emotion that may be credited to this masterpiece!<br/><br/>I simply don't get it. I don't understand why a director would stretch so many shots unnecessarily. I found this movie to take triple the time this story could be told - and still convey the same message, or EVEN a better more engaging one. I can only imagine the people who liked it had a lot of spare time on their hands to check facebook or go to the toilet during it, but for the rest of us, this movie is an agonizing experience that ended up with me angry at myself as to why did I end till the ending to stop it hoping something happen.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to people who ONLY appreciate model cinematography and acting marksmanship. However, if you have half- descent abilities to focus on the story (and actually interesting in one) - stay away. If there was a book for this, I'd send you to read it instead."
"johnny_joko","2","6","12","23 March 2019"," Snooze-fest
","So, I watched Sicario yesterday. I had two friends suggest this movie to me. Also the good rating on imdb and a very good cast made me decide to watch it. The movie is 2 hours long and not only did it feel like 4 hours but especially in the first 55 minutes you have absolutely NO IDEA what the hell is going on! And even after you get some explanation, it still doesn't seem enough. I found myself feeling frustrated many times and I was just hoping for something interesting to happen. The only good things about it, are some drone shots and that's about it. It feels like half the time you just see people driving from one place to another or near the end just walk in pitch black for 10 minutes! We learn about Emily Blunt's role in the operation after 80 minutes have gone by! They only needed her because she was a domestic agent and not because of her skills. Even that revelation doesn't force any change to her character which is ridiculous. Also, some scenes went on for much longer than they should have. The only interesting scene is the one where Alejandro enters the Cartel bosses mansion and kills everyone. That's it! Emily Blunt's character is beyond boring and she is supposed to be the protagonist. Actually none of the characters are likable and the movie fails to make you care for any of them. At some point I was actually hoping for everyone to die so that this travesty would end sooner. The final scene is as anti-climactic as it gets... The fact that this has a 7.6 rating in imdb is beyond me! Total snooze-fest! I had already downloaded the sequel, but after that steaming pile of garbage I had just watched, deleting it immediately was the right thing to do..."
"pinokiyo","5","6","12","16 June 2016"," Awful Pacing. SLOW FILM. Del Toro is the only saving grace with one ""badass"" scene.
","Make sure you have time to kill and plenty of sleep to pay attention to this film.<br/><br/>We've all seen the intense border scene in the trailer that makes us want to watch this film... while there is big anticipation for that scene in the beginning to come on, the drive/parade there takes forever - yet it's quite underwhelming. After that, you must sit through a long dragged on scenes again.<br/><br/>Oh, the irony how Emily Blunt is also ""used"" more as a fill-in for the film shooting as well. She is not the main star. The whole film she is just CONFUSED the whole time, along with the audience, and it can be really frustrating. <br/><br/>The film is very slow pacing and is confusing to a normal viewer with all the military jargon talking heads and rankings involved - unless that's really your thing. <br/><br/>Del Toro easily steals the show here and is the most interesting character where you want to know most about. (I believe they're making a sequel to focus more about him) <br/><br/>Del Toro's character is like Tom Cruise's Vincent character in Collateral; both characters have a very interesting background where you really want to know more about -- and a major badass coming out of the shadows. <br/><br/>You know what would be a really interesting movie? Have Tom Cruise Vincent character go against Del Toro's character - I'd pay to watch that!<br/><br/>At the same time it's very Hollywood drama having a single man take people down, cheesy Zero Dark Thirty night vision scene and tunnel. The situation is very illogical and unrealistic, as dramatic as they tried to be. <br/><br/>If you are able to stand the slow dragged on confusing beginning, the best scene by far in the movie is with Del Toro near the end with the ""dinner scene"" performance. The mood and tone is very tense, but that's the only real thing/worthwhile going for this movie. <br/><br/>It's one of those films where things conveniently happen (Like the movie CRASH) to progress the film forward. <br/><br/>I'm surprised Richard Roeper considered this the ""best movie of the year"". Oh, we miss Siskel and Ebert <br/><br/>The ratings is way too high and I think many are way too bias because of that single Del Toro scene alone. Overall, they dragged it on too much for little depth and pay off. The ending is unsatisfying where it leave you hanging."
"kvswathi","3","6","12","25 May 2016"," Boring to Hell
","Was interested by the name of the movie and trailer. So went on to watch it with great interest. Just after 12 minutes into the movie, it was dragging predictably and Emily Blunt became a laughing stock. The scenes seemed too artificial with no feel for it. The movie was let down by horrendous acting of their stars and the characters appeared so superficial and failed to engage the viewer into the movie. The only thing I really enjoyed is the cinematography and background score which were top notch and managed to make me watch the whole movie. The film contains extreme violence and may get haunting. Just avoid it. Nothing interesting in this movie."

","Emily Blunt plays a swat officer. I just can't see her in such character.<br/><br/>If you are in love with Mrs Blunt, you will love the film because she is everywhere. But that is it. Del Toro looks like it was hired to play against its will, he looks tired and inexpressive. Same goes for Blunt, actually, she looks like she's tired of shooting the film.<br/><br/>It is just a hype movie around these two actors. Sadly, they don't deliver. Blunt even seems confused about how to play her character.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin delivers a good performance and we hang on him hoping for something to capture our attention.<br/><br/>The issue with the film, is that it doesn't have a pace. The few action (and very noisy) scenes are distant one from another like tropical islands on a desert ocean. The film focuses - and this focus is blurry as well - on the morals about an honest American officer that faces illegal practices of other State employees in the drug war.<br/><br/>By the way, the Mexican Juarez city is not an inferno place like the movie tries to picture. This city has a very violent history related to drug and illegal emigration cartels, but there is also a large population living, working, going to school and living a normal live, not necessarily in fear."
"colinjamesmcdermott","6","4","7","21 April 2019"," After much hype, left bitterly disappointed
","Sicario was billed to me as a great movie to watch.
I was expecting something along the lines of Crash, silence of the lambs mexican style or essentially a confronting movie with blood, gore, police fights and telling chases.<br/><br/>Instead were left with a slow plot instead.<br/><br/>The start of the movie delivered exactly what I expected. A confronting Gang hiding people in walls and life being cheap. Perfect, we see clearly why Emily would go on a mission south. Now we find Emily and a Mexican police escort posse 15 cars long go into the dangerous zone with corpses hanging by the side of the road warding them off. Good start.<br/><br/>Then the traffic jam! wow this convoy is stuck in traffic and they see 2 gang cars in the distance also stuck in traffic. How convenient, so they wonder over, gang cars pull guns on them, get shot and they get a crumb of information.... right I bought that plot leap!<br/><br/>Now we have this 'shock' that US agencies go across the border to arrest and torture bad guys who appear to be quite bad. No redeeming features of them, just gang thugs being pushed to confess. Emily and her partner push to their boss wanting more details and answers...flagging their procedural concerns there. It's illuminating but sicario fails to ramp up the tension. It's officers asking their boss ""are we ok to do this""...""yes"".
It doesn't bring out the objections clear enough. The biggest problem being the FBI involved are 'in the dark', not the torture nor their reaction to the torture.<br/><br/>So Emily gets drunk, her partner introduces her to a ""good man"" they get it on. When she realises he was carrying a bank note wrap identical to the wrap used in this mornings bust at the bank. After playing an almost helpless white female, a man comes to her rescue and gets this corrupt cop off her.<br/><br/>Again how convenient. Lets just have a QF make another plot leap. Now they interrogate the corrupt cop and find out the location of the other corrupt cops. The only redeeming factor here is the corrupt cop being told that it's his family in protective custody or their addresses posted on Reddit.<br/><br/>Then there is the tunnel scene which is meant to impress us with IR technology. Emily confronts Del Toro after he finds another corrupt cop ""silvio"" loading money in the trunk. Emily goes to stop him and Del Toro shoots her in her armor.
Del toro then proceeds to use the corrupt cop to get into the gang mansion and kill everyone there. Including the gang leaders family as they sit to eat a meal. It is 100% unclear if Emily knows any of this or if Del Toro is just immune to bullets.<br/><br/>Also this is the death of Silvio, the father of the mexican kid playing soccer. the Kid being bossed around to get his bratty father stuff while he lives the life of the family father god. I had no idea why this was added. You make a heartfelt father and kill him I would understand as this provides connection to the brown people being blown apart, tortured and killed during the movie. You make a flawed and real father then you get a real connection. Instead you have made a demanding father that does nothing with his kid who the kid feels ambivalent about his passing in circumstances unknown. what was the point!<br/><br/>The real crunch, Del toro this assassin is the one who confronts Emily to fill in the paperwork greenlighting the whole operation and to say it followed procedure. Right, your assassin paid to take out another drug cartel is the one ensuring the paperwork is signed! After wanting to see this for a few years and hearing a lot of hype, this is a fizza."

Is it the script that sets up story lines and background and then ignores all the foundation it just established? Is it the direction that wants so badly to focus on the chases and shooting that he just gives up on coherence altogether? Whatever it is, the beginning and the rest of the movie are completely disconnected.<br/><br/>We start out with Emily Blunt as a supposedly bad-ass FBI agent who's been""kicking in doors"" being asked to join a mysterious task force with no explanation and no reason for choosing her in particular. Fact is, she's just not convincing in the role. She seems way to fragile to support her back story. <br/><br/>If they were looking for someone with her talents and skills, they never use any of them. If they were just looking for a patsy to take the fall, why pick a great agent instead of some dead wood from a back office? It makes no sense and just goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>Our tough, professional heroine instantly turns into a wet dishrag and complete victim with no spine. She gets ignored, disrespected, beaten, shot and takes it all with a blank expression or simpering tears, but never does she do anything meaningful to change her situation. <br/><br/>The rest of the cliched drug cartel story is the same stuff you see on any of the weekly cop shows, nothing new is added except a few extra on screen murders and some extra blood.<br/><br/>Very glad I didn't pay to see this one, I only wasted 2 hours instead of a lot of cash."

","Emily Blunt is kept in the dark... so are we. Very very weak reasons for her entanglement in this drug cartel movie. 6 American SUV's barrelling down the Juarez highway in a super- coordinated prisoner pickup, and then that convoy being held up by a vehicle broken down in the border line up is a bit hard to believe. But .. it's great scenery and it does have Josh Brolin in it so it must be good,right?<br/><br/>Well let's put it this way, he's good because he slots into these type of roles easily and pulls it off. The movie is well shot and is a typical portrayal of the American perception of the best way to deal with those nasty purveyors of pollution. Shoot'em dead with no mercy is their answer and so they happily employ goons and psychos to slaughter people in the mistaken belief that the more you get rid of, the less there are to deal with.It's like stamping on ants at the entrance to their nest! In my innocent mind and in my little world, in my little circle of friends, I don't know any drug takers or dealers and the problem I have with the theme of this movie is the level of society's resources committed to stamp out the use of narcotics by maybe 3% of the population. Blowing the suppliers to smithereens doesn't make one iota of difference to the production line, it makes for good movie scenes, it makes for rough justice but it doesn't solve any problems at all. Even with these prejudices I got absorbed by Del Toro's ruthless character, I wasn't that impressed by Emily Blunt and it seemed to me that she spent most of the movie with her mouth open, gobsmacked by the stuff unfolding in front of her, not much in the way of building any empathy. I still can't get over the way these goons and thugs (the good guys I might add) wander into buildings , flit round a corner and think they're safe with a gun in their hand, I suppose it's necessary theatre but it's really stupid . To sum up , I was disappointed with a lazy script and a sub par performance from the cast, the scenery constantly outshines the rest of the project."

","Sicario wants to examine the USA's role in the Mexican drugs war with special ops taking on the Mexican cartels in a ruthless manner, hoping the ends justifies the means but in reality just muddies the waters even more.<br/><br/>The film starts of horrifically, a raid in a house in Arizona leads to the discovery of a some corpses blamed on the Mexican Sonora cartel. Director Denis Villeneuve also then makes the mistake of signalling what will happen next.<br/><br/>This kind of bluntness in the narrative will follow through the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) after the Arizona incident is assigned to a special task force to go after the main guys running the Sonora cartel. The special ops team is led by arrogant and shady CIA operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who you figure will have an hidden agenda. Accompanying them is Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) as some kind of dubious lawyer turned law enforcement officer from Mexico.<br/><br/>Although after an interesting opening the film slows down to a snail's pace and it exposes the story as being muddled and the characters specially Brolin as one dimensional and Blunt as someone who is out of her scope in this operation and it dawns on her that she is not only being used but also placed herself in grave danger.<br/><br/>The story only perks up later when the film focuses on revenge driven Alejandro allowing Benecio del Toro to take centre stage as he goes after the head of the cartel.<br/><br/>The film has good photography by Roger Deakins, Villeneuve wants to give the film a grittiness but the story lacks nuance."

","At times (and it seems these times happen FAR too often) we all find ourselves checking to see how long a movie has until it ends, freeing us at long last from some manner of misery. And then there are cinematic gifts like ""Sicario"". Man, I NEVER wanted this brilliantly brutal masterpiece chronicling the down and dirty business of fighting Mexican drug trafficking to frickin' ever FINISH! <br/><br/>Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Daniel Kaluuya. Uniformly exceptional performances from each of these TRUE pros in every sense of what this word stands for. One minor quibble. I REALLY would have liked to see Director Dennis Villeneuve focus in greater detail on Del Toro's agonizingly tormented character Alejandro. ""Sicario"", the exquisite model of top-tier movie making that it is, could have been considerably better served through more concentration invested in and close-ups of a man whose soul is condemned to be interminably tortured whether or not he exacts at last the vengeance he stalks with such fierce and unbridled commitment. Del Toro is certainly that class of actor who I believe could have given us even more to remember in an already tour de force performance.<br/><br/>However unsavorily gained, U.S. law enforcement ultimately scores a major victory in ""Sicario"". The film's final images portray a seemingly innocent scene of a bunch of kids being cheered on by their moms while playing soccer in the Mexican dirt. The abrupt and menacing ""time out"" delivers a stark and sobering punch to the gut with the reality that this insidious war on drugs rages on.<br/><br/>Brolin's character warns us earlier in this harrowing story that as long as 20% of Americans are consumers of the commodity at the core of this ruthless combat the fight must continue. Which leaves us to struggle with the enduring and deeply disturbing question...<br/><br/>How, then, is it EVER going to end?"
"Artless_Dodger","9","4","7","13 February 2016"," Intense and compelling.
","Intense and compelling, this beautifully shot thriller features wonderful work from Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro, amongst others, and depicts a murky, morally vacuous war against drugs on the Mexican border.<br/><br/>Blunt plays Kate Macer, an FBI agent who, fed on half truths and lies, slowly realises the nature of the mission she's a part of. It's a powerful and visceral turn, and has much to do with the success of the film. Similarly, del Toro is brilliantly inscrutable as Alejandro and Josh Brolin does fine work as Matt, the apparent architect of the chaos. These three leads work brilliantly together, the friction between their characters driving the film. However, it's Blunt's gilt-edged performance as the stories moral compass that forms the centrepiece.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins cinematography is a highlight. The screen is filled with beautiful skyscapes and sunsets, the characters descending in silhouette to an underworld, a tunnel across the border. Denis Villenueve directs with verve and pace, never allowing the film to falter for a second. An early foray into Mexico is as taut and tense as anything you will find on film, and Villenueve, having grabbed you, simply doesn't let go. <br/><br/>One of the best films of the year. Don't miss it."

You could easily say they were shunned this year, especially del Toro, he was a scene stealer in every scene he was in in the movie. Look strongly forward to the sequel."

","Del Toro is the only reason people can make it to the end. Emily Blunt is already unlikable and to throw her into a weak and unlikable character just really made her presence that much worse. So if you are in love with Del Toro is it worth watching once. If you aren't you better just pass on this film. You expect her character to eventually get better and grow as most do when they face issues, but her character started weak and unlikable and it only got worse as the film went on. Del Toro took complete control of his role and where he is in it, it is amazingly. Sadly, he just does not get enough screen time to really make it worth it. I'm not surprised this movie didn't win any awards. I would have been more surprised if it had."
"lavatch","Null","4","7","5 January 2016"," Overrated & Underwritten
","""Sicario"" is a violent, unpleasant, hopelessly confused action picture caught in between a standard revenge drama and a socially relevant film.<br/><br/>The main problem is the lack of sympathetic characters, especially the main role of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt). Throughout the film, Blunt's character is lost in the vicious world of illegal government ops led by the cocky CIA operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). As with so many events in American history of the past half century, covert operations are rationalized by the dictum ""the ends justify the means."" If the filmmakers wanted to raise awareness of such vital issues as immigration and drug wars, they did not succeed.<br/><br/>Nearly all of the characters were one-dimensional in what would typically be the norm for a made-for-television movie. The most interesting role is that of a violent revenge-driven mercenary named Alejandro (Benicio del Toro). SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: In the penultimate scene of the film, Kate is ordered at gunpoint by Alejandro to sign a document stipulating that all of the covert activities she has witnessed were legal. Kate refuses to sign. In this crucial moment of the film, how many viewers could really say that they cared whether or not Kate Macer signed that document?"
"bob the moo","Null","4","7","30 December 2015"," Brooding thriller with murky morals which is strong enough to carry it through a final third that is not quite what the majority of the film is
","Aside from hearing positive things about this film, I had really not heard too much specific on it. I knew it was a drug-related film but such detail doesn't tell you how it will approach it – whether it will be Awards-bait 'issues' film, an action movie, or what. In the case of Sciario it is certainly a thriller which uses as its base a world direct from the headlines. The film opens with a tense and violent SWAT incursion, setting a tone that it keeps for the whole film. In place of big action sequences what we get is a slow-burn, where sequences are drawn out, tension, and (if they have violence) tend to have sudden and decisive moments. I have read some complaining that this makes it feel slow paced or dull, however for me it worked really well.<br/><br/>Within this thriller, there is a pleasing moral murkiness to it. The viewer is asked to constantly revise who we are supporting and why; and rather than provide us an easy answer at any point, the film leaves us in roundly murky territory, which does feel realistic and satisfyingly bleak. Not all of the film does feel realistic though, and the specifics of the final third are perhaps not in keeping with the tone of the narrative up till that point. Personally I found that the film had done enough to keep me with it so that I went with the narrative when it went off in a specific direction – mainly because it added to the sense of the film being grey morally.<br/><br/>The cast are strong throughout, with Blunt, Del Toro, and Brolin, all play their characters well, with a smartness that informs in retrospect as well as in the moment. The supporting cast has plenty of well known faces giving good turns but without distracted by the 'where do I know him from?' factor – specifically Garber, Bernthal, and a brief appearance from Donovan. British Kaluuya is pretty impressive in his role and was a surprise find since I had only before seen him in an episode of Black Mirror. The directing and editing of the film works to the tension, and the camera is used really well to keep the viewer in the scene and feel that tension and feeling of the unknown throughout.<br/><br/>Sicario is a strong thriller, which benefits from solid characters, a morally murky narrative, and a consistent brooding tension which is used well to give way to moments of sudden, brutal, and all too believable violence."
"miss-snoozy","8","4","7","29 December 2015"," A nice surprise
","Sicario is a movie about a girl that works for the CIA. She is asked to volunteer for a certain project involving a drug cartel. She says yes but from the start she really doesn't know or understand what the project is really about. Everybody involved acts vague and mysterious about it. And more so why is the character of Benicio Del Toro (Aljandro) joining this project for. What is he; CIA, FBI, something else? And what is his goal? They get involved in a strange shoot out with people from the cartel and the plot thickens.<br/><br/>I found myself getting drawn in and wanting to understand what was going on. Benicio Del Torro does a great job of adding to the mystery, playing a mysterious and ruthless guy with an unclear objective. Emily Blunt complements him well. As far as I know this is her first more serious role, first time she plays a more in depth character in a serious movie. She strikes a very good balance between portraying a relatively experienced CIA agent and a young girl that gets sucked in a weird project feeling not quite sure how to react. She is very natural in this role, very human. <br/><br/>There is a nice build up of tension in this movie. The scenes are almost all exciting in the sense that there is tension that puts you on the edge of your seat. And slowly this tension leads to the unfolding of the story and truth behind what is going on. I thought this was very well done. On top of that this is a story thats different from the usual stories about drug cartels, drug wars etc. Its not a cliché action movie. It has more depth and feels more realistic.<br/><br/>Other then that the movie is a great watch where it comes to how its filmed and the cinematography,a joy really.<br/><br/>All in all a great watch. If you're looking for something exciting, to be drawn in and forget about your daily life for two hours this is a movie for you. For movie lovers in general its a must watch."
"TheMaster01","8","7","15","19 September 2015"," Sicario.
","Sicario opens in Arizona. A still frame interrupted by the entry of a U.S. task force creeping into the picture, ready to raid a hideout run by a Mexican drug cartel. Right from the opening, Roger Deakins orchestrates some of the year's (even the decade's) most powerful and articulate images, under the careful eye of Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy, Incendies). The images are haunting and violent, yet incredibly mesmerising. This is where the film draws its powerhouse gut-punch from; frames that will stick with you even after the final credits have rolled. <br/><br/>So what do we find at the hideout? Corpses. Decomposing bodies lined up and stuffed within the walls. Don't worry, I'm not giving to much away, for this is merely the exposition of Villeneuve's best film yet. Here we meet Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), an excellent FBI agent who's almost met by death within the first five minutes of the film. No one's safe in Villeneuve's world, and we're reminded of that constantly throughout the intense ride. <br/><br/>Shocked by the discovery of the corpses, and won over by the promise of justice against those responsible for this horror; Macer volunteers to assist in a joint government task force in taking down a Mexican Cartel leader. Now, the War on Drugs/Inter-American drug trade has served as a canvas for many, many artists to lay their brush upon and share the horrors of the matter. But very few manage to encapsulate this theme so wonderfully, and provide as much of an exhilarating experience, as Sicario. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay is tight, tense and reminiscent of Boal's 'Zero Dark Thirty' screen writing, in that he's able to allow the story to constantly flow even when our protagonist steps out of the picture. Blunt's kickass screen presence can be seen at times as if echoing Chastain's dynamite performance in Zero Dark Thirty, whilst letting rip further on as if channelling Linda Hamilton's badass role as 'Sarah Connor'. Her expressive face is loved by Deakins' camera, and only further adds to the horror of the film's situations. In a world of violence and corruption, Blunt's do-good nature pumps a sense of hope through the film's veins. It's a stellar performance, but she's also surrounded by an award-worthy ensemble cast.<br/><br/>The leader of the government operation, Matt Graver (Brolin in another damn fine role), is a far more relaxed sandal-wearing figure who suggests Macer ought to loosen up a little bit. Brolin brings a swaggering smart ass element to the role, to act as the perfect juxtaposition to his associate, Alejandro (Benincio Del Toro). It's difficult to imagine anyone playing 'stone-cold killer' like Del Toro does (except maybe for Javier Bardem), but here, he matches his award winning role in Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" (funnily enough another film focused on drug cartels). As the film progresses, Macer's frustration builds, as she attempts to find the secrets that Matt and Alejandro are clearly not divulging. There's a mysterious quality present throughout most of the film, under-cut by superbly directed action scenes throughout. Your heart will undoubtedly start racing as you sit through an intense border crossing sequence. <br/><br/>Johann Johannsson's score is another exciting driving force upon which the film is carried. Never overbearing or obnoxious, the score is dark and foreboding, it's perfect. The film itself isn't 'perfect'; it could be argued that the story feels overly familiar (which I've read some have stated, mainly due to the subject matter) but I honestly feel that the approach isn't. Villeneuve's direction is much stronger here than in any of his previous works, and his ability to balance the main trio throughout most of the film's duration, is an achievement. It feels pretty damn real. It's tense, nervy and incredibly well made. Sicario means ""Hitman"" is Spanish. With Villeneuve as our ""Sicario"", you won't know what's hit you."
"rparbhak","8","7","15","18 September 2015"," Great film with some flaws that hold it back
","I just saw this movie at the 1130PM showing at the Arc Light in Hollywood. There were previous screenings tonight but there was a decent turnout at this time. I believe it will stay in the 7.5-8 rating range after the full release. I give it a solid 8. I know that there is a lot of fear on this board about whitewashing and American exceptionalism ruining the film, but that is not the case. This is a movie about a lot of dangerous people battling for control. The US government and Mexican Cartels are both implicated in carrying out nefarious deeds. This was a huge relief, especially after seeing the trailer for new Michael Bay propaganda film before the movie. <br/><br/>The movie is paced better than Denis's previous work. I had read the script prior to the filming and I was worried most about that. I was fully immersed the whole film and was wide awake/alert despite seeing it after a 12 hour workday. He has a gift for creating tension and it is in full effect in this movie. There were several tense set pieces that were well executed. The opening set piece was great and set the tone for the entire film. <br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful while also being restrained at the same time. Roger Deakins is an absolute maestro, a complete savant with lighting, framing, and camera placement. I have worked as a DP on projects that were outside in a desert landscape and it can be absolute hell to deal with. He and Denis know when to keep it simple and when to really accentuate the scene with more stylistic lighting. The golden hour scenes in the desert were beautiful and made me nostalgic for my home state of Arizona. <br/><br/>The acting was top notch especially Del Toro. He is comfortable with this sort of material and it really shows. When I read the script, I pictured this exact characterization for the character. Emotionless and relentless. It is his best performance to date. Brolin has a smaller role, but plays it well. Ruthless, determined, yet calm under pressure. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt nailed the archetypal cop just trying to do good role. I know the studio executives wanted a male to play the role, but it would have taken away from the movie. Her strength as well as her vulnerability gave more credibility to her character. Her physicality and emotional acting skills were on display at a high level. <br/><br/>The movie has flaws. Emily is not given enough depth or development. Her character is just not written very well. Her actions are predictable and her reactions were clichéd. I wanted to know more about her. The plot is very familiar in terms of a crime drama/thriller and does not really do anything special or unique. I also wasn't a fan of the score, but that is just personal preference. It doesn't take away from the film at all. It had the potential to be something more special and it drops the ball. It is still a great film and I recommend you all to see it."
"s3276169","4","8","18","19 December 2015"," Moral ambivalence doesn't cut the mustard.....
","Sicario is yet another one of those supposedly morally ambivalent films churned out by the US, that try's and fails to stave off international criticism. <br/><br/>For me this film, like so many others in the same vein simply doesn't cut the mustard. Interference in other countries politics, economics and justice systems is imperialism, pure and simple. <br/><br/>Trying to justify the crapulence of the US's various arms of government, in this case, interceding in Mexico by using the argument its necessary, irrespective of whether or not its morally justified, is simply bullshit, pure and simple. <br/><br/>Yes, apparently, if you are a sheep, you should step aside and let the wolves do their job. That would seem to be the message to take away from this film. Of course, the problem with all of this, as this film can't help but demonstrate, is that if you behave like wolves, so will those you loose them upon. Its peace and reason that changes people for the better, not mutual brutality and violence.<br/><br/>So setting aside my dismay at the questionable tone of this film, what did think of the film itself? Its inherently interesting material, so it is watchable. The acting is of a generally good standard. The lack of morality shown in this film however, for me, simply made it look a lot like propaganda for a cause that has already failed and rightly so. Four out of ten from me."

","Benicio came back for sloppy seconds, Douglas decided to pass. I have heard people complain that some of the promotional artwork places Benicio front and center albeit Emily Blunt is the alleged star. Truthfully he is the star, and his work is solid in this. Indeed, he's the reason for watching this as the only decent scenes have him in it. I often wonder why stars don't shut down some of the garbage they are called upon to spew in movies. Emphasis on stars, as I realize everyone else on set just needs to pick up their paycheck and I can respect that. The dialogue Emily is forced to mutter totally ruins the film, is abysmal and worse, distracting. I don't blame her, as I know she can do solid work as well as Benicio. I blame the script. She whines, cries, moans, complains, and mopes around throughout the entire movie; I don't know why. Her character from Edge of Tomorrow would have kicked her butt if she ran into her in this movie. Meanwhile the real star, Benicio is actually in the real movie taking names with his variety of awesome firearms and other assorted weapons. A few Hollywood crony reviewers compared Blunts work in this to Gene Hackman as Popeye in French Connection. Really? That is a low blow and is worse than dancing on the career grave of Hackman. He does not deserve that, hell I can't think of any actor deserving that kind of an insult. <br/><br/>This review would be more interesting if I went off on a further tangent, and discussed Hackman classics like Heartbreakers, but I digress. Back to the alleged plot of Traffic II, oops I mean Sicario. The gist of this movie is Benicio wants vengeance for the death of his wife and daughter at the hands of the drug lord and the equally repulsive United States government wants to oblige him. Josh Brolin plays the doughy CIA thug who dragoons FBI patsy Blunt into the operation to create legitimacy for the whole mess. Thus as Benicio goes around making widows and lowering the crime rate in Mexico significantly, Blunt loafs around spooning up righteous indignation worse than the Church Lady from Saturday Night Live. Blunt can't do anything right, she's the most inept FBI Agent I've seen on film since 1988 when FEDS came out. Blunt gets shot and strangled more times than any villain in the film; in some bitter irony it's even odds most of it is friendly fire. I bet by the end of this movie she wanted to shoot her character as well. This is tragically one of those movies that could have been great. Groundbreaking even. It is not. It's really an individual call if you want to take two hours of your time just to view a half a dozen scenes with Benicio taking out the garbage. Don't, instead watch him in The Hunted, or better yet Traffic."

","VERY GOOD MOVIE WITH LITTLE TO NO NUDITY <br/><br/>Through the powerful performances by Blunt, Del Toro and Josh Brolin in the leads as well as the excellent supporting cast, do we get a sense of the human cost (physical and psychological), which the war on drugs has caused.<br/><br/>From an exploding prison population, to the destruction of Mexican agriculture, to refugees and a cycle of violence that is beyond barbarity; the pull that ""Sicario"" exerts over the viewer is undeniable and by skirting the limits of bearable tension, without ever becoming exploitive, it is never giving an inch concerning its subject matter.<br/><br/>Few movies this year will have such a clear and defined structure and unflinching approach towards a situation that appears to be beyond salvation, while showing at the same time that life nevertheless continues.<br/><br/>Taylor Sheridan's script doesn't miss a single beat and without sidestepping anything frees itself from beaten movie conventions by using them in an extremely skillful manner.<br/><br/>All these themes, stories and characters are captured through the lens of veteran Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) who lets us always know how the micro- and macro-particles of any conflict are inextricably intertwined. We share the vistas of beautiful sceneries while having to witness their downfall. <br/><br/>Whatever ideals the likes of Emiliano Zapata once had, their country has now, as it is described in the movie, become the land of wolves"". <br/><br/>Fifteen years ago Steven Soderbergh's Traffic"" which earned numerous Oscars, not the least of which went to Benicio Del Toro, made a clear statement about the various strands the drug trafficking business touches.

","When the overbearing music conveys more feeling than the characters you know you have a train wreck on your hands. This is unfortunately the case with Sicario. A middling attempt at a dark/brooding drama, all the intensity in Sicario is unwound by incomplete characters. Most responsible is our female protagonist. Blunt delivers a one note performance and the note is vulnerability. Her character starts as pathetic and incompetent, the movie informs us that off screen she is was not always this way, and ends as pathetic and incompetent. What an arc. Watching her wander completely lost as she discovers her mysterious partners are not who they say they are (gasp) is just miserable. Watching her get pinned down by whatever man who happens to be in the same vicinity is insulting. Sure, many of us are tired of the generic ass kicking protagonist, but this is no better. Not that Blunt has any help. I think Del Toro is trying to impersonate someone from, No Country. He is not intimidating. Brolin is the vague sandal wearing operative. Nothing new there. The outcome of this movie is completely irrelevant (but still predictable) because I could not care what happens to any of these people. There are certainly riveting sequences and gorgeous shots, but these qualities are drowned by greater flaws. Sad, this is just an indication that some talent was completely wasted. Call it technically well-made if you want, but Sicario is a beautiful uninteresting film not about anything or anyone no matter how hard it tries."

My reasoning for 3/10 because there wasn't much action involved in the movie. Hell lot of talking! Too much talking. It didn't really explain what was going on in the movie. I understand that they are looking for a drug lord that killed many people. The operations wasn't clear at all, it was hard to find out what the hell was going on. <br/><br/>The actors were okay through out the movie. Just not enough action with the characters.

The main character just kept crying and showing emotional feelings about the situation. <br/><br/>I hate to say... The trailer was better than the movie. The trailer gave away most of the action but then watching the movie, it was all talking. I wouldn't recommend going to cinema to watch this movie if you are expecting the movie to be like Hurt Locker or any other action movie involving guns from U.S army or SWAT.

","The movie contains huge doses of violence, profanity, tobacco and alcohol use. That's already a bad sign that there's something wrong with the story. Here's the problem: the audience is expected to accept the concept of gangster as hero (played by Benicio del Toro). If you are okay with that premise, then the story makes sense (vendatta - bad guy becoming good guy to go after other bad guys who did him wrong, for whatever reason). If not, then be prepared lots of gratuitous violence and mayhem, as the FBI is co-opted to cover for flagrant and wholesale violations of international law. There is one scene in the movie depicting a fire fight that alone would have sparked a war, or at least a call for an emergency session of the UN Security Council. In fact, including such a scene would have improved this movie immensely. The thing is, unless the movie is meant to be a morality tale, there has to be a clear delineation between the good guys and bad guys. That this movie lacks, thus making the story pointless. This movie depicts US paramilitary forces conducting military operations in a foreign country to deal with a criminal problem. True, the story is fiction. The problem is that as the line between who is good and who is bad gets blurred, the story get muddled. After a while, it is difficult to tell the difference between the good guys and bad guys. Granted that the drug cartel guys are bad guys. But when compared to the brazen tactics being used by the other side, it raises doubts as to who is posing more of a threat to the public safety - the the gangsters or the guys with the badges. What good are having bad guys if the good guys are no good too? Without revealing details of story, suffice it to say that if the shenanigans depicted in this movie occurred for real, the US government would have a lot of explaining to do"

Instead of the lead character, Emily Blunt, making thoughtful (or even halfway reasonable) decisions, she repeatedly chooses to do things that leave the end feeling completely empty. <br/><br/>This is not a movie without sequences of intense action, and if that is all you look for in a movie -- rest assured, you will find that and more with Sicario. However, if you want a logically coherent main character who isn't a bumbling idiot, a plot with more than a cursory explanation at the end, and in general some closure, you will not be happy with this movie. <br/><br/>At the end it was incredibly hard not to be frustrated with the decisions of the main character. This boring story of revenge with nobody having the guts to make a good decision was, quite frankly, disgusting."

","Nothing much to say... boring, slow... Maybe they tried to reveal how this facts are in real life, but it wasn't the better way to do it. the other thing that i didn't like is that they tried to keep you in suspense the whole movie, but instead they set you in doubt and at the climax boil your head to connect everything (in the bad way). Too bad for Emily, which i think is a great actress, she has several good movies.<br/><br/>Reading the other articles there is no such comment that makes me change my mind... i think it was 2 lost hours of my life.<br/><br/>greetings from Chile, it's my first Review"

","Sicario is a very decent action movie, with extremely tense and well-shot action sequences, superb directing by Dennis Villeneuve and AMAZING cinematography; this movie looks great. Regarding the story, it's an effective thriller, doesn't shy away from getting violent, but there's not much else. No big questions are attempting to get an answer. <br/><br/>I must say the acting is very good. The stand-outs, for me, are Brolin and Del Toro. The latter's character is madly interesting. I must say that I hated it the first time I saw it, but second time I really got to like it. Maybe it helped that I'm now more familiar with Denis Villeneuve's work, thanks to his masterpiece Arrival. Or that my expectations changed (the marketing in my country was very different to the actual movie). So, if you didn't like it the first time around, give it another chance."
"rishimon","3","7","16","12 October 2015"," An absolute waste of time
","I don't understand why someone should make a movie like this at all. This is basically a nothing movie. The initial build up with good music will keep the viewers interested in this movie but only to realize sooner that they are in for nothing and in the end it is going to be a big disappointment. Never felt connected to any characters, don't get why all the drama and the emotional scenes are big bore! Ratings and reviews so far has been misleading. The entire movie focuses on hunting down a big Mexican drug/war lord who has done many killing and illegal trafficking. The story and screenplay in the initial part of the movie was successful in building up the plot but the movie ends with hunting down an easily approachable so called big villain. This movie should have never been made."

"ginaatkins","Null","3","5","1 September 2018"," Once in a Lifetime Performances
","I'm very surprised that this movie doesn't have higher user reviews. The acting is top rate across the board. I'm glad to see Josh Brolin getting these juicy roles...always thought he was underrated. Del Toro is always brilliant and but this is without question the performance of his career. As a men with nothing left to lose and nothing left to fear the tension lies in not knowing how much humanity is left in him. He is the embodiment of a soul damaged beyond repair. There is no hope, no repentance, no salvation and he knows it. He fulfills his destiny without pleasure or passion...he avenges his family with the cold exactitude of a surgeon performing his 100th surgery. Josh Brolin's character has a broader agenda with the Cartel as a whole while Del Toro has a singular objective. The juxtaposition between the Del Toro character and the young, new agent played by Blunt is subtle and nuanced. A lesser movie would have made the Blunt character MORE vulnerable and susceptible. She is definitely changed forever by her dealings with Del Toro and the movie allows you to question, momentarily, whether she will be able to touch a deeply buried crevice in his soul. Maybe she was...but he knows who and what he is and willfully doesn't allow access even to himself."
"bbhuffstetler","10","3","5","8 August 2018"," A Masterpiece
","Sicario has the bones of a good crime thriller, but in the hands of a director as talented as Villeneuve, Sicario becomes a meditation about America's role in the drug war and a contemplation on what fighting monsters does to the human psyche. 
Roger Deakins lives up to the standard he has set for himself, framing the environment our protagonist finds herself in as foreign and frightening, yet somehow still reminded us of home stateside. A tense stand-off near the border is a particular standout. 
Emily Blunt gives perhaps the performance of her stellar and perpetually underrated career as Kate, a conduit for the audience in the story but also the manifestion of dignity and ethical conviction in a world that doesn't leave room for much of either. Josh Brolin is having a blast playing the swarmy and self assured Matt, while Benecio del Toro imbues Alejandro with a mysterious and tough exterior that shrouds personal tradegy.
The script is one that withholds any clear moral standing for the audience, and the viewer is left in a constant state of bewilderment as to who can be trusted and if everyone's stated intentions are true. By the end, you'll be without answers, only left to reckon with what you've seen on the screen, and what it means for your country and it's efforts in a destructive and perhaps futile drug war. 
Sicario combines great acting, confident direction, impressive camera work, a remarkable soundtrack, and a expertly woven script to make a film for the ages."
"warthogjump","10","3","5","4 July 2018"," Perfect in its own right
","This move is simply outstanding. The directing, the acting from the 3 main characters, being Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro is very believable. The story is very compelling. The cinematography is gorgeous. The futility of the drug war, and its literal elimination of morality, lingers throughout the film. Emily Blunt and Del Toro are flawless in tension together as their values clash, and Brolin fits the typical American bravado role seamlessly. It is one of its kind, a movie addressing the Mexican/US drug cartel concerns, and executing it with utter class, style and realism."
"raghavrastogi-97751","8","3","5","27 March 2018"," Superb ! Tense thriller !
","A must watch thriller based on crackdown efforts by US joint-agencies on the Mexican Drug mafia. Emily Blunt, playing the role of an idealistic FBI agent in the plot represents the general audience, through her actions and reactions to the out-of-the-book methods of the team.
One of those movies which are rightly paced at right moments, with excellent cinematography and background music score. The build-up to the tense moments, when the viewer knows something is about to happen but when and how, is the USP of this movie.
A must watch for those seeking tense, paced and realistic action thriller, with no over-the-top action sequences and silly dialogues."
"zkonedog","9","3","5","26 February 2017"," Intense Film That Puts You In The Fight Against Drug Cartels
","Director Dennis Villeneuve crashed the Hollywood directors scene in 2013 with the brutal (yet spectacular) ""Prisoners"". Later that same year, he crafted the ingenious mind-bender ""Enemy"". After those two films, I knew I had to see what he would come up with next. ""Sicario"" is a much different kind of movie than those previous two, but even so it still manages to showcase Villeneuve's talents behind the camera.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Sicario"" is a story about the Mexican drug cartels. Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) is a cop who deals with the drug problems caused by the cartels every day. After one particularly frustrating operation, Kate is given the opportunity by her boss (Josh Brolin) to strike at the heart of the problem in Mexico itself. This is a big-time operation, with the decisions being made in it equally as complex. Along for the ride is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a shadowy figure you get the feeling isn't quite who or what he seems.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" is a solid movie on two levels:<br/><br/>First, it really captures the tension of the drug cartel scene. It's like those kind of episodes from ""Breaking Bad"", but ratcheting up the intensity tenfold. This genre is not usually my cup of tea in the least, but there is such an atmosphere of tension that I couldn't help but be sucked into the action. There are scenes, like a tense border crossing and a shootout in dug-out cartel tunnels, that will literally have you on the edge of your seat. Not a boring moment in the entire film.<br/><br/>Secondly, and perhaps equally as important, Villeneuve is able to take such a serious topic and layer great character narratives on top of it. There are even multiple surprises along the way, including an ending that you won't see coming and would traditionally seem out of place for a typical film of this subject matter. That's why I'm being pretty tight-lipped about the plot, as I don't want to spoil anything. When was the last time you had to worry about spoilers for a drug cartel film?!<br/><br/>Thus, I have to say that ""Sicario"" was a great success for Villeneuve, as it proves that his unique style can translate into pretty much any kind of cinema format. He's that savvy. This is a great, tense, film that will hold your interest and never let it wane even for a moment. It doesn't matter if you prefer action, narratives, twist, etc., as ""Sicario"" provides them all in equal value. I'm very excited to see what this relatively new director can pull out of his bag of tricks next!"
"romanorum1","8","3","5","29 December 2016"," An Intense Examination of the Brutal Mexican Drug Cartels
","At the beginning a brief explanation of the origin of the word sicario is provided. It actually is derived from the Latin ""sicarius"" (""assassin""); in Spanish it means ""hitman."" <br/><br/>In broad daylight in Chandler, Arizona a kidnap response unit (SWAT team) moves in against a house where drug cartel hostages are kept. An armored truck crashes through a wall. After the shootout, the team discovers 35 bodies partially encased in plastic behind the drywall; some team members retch in disgust. Two of the agents perish when a bomb explodes in an outside shed. These actions illustrate the brutality of the Mexican drug cartels. Furthermore, the raid confirms that the cartels are operating in the American southwest. <br/><br/>At HQ, a secretive American task force (special ops), headed by unconventional Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), is assigned to legally or illegally hunt down the drug cartel honchos in Sonora, Mexico. These include drug bosses Manuel Diaz (Bernardo Sacarino), his brother Guillermo Diaz (Edgar Arreola), and top guy Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cesar Cedillo).On the task force is idealistic field agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who led the assault in Chandler, and coldly violent Columbian Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Emily has a confidante, supposedly helpful but actually annoying Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya). After briefing, five team vehicles are driven across the Mexican border, escorted by the heavily armed Policia Federal. We are introduced to an arid and harsh land, run-down houses, and partially clothed bodies hanging upside down along freeway overpasses. There will be more brutal scenes. From the Mexican authorities, the team picks up captured Guillermo Diaz. Graver warns, ""Keep an eye out for the state police. They are not always the good guys!"" When they return to the border crossing, the roads are totally jammed with barely any movement. Tension builds as the team is on the lookout for armed cartel hit-men in cars. Soon there is a shootout in front of all the civilians, but the cartel hit-men are killed; Emily kills a policeman allied with them. At HQ, Alejandro tortures Guillermo for information.<br/><br/>After that the task force surveys a bank and captures a female money launderer. They begin to freeze the bank accounts ($17 million) of Manuel Diaz. This action forces him out of hiding and into Mexico. At a bar Kate hooks up with Ted (Jon Bernthal), a cop, and takes him to her apartment for sex. But when he removes items from his pocket, she notices that a money band is the same as used by the drug cartel. The situation turns violent, but Alejandro intervenes and arrests Ted, who is grilled and tortured for information about other crooked police on the force. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Kate is upset; she feels that the team is operating out of bounds. She wants activities to be run by the book. Graver brings her back to reality when he tells her that his CIA unit cannot operate within the USA without a domestic agency accompanying it. ""I told you you'd be useful,"" he says. ""So that's it. That's why I'm here!"" she replies. Kate has received a dose of reality. With new information, the Delta Force makes a night assault on the cartel's hideaway tunnel. During the successful mission, Alejandro captures crooked Mexican cop Silvio (Maximiliano Hernández), and uses his car to capture Manuel Diaz. He kills both, and then moves against top honcho Fausto Alarcon. Killing the guards, Alejandro confronts Fausto and shoots him and his family (Fausto previously had Alejandro's wife beheaded and also had ordered his daughter thrown into a vat of acid.). Revenge yes, but why were Alejandro's family earlier killed? Was he part of the Columbian drug cartel? Do the authorities prefer the Columbians over the Mexicans because they are easier to control? <br/><br/>Near the end Alejandro forces his way into Kate's apartment and makes her sign a document at gunpoint that the entire mission was on the up-and-up. Actually the raid was legal but Alejandro's revenge killings were not. He advises her to get a position in a small town because she is obviously in over her head. At the end women watch their children play soccer in a field. They pay little attention to the gunfire heard in the distance as the drug war has become part of their lives. <br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve has directed a brutally realistic movie. He examines the Mexican drug cartels, their heartlessness, and how corrupting they are. His real message is that governments cannot play by the rules and so must fight fire with fire if they expect to make inroads into drug trafficking. Although the feature is generally told from the view point of Kate (Blunt), who performs well, Del Toro steals every scene where he appears. He probably merited an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor."
"brando647","9","3","5","18 September 2016"," Denis Villeneuve Scores Again with One of 2015's Best
","Denis Villeneuve continues to knock 'em dead with (in my opinion) his best film yet: SICARIO. I took interest in the man with his 2013 double-punch of PRISONERS and ENEMY (both of which are great films) but SICARIO was the only one I loved so much that I immediately texted a couple buddies and told them they need to watch. From the moment it started with the raid on a cartel stash house in an Arizona suburb, I was locked in and it never lost steam. I love this movie; it might be my favorite of 2015. Emily Blunt is FBI agent Kate Macer, a successful career woman who is given the opportunity to volunteer for an inter-agency operation that plans to go after some of the more powerful cartel heads. She's placed on a team run by CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) with assistance from a mysterious D.O.D. consultant named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Graver and Alejandro keep her in the dark on the overarching details of their operation but she begins to question the legality when the men seem to be bending the law in the name of justice. It all culminates in one final mission when Graver and his team have done enough damage to the cartel's local business to send a minor boss running back to Mexico, falling right into line with their plans to cripple the organization. When Graver's methods cross the line, Macer finds herself in a maelstrom of violence where the end may not justify the means.<br/><br/>I love everything about SICARIO. The performances. The cinematography. The story. The music. Everything comes together so perfectly. Emily Blunt has proved in recent years that she's more than capable of handling the meatier roles with EDGE OF TOMORROW from 2014 proving she's an effective action hero and SICARIO giving her the chance to up the ante in a more realistic violent environment. Her character, Macer, acts as the audience surrogate in this world. She's seen some rough times in her career but she struggles with the cartel's level of brutality. When she begins to understand that the American task force has adapted some shady methods of its own to combat it, she's not ready to accept it as the best course of action. When she learns of Graver and Alejandro's objective and the truth behind her inclusion in the task force to begin with, it's a gut punch and Blunt nails all of it. Brolin does a fantastic job as the jovial Graver but he's overshadowed by Blunt and Del Toro. Del Toro is the other knockout performance in SICARIO. His character is an enigma. All we learn at the start is that he is a ""D.O.D. consultant"" but it's not readily made clear what his role is. He keeps to himself and seems to have a pretty good understanding of cartel operations, but his real mission doesn't come out until the end. He gets his big moment at the end and we learn this is a man in pain, and he's turned that pain into a weapon. Del Toro absolutely kills it in one of his best roles ever.<br/><br/>Another aspect of SICARIO I thought was a great touch was how Villeneuve shows us both sides of the coin. Mexico isn't our enemy. The cartels are our enemy. The problem is how much the cartels have ingrained themselves in the Mexican economy. Throughout the movie, we occasionally cut away to a nondescript Mexican family. The father is a police officer and works odd hours, often missing out on time with his son. We're given a chance to invest a little in this quiet three-person family before we learn who this man is, how he plays into the main story and what his fate will be, and then we're left to wonder about the future of his family. SICARIO presents the war against the cartels as bad for everyone. Lives are ruined. Morals are abandoned. And worst of all, there appears to be no clear end in sight. Everyone loses. SICARIO is a seriously bleak film but I love that it doesn't pull any punches or try to sugarcoat its message. This isn't an action movie in line with the Bourne films or anything of that nature; SICARIO is very much a psychological drama. I watch this movie and it's rumbling around my head for a couple days after it's over. I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone and I can't wait to see what Villeneuve brings us next."
"sweetsteph111","10","3","5","24 July 2016"," Astonishing!

I never thought I could hear scary music again, the music was terrifying, my heart was pounding all through the movie, I do not want to give anything away because I want everyone to see this movie. Yes it is an Oscar worthy movie. The writing, the casting, everything. Since it was a movie about the Cartel, you can guess that there were will be guns and blood involved, but that is all I will give away. This movie was astonishing, soul twisting, and terrifying, all because it is based on reality. The horrors that go on in Mexico every day. Such a tragedy.

","Director Denis Villeneuve has imported in a tour-de-force picture in ""Sicario"". The movie stars Emily Blunt as FBI Agent Kate Mercer. She is recruited by the mercy (sort of, kind of) of a U.S. government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. Half mercy on Mercer because even though she volunteered for the journey, this is not what she envisioned it to be. Josh Brolin co-stars as the Government Agent Matt Graver who does not want to dig his own grave in this dangerous mission, so he manipulates Mercer in ways I will not reveal. At the center of this mission, is the mysterious Alejandro played by Benicio Del Toro. Villeneuve marveled in his orchestration of ""Sicario"" by keeping it tense and unpredictable. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay was a little bit of a bust, but not so much to lessen the movie's strength. Blunt delivers the best performance of her career as Mercer; and Mercy, Mercy, Me why in the world was she not nominated for a Best Actress Oscar! Brolin was his usual steady self in his work as Graver. Del Toro was the scene stealer of the movie though, and there were plenty of hits to that statement; I will just leave it at that. ""Sicario"" is sic!! And A must see, so open your borders for it. ***** Excellent"
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","5","13 March 2016"," Sicario really packs a punch
","This gritty, violent thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve, the mastermind behind 'Prisoners' and 'The Place Beyond The Pines' sets a grounded story during the U.S/Mexican drug wars heightened in the U.S border where crime against society runs dangerously rampant and drug cartels dominate the streets. The film places Emily Blunt in the role of Kate Mercer, an idealistic DEA agent who volunteers for an operation to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel. Partnered up with veteran DEA agent Matt Graver (played by Josh Brolin) and Alejandro Wilson (played by Benicio Del Toro) who is seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and child, Kate travels through the brooding streets of El Paso in search of the cartel, only to witness harrowing events that while busting the suspects connected to the cartel. As Kate and her team dive deeper and deeper into the operation, she is faced with the grim reality of drug trafficking business and the complexities of capturing the cartel. As explained the title card during the opening credits, sicario is the Spanish word for hit-man. <br/><br/>This thought-provoking thriller could be just your average action popcorn flick taxed with tense action sequences and special effects. However, it has a lot more thoughtful elements to bring to the table than flashy action set pieces; and it certainly digs deep. The film presses the story in the violent underworld of drug trafficking and the apparent corruption lead in the law enforcement, including characters who have blurred lines between right and wrong. This all begins with the opening scene set in Chandler, Arizona where a team of DEA agents are making a drug bust that results in an operation gone terribly wrong with innocent lives lost. Then there's a shot showing Emily Blunt's character in the shower washing off the blood resulted in the incident. These first ten minutes really set the tone of the film, and it gives a clear picture what the story will be diving into. From that point, the story focuses on the characters and their experiences drawing into the drug busting operation, and the scenes to follow get pretty violent and grim without being overly excessive. The characters are crucially developed and stand powerful throughout the picture, particularly Benicio Del Toro's character who is significantly complex, serves as a turning point for the story during its climax. <br/><br/>Roger Deakins has been one of the most respected cinematographers in Hollywood, despite his lack of Oscar landings, and he delivers powerful cinematography this film. Each scene from start to finish to shot superbly and fits well with the atmosphere. The biggest gem comes with the characters driving through El Paso where we are treated sadistic views of the crime-ridden streets including four decapitated bodies hanging from an overpass and corpses mutilated and covered in blood. This scene is very difficult to look at, but makes crucial sense to the plot's dreary atmosphere. The performances are also quite the attention grabbers. Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro are both fantastic in their roles, and deserve immense amount of praise for their striving commitment they put in their characters. <br/><br/>Sicario stands high as one of the best films of 2015 and perhaps, one of the best films of this decade so far. This film is exuberantly shot, very well acted, and paints an authentic picture of the reality of drug wars that go on in the U.S/Mexican border. Yes, the film is violent and difficult to watch at times, but at the same time, one that deserves your attention. It also shows a strong signal that director Denis Villenueve has a bright filmography ahead of him."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","7","3","5","27 February 2016"," Surprisingly good and more complex than its peers
","Certainly a surprise film of the year, Sicario delves into the sensitive subject of the escalating war against drugs that have become a daily occurrence for those near the border between the U.S. and Mexico.<br/><br/>A member of the kidnapping division in Arizona, Kate (Emily Blunt) is brought onto a special operations unit funded by the Department of Defense after a devastating and jarring blow to her team. Immediately whisked away on a mission; Kate observes with an outsider's eyes the happenings of this covert unit, the sole woman amongst men. Thrust into the deadly and brutal world of the drug cartels of Juarez Mexico, Kate realizes that her idealism has no place as her new assigned unveils itself as far from ethical. With fresh eyes and a purist's motivation, Kate must make her own judgments of trust if she wants to stay alive during this dangerous operation.<br/><br/>Sicario is a film I wasn't expecting. The military oriented subject matter is not normally my forte and the trailer for the film felt generic. Alas, quickly the praising whispers for the film grew too loud to ignore and right they were. Sicario is a film that commands your attention with its barbaric violence, brutally realistic point of view and its astonishing cinematography.<br/><br/>Directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, the film decisively sets the tone within seconds of opening, readying the audience for what they are about to see. Sicario is a film that jolts you with unease, telling you to forget whatever expectations you may have. It is about far more than the mission Kate embarks upon with the DoD, and its ability to harmoniously tell its complexly layered story is a testament to its success.<br/><br/>The best word to describe Sicario is 'intense.' It is jarring, disorienting, and raw. Sicario easily could have been a basic thriller with a military shoot 'em up component. In having Villeneuve direct, the films subtler points are brought to the forefront. Each character is multidimensional and each moment a scene to be watched, within it the plot nuances that lesser films so often forget. The protagonist Kate especially has a marvelous arc throughout the film that matches the audience member's own experience and grounds you further to be completely engaged with the film.<br/><br/>May you remember the film years from now? Perhaps not, but for those looking for a worthy film to entertain with a little bit for everyone to enjoy, Sicario is certainly it.<br/><br/>Please check out the website for Archon Cinema Reviews for reviews of all the awards season contenders."
"morrison-dylan-fan","9","3","5","12 February 2016"," ""The land of the wolves.""
","Talking to a fellow IMDber,I got told about a gritty 2015 Crime Thriller which explored the War on Drugs.After being taken by the tantalising trailer,I decided that it was time to meet the sicario (hit-man in Spanish.)<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Going on a raid for suspected kidnappers,FBI agents Kate Macer & Reggie Wayne discover dozens of corpses hidden in the walls.As Macer and Wayne get the bodies out,other FBI agents search round the area and hit an IED that kills two agents.Furious about the IED attack,Macer and Wayne are transferred to a special task force led by CIA Special Activities agent Matt Graver,which is being set up to track down cartel hit-man Manuel Díaz.<br/><br/>Meeting Graver and fellow task force agent Alejandro Gillick,Macer and Wayne are told that the plan is to cross the boarder in order to extradite Díaz brother Guillermo.As the extradition starts to take place,Macer begins to wonder if the line between the cartel and the law is becoming blurred. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Following Macer and Wayne on a raid,director Denis Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins give the film a tough,gritty appearance,as burnt out yellows and dry whites are cast across the Mexico/US boarder,with stylised wide panning shots capturing unfolding outbreaks of attacks on the horizon of the endless deserts.Avoiding the use of ""shaky cam"", Villeneuve & Deakins immense the audience in the task force activities with long,jagged tracking shots,which along with staying close to the action,also gives the movie an elegant depth of field which gives the action scenes a real crunch.<br/><br/>Bringing Macer and Wayne in as outsiders,the debut screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, (who co-starred in the excellent ""Hamlet"" biker TV crime Drama series Sons of Anarchy) largely stays away from exposition on the War on Drugs,with Sheridan instead throwing them and the viewer into the middle of the task force,as frantic bursts of gunfire are joined by blunt,point-blank dialogue being shot across the screen.Dipping into the shadows of Film Noir,Sheridan shows the actions of the gangs and task force to be two sides of the same coin,as Díaz acts of brutality to keep his underworld empire burning,are joined by the task force using ""enhanced"" methods and the bringing in of ""outsiders"" to get the upper hand in a never ending war. <br/><br/>Trimming 90% of his characters dialogue and looking super cool, (has he ever not looked cool?!) Benicio Del Toro gives an incredible performance as Alejandro. Striding across the screen like a Film Noir loner,Del Toro displays a clinical skill in the releasing of Alejandro's feelings/emotions,by keeping his cards/motives close to chest until Alejandro's enemies let their guard down,and Del Toro sends his ""wolf"" on the attack.Taking on the Diaz cartel with a straight- lace appearance, Josh Brolin gives a great performance as Graver,whose ridged by the book manner gets wonderfully twist & turned by Brolin,as Graver uses his quick-wits to find ""outside"" methods in taking on the drugs war.Joining the task force as the eyes and ears of the viewer, Emily Blunt gives an excellent performance as Macer,thanks to Blunt giving Macer a fragile purity over her belief about how they should take on the cartel,which shatters on a merciless final note,as Macer finds herself in the land of the wolves."
"jjrosales-60804","8","3","5","24 January 2016"," Action, Suspense, Thriller
","Sicario portrays the world of a drug cartel and policing forces in a high-action, suspenseful set of events. The film relies heavily on in- action moments that keeps the audience on the edge while beautifully stringing together scenes in large settings. The tension builds from the characters at the very beginning of the opening sequence, where battle-ready troops prepare for an open assault in the hot, sandy desert village.<br/><br/>This title resembles many characteristics from other titles such as the series ""24"" and ""The Equalizer"" where the atmosphere is within every second that goes by. Definitely a movie to watch with your friends, with great acting and scenery. It keeps you guessing until the very end, and questioning the motives of every person seen. Highly recommended for veterans of war and the regular movie-goer. <br/><br/>Aside from the gun-play and explosions throughout, Sicario has a stunning performance of visual displays, even as a 2015 film. A top-quality 8-out-of-10 shot for a movie to enjoy during every second of the show. Characters that make cameo appearances are often found for the willing eye to catch, along with some large stars (my personal favorite in this one, from ""Burn Notice"") and to top it off, this film actually lowered the crime rate within the city it was depicted in after it was released.

","2015 was a very good year in films, and ""Sicario"" can be considered one of its highlights, but not one of the very best. First off, for me this movie was a great way to get to know for the first time two big names and talents in the industry: lead actor Benicio Del Toro and director Denis Villeneuve. The former did an outstanding job -maybe Oscar worthy, totally nomination worthy- at portraying a cold and expert man (I won't get into detail not to spoil anything), the latter made great use of the south-US/Mexico landscapes, but also of the focus on small details, to give a proper identity to the film, which eventually looks slick and classy while also portraying horrifying images (i.e. the amazing first scene). I also liked Josh Brolin's take as an eccentric, no-nonsense DoD consultant, though his character tended to turn darker and darker for no apparent reason. Probably (hopefully) he's gonna have a big role in the sequel. Jóhann Jóhannsson keeps up the good work with a simple, yet fitting soundtrack: he reminds me more and more of the mastermind, Hans Zimmer, in that sense. But let's get to the nay part. Before watching ""Sicario"" I'd heard that Emily Blunt's performance was the one to look after. It isn't. She really tries, and she does so hard she gets irritating. She's always swearing, crying, being disappointed, and all that in a desperate way, as if she needed to show us she's the lead actress in a boys' flick. Her partner does the same, or even worse. Finally, some words on the complicated plot. At the end of the story, everything fits well, and you won't be disappointed, but in the making it feels at times disorienting and excessively cryptic.<br/><br/>A very good movie, an outstanding work by cast and crew, with one major disappointment. 8/10"
"alex-klein2424","10","3","5","15 January 2016"," A Haunting and Beautiful Nightmare
","This was my 2015 movie of the year. A diamond in the rough that many may overlook. Immediately you are swept into the intensity that continues all throughout this film. Through the lens of the main character you are promptly questioning why everything is going on just as she is and through that the story unfolds. With a haunting soundtrack that must be heard on surround sound and sweeping wide shots of crowded borders and desolate terrain, this movie shakes you to your core. Moral ambiguity has never been so blatant and all the while, a sense of truth for the story telling can be felt. Border disputes, drug cartels, and crooked governments are the plot and the tag line should read, ""Do the Best Thing or Do the Right Thing"". Outstanding performances by Blunt, Del Toro, and Brolin. This movie was my number one because it turns you on your head. There was no hype for this film and there still isn't, even with three Oscar nominations. Go get swept up into this movie as soon as you can."
"witster18","8","3","5","8 January 2016"," Artistically... it may be the best film of 2015...
","This film just looks amazing. A lot of care went into this. <br/><br/>I wish our lead here(Emily Blunt) got the same development and fully-fleshed-out journey throughout the film as Melissa Desormeaux- Poulin did in Villeneuve's ""Incendies"".<br/><br/>Blunt's character here is a little too weak for my tastes. It kinda messes with the plausibility and effectiveness here. One begs to ask the question why she would ever be asked to come along. I mean it seems obvious in the film that her character is in over her head, and it really makes things a bit of a mess for me as the viewer.<br/><br/>Shame too because this film is quite simply amazing. The cinematography is incredible. Villenueve's grasp of moving action and steady, almost Mallick-like steady pans with vibrant color and attention to detail is truly amazing.<br/><br/>If you've ever wanted a film to be the epitome of an incredible 'shooter game' - then this is it. SOme moments late in the film had me standing up in front of the television with anticipation and excitement.<br/><br/>As a thriller, it works because the action is done so well, and because the 'revenge quotient"" is high. <br/><br/>The film WILL do nothing but further excite those in anticipation of Villeneuve's ""Blade Runner 2"" project. He's the right man for the job. ANd this film does nothing to change the fact that he is EASILY one of the top 1 or 2 directors to watch right now.<br/><br/>WHile the characters here lack a little depth, and the story doesn't really know where to put them most of the time, the film still works. <br/><br/>One of the most visually stunning films in a few years. A couple of years ago, slammed behind his other film ""Prisoners"" and another film with similar strengths and weaknesses, ""Place Beyond the Pines"", ""Sicario"" may not even make the top 10, but for 2015 this is EASILY top 10, and sitting on the 're-watch as soon as possible' list. <br/><br/>I saw a film that was also supported by it's look last night, ""The Walk"". It also lacked some character development and had some tonal issues.. and it looked good. BUT, ""Sicario"" went above the 'grand look"" and leaked way over into artistic masterpiece territory.<br/><br/>I don't know how 'accurate' this is in terms of subject matter, but it certainly seems very realistic. I just wish they would have made Emily a little more of a tough-girl.<br/><br/>He cared about this one. 83/100<br/><br/>You'll like this if you liked:Babel(about even), Prisoners(a little better), Trade(not as good), or Eden(not quite as good but decent sleeper to try out).<br/><br/>2015 has been slow to come around, but certainly it could be argued that ""Fury Road"" and ""Sicario"" are two of the more visually stunning films of this century. I would have loved to have seen this on IMAX."
"reknob","5","7","17","27 December 2015"," Who gave this the green light??
","This is an 8/10 film dragged down to a 5/10 by the inclusion of Emily Blunt's ""character"" in the screenplay.<br/><br/>I have no understanding whatsoever what the execs/director/writer were thinking when including her whiny-ass, *unbelievably* naïve character in this otherwise really good film but boy did they trash it by her inclusion.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the amount of disbelief suspension required to think she could ever be a FBI/SWAT team member (never mind leader!!) with her 90lbs frame but she goes one further by doing things like checking a dead guy for a pulse with her leather gloves still on (two minutes into the film!) just to ensure that your jaw slacks open at the seeming incongruousness of all the good things you've heard about this film vs her character (stick thin female/pointless and distracting character) contributing absolutely nothing to it and she's in your face throughout the film - mindboggling ...<br/><br/>Take her out of it and add a few more minutes with the rest of the cast and you're onto a winner cos the rest of it is just great, cinematography and direction in particular but well, I don't know what else to say ...<br/><br/>I'm not hating on Blunt cos her performance is fine but she should never have made it past the first draft of this write-up; there's just zero interest here in her character and you just have to think that it's just yet another example of Hollywood's obsession with squeezing in a female character (almost always to the detriment of everything else) to satisfy the focus groups/wtf-ever but that's usually a token ""supporting"" (LOL!) character, not the ostensible lead in a film ...<br/><br/>This is a film that should never have had a lead cos the story *is* the lead - Blunt appears to have been tacked on as an afterthought and ultimately it trashes what could have been a well made film with a great cast ...<br/><br/>A real shame and yet more evidence of some staggeringly inept writing decisions coming out of Hollywood these days ..."
"themissingpatient","9","4","8","2 October 2015"," Deep, Dark and Tense
","Sicario is gritty, dark and brutal. It is as intense as action-thrillers get. Like Emily Blunt's character, you just go along for this ride not knowing exactly what is going on or who to trust. All lines between right and wrong are blurred. The more that is revealed, the further we descend into this horrific world and the greater the tension grows. This is one of those rare films where you'll find yourself forgetting to breathe and blink.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve has just proved to be the most powerful director working in thrillers today. Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy and now Sicario. There is magic between Villeneuve, cinematographer Roger Deakins and composer Jóhann Jóhannsson.<br/><br/>Sicario grabs you from the opening scene, like an invisible hand that reaches inside your rib cage and squeezes. Just when you think it has let go to give you a little break, it suddenly squeezes harder than ever, forcing all the oxygen out of your lungs. It's not exactly a fun experience, it's a shockingly real thrill ride that takes you further than you expect these kinds of films to take you. The original tagline said it best, ""The deeper you go, the darker it gets."""

","The start is interesting and the movies looks at some interesting topics such as the impact of drug wars on communities and state institutions using rogue and non approved ways of dealing with criminals. However I kept on waiting for something to happen and nothing came, so I left the cinema like 'what was the purpose of these 2 hours???'<br/><br/>In summary: Shockingly bad. The lead character hardly featured, a 2 hour length film about what? No emotion, no suspense and no action. In fact the length could have been reduced by approx. 45 minutes by cutting scenes where they used the camera to pan across various landscapes None of which were interesting."

","I was hyped up by the mainly positive reviews and the trailers. The posters also looked intriguing. Having mostly heard good things about this movie, I went in with high expectations I admit.<br/><br/>Very good start, a lot of tension throughout the first 30 minutes. However half way through the movie I began to fear the movie wouldn't deliver as it was pretty low on action. Save for the last 15 minutes, the rest of the movie is very slow. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt's acting was tense, raw and impeccable. However the character development was so poor. She literally serves no purpose but tag along being a bare witness to the events unfolding before her. As to Brolin and Del Toro's acting, what can I say? One dimensional, bland, half grinning tough guys, overly aggressive for no reason. <br/><br/>Expecting Emily Blunt to portray some kind of tough female special agent surrounded by guys? Pass. She hardly fires twice in the whole movie and cries more than anything. Benicio is instead the center piece here. An attorney turned Super Soldier who shoots more accurately than an aim-bot, motivated by an oversimplistic revenge plot.<br/><br/>Terribly let down by a story that could have been more developed."

"texshelters","5","5","11","14 October 2015"," While not a complete mess, 'Sicario' loses its focus on more than one occasion..
","'Sicario' Misses the Target<br/><br/>'Sicario' is a U.S./Mexico border drama aboutwellI'm not sure what it's about, and that's the main problem with the film. It lack coherence and focus. <br/><br/>The film starts off centered on F.B.I. Agent Kate Macer and her desire for revenge. Then it becomes a film about the questionable morals of federal policing agencies on the border. Then it mutates into a revenge film about a completely different character. That might work if the plot was not so logically flawed. It might also work if we had more of a back-story on the characters. <br/><br/>In one scene, Agent Macer takes home a Phoenix cop. It's clearly a set up, and we are expected to believe a trained F.B.I. agent would fall for such an obvious ploy. There is nothing to suggest that she is easily fooled or that the people behind it are that clever. Besides, the plan relies on coincidence and there is no guarantee that it would work. It is based on stereotypical notions of female weakness and illogic and clashes with the notion that Macer is a tough agent. If we knew she had made mistakes of judgement in the past, it might have been more credible. However, almost no backstory is provided for her character. <br/><br/>Macer is a patsy, which is fine, but then why make her the main character? And if she is the main character, why move away from her entirely during a large portion of the film? It is because the film, for all its pretense at making a smart, complex drama is plot driven and the characters are secondary. Thus, the actions that the plot dictates don't make sense for who the characters are. <br/><br/>Visually, the film looks flat. Certainly, part of that is because of the filming in low-light situations. I wonder if it is also because some of it was filmed in HD video, or was it? The music is good, meaning, I didn't notice it. What holds this film together at all is the acting. Brolin, Blunt and Del Toro are as good a trio of actors as you can find in film, and they deliver. Too bad none of them are let off the reins so we can appreciate their talents. <br/><br/>Critics are fond of discussing the film they wanted to see and then slamming films for not satisfying their preconceptions. So, here it goes. The film needed to focus on either agent Macer or Alejandro (Del Toro) and complete their tale of revenge. Neither of these characters' actions are clever and in fact, they are quite predictable. Good thing the drug lords are easily duped and overpowered. <br/><br/>Rating: Rent it.<br/><br/>There is no reason to see this in the theater, except perhaps the beautiful overhead shots of the border between El Paso and Juarez. The film attempts to address large themes of betrayal, honor, corruption and revenged, but it misses the target. <br/><br/>Peace, Tex Shelters"

"harrylosborne","7","2","3","20 April 2019"," Brilliant cinematography and dark realism
","Sicario is an enigma: some of the film is near perfect (notably the border crossing scene), striking the right balance of tension and drama, without losing realism. The portrayal of cartel-controlled Mexico is bleak and unforgiving, creating an appropriate sense of paranoia and isolating the American soldiers sent across the border. Unfortunately, between these scenes, there is a lack of meaningful storyline - Emily Blunt's character seems miscast, constantly unaware of the situation. Whilst (to an extent) this makes sense, as the film progresses this begins to drag somewhat.<br/><br/>The real character of interest is undoubtedly the understated mercenary Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), someone connected to the cartels but with his own personal stake in the matter; his introduction scene (involving some suggested torture) is darkly realistic, and his motives remain a mystery until the very end. This, however, is part of the issue with Sicario - the ""take down the drugs trade from the inside"" plot device feels unimportant until you realise the underlying goal of the mission, preventing this film from really exceeding expectations. Whilst no doubt interesting, not engaging with the story makes enjoying Sicario more difficult than necessary."

","13 May 2016. With strong elements from Traffic (2000) in which Benecio Del Toro won a best support actor Oscar and again gets to star in Sicario in a somewhat different role, Emily Blunt becomes our eyes and ears in this dark criminal drama. There are some great intense scenes that the audience participants in as observers to the efforts to make a difference in the war on drugs. Sicario has taken some hard-hitting actions scenes from Phillip Noyce's Clear and Present Danger (1994), Tony Scott's Spy Game (2001), and even Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker (2008).<br/><br/>There are some weaknesses that appear in this movie. Emily Blunt's character without any character development seems to lack the depth of character to establish her persona and role that she presents on the screen. By the end of the movie, though, it becomes quite clear that even without Blunt's depth of character and backstory how the painful moral dilemma arose and becomes a sharp dagger against some's throat. There is a lack of balance between the American and Mexican characters, especially the important role of the Mexican police officer that is highlighted in the movie. There is also some fine landscape photography, especially of a jet taking off, but missing a similar opportunity to experience the wondrous sensation of its landing too. Finally, the mainstream photography of a high quality production seems to actually diminish the raw, jagged hard edge of the undertone of the movie.<br/><br/>Even so, this movie as a whole is reflects a good attempt at pushing the envelope in quality, innovative ways of transporting the audience into the war zone of America's drug war."

","Do not be misguided by my headline, I loved this movie and Villeneuve's ability to give it such a gritty, realistic feel. It truly inspired me to think about my own moral values and what I would do under the circumstances of the characters portrayed. But it did not make me want a sequel.<br/><br/>This is not an angry review about Hollywood's inability to leave a good movie alone, it is simply about how this movie ended without the viewer wanting more. The ending was solid, but not enticing enough for me to truly believe Kate would do something about the corrupt government, and especially didn't beg me to wonder what Alejandro was up to next. This isn't a flaw, this was done on purpose. After all of the twists and turns, Sicario gives us an ending that leaves us comfortable with its resolution. <br/><br/>The acting was perfect, the writing behind it all was ingenious, and the directing was sufficient enough to pull out a film that makes people think about the story as much as the action.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the editing. Cut down that freaking night scene where they enter the tunnel a couple minutes so that I don't fall asleep watching glowing figures point guns at nothing. It didn't add to the suspense, the suspense was meant to be in the tunnel itself, where I ended up seeing only one cartel member already knifed to death on the ground. Then what the heck is Blunt's character doing after Del Toro's is already in Mexico? No idea, they chose not to bring her back until he's back in the US threatening to kill her. <br/><br/>7/10 for me simply because it was really great, with an ending of relief not having to go through more poorly edited action scenes.

","""You're asking me how a watch works. For now, just keep an eye on the time.""<br/><br/>""Sicario"" was kind of a disappointment for me. Despite my admiration for director Denis Villeneuve (""Prisoners"" was an excellent film), the presence of a high-profile and talented cast and an inviting trailer (although I scrupulously shun trailers), I thought this one wasn't really original and impressive. Maybe the trailer has put me on the wrong foot. That sinister and morbid beginning with those corpses stashed in plastic, made an immense impression on me. This combined with the flashy and clever scene where you see a convoy of pitch black SUV's making their way through a crowded highway with an action-packed ending subsequently, made sure I was eagerly looking forward to seeing this film. <br/><br/>The film certainly is excellent. But haven't we seen this kind of ""war against seemingly elusive Mexican drug cartels"" before? Particularly the kind of movies where corruption and deliberate lies play a major role. With manipulative officials and field workers who have their own agenda. It's all exciting, hard and ominous in this realistic ""war on drugs"" film, set in the blistering hot deserts of Mexico. The three main characters are a mixture of different characters. Emily Blunt (who played outstanding in ""Edge of Tomorrow"", where she showed that she effortlessly could handle a physically grueling role) as the FBI agent Kate Macer, assisting two experts in this hopeless struggle. The first one is Josh ""Oldboy"" Brolin as the dead calm Matt digger who never shows the back of his tongue. And then there's also Benicio del Torro as the mysterious acting Alejandro. Three masterfully played leading roles who are dancing, on the sound of a mariachi band, a complicated and politically charged Mexican dance.<br/><br/>But as mentioned earlier, it didn't impress me that much. Certainly not in the same way as ""Prisoners"". It's a rough and (figuratively) ugly film. But gorgeous and endlessly beautiful imaged. But the stereotypical characters are also introduced again. The head of a cartel enjoying a wonderful supper together with his family in a huge, imposing hacienda while his paltry and violent troops do the dirty work. A fragile FBI agent who again must stand her ground between the more robust and more imposing males. And finally it's just another divide and conquer story in which the boundaries of morality are shifted again.

","If you watch this movie, be prepared to slog along painfully through the first hour and 10 minutes. I guarantee you will be rolling your eyes, shaking your head and saying to yourself, ""What nonsense!"" more than a few times. After that first hour plus, then, and only then, does the movie begin to come together a bit and make even the slightest bit of sense.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt, one of my favorite actresses, is sadly miscast here. She's too pretty, too fragile and too damn out of her element. And smoking cigarettes is so passé. Emily was great as the action hero in ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Her oily biceps, her determination, her lithe and limber athleticism were terrific. She really sank her teeth into that role. Awesome.<br/><br/>In Sicario, she and the viewer flounder around like beached fish dying from lack of oxygen and in search of relief or release. The script has Emily ---and her audience--- asking and asking ""What the heck is going on?"" It gets REALLY boring, hearing her ask this over and over.<br/><br/>At that point midway through the film, things kind of sort of start to coalesce for us all. Kind of. Eventually, Benecio del Toro magically morphs into the real protagonist. Things move along nicely. And there's a wonderful bit with that big, hunky guy from Walking Dead. His acting just gets better and better.<br/><br/>However, don't expect any real catharsis here. And by that I mean the ""emotional relief"" of knowing that you learned something or solved any kind of life mystery. You're not even afforded the gift of being entertained . . .not much anyway.<br/><br/>Don't expect any kind of understanding of anything at all. Benecio takes care of business with his usual aplomb. Emily attempts to act, at the end, like she's going to find some meaning in ""it all."" There is no revelation. Neither she nor her audience feel satisfied. One is left hanging. All one learns is to not hang out on balconies. That should come in useful.<br/><br/>What I can say this movie did for me was to teach me to stay far far away from Mexico and the border, Far far away. But I think I knew that already."

The crime investigating team come across a shed in the backyard, which turns out to be a bomb and detonates, killing 2 officers.

They then leave for El Paso in there private jet, we're Kate meets Alejandro Gillick (Benicio Del Toro) for the first time. When they get to Juarez, they extradite one of Diaz's top men, his brother Guillermo but when they try and cross the border, they sight a group of hit men in a traffic jam, so the elite force kill them on the spot. When they get Guillermo back to base, they torture and interrogate him and he eventually tells them about a tunnel that Diaz uses to ferry drugs into the US. They then return to Arizona and question a group of Mexican migrants who give them some more information about the tunnel. Meanwhile, Reggie and Kate are fed up with being kept in the dark about everything, so Matt tells them that their goal is to cause a disruption in Diaz's drug operations so he will be called back to Mexico to meet his boss, drug lord Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cedillo). After freezing Diaz's account, Kate tries to build a case against Diaz involving his money transactions but Matt isn't interested in using that route to catch Diaz. She then tries to go to her boss with the evidence but Jennings tells her that they outrank him and if she goes against them, there could be legal repercussions. After a night drinking in a bar, Kate goes home with Reggies friend, Ted (Jon Bertha) and she realises that he has a wristband which is used to bundle Diaz's laundered money. When Ted realises that she knows who he is, she puts up a struggle and tries to shoot him but he knocks the gun away and starts to strangle her. She is then saved by Alejandro, whose was close by, watching her because she exposed herself at the bank. Matt and Alejandro then torture Ted and threaten his friends and family which leads to them getting the names of corrupt cops who are working for Diaz. The next morning, Kate and Reggie realise that they are being used by the elite force, purely to give the CIA the legal ability to operate within US borders. Reggie doesn't want to go any further with the investigation but Kate wants to see the whole thing to the end. After finally getting through the tunnel, Alejandro sneaks through the Mexican side and he kidnaps one of Diaz's mules, whose a corrupt Mexican police officer. Kate follows Alejandro and attempts to arrest him but he shoots her in her bulletproof vest and tells her to return to the US. Matt then tells Kate that Alejandro is only working with them to avenge his murdered wife and daughter. Alejandro then uses the corrupt police officer to catch Diaz and then he kills him and wounds Diaz. Diaz then drives Alejandro to his bosses estate and then he kills Diaz and fights off Alarcon's henchmen. Alarcon is calmly eating dinner with his wife and children and he tells Alejandro that what happened to his family wasn't personal. After killing his family in front of him, he looks Alarcon in the eyes and he shoots him with no remorse. The following day, Alejandro goes to Kate's house and makes her to sign a waiver, by gunpoint, stating that everything that they done was by the book. Kate then attempts to shoot him from her balcony but she ends up letting him walk away. Del Toro is definitely the best character in this movie and his calm demeanour, even though his family was brutally murdered, was great. The only problem that I found with the film is that it takes some time to get going and you don't know what really is going on until the end, so you are kept in suspense through most of the film. Emily Blunt just wants to expose everything before she actually knows what's going on but I did like Josh Brolins character, who used brutal tactics to get the job done. Anyway, I personally enjoyed the movie, mainly because of the ending and I can't wait to see how Del Toro's character will progress in the sequel. Enjoyable! <br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie was directed by Denis Villeneuve, 48, who brought you Prisoners in 2013, with Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal and Enemy which also starred Jake Gyllenhaal. He's rumoured to be directing the next Blade Runner, along with Story of Your Life starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker so he's obviously gained some respect, due to the success of this movie. I liked the way that he showed the different points of view in this movie, like the corrupt cop with his family and there is a sense of authenticity which made it feel real. I just hope they don't mess up the sequel, if they ever do release one! <br/><br/>Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $80.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/dramas starring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Jon Bernthal, Victor Garber, Daniel Kaluuya and Jeffrey Donovan. 7/10"

They go across the border to Juarez to grab someone they need. What is she doing there on this mission. Things are answered eventually but that seems more of a plot device and doesn't ring true. The scenes there and at the border bridge crossing are quite suspenseful. Later on the hook up with the bad cop gone wrong seems a bit unrealistic. How could they know that would happen for sure. When they going through the tunnels it's again quite scary. Later on don't really get why she is so terribly upset about taking down a drug lord even though it's against the proper procedure and international jurisdictions and protocol. Is that something worth being so eaten up about? Emily Blunt is getting some action roles and she is watchable - both feisty and vulnerable. Josh Brolin is quite good as the questionable agent. Benicio del Toro is of course terrific and it's a good change to see him on the good side after playing 'Escobar Paradise Lost'. I actually think that 'Paradise Lost' was a better movie on the whole.<br/><br/>Overall this film is worth a watch. It's a well made and tense and holds your attention.

Unfortunately for the by-the-books FBI agents, the mission is filled with more backstory then they are initially informed. Under Villeneuve's superb direction, the outstanding writing of Taylor Sheridan (""Sons of Anarchy Sons of Anarchy"" - FX), and supported by the eerie sound track of Jóhann Jóhannsson (Composer - ""The Theory of Everything""), Brolin and Del Toro are at their all time best. However, it is Emily Blunt's bad-ass agent persona, who takes all the hits, strives to stand up for her values, and is left to make a decision that may cost her her life. If Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" (2000) or Bryan Singers' ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995) are your type of movie, ""Sicaro"" will not disappoint."

It was not a good idea - it made me very upset, as a film school graduate, to see someone professionally and beautifully portrait women in this film as completely weak, sometimes stupid and helpless figures. In various scenarios, this film focus on the macho attitude of men - OK, it is military so of course the men are a bit macho. But it is not only what they said, but also the cinematographer's way of presenting the scenario which is very sexist. When the protagonist had seen something wrong by accident, her male teammate's response was not 'we are sorry you have seen something you should not have'. Instead, it was 'you went to the wrong place and seen the things you should not have, now shut up'. Is it necessary to have done it that way? It is extremely upsetting to have paid for a movie ticket to be insulted. Today in the 21st century, Hollywood is still presenting women in a sexist way. Not very forgivable.

Absorbing yet gradually paced look at the ongoing war on drugs at the US/Mexican border where Blunt's gung-ho yet continually over-her-head/need-to-know mission with an elite government task force has her sinking into a moral quagmire of Just What The Hell Is Going On Here paranoia and conceit. Brolin provides some weathered charm as her blind-leading-the-blind comrade-in-arms while Del Toro gives his best performance since winning his Oscar as a varying shades of grey op whose still-waters-run-deep demeanor has a chilling effect. While the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan enters Michael Mann territory of on-the-job stresses involving life and death with enough ballast, director Denis Villeneuve's somewhat glacial pacing does tax the nerves when it's not nerve-shredding with its peppering of well-executed violence."
"oktjabr","8","5","13","24 September 2015"," Professionally done drug crime thriller with a lot of zeitgeist
","When film historians of the 2050's look back at the '10s, the style that Sicario represents will probably be a quite defining feeling of the era – a movie version of TV series like True Detective and Narcos. Droning soundtrack, cinematography pushing muted grey and brown and characters lost in their personal hopelessness. Drugs (or maybe terrorists), guns and technology. In this sense, Sicario is somewhat a textbook example.<br/><br/>The film is well shot and has a rather good pacing for a thriller. In tone, it reminds me of Villeneuves earlier film Prisoners (2013) – throbbing soundtrack, world soaked in greys and desperation, broken people and morally ambiguous use of torture and violence. Sicario throws in techno thriller-stuff – drones, vehicle convoys and alphabet agencies. As for the cartels and the drug trade, Sicario doesn't seem to problematize or politicize the issue nor is it a lesson in history as for example Narcos is. I'm not American enough to recognize any hidden jabs about illegal immigration, either.<br/><br/>The only thing hinting how ordinary people are just cogs (reminding us of Villeneuve's masterpiece Incendies[2010] which is basically about fate and misfortune) is the recurring scenes of the Mexican father who wakes up, eats his eggs and beans and goes off to work when his son only wants to play football.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt does a good role as an idealist (or perhaps sane, if we are not to take the nihilist viewpoint as given) FBI agent who gets thrown in the deep end with the task force team led by rather stereotypical CIA-type guy Josh Brolin. The bunch is joined by Benicio del Toro who basically acts the enigmatic, Spanish speaking Benicio del Toro. Daniel Kaluuya is OK in his sidekick role.<br/><br/>Some say that del Toro steals the show, but Blunt was my favourite with a strong female character who isn't a strong female character to the point of being a trope or unbelievable in the context. It was striking how similar the character was with 2nd season True Detective Ani Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams). Then again, if this is the era of TV series getting more serious as a medium of telling stories to adults against infantile superhero fixated feature films, Sicario has a feature benefit of sparing us of longer escapades into relationship trust issues, something you essentially have to have when writing a 10+ hour TV series.<br/><br/>All characters have a slight tinge of cliché, but hey – if this is the neoneonoir of the '10s, it is only to be expected. Sicario isn't anything new or mind blowing, but it is a skillfully crafted piece of film that delivers more than your average thriller, possibly because the subject matter is more interesting than your run-down-the-mill crime thriller."

","Damn! This movie was something else. To start, I didn't know much of the film prior to seeing it. I watched the trailer once and didn't even finish it as to not ruin anything for myself when I saw it.<br/><br/>This movie is labeled as an action drama, but may have just been labeled as a thriller for the palatable tension the movie created for the viewer. Similar to Everest, there were swathes of this movie where I was truly on the edge of my seat with my hands on each side of my face. The score creates this sickening tension that leaves you with the sensation that all hell could break loose at any second. The music coupled with the eerie and vast cinematography reminiscent of Seven and the 1st season of True Detective gave me a feeling of lost abandon and hopelessness throughout the film which of course, ties into the story.<br/><br/>As for the story, do not expect your typical hand fed Hollywood plot. You will have to work to see all of the inter-workings and under-workings of the story that's being told. There is always a feeling in this film of something sinister working underneath it all. The story is only bolstered up by the complex and ever so cool characters that take the billing of this movie. And it's not just the three stars of the film that will draw your interest, the side characters and sub plots will have you rooting for or against anyone at any time.<br/><br/>Every film has a complaint and this film is no exception. I did indeed have an issue with one character's particular development in the 3rd act of the film, but to avoid the risk of ruining anything for anyone, I'll leave my own reservations to myself. My only comments on the matter is that I felt the character's development did not seem to coincide with what was originally intended, but the development was perhaps an afterthought.<br/><br/>Even with wrong turn, the film pulls out a work of art, a modern and fresh Traffic if you will, darker and more grand in scale. The content of the story is relevant and most will appreciate the content. The message, if there is one to be taken from the film can be interpreted two different ways I think. This is a cinephile's film. The pace of the film will be lost on most as the director builds his slow, albeit ever increasing beat to a crescendo that will leave you discussing the film afterwards for certain, as was my case.<br/><br/>8/10"

"Horst_In_Translation","6","4","10","4 November 2015"," Villeneuve so reliable right now
","""Sicario"" is an American 2-hour movie from earlier this year and the director is Canadian Denis Villeneuve who consistently delivered strong films over the last 5 years since his Oscar-nominated Incendies. This one here is not an exception. The writer is Taylor Sheridan and it's the first time ever the actor (""Sons of Anarchy"") has come up with a script. Pretty good effort for being a rookie. In terms of acting, the movie is mostly carried by Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin. The latter 2 seem basically interchangeable until at least the half of the movie playing bad-ass secret agents with one being basically the Hispanic version of the other. However, the last 45 minutes take Del Toro's character into a completely different direction and this is probably also when the film is at its best. I am not saying I did not enjoy the first hour of the film that mostly focused on Blunt's character, but Del Toro simply takes it to another level here when the film is more progressed.<br/><br/>Still, I am not sure if it's an example of great acting or just a character written as ruthless and bad-ass (no prisoners taken) as you can imagine. Maybe it is the latter, but that should not be derogative in any way on Del Toro's performance. He elevates the material a lot and I cannot think of any other actor who would have worked so well with this character. No surprise, he is considered for an Oscar nomination. Same goes for Blunt, even if her buzz is probably not that heavy anymore. There are a couple parallels with Jessica Chastain in ""Zero Dark Thirty"", but all in all it is a completely different character and performance. And of course she is very easy on the eyes as well. Brolin occasionally became a bit less significant with these 2 strong performances around him, but that's also because he was not written equally baity. You cannot blame him and he gives a good performance as well. ""Sicario"" is a worthwhile watch for everybody who has an interest in drug trafficking at the Mexican border and does not mind the graphic violence that comes with this movie. I would not say it's among the best of the year, but nonetheless a good watch and I recommend it mostly because of its extraordinary last 40 minutes, even if there are great scenes before that already too like the fireworks scene."
"zardoz-13","10","4","10","4 October 2015"," ""Sicario"" Means Suspense and Action
","""Prisoners"" director Denis Villeneuve's menacing manhunt melodrama ""Sicario"" treats the war against drug cartels and their smuggling operations with even greater cynicism than even the recent David Ayer's opus ""Sabotage"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Imagine combining ""Silence of the Lambs"" with ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" and you've got the essence of this no-nonsense, atmospheric epic that boasts more shades of gray than black and white. Emily Blunt plays a by-the-book FBI agent who wades into the murky depths of corruption and evil that threaten to undermine her sanity. Josh Brolin and Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro co-star as the hardcases who need her shield so their shady business doesn't violate the letter of the law. ""Sicario"" isn't a slick, superficial, standard-issue, shoot'em up with sensational stunts. Primarily, ""Sicario"" argues that the best way to eliminate drug cartels is to fight fire with fire. Similarly, ""Sabotage"" appropriated that attitude toward the cartels, but it lacked the credibility that ""Sicario"" delivers. The good guys don't wear white hats in ""Sicario."" They display the same conspicuous lack of regard for human life that their adversaries espouse. You don't walk out of ""Sicario"" feeling relieved so much as horrified by what it takes to conquer the evil that cartels do. This spartan crime thriller features enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right up to its ending that may abrade your sense of moral rectitude. <br/><br/>""Sicario"" opens with a bang as FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt of ""Edge of Tomorrow""), her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya), and the Bureau's Kidnap Response Team smash into a residence in a sleepy little subdivision in sunny Arizona and discover the cartel has been using it as stash house. They scramble inside to rescue hostages, but they find the walls of the house conceal 42 corpses like a contemporary catacomb. Two agents tamper with a booby-trapped outside tool shed, and the explosion shreds them and flattens everybody else. Afterward, a nonchalant guy in flip-flops, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin of ""Gangster Squad""), schedules a meeting with Macer's superior, Dave Jennings (Victor Gaber of ""Argo""), and invites Kate to accompany an inter-agency task force bound for Mexico to pick up a cartel informant. Macer signs up. Later, she watches in horror as Graver and a convoy of black government SUVs careen into Juárez, Mexico. Graver's tight-lipped, second-in-command, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro of ""Savages""), warns Kate not to trust their Mexican Federal Police escort. The naked bodies of dangling corpses garnish the perimeter of this eerie setting. Everything boils down to pulling one individual, Guillermo Diaz (Edgar Arreola of ""Machete""), out of a safe house and hauling him back across the border for interrogation. Not surprisingly, the trip into Mexico is a picnic compared with the trip out. The Task Force finds themselves snarled up in a traffic jam at the border crossing. They aren't entirely surprised when they spot cartel gunmen itching to waste them, and an inevitable shootout ensues. Just as Alejandro warned Kate, the corrupt Mexican Federal Police side with the cartel gunmen and our anxious heroine takes out an MFP officer with well-aimed shots. As suddenly as the shootout erupted, it concludes.<br/><br/>All is not what it appears, and Kate suspects that Graver is a CIA agent and Alejandro is a hired gun. ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears,"" Alejandro assures Kate. ""And you will doubt everything that we do. But in the end you will understand."" Eventually, she realizes she is being used to lend Graver's operation a veneer of legality. When she confides her fears to his superior, Dave reassures Kate that everything is above-aboard and Graver's exploits have the blessings of highly placed elected officials. Graver explains that Alejandro and he aim to create so much chaos within cartel ranks that the Mexicans will turn on themselves and start killing their own men. This strategy is designed to flush out an anonymous cartel chief whose identity remains a closely guarded secret. Alejandro promises Kate that exposure of this figure will prove catastrophic for this coldblooded criminal organization. The biggest action scene in ""Sicario"" has Kate and company entering a covert cartel tunnel, shades of the Vin Diesel thriller ""Fast Five,"" and wiping out cartel henchmen in those subterranean depths with a clandestine army of SWAT shooters equipped with night vision technology.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" qualifies as an impressive, but cynical crime movie. Apart from the heroine and her partner, the protagonists are as unscrupulous as the villains that they have in their sights. Meantime, Kate Macer cannot believe that she has gotten herself trapped in this web of amorality. As idealistic as she is, Kate believes in the rule of law, but she emerges tarnished mentally if not physically by the experience with Graver and Alejandro. Although the talented Emily Blunt toplines this law & order saga, an unshaven Benicio Del Toro claims top honors as a PTSD-afflicted gunman. He plays a former Mexican prosecutor who has suffered more than anybody. The cartel decapitated his wife and drowned his young daughter in a vat of acid, so he shoots first unless he has to ask questions before he fills his enemies with lead. Del Toro gives a smoldering performance. Josh Brolin isn't far behind as an enigmatic CIA agent who deals with every encounter with his adversaries as if he were a surfer gauging waves at the beach. Nothing in ""Sicario"" comes off feeling contrived, glamour, and formulaic. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve stages the action scenes at the border crossing and the tunnel with an impersonal air of solemnity. British cinematographer Roger Deakins of ""No Country for Old Men"" depicts these escapades in dark, muted colors reminiscent of the classic Dutch painter Rembrandt and effectively captures the moral depravity perpetrated by the principals. Watching a movie like ""Sicario,"" you have to wonder whether the wholesale legalization of narcotics—repellent as a solution might seem-- wouldn't offer greater salvation as a whole for everybody rather than futile free-for-all combat."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","8","4","10","1 October 2015"," A dark, fantastic movie that should not be missed!
","I instantly became a fan of Denis Villeneuve after watching a Prisoner. When I heard Villeneuve's next movie would be exploring the war on drugs, I instantly got curious. And after coming out of the theatre, I can say that not only was I not disappointed, I was a bit shaken to my core. Felt like a mix between Zero Dark Thirty and No Country for Old Men. Sicario is one of top five favourite movies of this year. <br/><br/>Just like Prisoners, Villeneuve takes the audience on a dark descent into a world of violence with the main character's morals being challenged. But whereas Prisoners was more self-contained, Sicario goes bigger by the exploring the harsh almost lawless landscape behind the Mexican border. Villeneuve does not shy away from the harsh reality of the violence that occurs throughout the story but doesn't try to shove it down your face. Before the violence is about to come, Villeneuve does a superb job of building up the tension so when it happens your jaw drops. And I even give Villeneuve, as well as the writer Taylor Sheridan, extra credit for focusing on a character that may have seemed unimportant throughout most of the movie but by the third act become very relevant in the end.<br/><br/>The cast in this perfectly plays each of their roles. While Edge of Tomorrow shown that Emily Blunt can play a serious bad ass heroine, her performance in Sicario has officially proved that she can lead a role in a serious thriller. Blunt shows a character that is tough, loyal and obedient on the outside but within there is a vulnerability and question of morality within her. She shows a person who all she wants to do is bring justice but becomes conflicted as she goes deeper into the dark reality that she is in. And by the end of the film you can't help but to feel sorry for her. Josh Brolin becomes the ultimate contrast as a man who does not follow typical procedure from his cowboy-ish attitude, his choice of clothing to methods that border on the line between order and vigilantism. But the real star is the Sicario himself, Benicio Del Torro. Del Torro's display a great sense of quietness and sophistication but yet comes off very intimidating. His character carries a huge amount mystery that makes you want him to have more screen time. He is someone you can't tell if you want to root for and be totally scared of.<br/><br/>Veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins really shows the bleakness and darkness of this world. His shots range from excellent wide shots of barren desert landscapes, slowly creeping zooms to tell we are about to see something horrific to avoiding lights during night-time sequence to take full advantage of the dark atmosphere. I will be shocked if Deakins does not get a nomination for best cinematographer at the Oscars.<br/><br/>And finally, a big part of chilling atmosphere in this is in thanks to Johann Johansson's score. Johansson create a one of the darkest and creepiest soundtrack I have ever heard as it perfectly reflects the sense of dread the story creates but yet also creates an emotional response at the hopeless of the situations that go on.<br/><br/>Overall, Sicario is a masterpiece that Dennis Villeneuve has created. It would be foolish to ignore this movie. I am looking more forward to more of what Villeneuve can bring like his next two movies, The Story of Your Life and the Blade Runner sequel."

Of course, they had to put a woman and a black guy as the leads for this story. Both are wooden and uninspired, especially Blunt, who mostly just looks like she is going to cry because the boys won't let her play. Now *that's* a good role model for your young daughters!<br/><br/>The other part of the movie is simply a revenge flick, and not all that good either.<br/><br/>It is hard to quarrel with other reviewers who point out the vast disconnect between the critical acclaim and the actual product.

I mean they even had the cliché (almost) sex scene, can't I at least get some cliché big plot line too? Just completely pointless, Emily Blunt's character is specifically called in to help this special team, and does nothing. She doesn't add to the team she just follows them and seems to get abused.

Enter Josh Brolin as the Govt agent. He was excellent as one of these mysterious Govt types that works for some agency with some kind of authority from somewhere.<br/><br/>But Benicio Del Toro is the star. He turns in a terrific performance as this ultra mysterious Spanish-speaker who has some TBD role helping the US Govt fight against Mexican drug lords. <br/><br/>Kate is supposedly this tough FBI agent, but she seems to bristle at the Govt agents methods, thinking that the law is supposed to be followed. But these guys don't. Really though, drug lords, Mexico, what did she expect? I kept thinking that if she was this righteous, she should not have volunteered. <br/><br/>There are some nice back and forth scenes between Blount and Del Toro as he coaches her on how to absorb what she sees, and well as with Brolin.<br/><br/>But the story suffers because we never learn more about Kate or any of these guys. It would have really helped to learn about Kate's upbringing to more understand he motivation to fight drugs so much. But instead, it's empty. So when she starts bristling, you are left wondering why.<br/><br/>The story gets a bit bogged down with she and her partner smoking cigarettes, and going back and forth to this hotel to meet the teams. It's like, OK, what is the point here? The story also gets a bit hard to figure out what is happening.<br/><br/>The whole movie is pretty bloody and violent, as you'd expect. But it's not a great film by any means. The ending culminates in your learning more, but I'm like, so what, big deal. <br/><br/>Average at best is Sicario.

Was one of them ""Consistent Stereotypes in a Motion Picture""?<br/><br/>Anyway, if you've watched the previews or read any reviews you already know the basic plot line so I'll spare that and just point out the most glaring ""huh"" moments for me...<br/><br/>1) Criminals aren't supposed to be smart but why pack 50 corpses into the walls of a suburban home when you are surrounded by miles of barren land where they could have easily been buried?<br/><br/>2) Why does the team make a perilous daytime prisoner extraction via convoy into Mexico, risking ambush at every turn when they could have easily flown in/out with one helicopter? I mean, the CIA can provide Gulf Stream jets and military transport aircraft for Brolins' character to luxuriate on but they can't get 1 helo for this mission?<br/><br/>3) Since Kate is clearly a badass who's been ""kicking down doors since day 1"" I guess it's necessary for her to instruct Iraq War vet and gal-pal Reggie on how to put on a body armor vest?<br/><br/>4) One of the back stories of the plot is provided by del Toro's stone-faced Alejandro Gillick (Columbian with an Irish last name?); a ruthless hit man who previously worked for the Medellin cartel. Apparently the before-mentioned CIA bufoons think it's a great idea to use this guy to take out all the Mexican drug lords so that their industry can be better controlled via proxy by more ""reasonable"" drug lords like him.<br/><br/>Truthfully, del Toro's character was the only one I really enjoyed. It's just too bad he didn't shoot Kate in the end. I guess she was spared because she reminded him of someone ""very dear"" to him? Whatever."

","I did not expect a healing from such a violent film as SICARIO. Spoiler alert. I can't explain the impact of the film on me without giving away the best secrets of the story. Then again, my fans know the films I review are a springboard for me to talk planetary change.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is the innocent Phoenix police officer dragged into a CIA scheme to assassinate a cartel leader. A part she plays to confused brilliance that makes her one of the most believable cops characters, male or female, in film history. The CIA needs a domestic officer to expand jurisdiction into Mexico and Emily is it.<br/><br/>The broken town of Juarez is where action centers. Josh Brolin is the CIA's master disruptive player. All law has broken down in Juarez as the cartels battle. It's a chilling look at how thin the line between anarchy and civilization truly is.<br/><br/>Blunt's character is watched over by Benicio Del Toro's dark angel. He's a free agent, a Columbian lawyer turned assassin, out to kill the cartel leader who beheaded his wife and killed his teen daughter, boiling her alive in acid. Nothing will stop this Sicario, which means ""hit man"" in English, not even his affection for Blunt, who reminds him of his daughter.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes of this film are very hard to get through as Blunt uncovers 20 mutilated corpses in a Phoenix bust. I'll admit I closed my eyes to get past it.<br/><br/>The amazing ending, which I will not spoil for you, is just as hard to endure. Violence here is not gratuitous. It's a documentary to the real zombie apocalypse we face. SICARIO offers a deep look into our sick society, decaying from the inside, fueled by the greed of men that seek to send humanity into a hellish dark ages.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled I stood to go home after my matinée break. Then a soulful Mexican guitar solo in the credit score broke the 2 hour tension. I retook my seat and soon my ET guide Ohom asked me to meditate on making sure the world does not go the violent way of Jaurez. The meditation enemy once again, addiction.<br/><br/>I closed my eyes and the sweet guitar sounds swept me away. Ohom asked me to go beyond addiction to seek in my mind's eye the root cause. I saw many of my neural pathways were badly ruptured from the nightmare of the first 20 years of my life in family as a helpless kid ruled over by a drunken father. The neurons were the red exploded remnants. How could I still be so PST damaged on the inside after decades of many kinds of therapies I wondered?<br/><br/>Ohom showed me the neuron reroutes I had created to function as normally as possible. Then he and his team began helping me heal my damaged neurons and neural pathways at super speed. In less than 2 minutes 2 decades of mental and physical abuse I'd suffered as child survivor of frequent bloody fatherly beatings were healed, along with my broken my heart from when my mother did not rescue me from hell but abandoned ship. A pain far worse than the broken arm my drunken father would give me.<br/><br/>Again I may never know if this amazing ET stuff is real, it just works for me as gateway to higher energies and I do feel more whole. I'd not expected this kind of breakthrough this warm fall Sedona afternoon, and accepted this ET healing with tears of joy in the dark movie house.<br/><br/>I see now clearly the root cause of addiction is seeking to numb our pain via self- medicating with drugs, both illegal and prescription, booze and loveless sex. My addiction of choice has been my work. Getting older and not being able to work at my crazy pace, still far more than men half my age, is buying me time to smell the roses and moments like this.<br/><br/>As always the personal healing begets a planetary healing and I sent out the bliss of my healing across the world.<br/><br/>The credits ended. As I stood to go a young theater attendant asked me, ""How was SICARIO?""<br/><br/>And I said with wry smile, ""Useful."""
"DavidStewart57","10","3","7","20 October 2015"," Sicario
","Sicario, the new film by Denis Velleneuve, is a jaw dropping, knuckle-whitening experience. Emily Blunt plays an ambitious, chain- smoking FBI agent assigned to work with the DEA in bringing down drug cartels along the US/Mexico border. As soon as she sees the unorthodox methods used by a swaggering cowboy of a DEA agent (Josh Brolin) and a soft-spoken, yet intense protégé (Benicio Del Toro), her outlook on going by the book falls along the wayside. Meanwhile, the film goes back and forth to the daily routine of a hard-drinking local police officer in Mexico going about his private duties leading to a surprising third act in the film.<br/><br/>Not since Traffic has such a film showed the drug trade in an unflinching and suspenseful manner. At times, the film goes into sensory override as you feel and empathize with the anxiety and pressure Blunt's character faces throughout the film. Velleneuve, who gained strong praise with his 2013 film, Prisoners, ups the ante by keeping you on the edge of your seat thanks to Talyor Sheridan's sharp screenplay and Roger Deakins award-deserving cinematography by showing the gore and fury of a world filled with corruption similar to his work with the Coen brothers, be it through close-circuit television sets or night-vision goggles.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro gives one of his most darkest and strongest performances in years as Alejandro. His world-weary presence and soft-spoken demeanor is underestimated by a compulsive drive similar to De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Emily Blunt is great as she successfully walks the tightrope between being a no B.S. FBI agent and a lonely woman whose only merits she holds dear are loyalty and integrity. Josh Brolin brings out a wild and beautifully crass performance as a DEA agent who thrives on chaos like a stilted flower relying on rain to survive.<br/><br/>Velleneuve's harrowing vision on the war on drugs is complimented by Johann Johannsson's ominous score as you go into this two-hour abyss of action and suspense. Sicario is nothing short of riveting and raw that it stands head and shoulders over previous films that have dealt with geopolitical themes like Zero Dark Thirty. The film is not preachy as previous drug-war films as Velleneuve objectively looks at the thin blue line between honor and corruption."
"writers_reign","7","3","7","9 October 2015"," Blunt Instrument
","We know from the recent documentary Cartel that the US is engaged in its second (following Vietnam) unwinnable war within half a century but because Sicario is ostensibly fiction the viewer is allowed a glimpse of a light at the end of a tunnel - which is not entirely metaphorical. On another level it's a case study of how idealism is the first victim in this kind of war as by-the-book FBI agent Emily Blunt sees her ideals bludgeoned at every turn having volunteered to take part in an operation designed to bring down the head honcho of the drug cartel which makes a Multinational look like a mom and pop grocery store. Though it may draw the fifteen to twenty-three year old male audience they are not its real target and overall we have to settle for three exceptional acting performances rather than wall-to-wall carnage."

","Sicario is one of those rare films that makes the 'Thriller' genre have meaning. Besides the tense moments and really strong character development, there lies a beautiful and yet hard shot film that keeps you glued to the screen.<br/><br/>The film tells of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who works closely to raiding and putting down drug cartels across the US/Mexican border. Her handy work is enlisted by a government official Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and his crew including the mysterious Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) to aid in a joint task force tracking down an anonymous drug lord. But it soon turns to more personal matters as Kate discovers why she is involved and why they are doing this without the book of rules.<br/><br/>Directed by French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve (who is behind the darkly gripping and acclaimed drama/thriller 'Prisoners') and with a solid script by Sons of Anarchy writer Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is a standout thriller that lies in the sub-genre of drug and human trafficking, giving a close look into the people involved on both sides and what drives them to power. Not based on a true story in particular but it's a real life scenario that still occurs in the US and various parts of the world.<br/><br/>The acting performances from Blunt, Brolin and del Toro are all strong throughout and it's possible that Blunt (or even the three of them) could get Golden Globe and Oscar attention. Blunt is such a great choice to be in this film, especially that her female cop role breaks the formula of the usual male lead and gives a different lead.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography is beautiful, gritty and really well shot thanks to the work of Roger Deakins (Oscar nominee for No Country For Old Men and other works) and echoes the style and presentation of that film. I should mention as well that it's music score is also beautiful and really suits the film, composer Jóhann Jóhannsson (Oscar nominee for The Theory of Everything) nails it and both of these men should get Oscar attention as well.<br/><br/>Overall, Sicario is a slow burning, hard, gritty but yet beautifully shot thriller that will keep the fans of character built thrillers in their place.<br/><br/>9/10 - Nick"

"essextax","5","4","11","23 October 2015"," Disappointing
","Much was promised about the tension in this film and it's true it did have it's moments. However, most of this was sustained by the dramatic background music and not the story itself.<br/><br/>The plot itself is straightforward enough. A disenchanted Mexican/Colombian agent/drug dealer (we never find out which) seeks revenge on the criminal mastermind who had his family slaughtered. He's ably supported by various US govt agents who, apart from Blunt's character, seem quite happy to run roughshod over the Constitution as the end justifies the means. Doesn't it? <br/><br/>Blunt struggles with this moral dilemma and reacts to the horror she witnesses mainly by looking like a rabbit caught in the headlights or throwing a tantrum. We're supposed to believe that she stays with this abhorrent mission (which she is reminded she volunteered for) because of her deep rooted desire to get to the real bad men in the drugs trade but which conflicts with her equally well founded belief in the law and due process. Oh, what a dilemma. <br/><br/>Benicio del Toro is excellent of course but, to be frank, if Bruce Willis could speak Spanish he would have got this part, such was the skill required to pull this off. <br/><br/>Sad to report that in an industry where there are so few ""hero"" roles for women, this could have been the chance to give us another Ripley but what we got was more like a small child not getting her own way.<br/><br/>The cinematography was first class with some excellent night vision scenes that, in my opinion, were novel and moody. The general ""feel"" was worthy of a much better and original plot and script.<br/><br/>Shame - an opportunity missed"
"bartonj2410","8","4","11","26 September 2015"," A simple premise delivered so effectively by Denis Villeneuve
","When settling down to watch Denis Villeneuve's Sicario, I was thinking back to his previous two films, Prisoners and Enemy. Both were extremely tense and Sicario is no different, in fact, Sicario is one of the most tense cinematic experiences you could have in 2015.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt stars as Kate Macer, an FBI agent who does everything by the book, is recruited by government official, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), to join a task force in tracking down a drug lord responsible for bringing drugs across the border between the United States and Mexico.<br/><br/>With the man they are chasing being directly responsible for the death of a number of her fellow agents in the kidnapping response team, Macer is more than keen to joint the hunt but when the truth begins to unravel, she finds herself in real danger.<br/><br/>What makes Villeneuve such an enticing director is his ability to keep an audience on the edge of their seat from start to finish. Prisoners was emotionally draining while Enemy was downright weird, culminating in one of the most shocking endings I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Sicario is neither emotionally draining or weird but Villeneuve's film perfectly builds tension around Macer's journey towards justice. It's a simple premise yet the film is so effective in its delivery that Villeneuve has warranted his place as one of the best directors of the thriller genre working today. <br/><br/>Villeneuve manages to get the best from his cast in his films and Sicario is no different. Emily Blunt gives a career best performance as Kate Macer; brilliantly balancing both the experienced and naive sides to her character. Josh Brolin is his usual grizzled self, which is always great to watch, and Benicio del Toro gets his teeth into the mysterious Alejandro Gillick, a man who keeps Macer well and truly on her toes. <br/><br/>As well as boasting some great performances, Sicario is also beautifully shot with some magnificent cinematography from Roger Deakins, somewhat a legend in his field. A story can be well told in a film but another dimension is added when the visuals are of such a high order. Deakin's camera work combined with Johann Johannsson's score makes for a real treat, in particular one tunnel sequence late in the film.<br/><br/>Sicario may mean hit-man in Mexico but in cinema, Sicario simply means excellence."
"roomanamir","10","4","11","26 September 2015"," Out of this world experience of an old material
","There is sequence during the middle of the movie that has a team of US Army Delta Force, CIA, and Mexican Drug Enforcement Agency guys entering the crime zone of a dangerous city in Mexico. These are about 4 to 5 vehicles. They going to extract a drug world kingpin for interrogation and take him to US Soil. This is such an intense sequence, visually from cars moving in and out of US/Mexican Border to local police joining to escort them, and then it ends with a gunfight upon return.<br/><br/>All of it sounds familiar or old material. Yeah, right but when you see it you will realize that an old material only handled differently creates an experience we call, tour de force movie making. This is pure example of method directing. Sicario's story line initially presents itself as a tired material seen hundreds of times, but the way it makes you feel about it by Denis Villenueve's Direction, cinematographer and actors is unimaginable. <br/><br/>What am I trying to say, for example in the sequence I mentioned earlier, these cars are filled with macho, good looking, brawny US Forces and Mexican Drug Enforcement, you hear them rant and laugh during the whole sequence. You are thinking that few of them will sure get killed while in a gunfight that could possibly be approaching any minute. But by the time the particular scene ends, yes with a gunfight, you realize that all of them are thoughtful and not trigger happy conventional thriller movie's supporting characters. They handle the situation as if they understand that all of them need to get alive out of this situation. They feel same even for the bad guys.<br/><br/>This sequence actually laid the foundation of how the rest of the movie is going to be and especially what you are going to experience in the third act. This one kept topping itself and pulse pounding throughout the course of 2 hours. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt character starts out as FBI Agent working on kidnapping case gets enlisted by government task force. She is up for it but not prepared for what she will know as the operation will near its end. This movie articulately handles the cost of war on drugs and its effect on life of an average Mexican and many Americans. How a Non Civil Government Agencies and Military Forces have high interest in War on Drugs and uses or misuse all the resources that are within or not under their jurisdiction to win this war.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt and Benecio Del Toro characters are at the center of all of this. These are best and Oscar Worthy performances we have seen to date this year. There is something so weird and scary about Benicio Del Toro playing the seemingly sinister character with some sort of Mexican Drug Cartel connections. But he is the one that keeps us guessing is he the bad guy or the good? And believe me he does it till the very last. His breakthrough performance was The USUAL SUSPECTS (1995), low profile but memorable performances in SNATCH (2000), Oscar Winning role in TRAFFIC (2001) and my all-time favorite, THE HUNTED (2003), he has never looked back since then. His mannerism while playing such characters makes you an instant fan of his work.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character however has an edge to it. She wants to do the right things but yet remained involved in whatever wrong is going on around her. She is suspicious right from the beginning but gives in to the hope that she is going to nail the bad guy. She is careful and brave, midway during the movie we see her behave like an every female character that needs to be rescued, but the very last scene pays off by telling that she has courage to do what is needed but also understands the cost associated with it. So she may or may not do what seems right according to her idealist approach.<br/><br/>I was also amazed by the cinematography and minimum use of background score. There are cinematographers that capture an exotic location beautifully and then there are Visual Artists like Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country of Old Men) that makes you feel that the landscape we are watching are the characters in the movie. This cinematographer captures the barren, crime filled, god forsaken land in a way less seen in crime thrillers. <br/><br/>At few point during the movie the characters speak so slow that we barely hear them, but then as the movies progresses, we realize that these are people who are very much aware of the consequences of what they may or may not say and it will ultimately affect the outcome they foresee.<br/><br/>Like I said from the beginning till the end the movie makes you keep guessing what is going to become of the story, you are waiting for a bad guy to be revealed, but movie takes an unconventional way in explaining why each of the character is doing whatever they are doing. <br/><br/>This one comfortably takes one of the slots among my top 10 movies this year. What an amazing movie experience."

","While the cinematographic beauty or the great score are nothing we haven't learned to expect from Villeneuve, what really stands out here is the incredibly well made and tense action sequences.<br/><br/>Villeneuve takes a story that could easily have been borrowed from a cheap action flick and makes a cinematic masterpiece out of it, a meticulously paced tense slow burner, showing us the face of the drug war more up close and personal than the photography would have you expect."

"Cyorel","6","2","4","27 January 2020"," Realistic but too many lengths
","As the title perfectly sums it up.<br/><br/>I liked the very realistic side of the film: both in the actions of the characters, and in the often subjective way of filming, which gives us the impression of being part of the action.
Del Toro plays a dark role that fits him like a glove.<br/><br/>Only one downside to ""heroin"" (the girl, not the drugs... :D) a little too ""teddy bear"" for my taste.
I find it hard to find credible that a SWAT team leader can still believe in Santa Claus and imagine that we're stopping and fighting a Mexican drug cartel scourge by the usual little legal procedures, filing files in court and pleading to a bar association...
And who, in his immense sense of infallible justice, persists and signs (or precisely would refrain from signing, even under the threat of a revolver under his chin) to think that one should stick to procedure, even after having seen all the ruthless methods that are the law in ""this universe""?
Mouais, and the marmot puts the chocolate in the tinfoil.<br/><br/>But what bothered me the most was the multiple lengths.
However, it started off pretty strong with this SWAT arrest scene.
The tension comes down perfectly afterwards, as if to let the spectator and the characters breathe, who evacuate the tension of what they have just experienced.
And then after about a third of the film... It gets too much... you get bored with each one of these scenes that go on and on...
Any of them? Never mind. But then I come out with the feeling that it was always an exchange between a bit of action, and length... a bit of action... and length.... length... etc... etc....<br/><br/>Several tens of seconds and almost ten different shots to film the desert seen from the sky from a jet in flight ... Is it really useful or was it to fill a lack of elements to hold a ""conventional"" film length?
Ditto with the surveillance camera images, before stopping a smuggler...<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a pity.
It doesn't have to be a big fart to make a dynamic movie, but here, the overall action seems a bit too limited in favor of images and scenes not necessarily useful to the story, and, what's more, boring.<br/><br/>To sum up, I liked the film, no doubt, but I was a bit disappointed by so many unjustified lengths in my opinion"

","Emily Blunt plays Kate, a honest agent who mingles with the wrong law enforcement crowd. The first scene establishes Kate as a brave cop, but it is a totally gratuitous plunge into a horror movie and unnecessary to the main plot.<br/><br/>The main plot being Kate joining a motley crew of macho men, travelling to Mexico for a suspicious operation. Among the crew is strong, silent Del Toro as Alejandro. Being a foreigner, his presence as a ""consultant"" sounds fishy from the start.<br/><br/>After the extraction and torture of a Mexican cartel member and several lies later, we finally discover that Alejandro was indeed a disreputable character and that Kate is in the wrong line of business.<br/><br/>Most memorable is the scene in the tunnel, with an unusual but captivating cinematography. Overall, the plot is fairly predictable, with the expected statement about the West being the father of all evils - just before being shot, the Mexican drug lord tells his killer that it was the Americans who taught him his methods...<br/><br/>Whatever the story may be, looks like there are plenty of non-Westerns who are willing to learn and even surpass their alleged masters in cruelty and cunning. Perhaps it's time they should start taking their own responsibilities."

She gives an oscar-worthy performance here, someone who knows so so much but at the same time so little. She portrays everything the audience feels and she is badass but with enough weakness for you to sympathize with her.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin plays Matt, and he does an amazing job with his role as a DOD Advisor. Theres a lot of questions i have for his character, and i can't wait to see him more in Soldado.<br/><br/>The visuals and soundtrack deserve praise, with the late Johan Johannson providing the soundtrack which is eerie and terrifiyng.<br/><br/>And Benicio Del Toro. 
He gives a career-best performence as the ghost, the man without mercy. Alejandro is a perfect combination of writing and performance, and he steals every scene he is in.
Sicario is well worth the watch. A razor sharp thriller without mercy and its jawdropping visuals boost it higher then most. <br/><br/>And when you see him, the wolf, the hitman, the one who ends it all.

"madameminty","3","2","4","31 March 2018"," Not present tense for sure
","I heard this movie is tense. I cannot comprehend this judgment. It's slow, and there is simply nothing happening to create the tension. Characters act like things are tense, and mumble psychopathic one-liners that seem to be supposed to shock the viewer and show how hardened they are, but it's just grotesque. The scenery keeps throwing unsubtle hints at you to claim there's imminent danger, but there's none. When it finally arrives, it's underwhelming. Makes one wonder how cartels weren't all just shot to death yet. I gave up after 40 minutes of nearly silent walking and driving around, pretentiously gazing into the void, with a couple minutes of establishing how blindly idealistic the main character is against all logic.<br/><br/>I'm guessing (so not a spoiler) it'll be her downfall, she'll be betrayed, and no matter if her character will develop (probably not!) she'll have no effect on the plot and the baddies will win. So edgy. Then the movie will pretend it's some insightful social commentary. No. It's cliché, banal and predictable, that's what it is. Given how sedating and kitschy it is so far, I don't even care to find out. Ask yourself, do you?"
"Vartiainen","Null","2","4","31 January 2017"," What was the tone supposed to be here?
","Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is an FBI agent working in Arizona to take down the Mexican drug cartel and their distributors within US. She gets recommended to a joint task force that is designed to take the fight to the enemy on the other side of the border. The team consists of long time veterans of the drug war and it quickly becomes clear that Kate is very much not in the know.<br/><br/>Sicario was directed by Denis Villeneuve, who has made a lot of noise recently in the film circles and whose scifi film Arrival is just about to be released. Personally I've seen from him the movie Prisoners. It was a nihilistic, overly dark thriller about the darkness of human condition. It seemed to hate humanity and life in general, setting as its goal to drag the viewer down to dirt with it and make him realize that it's a miserable planet to live on. Deep down everyone is rotten and flawed, most people think only of themselves and even altruistic people are prevented from doing much by those around them. In a word it was depressing. <br/><br/>Sicario is the same.<br/><br/>Now, to be fair, it is a very professional movie. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the slow panning shots of Mexico. The realistic style serves the subject matter well. The dialogue is, if not overly memorable, at least interesting enough to follow. And the final confrontation between a member of the task force and the drug cartel boss is a great piece of cinema without a doubt. It's intense, filled with hinted backstory and suitably brutal in its conclusion, fitting the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>But here's the problem. The said confrontation is not between Kate and the drug boss. Instead it's Benecio del Toro's character that confronts the boss. And del Toro's character is by far the best in the whole movie. He has the most backstory, the best presence and the most memorable characteristics. So why wasn't the movie about him in the first place? And believe me, I have absolutely no problems with seeing Emily Blunt in a role requiring her to be tough and action-oriented. I know she can pull it off. But in this movie her character is a tool. Now, she is a tool on purpose, because it fits the plot, but it makes the movie aggravating to watch from the audience point of view, because we feel alongside her that we have nothing to contribute. That we have no control. That we're only being used. And yes, that is an intentional choice on the film makers' part, but it's one I cannot agree with.<br/><br/>And that's Sicario. It's a well-made crime thriller and probably well-deserving of its praise. I just personally hate its message, its whole style. I don't watch movies to realize that the world is an ugly place. I don't watch them to be depressed. As such, this movie has earned my scorn."
"mm-39","5","2","4","2 January 2017"," Blah!
","Blah but you can follow the story. Sicario has a story-line which keeps the viewer captive for how, and what will happen with the ending. Regrettably the characters are 2 dimensional and flat. Emily Blunt is the Jodi Foster type character from Silence of the Lambs who is disjointed and filled with doubt! Benicio Del Toro is the cold South of the border hit man right out of every mob movie. Josh Brolin the evil C I A guy aka Tommy Lee Jones style which was cold/calculating. Daniel Kaluuya flat character is the moral support of the Jodi Foster style character. The character development/character driven stories are so old/predictable which kills the story. Shocking ending became another predictable C I A government is evil story with the what did just do story-line. I wish there was a plot twist, or character twist.

","""Sicario"" is an oddly distancing and expansive movie that seems more about deserts, rural Mexico and military encampments than it is about the things that happen in those environments. Everything seems stepped back deliberately so you lose interest in the story and just notice the shots.<br/><br/>The plot is something about a naive FBI SWAT operative (do they even make those?) who gets involved with the CIA, the Department of Defence, the military, the Delta Force, and so many other military bodies you get confused. But then I guess it's supposed to be confusing.<br/><br/>The point of the thing is that the main character doesn't understand what's going on either, she's being used, etc. It's just not involving enough to be interesting. It's the kind of movie where reading a synopsis makes it sound so much more interesting than watching the movie actually is. In words, you can leave out the boring bits and focus on the bits that matter.<br/><br/>This is what Villeneuve's direction should have done."

","It is a good movie. The story is fine, but they didn't tell it the right way. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt were really good, but Benicio Del Toro is on a whole different league in this movie. Good points: -Alejandro shooting Kate -Alejandro threatening Kate -Matt completely taking advantage of Kate -How Matt used Kate as bait -Alejandro's background Not good points: -The extraction of Guillermo -The whole thing with Silvio's family (and I understand how they wanted us to sympathize with his family, but still...) -The way Alejandro got to Jefe's house (they should have thought of a better way to do that) -The first scene with the house raid and the bomb was redundant -You didn't need two hours to say this story"

","I would like to have given Sicario more than 5 stars, but I just can't bring myself to do it. The story is an interesting take on the usual drug war movies. The action scenes were well done, for the most part. Cinematography was not bad at all. Unfortunately Emily Blunt's character was so unbelievable it just sucked the fun right out of the movie. We are supposed to believe that Emily Blunt's character has spent her entire time with the FBI, as a ""door kicker"" on their elite Hostage Rescue Team. The HRT is no picnic, and getting selected takes a physical, mental, and emotional toughness that Emily's character lacks. If I were in the FBI I'd be embarrassed by this film. We get to watch for 2 hours as Emily's character is thrown into violent encounters where she perfects the art of looking like a scared fish out of water. If her character was supposed to be an analyst, this might have been believable. Unfortunately the writers are asking us to believe that an elite HRT member gets selected to join a task force with a CIA ""Special Activities Division"" team, where she'll finally be able to punch crime in the face, and instead she whines and complains about everything they do. I'll tell you what, if I was on the SAD team I'd have been just as upset to have her around as they apparently were. At least the movie had that one believable element."

"stephendaxter","7","2","4","24 December 2015"," Fantastic performances, and Villenueve directs another great film
","""In Mexico SICARIO means Hit-man""<br/><br/>'Sicario' is an Action Thriller / Crime Drama that follows an FBI agent who gets thrown into a war against the drug cartels operating along the border of the US and Mexico. Apart from the stellar cast leading the film, i was most excited to see this film because of it being directed by Denis Villenueve. For those of you who don't know, he directed 2013's 'Prisoners' and 2014's 'Enemy', both are incredibly fantastic films that were directed to near perfection and you should definitely check out. This was still a fantastically directed film by Villenueve, but compared to those films i just mentioned, this one has many other flaws that didn't make it quite as intense as i hoped it would be from seeing the trailers. If you are looking for a fast paced, high octane action thriller, this is not it. Much like his previous films, this is a very character driven story where the film at times is carried on the backs of the amazing performances by Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Despite these praises, there are elements of the film that i didn't enjoy and harmed my overall experience with the film. <br/><br/>The film started off very promising, it showed off some some of the thriller elements whilst also introducing our characters and the main overall plot of the film which was pretty meh up until the last third of the film. I was initially intrigued by what was going on and wanted to find out more about what is really going on behind the scenes, especially with Del Toro's character. But for almost the entire second act of the film, i found myself checking my phone a few times because it dragged on and on and didn't look to be ending any time soon. It had some short moments that were quite interesting in terms of character development and getting me a little more interested in the plot. But overall, the second act wasn't all that compelling to watch like the rest of the film was. I feel like they tried to do a lot to set up the finale, and just the way it was structured became an issue for me. A lot of scenes didn't quite make sense and took me out of it a bit. It all ran at a fairly slow pace which i was expecting but there were no dramatic or intense tones to get me engaged with what was going on, apart from one or two moments. A lot of this middle section relied purely on the performances of Blunt, Brolin, and Del Toro, and even though they were fantastic it wasn't enough to make me enjoy this section. It's hard to explain, but just a lot of the writing in this section looks and sounds good on paper, but the execution wasn't great. <br/><br/>That being said, the last 30 minutes of this movie....... SPECTACULAR. Not going to give anything away but it all hits the fan from a storytelling standpoint, a character standpoint and an action thriller standpoint and this really saved the film for me. All of the little bits and pieces that were set up throughout the film come full circle and you realise a lot of things that maybe didn't make sense earlier make total sense now, such as 'why is the film even called Sicario?....... **You know what, stuff this, i'm gonna revoke some of the things i have mentioned so far MID REVIEW but not edit it out, because thinking about the end, and then thinking about what happened earlier is making me realise that this film was a lot smarter and well crafted than i thought it was 5 minutes ago. I obviously can't talk about any of the things i am thinking about, but this is probably going to make me watch it again like i did with 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy', and i reckon i might enjoy it more the second time, only time will tell. <br/><br/>But as i mentioned before, the performances of Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro were all absolutely fantastic. I am not necessarily surprised because they are all incredible actors but in this film when they came together no-one took anything away from the others' performances. One did stand out well above the others but it didn't make me love the other performances less, if anything each performance added to the others. There is also quite a bit of talent in the supporting roles but due to the scope of these three large actors always commanding the screen they will most likely go largely unnoticed. <br/><br/>In the end, Sicario is a film that definitely not everyone will appreciate. It is more than an action thriller and incorporates great amounts of drama, and plenty of intense moments. The second act of the film whilst watching it did really hurt my enjoyment of the film in the moment, but as i mentioned, it didn't bother me nearly as much and i actually now praise some of the decisions they made. If you like Villenueve's previous films this one is not quite up to par but you can still see a lot of his signature all over this film and that is what i enjoyed about it. - 7.2"
"StevePulaski","7","2","4","13 October 2015"," A film so unethical it makes dirt look cleaner
","Sicario may be one of the most melancholic, morally bankrupt, and ethically vacuous mainstream films to be released this year; yet, such moroseness comes with the territory of the ongoing, politician- branded ""War on Drugs."" The story concerns an idealistic FBI Specials Weapons agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who, along with her partner, Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), are recruited to work with the CIA in order to find a man responsible for savage murders in Mexico.<br/><br/>Doing so involves extensive work with the CIA and infiltrating cartels in Mexico, so Macer and Wayne team up with Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a Department of Justice adviser who leads the manhunt, and Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro), who are specifically targeting a cartel boss named Manuel Díaz (Bernardo P. Saracino). Díaz is believed to one of the main authorities behind Mexico's explicit involvement in the cartel. Upon arriving to Mexico and experiencing the practices of both Graver and Gillick, Macer is shocked at the amoral and corrupt nature of the CIA's practices, which have resorted to targeting innocent, often unarmed people in addition to working largely on hearsay rather than concrete evidence. <br/><br/>Kate Macer is one of the year's most fascinating characters, and particularly one of the most compelling female characters of the year. Her presence initially rekindles thoughts of Maya in Zero Dark Thirty, who found herself nudging her way through the patriarchal CIA practices in order to further her belief as to where Osama Bin Laden was hiding out for over a decade. However, Kate is much more realistically written in a human sense. Maya felt more like an empty shell, ill-equipped to show emotion that wasn't determination or archetypal female toughness.<br/><br/>What makes Kate Macer really interesting and believable is her mental toughness and willingness that turns into pure uncertainty and vulnerability upon arriving in Mexico. This doesn't mean she's weak, as I know some will take it, but it simply means that she's indeed human and conflicted. How does she maintain her idea of ethics and moral high-ground when everyone around her is abiding the ""what not to do"" section of the unwritten CIA playbook? The film asks us that through many scenes of Kate's blank stares, uncertain remarks, and general uneasiness throughout the film. She's one of the most fascinating and ambiguous characters I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Aside from the layered characterization of Kate and Blunt's fascinating performance, Sicario is mostly a showcase for the stylish, limitless directing of Denis Villenueve (responsible for Prisoners, one of 2013's best films) and the masterful cinematography of Roger Deakins, arguably one of the best cinematographers working today alongside Tim Orr and Emmanuel Lubezki. Villenueve makes Mexico a landscape that pulsates with tension and danger, but not in a xenophobic manner, and Deakins captures the sunlit sand and the damaged landscape with an all- encompassing look at how the War on Drugs has left the country in economic and agricultural shambles.<br/><br/>With Villenueve and Deakins at the helm, almost nothing else matters, and that's good, because Sicario is a film that benefits from the strength of its three strong components to sort of disguise the fact that the film is a largely unfocused and somewhat disconnected project. No matter how strong the performances are - particularly from Blunt and del Toro, who always has this delightful slowburn quality to most of his performances that doesn't get disguised here - the character relations are surprisingly weak, giving the film a rather cold and unfeeling element. I felt like I was always within arm's length of Sicario, and writer Taylor Sheridan was doing nothing to pull me in whatsoever.<br/><br/>Films involving the CIA always seem to emphasize this element; they frustratingly focus on the masculine qualities of these films, no matter how observant they tend to be, and the result is either a cold film with lesser character relations, a piece of flag-waving trite, or a combination of both. Thankfully, some of this is at least attempted to be remedied through Villenueve's direction, which lingers on facial features and expressions in a manner similar to Scott Cooper's constant emphasis on the human face in Black Mass. This allows for some humanity to penetrate an otherwise vacant landscape about as desolate as some of Mexico's rural areas.<br/><br/>Sicario, which is clarified as meaning ""hitman"" in Spanish, is a strong film aesthetically, but a weaker film structurally. It features the same kind of quips and disconnected elements we've grown accustomed to with films revolving around the CIA, and it unfortunately shortchanges those behind the war itself, on both sides, with the exception of the morally divided Kate. Thankfully, while Sheridan's writing may have been phoned-in to some degree, Villenueve and Deakins' work is anything but textbook-fare.<br/><br/>Starring: Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio del Toro, and Bernardo P. Saracino. Directed by: Denis Villenueve."

","Sicario is a fast thriller pumped with a lot of energy. Makes the viewer sitting glued to her spot. Felt very realistic, as if I was right there, the lack of music in many parts only increased this feeling. I saw people complaining of the movie having no ""main story"" but I think this was its strength, getting an insight into a 2 w mission, not too dramatic, not too boring, it felt like a documentary turned movie and definitely got your heart rate up.
On the other hand there was a lot of  turndowns; especially Kate's character which is described as a green, sentimental, newbie. They could easily have chosen a man for that role but why bother? Additionally her partner is the only coloured in the movie and sadly he has to play a side role and chauffeur (even though he is a lawyer!). It's tiresome to see those patterns repeat themselves in movie directing and too realistic to turn the blind eye to."
"srdjan_veljkovic","5","0","0","15 April 2020"," Much ambition, little substance
","It is done with great ambition and a big budget. But, it has very little to show for it.<br/><br/>Yes, some of the scenes are very well done. They may not look beautiful, because they are not meant to be, but, they have an effect. The aerial views of the wastelands and poor cities of Mexico, the sequence in the underground tunnel... Well done and impactful, but, nothing really special, it's been done before.<br/><br/>It does feature decent pefromances by the main actors, but, not nearly as much as hyped. Emily Blunt is not very good, really. Sure, her character is highly implausible, she's tough and strong and emotional and indecisive and butch and feminine... it's almost impossible to play well. Still, she's not doing almost any of that believably. Del Toro is OK, but, he's just ""doing his thing"", we see very little glimpse of his torment for the loss of his wife and daughter. Sure, by that time, he might have pushed it back in his mind, but, then he wouldn't still be on the revenge path with such passion. Brolin is mostly faking it. The only one to do a really good job is Victor Garber, whose ""I just work in this government agency"" routine is spot on, it was like looking at one of those people.<br/><br/>The story is pretty weak and without much sense or impact. Things just happen and are tragic, but, it's way too unrealistic to pass as a kind of ""scripted documentary"", so the lack of sense or conclusion makes it pretty much pointless. Sure, we know that drug cartels, Mexican in particular, are very violent and that CIA and such are essentially ""playing along"" and it makes sense to point this out to those that actually don't know this. But, to have that impact, movie had to be very different. It also doesn't work as the story about Del Toro's character (which the title implies), he's too little in the story.<br/><br/>So, if you like violent thrillers that have some loose sense of reality or correlation to real-world events that also look well done, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, pass."

The film is tense and stylish, soundtrack is eerie. It shows a dark side to law enforcement and the questionable things that are required to be done for the right reasons.

Denis Villeneuve does not shy from showing the seemingly sempiternal rough edges of this world, highlighted exquisitely by a tracking shot through the Juárez slums, and a following scene at the border crossing which rivals the tension in the opening of ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""No Country for Old Men""'s coin toss. Deakins produces the best shots of the year, and Del Toro's frightening Alejandro steals the scene on several occasions.

The cast is good, especially Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin but I found Blunt's character to be oddly peripheral to the story and not all that interesting.

","CONTROL. COMPROMISE. VENGEANCE.<br/><br/>I would credit Sicario as being one of the movies responsible for my deeply-rooted respect and admiration for the medium of film. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and acting as writer Taylor Sheridan's induction into the screenwriting business, Sicario is a tense, thought-provoking thriller that sets the audience on edge and keeps them there until the end credits begin to roll. With each re-watching of the film, one comes to appreciate Villeneuve's moviemaking on a deeper level and the faint subtleties he slips into every scene to enhance the film as a whole. The story follows FBI Agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) as she volunteers for a joint government task force to help bring down the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. Heading up the task force is DOD ""Adviser"" Matt Graves (Josh Brolin), a lifelong soldier hellbent on bringing down yet another threat to his country. Acting as Graves' shadow is the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) a seemingly reserved man of few words. Agent Macer is thrown into the world of espionage and operations that don't technically exist with both feet, serving as a conduit for the audience who have also never been privy to such things. Villeneuve takes advantage of everything from lighting to wardrobe to help subconsciously tell Sheridan's story. From lighting certain characters so that they faces are in light while others are in darkness to the last scene of the film where Macer is wearing a pure white shirt in contrast to Alejandro's dark suit the director used every opportunity to compare and contrast the characters. Emily Blunt plays Kate perfectly, a by-the-book FBI Agent thrust into a world of wolves that has no ruling law. Macer is understandably upset and thrown off balance by the constantly shifting ground beneath her feet and the audience sees the toll it takes upon the character from the dark circles beneath her eyes and picking her smoking habit up again. Both Graves and Alejandro have lived in the world of shadows for so long that they too are shadows and we see two sides of the coin in their handling of the horrors they've seen and/or perpetrated. Although the movie follows the plot through Kate's perspective, it is Benicio Del Toro's performance as Alejandro that steals the show. Taking over every scene that he is in with his intense, silent demeanor, Alejandro carries himself like a predator, always ready to pounce should the situation call for him to. Graves on the other hand, deals with the dark madness around him through humor, smiling and laughing as though he doesn't have a care in the world when in reality, lying just beneath the surface, is a predator waiting to take down its prey. Throughout the film, the musical score by Jóhann Jóhannsson enhances every emotion felt in each scene. With a steady heartbeat of drums and deep thrums of string instruments, Jóhannsson raises the tension level and sets those watching on edge as they wait to see what happens next. Each character comes into the plot with their own objectives and motivations, Kate desires to strike a blow at the cartels killing innocent people, Graves perceives a threat to the United States of America and is willing to do anything and everything to protect his country, and Alejandro wishes to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter who were brutally slaughtered by the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel. Every step taken leading the climax of the film takes the audience down farther and farther down the very dark, malicious rabbit hole that is the drug trade. This film shows every aspect of how the destructive disease infects and destroys all those it touches and how the United States is searching for the vaccine. Villeneuve and Sheridan craft a masterful tale of the chaos that reigns along America's southern border and all of those it affects, showing that in the face of lawless chaos and evil intentions, one must fight fire with fire or be turned to ash."

","Many of you might think, oh no, another drug dealing movie about what is going on at the border between the USA and Mexico... and yes, you are right, this is another movie about what is happening but we don't want to know is happening day after day... but let me tell you something, the movie is really catchy and why is that? Well besides how it has been filmed there something different from the others movie: the main character is a woman.<br/><br/>Emily's Blunt character is what makes this movie terrifyingly real and to gain our attention among all the movies from the same topic. She is the newcomer in a land of men, as one might say. she is coming from the bureau where everything follows some rules and there is the law. Here she has to learn to not follow said rules and even forget about the law. Time to sort of one priorities.<br/><br/>The plot itself is nothing out of the ordinary but it is the actors' work that make this movie one movie to remember (or not to forget).

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Sicario is an action thriller film that premiered in 2015. The movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve and stars Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin. The movie follows Kate Macer played by Emily Blunt that discovers cartel activity in a FBI raid. Kate and her partner join a task force that seeks to bring the cartel to justice.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve should be commended for his great directing. This direction is one of the movies biggest strengths as the entire movie is pretty to watch. Every scene sets up the stakes well and also the intention of every scene is crystal clear. This movie has gorgeous panoramic vistas and overhead shots. There is a night vision and thermal scene that simply is cool to experience.<br/><br/>The action in the action scenes are not the complete focus in Sicario. This movie prefers to set up the plot of the movie and prioritize that for its action set pieces. This is absolutely worth the build-up as it makes the action scenes and the effects of it more satisfying. One of the examples in this movie is when the tunnel is raided. The tunnel being raided is both a cool scene to watch as well as leading to the finale that built up Alejandro. The movie is riddled with examples like this that make the movie more exciting to watch.<br/><br/>All of the actors do a great performance in this movie Emily Blunt's Kate Macer is a naive Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in the world of the Mexican drug cartel. Kate is more of the audience's character than a character that is meant to be mysterious. The characters that take the show are Benicio del Toro's Alejandro and Josh Brolin's Matt Graver. These two character's experience in the world of the Mexican cartels is evident. The movie's secret protagonist is Benicio del Toro's Alejandro. This character undergoes his own personal story that both Kate Macer and the audience experiences.<br/><br/>There are some aspects of the movie that are meandering without much point. One of these is the plot with Mexican police officer Silvio. This plot got pointless and did not connect with the main story well. The story was already understood to impact many civilian lives. When Silvio runs into Alejandro the result is already clear. The entire setup was not worth the result.<br/><br/>I would recommend Sicario. The movie is a tight action thriller.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

Josh Brolin and Batman Benecio Del Toro provide a good cop bad cop performance rivaling any I have seen. The audience takes the vantage point of Emily Blunt in this movie while she provides an incredible performance almost mimicking the audiences reactions to the scenes unfolding. The story reveals itself in a unique way in that the true nature of what is happening is not revealed until near the end and the ride getting there was a journey itself. I recommend this movie to any cinephile, fans of Brolin, Del Toro, Blunt and/or Denis. V. and fans of crime and/or mystery films."

","This is the movie I watched second time. I guess the first time was hasty and thus could not concentrate on what it meant to me!<br/><br/>Now I understand it very well that the FBI agent Kate (Emily Blunt) and her Partner Reggie actually led a successful drive against Mexican drug cartel and reached a safehouse and rescued the corpses standing in the wall even of two police officers. She finished the mission successfully even killing some other enemies and this brought her focus in the nation.<br/><br/>Next, a taskforce was initiated where she was attached as part of the mission. However, the planner Matt and the Hitman (Alejandro) took her in the taskforce to have legitimacy. Hitman was said to be coming from CIA which required domestic agency to initiate any program inside US.<br/><br/>In the beginning part it was seen they entered into Mexico and saw the inhuman and explosive environment due to the upshots of the drug cartel and its impacts on the human life in Mexico. They brought the brother of Manual Diez, the prominent member of drug cartel in Mexico entering into USA.<br/><br/>The taskforce tortured the brother, Guillermo and captured magnificent information about the locations where they trade and found ideas of tunnels through which they pass off the drugs and its locations.<br/><br/>All these enraged her and partner. They even could not know what their rules are. They were made to watch what Matt and Alejandro did. In the meantime, Kate even could trace the money laundering crimes of Diez in the US by which she wanted to prosecute against him which the taskforce laughed at.<br/><br/>This led to create distrust specially in Reggie the partner of Kate. Even they thought of leaving the taskforce and Kate resisted and started to get prepared for the tunnel mission.<br/><br/>The taskforce took with them other professional fighters and tech experts. They were massive in size and operational courage. In the evening when light started to dim off, they initiated their mission. Night vision goggles and other night stuffs were used. In the tunnels, firing continued. The Mexican sides started to fall. In the other side, Alejandro appeared and caught the corrupt police officer who used to pass the drugs from Mexico to the entry of the tunnel. Simultaneously, Kate appeared there which surprised Hitman and Hitman fired on the bulletproof vest of Kate when she pointed gun at Hitman.<br/><br/>Hitman took that Cop with him on gun point to the road leading to catching Diez. In the street, he found Diez and fired in the leg and made him pull off from street and get back to driving to the house of Fausto Alarcon, cousin of Diez and Guillermo.<br/><br/>Hitman killed the guards of the Alarcon house, the boss of the drug cartel. And hitman came back to USA. Kate got back and confronted Matt and this led to muffling. Matt said that they don't want to end it they want control like once by Madellin. Hitman even was working in the Madellin. The wife and daughter of Alejandro were killed by Alarcon which was another personal reason why he was used as Hitman in the taskforce. This induced him more and led to reaching the Drug Boss and killing his family in front of his eyes and then killing drug boss finally.<br/><br/>Alejandro took the sign for approval of the taskforce on gun point from Kate and in the end, she had space to fire him from the veranda. She did not."

","This isn't a film for wimps. Though I've no first-hand knowledge, I imagine this film brings the viewer about as close to futility, brutality, frustration, and pure adrenaline rush that's felt by law enforcement every day as they continue waging our War on Drugs. It also weaves in storylines of smaller-time players that inevitably get caught up in this multi-billion dollar ""business"" of narcotics, terror, and murder. <br/><br/>As good as Traffic was in its day, Sicario narrows the focus somewhat, following Natalie Blunt's character throughout most of the film with only rare (but memorable) shifts to Del Toro's anti-hero. It's also less preachy than Traffic, allowing the audience to draw some of its own conclusions. <br/><br/>The violence is measured, at times, but shocking at others.

Thrill comes when there is something more in the story that you donot know and something which will keep you guessing all the time.<br/><br/>Invincible Villain who was off the grid for such a long time was really easily captured by the hero.

","In the southwestern U.S. , an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is assigned to work for a CIA boss (Josh Brolin) and his associate (Benicio del Toro) in order to break into the leadership of a Mexican drug cartel that was responsible for a kidnapping operation in Arizona .<br/><br/>Among the law enforcers, ""Sicario"" gives us the traditional battle between those who go by the book (Blunt) vs. those who just want to get things done (Brolin and del Toro). The performances are all good especially del Toro as a human-turned-animal whose presence is a force of nature. Sadly, the story lacks enough character development that might have added more heft in the conflicts involving principle.<br/><br/>The true star of the film is the powerful direction by Denis Villeneuve. Every scene, even those with stillness, has an eerie edge that leaves viewers feeling like they've entered the dark side. There are also a few crowd/action scenes that are brilliantly executed with just the right amount of build-up tension leading to the action. While the film has the expected amount of violence, Villeneuve takes different approaches to minimize the effect such as scenes that show only the shooter but not the victims.<br/><br/>Villeneuve has an impressive list of films highlighted by (in my opinion) ""Polytechnique"" (2009). ""Sicario"" is his second Hollywood film, ""Prisoners"" (2013) being the other. Both are good films but I feel each is a build-up to his eventual Hollywood masterpiece (maybe more than one) that is yet to come. I can hardly wait for the event."

","Brolin & Del Toro are the stars of the film, second half of the film is almost exclusively focused on Benny the Bull, and is the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the first half spends far too much time with Blunt's barely competent FBI agent. Either sitting in dark hotel rooms talking about her bra. Or sitting in dark hotel rooms surfing Google Images, because, you know, that's how FBI agents research Mexican Cartels. Or just sitting in dark hotel rooms looking like she'll burst into tears at any minute. Well, that's how she looks for the whole film actually.<br/><br/>But I can't completely blame Blunt for this, it's a poorly written character that is used as a clumsy exposition device for the first half of the movie. ""Who are you?"" ""Who is he?"" ""Where are we going?"" ""What are we doing?""
Once all that information has been passed to the viewer, there is no need for the character anymore, and she barely features after that. A better written role or a better actress, probably both, was needed to make this character interesting.<br/><br/>The good parts of the film are all about Brolin & Del Toro. The two actors have great chemistry but sadly, Brolin is sorely under used. Benny gets his starring turn, and it is as majestic as it is brutal.<br/><br/>Watch it for those two."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","0","0","2 July 2018"," An uneasy and tense thriller, rendered in shades of grey.
","There's an underlying seediness to 'Sicario (2015)', an unseen sense of evil that strengthens with each scene that blurs the line between 'good' and 'bad'. This is amplified by every aspect of the production, from the astute and assured direction to the earthy and understated screenplay, which leads to an experience steeped in tension and weight, one that communicates just as much through its fantastically framed vistas as it does through its brief but frenetic violence. It's a slow burn of a thriller, one that doesn't culminate in a massive action set-piece but rather a demolition of what you previously understood was going on - in terms of plot, morality and, especially, character. After a an act of pure brutality finally pulls back the curtain on a previously mysterious character - and, by extension, a certain way of thinking - in an unexpected and gut-wrenching way, all preconceptions fall away and you realise just how dark the narrative really is. The movie's haunting end implies devastating consequences for those on the ground-level of this ever escalating war on drugs. The movie doesn't give you any easy answers and makes you question everything you see the supposed 'good guys' do, soon shedding any suggestion of such a thing even existing. If you don't think you're doing the right thing, though, then how can you do it? It is a phenomenally deep question and one that resides in the heart of our protagonist and the overall piece. It's these shades of grey that really make the movie so compelling and ripe for discussion. It aims to start a conversation and can easily do so. Most importantly, it's an engaging and impactful experience. It will get under your skin and, almost certainly, truly affect you, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout, sometimes unnerved but always unable to look away. 8/10"

","I'll be honest with you and mention that half the reason I ended up watching this film was because I was captivated by the trailer for the sequel. Well, I guess the producers would be pretty happy with that, but then again I probably shouldn't get too caught up with trailers because sometimes they really don't tell you all that much about the film. Then again, I guess getting another opportunity to watch Thanos, or rather Josh Borlin, in action was going to suit me well.
 As it turned out I didn't mind this film all that much, particularly since it was pretty much told from the perspective of Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who is trying to work out what is going on. She starts off as an FBI agent working in the kidnap squad (give them points for that, since most of the time they are either working homicide or narcotics - kidnap is original) when she uncovers a house were a heap of bodies have been hidden in the walls (and how nobody actually smelled the stench in the entire neighbourhood, let alone as soon as they entered is beyond me - then again they might have been responding to a 'there is a putrid smell coming from next door' call, but why send the FBI, why not sanitation).
 Anyway, she attracts the attention of Josh Brolin who asks if she wants to tag along for an operation. She invites her buddy along, only to discover that he isn't allowed into the airforce base, only to tag along for the rest of the film, you know, for somebody to actually talk to because Brolin and this Mexican friend (del Toro) are just so full of conversation. We can't have an actor suffering in silence, can we, especially since Brolin falls straight asleep as soon as they get on the private jet.
 So, lets start with this whole going into Mexico and kidnapping a prisoner, only to have the entire police force, you know the ones who are just so effective against the drug lords, escort them through town and back again. Then there is the hugely packed road back into the United States, which conveniently gives the gangsters an opportunity to make a strike at them, when if these guys are like black ops, and have authority from on high, surely they could have used the less crowded opposite side of the road. Oh, and then there is all this CIA this, you know, they guess that he is CIA, but he denies it, and they all talk about how CIA aren't allowed to operate in the United States, only to suddenly have it revealed at the end that they can, if they are attached to a domestic agency, which is why we end up having all these FBI 'observers' on CIA missions. Surely, surely, surely they would have known that, but then again it would have undermined the big reveal, the 'we have been denying that he is CIA for the entire movie to suddenly admit that he is in fact CIA'.
 Look, this movie isn't all that bad, a little slow at parts, though I did appreciate Kate 'only has one T-shirt in her entire wardrobe' Macer. Then again Blunt seems to play this tough characters pretty well, if some of her other films are anything to go by. Also the fact that the entire story is actually told from her perspective also gives this film a bit more panache than many of the other films do. A bit unrealistic in parts, but still good."

","""You should start your film with an eartquake and then build up on that"". Sicario accomplishes that widely and althought its superb tension has been praised it is sometimes regarded as a minor achievement, as if films with this level of production value were a guarantee of thrill. That´s just wrong. Denis Villeneuve is an outstanding director who should be granted a blank check for every movie he makes and this level of technical brilliance should be celebrated without reserves. Special mention to the superb soundtrack.<br/><br/>In this case the only problem seems to be the story, the only possible way to pick on a Villeneuve´s film. Apparently, it doesn´t cover the intricate set of interests in the drug cartel. Now, how many movies, specially big ones, completely lose it precisely because of an over-sized ambition to explain everything? (I´m not looking at anybody, Mr. Nolan). Sicario doesn´t fall in that trap. It never tries to bite off more than it can chew and it succeeds at portraying a complicated matter the only possible way: narrowing the scope.<br/><br/>The only thing that matters is Kate, Emily Blunt´s character, on her way to ""finally understand"" the big picture. The first half of the film does a special good job at making the audience know as little as she does and although we may step out of her character a couple of times, it´s only the bare minimum so we can get the big picture as well. Sicario is easily one of the best films of the decade. The film industry should work relentlessly to give this man great scripts, we don´t want another ""Prisoners"", please."

","There are many reviews here that go over why Sicario is a good movie, and I agree with many of them for a variety of reasons, so I won't add to the pile of praise.<br/><br/>And for the record, I will say that I don't think this movie is the best thing sliced bread by any means, but it is a solid film.<br/><br/>What I will offer is a word to some of those that disliked the movie for reasons I actually find quite silly and misguided.<br/><br/>However, before that I will point out that there are people who claim the movie didn't click with them for a variety of ""movie"" reasons, and it simply wasn't their thing. This is totally fine, of course, because every single person is entitled to their personal feelings of *enjoyment* of a movie.<br/><br/>But what is objectively wrong is when critiques of this film are based on false pretenses and expectations. <br/><br/>There are two very wrong critiques of this movie:<br/><br/>1. The first set of critiques that are misguided are the ones that claim this movie has no real central plot or character development. They often frame their points by beating up Emily Blunt's character, and claiming how the plot built up but didn't real do much with itself at the end.<br/><br/>This is simply not true. <br/><br/>I will suggest that perhaps the frustration here for those who claim this is that they did not get to see a classic Hollywood morality tale when it comes to law enforcement. <br/><br/>There was no central character, agency, or group who in the middle of this drug cartel mess are morally righteous or easy to side with. <br/><br/>There wasn't even fully an anti-hero.<br/><br/>This film explores the moral ambiguity of the USA/Mexico/Latin America drug cartel/war issues, and tops it off by making a clear point that this mess of moral ambiguity and cycle of violence MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE affects people who are innocent and never asked to be a part of the mess that is the drug trade/war.<br/><br/>Just because the film mostly follows those involved with law enforcement in the U.S. doesn't mean that you should expect a clear-cut good vs. evil story, and that's exactly the way it is in real life.<br/><br/>2. Another set of critiques levied against this movie centers around Emily Blunt's character being surrounded by a mess of people doing a bunch of violent things etc., and how her character seems to be caught in the middle of everything with no real capability to change the events and outcomes around her.<br/><br/>These critiques go further to explain how the movie portrays law enforcement in the drug war as an arena of violence with a bunch of higher-ups running around calling the shots, while underlings carrying out the dirty work on both sides without really having an authority on the outcome of their situation.<br/><br/>I would invite anyone who feels they agree with that ""critique"" of the film after watching the movie to really re-read the two paragraphs I wrote above and decide if that's an accurate representation of the drug war or not. <br/><br/>If you're expecting a movie like this to reflect the ""reality"" of the drug war by serving up a John Wayne type character taking heroic and full control of a dangerous situation and solving the problems of the world, then I would sincerely suggest that you ask yourself if you have a realistic view on the drug war itself.<br/><br/>After all is said and done, Sicario, isn't a good vs. evil movie about the drug war, nor is it an action-thriller about law enforcement and the drug war.<br/><br/>This movie is about the wandering and hopeless feeling that ongoing violence creates, regardless of who is involved. It is accented by the point that getting involved in these situations (no matter the side you're on) requires you to sacrifice what you think is right or wrong to a degree, and reminds you of the terribly unfortunate human collateral damage caused by the ongoing cycle of the drug war—both physical and spiritual."

","Kate Macer is an FBI agent who is part of an anti-kidnap squad but after taking part in a raid that leads to the discovery of dozens of bodies, victims of a drug cartel, she finds herself seconded to a specialist task force that is targeting the cartel. This task force is led Matt Graver, a CIA operative and includes Alejandro Gillick, a Mexican former prosecutor with shadowy motives, and several members of Special Forces. She quickly starts to wonder what she has got herself into. On her first day they cross into Mexico to extradite a senior cartel member; an operation that ends with a shootout on a highway just north of the border. This man gives information that leads to the location of a cartel tunnel under the border as well as cartel bank accounts. The real plan then becomes clear; the hope is that by creating such chaos for the cartels will recall their senior man in the US and he can be tracked to the cartel's leader.<br/><br/>This is a tense thriller that had me gripped from start to finish; it is not a feel-good film though. Apart from Agent Macer and her FBI partner there are no really good characters; Graver and Gillick are morally questionable as it emerges that Macer is only really there to rubber stamp operations that would otherwise be illegal. This doesn't mean we can't sympathise with them as we see the brutality of the cartels the sight of numerous bodies hidden in the walls of a house and hanging from a bridge in Juárez is quite disturbing. The action is restricted to a few brief moments but when it happens it is sudden, intense and feels real. The cast to a great job; Emily Blunt is a convincing lead as Kate Macer and Josh Brolin impresses as Graver however it is Benicio del Toro who stands out as Gillick, a character who's loyalty is far from obvious. Director Denis Villeneuve does a fine job making it all feel very real. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody who wants a really tense thriller without a blank and white morality."
"ratnakar-techie","9","0","0","21 May 2017"," Lost War on Drugs
","Dennis Villeneuve is one of the best directing talents in recent times, has proved it with Prisoners and Enemy, this one is a more mainstream effort from him. The so called War on Drugs as one knows has been a long drawn out affair,that has cost billions of dollars, countless lives and has not seen any resolution to yet. And I doubt it will. For the last 4 years or so,Mexico has turned into a war zone of sorts, with daily battles between the entrenched drug cartels and the Government. A dirty battle, marked by unprecedented viciousness, cruelty, and which really has seen no winners at all.<br/><br/>And I guess that is the best part of Sicario, it treads into the grey zone, there are no heroes in this war. Both the sides play it equally dirty, throwing all rules and ethics out of the window. As the idealistic Fed agent Kate Macer( Emily Blunt) discovers , when her boss tells her bluntly, the boundaries have expanded, and there is no question of operating outside them now. In a sense Kate undergoes a loss of innocence, as she watches her colleague, a Dept of Defense adviser Matt( Josh Brolin), and his mysterious partner Alejandro( Benicio Del Toro), break every rule in the book. She seems to be the odd one out in a dirty and ruthless world, where no one is what it seems.<br/><br/>One of the most shocking opening scenes ever, where the raiding party, discovers a home stuffed with caracasses in the wall and rigged with explosives. You know this is not going to be your conventional popcorn action flick. The pacing is slow, and the tension is more like a slow poison sort, that envelops you steadily. The violence is brutal and realistic, it just makes you squirm, you are thankful that you are not there. One particularly brilliant scene, when the Agents intercept the cartel men in a traffic jam near the border, the way Villeneueve builds up the tension here is superb. The movie sticks to the point, and at no stage is the focus diverted. The tension is relentlessly drilled into your head, until it overwhelms you.<br/><br/>The camera work is outstanding, the desert scenes, the aerial shots of the border towns, are so brilliantly shot, as well as the scene where they go into the tunnel. Add to it, the movie is marked by some top notch performances. Emily Blunt is first rate as the idealistic Fed agent, who has a rude awakening to reality. Josh Brolin as the street smart DOD agent, who would do anything to get to his target is great as usual. And it is good to see Benicio Del Toro, back in a real meaty role, as Brolin's partner, who seemingly has a lot to hide. Here is my recommendation, Go for it."

"jrarichards","8","0","0","1 March 2017"," Taut, simple-ish but realistic-looking thriller with very downbeat message
","As a huge Emily Blunt fan with enthusiasm extending somewhat beyond the purely rational, I was somewhat surprised to see her (in the role of the FBI's Kate Macer) handing over control of the plot - and hence the starring role - on at least two occasions in ""Sicario"" - in an interesting enough technique and one we get to see deployed surprisingly rarely in films. Still, Emily does not disappoint in her role, though Benicio del Toro as Alejandro certainly has a mountain of screen presence, and his part differs from hers in remaining competent at all times, while Macer is in truth out of her depth as she joins a combined-agencies anti-drugs operation (initially detailed quite well and - one would feel - extremely realistically, but later assuming more of a ""sketchy"" look). A further co-star here is Josh Brolin, who sadly comes up with the distinctly irritating character of Matt Graver (CIA). Nevertheless, one is more than tempted to believe that those with ""the A"" can indeed be like this, so presumably it's only reasonable.<br/><br/>The plot here is a relatively straightforward one, which the above mini-description goes a long way towards encapsulating; but the ""fun"" here, while it lasts, lies in the depiction of some very ""interesting"" relationships on and around the US-Mexican border (at times well or even stunningly presented by aerial shots and so on). Indeed, how could this border be other than a star of the film in its own right - given the truth about the circumstances of the neighbouring El Paso (Texas) and Ciudad Juarez (Mexico)? For there they sit, with normal-ish, civilised life on one side of the border and anarchy and misery and mass murder on the other. Art of course imitates life here, as documentaries like Simon Reeve's excellent ""Tropic of Cancer"" and the superb ""Toughest Place to be a Nurse"" (both HUGELY to be recommended, by the way) have covered this ground in reality, and indeed Sicario's fictionalised version cannot top those real-life stories, though we do at least know how authentic and impressive (impressively scary) the former looks.<br/><br/>This film does no favours to Mexico as a tourist destination or in any other light, but it throws up the expected number of questions about what methods are justified and who are really the good guys - indeed it probably asks more questions even than we anticipate (not least in a very interesting vignette starring Julio Cedillo). <br/><br/>Real answers seem few and far between, however, and the fact that this is now ""the way of the world"" hardly seems satisfactory, all the more so given the potential sentence-ending of ""and forever will be""... We know this is a war that is not being won, and we can scarcely extract much satisfaction from the idea that ""desperate situations call for desperate measures"". <br/><br/>Naturally, our Emily stays on the right side of that kind of line - pretty much; but then she is told in no uncertain terms what we the viewers have already come to appreciate (perhaps even shockingly, given our experiences of supremely self-assured Blunt characters, such as the one in ""Edge of Tomorrow"") - that here is someone whose methods fail and are out-of-date, a fish out of water (as indeed anybody interested in traditional, transparent procedures would now seem to be). And that is a far from pretty thought.<br/><br/>Overall, then, this film offers up an appropriate degree of tension, looks mostly authentic, and leaves one feeling both alarmed and miserable. Job well done, then, Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Taylor Sheridan, but in no way is this any kind of pleasure watching.<br/><br/>Worthwhile it probably will be, however, and much recommended for that reason..."
"view_and_review","10","0","0","26 January 2017"," Cold
","Back when I was younger we had a slang for certain people. It was used for people who we considered heartless or maybe someone that operated on a ""I don't give a bleep"" level. We called them cold-blooded, or cold. It was a term of endearment though. ""Man, you cold."" Like, man you're doing some stuff I could never work up the nerve to do.<br/><br/>That's how I would characterize this movie. Cold. Along with cold it was extremely intense. Like that hold-your-breath-so-you-can-be-aware-of-everything-that's-going-on intensity. And the pervasive musical score with the low bass chords added to the intensity. <br/><br/>I thought the movie was going to be a hit-man/double agent/super spy movie with extreme gadgets, extreme explosions, extreme stunts and an extreme death toll. It's not that. Or I'll say, it's not quite that. This movie went for authenticity. There's no 007/Ethan Hunt/super spy performing these miraculous fight moves, deftly killing people with the most unlikely weapon and escaping death defying situations. Upon seeing Emily Blunt (Kate Macer), I figured she'd be a super badass that would be kicking butt and taking names and could outdo even the best man. She was bad, but there was a realistic limit to her skill set.<br/><br/>The action was gritty, slow moving, calculated action that conforms to the rules of physics and reality. There's tactical planning on a basic level, constant communication and methodical execution of said plans. And did I mention that it's cold?<br/><br/>The story is a simple yet terrific one. The U.S. is stepping up its effort to curtail drugs flowing into the U.S. from Mexico with the help of an ""adviser"". This adviser has a right hand man, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), who adds an element of mystery to the entire operation. And he adds the frigidness. This man sleeps in a freezer. He drinks water and pees ice. Every scene he was in the temperature dropped. He was one cold piece of work.<br/><br/>The movie was masterfully done. It drove home the seriousness of the drug violence without making it look fake and superfluous. Even the subdued nature of the acting added to the quality of the film. No person was out of place or there to make a splash. This was just one of those movies where the pieces fit perfectly. Sicario has just become one of my favorites."
"jonathan-05590","9","0","0","8 December 2016"," Emily Blunt's Performance is Exceptional
","After being thoroughly impressed by 'Prisoners', and following the release of 'Arrival', I wanted to watch some of Dennis Villeneuve's other successful films to gain an understanding of his distinct style of filmmaking as preparation to watching 'Arrival'. This, like 'Prisoners', has once again left me very much in love with his approach to directing. <br/><br/>Sicario follows the story of Kate, who has been sent by the FBI to track down a drug lord, responsible for the killings of countless civilians, including some of her own team. We observe how she deals with not only the brutality of the people she is trying to arrest, but also the people she made the regrettable decision to work with, who take matters into their own hands, ignoring the jurisdictions of law.<br/><br/>Dennis Villeneuve made the right decision to cast Emily Blunt as the lead protagonist; an actress I believe is well suited to roles such as these. What I find most captivating about this film, is the way in which the subtlety of Blunt's performance leads to a fresh perspective on working within the conditions of such an extreme environment. What you do not see in this film is exaggerated acting, a cheap tactic, often used to draw attention to what is being reacted to, and instead you are met with raw emotion, subtlety, and a frankly more powerful means of conveying the message of the film. The way Emily Blunt has taken on the role of someone who is faced with such extreme barbarism works well, and her role is key in the success of this film.<br/><br/>Being a fairly slow film for some, the way Villeneuve strips away distractions and keeps us engaged is extraordinary. I found myself entranced by the scenes in which he decided to keep the camera focused on the actor's reaction to something without cutting away. It seems as though the longer the shot is focused on the actor, the more suspense is built up. These scenes were by far one of the best aspects of the film. Like I talked about in the previous paragraph, the subtlety of the acting, paired with Villeneuve's will to keep the camera focused on the actors is an good example of first class directing. <br/><br/>The way Alejandro Gillick's character evolves through the film is certainly notable. In the beginning, he chooses not to reveal much about himself, to the dismay of Kate, who repeatedly makes the effort to extract information from him. For the most part of the film, I couldn't decide if he was a protagonist or an antagonist, and there were times where my perception of the character swayed, ultimately remaining unsure. For example, his unconventional and often detrimental means of handling situations like Kate pointing her weapon at him was met with the fact that he was making these choices because of his determination to kill the man who murdered his wife and daughter. As an audience, our perception of Alejandro fluctuates throughout, yet takes an immediate demise at the point at which he threatens to kill Kate if she doesn't sign the paper declaring that everything they did was legal. Prior to this, there was never any consequence to the lead protagonist directly from Alejandro, with times where he had saved her life, but at this stage in the film, all that changes, and we are left seriously reconsidering the well-being of Kate.<br/><br/>Aside from these points, the way this film was directed, filmed, and acted left me consistently engaged, with me trying to work out the direction of the plot, and being constantly surprised by the outcome to a seemingly simple yet complex narrative."

","Thanks partially to some of the best ever use of acoustic bass, this movie is very tense. The camera shots feel epic and the acting is excellent, or at the very least eccentrically entertaining.<br/><br/>The only real issue I had is with the story. Towards the end, it stopped making sense. I went to wiki to look up whatever I missed and, no, it still doesn't quite make sense. It is a strange blemish on an otherwise well-executed movie.<br/><br/>This is also not a very purposeful movie. A lot of shots are there to build atmosphere and not to tell a story. There is no big lesson or message in the end. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but some people like movies driven by intelligent message."

","If you haven't read anything about the story or I reckon if it's not in the trailer, than the beginning of this movie will definitely feel like a punch in the gut, while you watch it. Even if you have it will have an impact of course, but it is even greater without knowing anything. And while it is silent (sort of), you will feel a great impact.<br/><br/>So while some might feel that this strong beginning might (or rather is) kind of hurting the rest of the movie, I do think that it just sets a tone. And makes the character decisions relatable. Emily Blunt is the moral compass and should be the conscious of the viewer. We go on a ride with her and while she is trained in certain things, even her stomach cannot handle everything. Not to mention her mind and body of course ... But there is a reason it's called ""war on drugs""."

","""Sicario"" is a great drama film that borderlines a thriller and is, with no doubt, epic. There are powerful performances throughout the film from Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt, and Benicio Del Toro. This film is well written and perfectly put together. Being that this film is about a war on drugs at the US and Mexico border and the fact that I'm an action movie fan, I thought this film would have a lot more action in it. The fact that it didn't have more action scenes didn't leave me disappointed. This film really didn't need that much action to keep me interested. It was intelligent and powerful enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen the entire time. Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya) are FBI agents enlisted by a US task force to help in the fight against the drug war at the US and Mexico border, along with the help of a questionable consultant named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), the two agents start to question everything they believe and work for. This is a great piece of work for anyone one who loves a well crafted film."
"classicsoncall","10","0","0","31 August 2016"," ""Now you'll learn what's hell in Yankee land"".
","It's hard to imagine that the world of ""Sicario"" actually exists in the nether world of Mexican drug cartels. You hear about the escalating number of deaths attached to the drug trade and it's quite simply unthinkable. The Mexican Government itself estimates the number of homicides due to drug trafficking between 2007 and 2014 is a staggering one hundred sixty four thousand! <br/><br/>So it's not surprising to hear Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) consider that the war is already lost. But the good guys try to persevere as best they can, utilizing a drug kingpin of their own to infiltrate the top of the pyramid. Benicio del Toro is coolly effective as the assassin of few words avenging the death of his wife and daughters in the hell hole that is Juarez, Mexico. He sets the tone with FBI agent Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) by telling her to keep her eyes open because ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears"".<br/><br/>With a goal of 'shaking the tree to create chaos', Graver's inter-agency task force pretty much boils down to a one man operation by the time Alejandro (del Toro) snakes his way into the Fausto Alarcon compound. There's something to be said for ruthless killers, and it's embodied in the person of Alejandro, who's sense of justice leaves no room for moral quandaries.<br/><br/>Best thing one can do as the viewer is play close attention because the delivery is sometimes fast and murky, and you have to make sense of some untenable situations. Director Denis Villeneuve weaves an intricate story line on the shoulders of his principal players and it works to dramatic effect. This is a thriller you shouldn't miss."

","The border is just another line to cross<br/><br/>Subject to combat drug trafficking in Hollywood in most cases reduced to a confrontation template villains and valiant policemen. A good half of the movie is full of action scenes and patriotic speeches. Inevitably and division into good and bad sides. In Sicario Villeneuve you will not see such. The director has created a deep and attention to detail the political thriller, which is frightening and causes the press in the chair.<br/><br/>From the first minutes of viewing the picture presses naturalism, gently introduces the viewer into the brutal world of the fight against crime. The feeling of reality does not leave until the end of the film, and the voltage increases with each passing minute. Confronting US intelligence and Mexican punitive not like confrontation of good and evil. The spectator, like the brave heroine Emily Blunt kept in the dark, the true motives of the characters of Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are unknown. Intrigue excellent support to the climax and culmination, in turn, is ideally links all the story lines with each other, it's worth a separate praise.<br/><br/>Yet despite all the undoubted advantages, among which are well thought out plot, frightening realism and stunning acting, I think the main advantage of the voltage that through the interaction of many factors creates a strong impact on the viewer. Since hovering over expanses of Mexican criminal chamber of the nominee for the Oscar Roger Deakins, ending mesmerizing music of Johann Yohansana, confront us with the picture, the creators of which squeezed the limit of their capabilities. As a result, we see a bloody war without rules and morality, justice advocates are doing lynching and lawlessness, but is it possible to judge them if they are struggling with the wild beasts of drug trafficking? That's only if all of these animals? How has shifted the boundary between justice and senseless slaughter?<br/><br/>No matter what kind of war in question, whether it is the war on terrorism, the war between the warring powers. There's no concept of good and evil and right there. You either accept the rules and enter into a world of wolves, where the boundaries are blurred morality, and goals are driven by revenge and anger. And there is no sense and no way to change something. To replace one, others will, closes the cycle, and the war will continue. And naive heroes Kate will always be to seek justice in this world, and will be disappointed when they came to an understanding. We can only wait for that ""comes some wise guy will discourage and 20% of the population use drugs.""<br/><br/>In summary I would say that the atmosphere created by the allows you to believe in the reality of the situation, in consequence, the problem takes on a frightening character. Actors create interesting and complex characters, beyond which is not boring to watch. The music video and create amazing beauty of sight, allowing to see the meaningless horrors of the modern world where children play soccer under the thunder of explosions.<br/><br/>9 out of 10<br/><br/>and one of the best films of the year."

","Benicio Del Toro's Alejandro Gillick is the key to this entire film. When we first meet him, he doesn't so much introduce himself as he emerges like a enigmatic Mephisto. He remains at arms length throughout the plot; biding time, leaching forward, coolly assessing the situation before he takes his closing shot. Any sense of justice and idealism that Del Toro brought to his character in the similarly themed Traffic (2000) is completely gone; replaced by the deadened gaze of an angry and dangerous tiger shark.<br/><br/>The story of Sicario however does not start with Alejandro but with forthright FBI agent Kate Macer (Blunt) and her drug enforcement team. They raid a cartel safe house in Chandler, Arizona and find dozens of decaying corpses as well as a deadly bobby trap that kills two of her agents. Despite this, her superiors recommend she joins a Department of Defense-CIA task force who are tracking down the man responsible for the death of her mates. When she joins however, she descends into the chaos, murder and deceit that plagues the border between El Paso and Juarez. Leading her down the rabbit hole is gung-ho CIA agent Matt Graver (Brolin) and along for the ride is her partner Reggie (Kaluuya) who like Kate seems completely out of his depth.<br/><br/>Much like in director Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners (2013) and Incendies (2010), Sicario is an ugly story made beautiful by a canny eye for detail and an unflinching dive into the darkest of the human soul. The glorious vistas and bird's eye footage takes the film's similarities to Apocalypse Now (1979) to a jarring extreme but proves at times even more alienating. The God of Sicario not only doesn't know, he doesn't care to know.<br/><br/>In the dark and unflinching world of Sicario, the only ones who care plumb the depths of drug cartel hell are but degrees away from the drug traffickers they're trying to capture and control. Brolin's Graver seems to almost take relish in his job which includes gun- play, torture and even enemy collusion. You never know whether he's keeping Kate and Reggie in the dark for good reason or if he simply gets off on watching them squirm. While Alejandro is laconic and foreboding, Graver is about as close to a magician as you're liable to see in this movie; he walks in, tell you to your face you're going to be tricked...and does it.<br/><br/>If there's a weak spot to this movie it's Emily Blunt as Kate. At her best she tries to impose herself among a group of wolves and succeeds in being useful in a fight or two. Yet at her worst, her main function is to seek and absorb information while looking forlorn and Bambi (1942)-esque. I understand the limits of justice and nobility is a major theme but wouldn't the chilly fatalism of the plot hold more sway if the forces that be, cut a Dana Scully to the quick instead of a dime novel Clarice Starling?<br/><br/>The unbelievably of the protagonist is a crippling delta of the film but is by no means a fatal one. As a whole, the film is a near masterpiece of mood, tension and the ruthlessness of man. As a film whose main theme is violence, the gore is surprisingly tame; this movie won't dare be so obtuse as to coat itself with layers of sinew. It's the atmosphere of violence that you walk away with. An atmosphere tearful of the loss of innocence and putrid with the specter of death."

","Another feather in Denis Villeneuve's highly feathered cap (Prisoners, Enemy), Sicario has been described as being to the War on Drugs what Zero Dark Thirty was to the War on Terror. The excellent Emily Blunt, acting as the audience surrogate and protagonist, plays an FBI agent embroiled in a mysterious plan in the Mexican town of Juarez. Leading her team are the laid-back yet enigmatic Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro, oozing cool mystery and threatening menace. <br/><br/>As Blunt's character finds out more about the operation being run, we also find out more, adding tension to an already tense film. And tension is one of the primary ingredients in the piece - scenes are often nail-biting and at their conclusion do not be surprised if you find yourself letting out a held-in breath. This is achieved in multiple ways. Jóhan Jóhannsson's excellent score - the standout of which is the dread-filled track 'The Beast', playing multiple times and conveying the terror and horror of the situation. Roger Deakins, nominated thirteen times for the Academy Award for Cinematography without winning, makes Sicario look exquisite, with memorable shots such as the silhouettes of a Delta squad framed against the setting sun, descending into a tunnel to root out cartel members. Numerous aerial shots make it look like characters are being watched by drones. Emmanuel Lubezki did fantastic work on The Revenant, yet it seems a crying shame that Deakins should miss out for his fine work. <br/><br/>Best of all is the acting. Del Toro's performance has been widely praised, but Blunt is the standout here, expertly showcasing her character's descent and the PTSD and disillusionment she develops as she gets further into the murky situation. Brolin, all sandals and faux-Southern-friendliness, is the best he's been in anything, whilst del Toro deservedly wins the plaudits with a performance that really comes into its own towards the film's end, as more about his character is revealed, and almost evokes Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men at times. It will be interesting to see his performance as a purported villain in Star Wars: Episode VIII. Every technical aspect of the film is perfect - right down to the Oscar-nominated sound editing, with gunshots sounding realistically loud and jolting. Villeneuve's direction ensures moral complexity for the characters, despite Brolin and del Toro's truly despicable actions.<br/><br/>Really there are only a few things preventing it from reaching the very top tier. At times, some plot elements are unnecessarily unclear - sometimes this works as Blunt's character as the audience surrogate is meant to be in the dark, yet sometimes the vagueness is irritating. Also, occasional scenes verge on dragging too long, and some of the dialogue borders on cliché-speak. Yet ultimately, this does not prevent Sicario from being one of the best films of all of 2015, and an important watch to understand the USA's War on Drugs. 87/100."
"peterhjensen","10","0","0","22 July 2016"," A classic film where all the elements come together perfectly
","Sicario is directed with a superb certainty by Denis Villeneuve with an original eye to the placement of the human body within both the frame and the physical spaces examined by the camera. Mr Villeneuve expands on symbolic arrangements used so effectively by Alfred Hitchcock. The unexpected location of a corpse, or the glimpse of a key person through an array of mirrors, staples Hitchcock's visual language is redeployed with the same eerie effects. In Psycho Hitchcock took particular care with the bathroom, the place where our animal obscenities are flushed or washed away, the portal between human filth and the charade of normality. In the famous shower scene the camera can only travel so far in its exploration of the drain, it is safe to conclude that what lies beyond it is unimaginable. Mr Villeneuve however allows his camera to go even further into the dark space we would prefer not to think about.<br/><br/>Sicario leads us with increasing intensity to the place where Monsters and Myths are born as embodied by Benecio del Toro's character Alejandro. <br/><br/>One myth that is synchronous with Alejandro is ""Medellin."" it says much about the quality of writing of Taylor Sheridan (Sons of Anarchy) that the moment one of the corrupted see Alejandro they say the word ""Medellin"" though at least in the case of the small time cop who is a cartel courier it is a surprising conclusion to instantly make. That is not the point Alejandro is Medillin, the locus of balance and control in a world where the insanity rules.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin whose character functions as a chorus (he will reveal Alejandro's back story) explains that ""Medellin"" refers to a time of control. In fact it was the place where a Colombian super cartel emerged only to be destroyed by a rival with the overt support of America. Emily Blunts motivation for (Kate Macer) volunteering to take the ride over the border with Alejandro and Company is the proposition that in 6 months every house in the U.S.A used by the cartels will be rigged with explosives. It does not need a psychoanalytical approach to imagine the disintegration of social order occurring not just in the collapse of individuals into substance abuse but the house next door as well. <br/><br/>Throughout Sicario we see corpses tightly packed in walls (Edgar Allen Poe would have approved), living bodies contorted into planes and buses, the dead and the living jostling each other in tunnels (lit with a phosphorescent hue of night vision goggles), and bodies subdued at anonymous transit stations. The only moments of physical freedom occurs at the end the soccer game played by children, a game that continues despite the ominous reminders of reality in the form of gunfire over the horizon. <br/><br/>Woven into the visual narrative are superb slow pans over endless border fences, empty desert and amorphous mountain ranges, leading us closer to the place that gave birth to Alejandro, the palatial retreat of his nemesis Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cedillo note perfect in his mix of arrogance and practicality). It is in fact Fausto who will respond to Alejandro with the words ""The people who sent you, do you think they are any different? Who do you think we learnt it from?"" What redeems Alejandro is the exchange where Fausto dismisses the dropping of Alejandro's young daughter into a vat of acid as just ""business"". Mr del Toro responds with a line enunciated from his very bones ""For me it was personal"". His awful revenge involves killing a clueless wife and two well bred boys who happen to be at the table with Dad. Julio Cedillo at that point switches registers to a kind of executive distress, Alejandro is not playing by the rules, he had expected to be executed out of sight of the children, his moral blindness becomes ours as we watch a family murdered in the context of a satisfying climax.<br/><br/>An interesting moment occurs during the ""interrogation scene,"" with the highly secured prisoner who has information that may be vital to Alejandro's mission. It is an obvious humiliation for Alejandro's to push crotch in front of the prisoners face, who is now terrified, knowing full well that the time of Medillin's revival is imminent which can only mean that Fausto is to be taken down. Over the sound of tortured screams and beating the camera drift towards a drain referencing the shower scene from ""Psycho"". What is going on in the room is the bestial reality that we would wish to dispose of, to hide from, the fact that in the name of civilisation we must become animals ourselves. The binary becomes a loop, a circle, a drain. <br/><br/>The binary reaches into the very internal architecture of Alejandro himself. Despite Kate (Emily Blunt) reminding him of his beloved daughter he is willing to kill her in order to get legal absolution for his unique execution of justice. Her refusal to sign a document in his mind is her suicide. At the end of the scene as he ambles away into an anonymous car park Kate is pointing the same gun he had pressed under her china few moments earlier at him from her balcony. Alejandro pauses and waits for the shot, he is already dead. Kate puts down the weapon, broken but human. Alejandro continues walking, he has willingly left civilisation behind in the name of a restorative myth and in so doing has become the unimaginable, the thing that would disrupt causality and destroy the state of things as they are. In other words death itself."
"werdnaoslek","8","0","0","22 June 2016"," My thoughts on the newest Villenueve flick
","There isn't much hope, or anything to really cling to in this movie. The gritty story is told in a gritty manner, and the environment this movie surrounds you with is very filthy. That's not to say that the camera-work or color palette makes this movie look bland because the cinematography in this movie was top notch. In fact, Roger Deakins very stylistically shot this movie, to showcase the brutality and to be more interesting to watch at the same time, so it doesn't feel like senseless violence. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is that it keeps you on edge for the majority of the run time. The music by Jóhann Jóhannsson was very odd and eerie and was used sparingly. The music was mainly used as a tool for giving a sense of anxiety. The great music, combined with beautiful/odd shots of random objects, and closeups of seemingly random objects actually builds a lot of suspense. The way this film does it is incredible, with these oddly eerie scenes that give you a sense that something bad is going to happen soon. These riveting scenes have dramatic slow build, and there were points when I, unaware of it at the time, got a huge knot in my stomach. Even if there isn't that much happening to advance the plot in these scenes, it is still wildly entertaining. There is a great scene in an airplane where for some reason, I felt on edge with the eerie music and weird close-ups of objects with extreme attention to detail. I'm thinking that Denis Villeneuve decided to build suspense and anxiety in these random scenes to delve into the subconscious of all these professional agents who have seen their fair share of disturbing things. Using these scenes to emphasize the vibe of the anxiety in these characters was a genius editing choice.<br/><br/>Where this movie starts to weaken is its screenplay. The story and premise for this movie could have had so much more done with it. There were great performances all around, though these actors did not have much to work with. I mean, sure, there were moments where the characters acted really sad and angry when they needed to, but there was nothing to really define these different characters. Besides the fact that the only thing that I could really differentiate these characters from was their opinions on some situation on hand, these actors did a phenomenal job with what little direction they most likely had, with essentially no character arcs. There were a few character dilemmas that were done well, but there was nothing interesting or unique to make any of the characters feel all that special. There was not much dialogue to give us more information about these characters. Another thing revealed much later on in the movie, but still slightly unclear, is the main characters and all of their different motivations for the large, elaborate drug bust they are trying to execute. That only comes much later, and it is still unclear what Kate's motivation is. Nothing else besides that really gives anybody a unique or special personality. I was surprised to see that by the end of the movie that Benicio del Toro was becoming the star of the movie, rather than Emily Blunt. I was fine with that since I know that a spin-off is being made for del Toro's character later, but I was annoyed with the fact that the del Toro's character, Alejandro, got more of a resolution than Kate Macer. Since the majority of the movie led me to believe that she was the main character, I was a little weirded out to see her weaven out of the majority of the last 20 minutes of the movie, and then a very brief scene at the very end with her. This felt really sudden, and the studio was very obviously rushing to get the last act packed with screen time for Benicio Del Toro, to set up the spin-off. The ending was sad and left a bitter taste, but was fitting for the general overtone of the film.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie was put together very smartly. The characters were only mediocre, as well as parts of the script during the final act of the movie. Sometimes Emily Blunt's character motivation made little sense, and a lot of times there were missed opportunities that I felt could have been good places to insert some dialogue to let us learn at least a little bit about these characters. I have a feeling that the script was used more of a guideline than an actual script. This movie is worth a watch, even if it starts very strong and almost dies with a faint whimper in the concluding scenes.<br/><br/>+ Good acting all around - Messy script + Interesting premise + Good suspense building, good use of music + Insane camera-work 7.9/10"
"theveneficus","7","0","0","28 May 2016"," Terrific acting and a brutal story make this a haunting film.
","I've never really thought greatly of Emily Blunt until I saw this film. I've seen a few of her other films, Edge of Tomorrow for instance. And whilst she's definitely been good. I've never been captivated by her performance. That is until now. Unfortunately her character lacks a little strength that would otherwise make her not only a good FBI agent, but a powerful heroine. In a lot of scenes she's sort of just there. Not really doing much besides complaining. Which is understandable since she has virtually no clue what's happening. At the same time that's part of the fun of this film. We the audience are just like her. We're lost, confused, and quite scared. One 10 second shot, which I'll definitely remember, is when she and the other agents are driving through a slum in Mexico and they see four naked mutilated corpses hanging in plain view under an overpass. This is the kind of world Kate Macy (Emily Blunt) has entered. Its grim, bloody, and no one but the children care for one another. Its a world where I wouldn't want to spend even a second. Filled with gunfire, explosions, drugs, and death. The two strong points of this film are easily Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro's performances. They're exact opposites. Blunt is in deep water, afraid yet still moral. Whereas Del Toro is swimming gracefully through this film, controlling everyone and everything along with the help of his 'friends' who will forever remain in the shade. In short, this is a good film, filled with powerful, shivering scenes and gripping performances. I just wish Emily Blunt had more to do."

","There are movies which will taint you, which will bring you to the depths of the human nature and will make you wonder about Good and Evil.<br/><br/>Sicario is a movie by the Canadian director Denis Villeneuve about a US Elite Task Force of CIA, FBI, DEA and Delta Force mandated by the Department of Defense to take down a violent and murderous Mexican Cartel responsible of the death of many innocent families both in Mexico and the US.<br/><br/>Kate (Emily Blunt), a young and promising FBI SWAT team from Phoenix, Arizona, is hired to serve as liaison between the Task Force and the US Government. During the meeting, she meets the Agent in Charge, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who briefed her about the mission and the main objectives. But soon she realizes that the Task force is free of action and have no restraint about using force against the criminals they are supposed to take down.<br/><br/>Along the way, she meets Matt's partner, Alejandro (The excellent Benicio del Toro), who introduces himself as a cartel 'expert'. He is rough, keeps on himself and very heart cold. Throughout the movie, we realize that in fact he's an assassin who is on a personal vendetta against the head of the cartel who ordered the horrible murders of his wife and daughter. The real purpose of the mission is to create a diversion to allow Alejandro to fulfill his revenge and assassinate the cartel leader and his family which at the end he did in cold blood.<br/><br/>This movie is violent and this is not for everyone eyes to see. But it's intense and complex, making you wonder what's the border between good and evil as the good guys are as violent as the criminals, maybe even more.<br/><br/>Benicio del Toro is really amazing starring as Alejandro. He truly deserved an award for his performance. He is very chilling but we understand why he is so driven by revenge. The ending scenes where he kills everyone in his way to finally murder the entire cartel family including children is frightening. This is hard to witness and I felt for those children as well as the corrupted police officer's son after his father was murdered by Alejandro.<br/><br/>I'm giving a high note because it's nonetheless intense and to reward the performance of the casting which is over the top as the directing. But god this is frightening."
"Turfseer","7","0","0","18 April 2016"," Thoughtful meditation on over her head FBI agent coping with CIA extra-judicial actions against evil drug cartels
","What does one make of Taylor Sheridan's screenplay in which the principal character, FBI agent Kate Macer (played by Emily Blunt), is a passive observer for a good part of the drama? Macer is given the assignment to accompany CIA operatives to investigate the botched FBI Swat team raid of a Mexican drug cartel hideout in Arizona, where dozens of corpses are found and two agents lose their life when an improvised explosive device goes off. Macer's assignment is mandatory since the CIA must be accompanied by an FBI agent during any domestic investigation.<br/><br/>Macer is partnered with a CIA undercover operative Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who makes it clear they're going after Sonora Cartel lieutenant Manuel Díaz. But instead of going to El Paso, Texas, they end up in Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, accompanied by the sinister former Mexican drug prosecutor Alejandro Gillick (Bernicio Del Toro). It will soon become apparent that Macer is way in over her head as Gillick refuses to play by any rules in dealing with ruthless cartel members. In fact, Macer will soon realize that Gillick is almost as bad as the cartel members he's attempting to hunt down.<br/><br/>On the way back to the US with Diaz's brother Guillermo in tow, Macer almost gets herself killed as cartel members attempt to rescue the hapless sibling on the Bridge of the Americas at the Mexico-US border. While Macer is undoubtedly happy to see Delta Force Special Ops come to the rescue on the bridge, their method of shoot first and ask questions later (which foreshadows some even more advanced extra-legal shenanigans at film's end), impels the intrepid FBI agent to question the entire moral imperative of the CIA team's mission.<br/><br/>It's only at this point that Macer becomes a more active participant in the drama that things get more interesting. First she and her FBI partner Reggie Wayne question Graver and Gillick as to their true intentions and they learn that the real target is Sonora Cartel boss Fausto Alarcón—Graver and Gillick are attempting to disrupt the cartel's drug operations which may draw Diaz out and lead them to the bigger cheese, Alarcón. But naïve Macer almost mucks things up entirely by attempting to gather records at a bank that services Diaz's money launderers (Macer is overruled in her efforts to arrest the bank officials as it could tip off Diaz and his cronies as to what's going on). Meanwhile Gillick has extracted information from Mexican illegals about a tunnel between US and Mexico at a border station.<br/><br/>Macer falls in deeper over her head when she attempts to have a one night stand with a corrupt Arizona cop. Gillick saves her from being strangled and later extracts information from the cop regarding other corrupt cops, utilizing methods that border on torture.<br/><br/>The CIA achieves its objective when they're able to track Diaz who is now going to meet with his boss Alarcón. Gillick has no time for by-the-book Macer who regards his mission as completely unauthorized and illegal. One of the film's most exciting moments is when Gillick shoots Macer (she's wearing a bulletproof vest) and he orders her back through the tunnel to the US side.<br/><br/>Graver explains that Alarcón's overreaching has upset the balance of power in the drug cartel world and he must be eliminated—re -establishing the Medellin cartel as the sole arbiter of power. Gillick also has a personal score to settle with Alarcón—his wife and daughter were murdered by Alarcón's thugs.<br/><br/>The focus shifts from Macer again with Gillick providing all the histrionics at the denouement. Proving how ruthless the drug cartel world is, Gillick murders Alarcón wife and children as the drug lord helplessly watches at the dinner table at his estate in Mexico. Then Gillick finishes Alarcón off not before mentioning the fate of his own wife and daughter to the kingpin.<br/><br/>The whole point of the film is that in the war against Mexican cartels, there are no rules and those assigned with the task of taking them out, will employ any tactics at their disposal to achieve their objectives. Macer, who believes in the rule of law, proves to be wholly impotent and irrelevant in the fight against evil. Her impotence is highlighted when Gillick forces her to sign a waiver at gunpoint, claiming that all his actions were legitimate.<br/><br/>At the beginning, we expect the heroic Macer to be successful in her quest to bring murderers to justice ""by the book."" But in a complete reversal, it's those who refuse to play by the book who are triumphant. Macer is simply a cog in the wheel who is completely over her head.<br/><br/>Despite its theme imbued with verisimilitude, not everything that happens in Sicario is completely believable (did you really believe that Gillick would have been successful in sneaking into the drug cartel boss' compound and is so easily able in disposing of Alarcón and his entire family?).<br/><br/>Still, Sicario raises some important questions about the nature of extra-judicial actions in the fight against evil."

","Things that were cool:<br/><br/>1.) The acting. This film features a very talented cast front-lined by Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and and Josh Brolin. Particularly mesmerizing is Blunt who is able to convincingly convey the sense of urgency and confusion her character experiences. <br/><br/>2.) The cinematography. Far and away my favorite part of the film. Shot by Roger Deakins (Shawkshank Redemption, Skyfall, A Beautiful Mind), the cinematography beautifully pushed the narrative. Several of the shots used from the airplane view were incredible as well as the sweeping views of the western plains. The intro scene and first operative mission both utilized very engaging cinematographic techniques that generated a lot of cool tension. <br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>A very solid film that forced me to think hard about the parameters appropriate to right injustice and fight against crime. The movie definitely implies that you do have to be okay with getting your hands dirty for ultimate good to come. The film also does a great job of considering this issue from the side of the Mexican people who deal with this problem from a completely different angle. The deep-seated gloom inspired by the last scene portrays what we consider a grandiose ""war on drugs"" to be nothing more than ""another day in the life"" for these Mexican civilians.

The acting and Denis Villeneuve's direction is exceptional. Written by Taylor Sheridan Sicario tackles complex drug policy issues and there impact but makes a digestible story.<br/><br/>Sheridan gives Benicio Del Toro's wonderfully played Alejandro just enough lines to keep intrigue in the character, in the vain of Training Day's Detective Alonzo Harris or Lamb's Hannibal Lecter to name a few. <br/><br/>While Emily Blunt is excellent as the reserved Kate Macer her character feels simply functional as the viewers moral point of view. Josh Brolin gives a fine performance as the laid back spook Matt Graver. Still, Benicio Del Toro steals the show with great screen presence in his dark themed scenes.<br/><br/>There's an edgy explosive opening as a SWAT team discover dozens of corpses, the realistic setting adds to the tension as jurisdiction wrangling and corruption is discovered. <br/><br/>Sicario is a solid murky, hard- edged thriller and worth watching for Del Toro and Brolin's performances alone. Overall a great film but doesn't do enough to elevate it into a classic."
"kgprophet","6","0","0","5 February 2016"," Different Story Structure Creates Strong Tension
","This film is supposed to center on the FBI agent Emily Blunt being lured into an undercover drug operation. Her character represents the audience, and the screenplay toys with us (and her) hinting at larger things going on. With military interdictions on foreign soil, you will be reminded of recent films like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker"". This film can be rightly called a suspense film more than a thriller, because you are given clues to what the real story is, but are only given bread crumbs of information along the way. This film has more emotionally based photography (by the great Roger Deakins), and a very selective point-of-view as we stick to our vulnerable main character.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt, recently seen as a fierce and fearless warrior in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" transforms herself quite believably to a competent but insecure law enforcement officer. The center of the real story is lead by Josh Brolin, who only needs to give you a wink and a smile to let you know that much more is happening, and frequently challenges Blunt to keep going along with the plan, even though the stakes are obviously getting higher.<br/><br/>This is one of the better screenplays to be produced, where it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience (we know some kind of dark operation is going on). When danger comes to our main character, we are surprised as much as she is, being lulled into a sense of security. The screenplay seems to instinctively know at what point we need a piece of information to stay engaged. Benicio Del Toro, as always, threatens to steal the movie from our other like-able characters with his mannerisms and general mystique. The ensemble in general has plenty of moments to exert their influence. What is interesting about the structure of this film, is that it is setup to feel like an action flick, but instead finds nuance in the preparation for the big action moments more than the bang and booms usually associated with that type of film. As an outside observer, the photography floats and hovers around the edges, providing more of a glimpse of the meat of the scene. This type of photography wisely represents our main character, who eventually resorts to her own interpretation of what is going on, but struggles by being an outsider from having any control to what is going on.<br/><br/>The screenplay creates a third act that is less about Blunt and more about Del Toro's character. What is great about the third act is that finally fleshes out who Del Toro really is, and is responsible for the fireworks that make up the climax. This can be surprising, because it doesn't involve Blunt's character at all. Which is fitting for the screenplay, since in order for it to succeed in maintaining unpredictability in regards to Blunt's exposure to danger, having her involved in the finale would remove that unpredictability. The music provides some good tension-building low tones. Although there are some grim images of violence, I would not consider this film as particularly violent, instead allowing the chatter of preparation and knowledge of the danger to fill the void."
"tomsview","7","0","0","3 February 2016"," The emperor's new flack-jacket
","From most directors, this would be a pretty good thriller with terrific action sequences and good performances from the actors, but from Denis Villeneuve, I expected more.<br/><br/>Where is that killer twist or the feeling that he has taken a well-worn genre – yet another drug cartel movie – and stood it on its head? He tries for a little ambiguity in the last scene, but it feels forced. The earth didn't move for me on this one.<br/><br/>When I first heard that the man who dazzled us with ""Polytechnique"", ""Prisoners"" and ""Enemy"" had picked this subject I wondered why? Now that I have seen it I definitely wonder why? I almost feel that much of the praise for the film is simply afterglow from his previous movies – and that smacks of the emperor's new clothes.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is exciting, the house of death has the flavour of ""Se7en"", and I thought Villeneuve was really in the zone. Then there is the great cinematography and unique angles that almost transforms the Texan and Mexican landscapes into the satellite shots you see of Mars. The armed convoys of agents on the way to and from the raids in Mexico is reminiscent of those convoys that left the Green Zone in Bagdad on the Highway of Death to the International airport.<br/><br/>The look of the film is superb and Jóhann Jóhannsson created an edgy score, but it's the story that goes downhill for me. Towards the end when Benicio del Toro's character cuts loose on his solo effort, if I wasn't thinking of a ""James Bond"" film, it was Viggo Mortensen in ""A History of Violence"". However, that movie was based on a graphic novel – a comic book – and accepted for that. Villeneuve's movie is supposedly linked to reality and current events.<br/><br/>Sure Emily Blunt as FBI agent Kate Macer projects a strong women who handles her tough assignments with as much focus and determination as any guy, but that can't be the point of difference for ""Sicario""; other movies have led the way in that area. The most interesting aspect of her character is the conflict she faces over the lawless methods of the 'good guys'.<br/><br/>Drug Cartel movies have just about blown Mafia movies away. However, I am not so sure that any director has really nailed the ""Godfather"" or ""The French Connection"" of cartel movies yet. Other than the fact that cartel gangsters are meaner than Triads and Russian Mafia combined, I have to admit I find the level of entertainment in the subject limited. Ridley Scott crashed and burned with ""The Counselor"", and although ""Sicario"" is many notches above that effort, Villeneuve hasn't been able to avoid the clichés.<br/><br/>Maybe that is reflected in the recent Academy Awards nominations where the film received well-deserved nominations for technical awards, and none for best picture, direction or story."

However, for once the 'hype' is actually well deserved. Benicio Del Toro is sublime playing the avenging gun for hire. There is a palpable tension for a great majority of the film and whilst there is some violence it is actually fairly tame – on the whole that is.

Either it was a cleverly devised piece of film work or an accidental genius, I do not know. I can't remember the last time I felt so conflicted about a film.<br/><br/>The main character Kate Macer is played by Emily Blunt; she was dreadful, but not because of her acting, because of the inherent nature of the character. I can't imagine any feminist liking this movie at all. Not only is she kept in the dark by her male counterparts, but she is used, for their progressive purposes to do what she inherently is, a woman out of her league. At every turn of the movie she is is faced with insubordination by men; she is out matched and manhandled in physical confrontation by men and stuck trying to decide how she feels or what she should do instead of reacting to her environment using FBI trained field instincts - instead of shooting first and asking questions later. Take what you want from that. In short, she came off very weak. I am not an expert on FBI anti-drug tactics or what demographics comprise the elite agents who deal with this kind of warfare. <br/><br/>Who's story is this? The direction of film changes to focus more on Benicio Del Toro who plays Alejandro - a man seeking revenge, but also in some kind of way helping the FBI tracking down a drug kingpin. The focus subtly shifts, yet the character development of Alejandro is never fully revealed, it is merely insinuated through Josh Brolin who plays Matt Graver and the audience is left watching the warpath reactions of Alejandro - who is the type of person who shoots first and ask questions later.<br/><br/>This film, I feel is Oscar worthy, yet I really felt off put by who I thought the protagonist was - and I came to that assessment by how much screen time that character got - meaning Kate Macer received the most screen time. Because of this and the ending of the film, I felt truly conflicted, which is great that a film could garner this result - however, as I've stated before I did not like the main character.<br/><br/>I will probably watch it again, because I feel like this is a film where you can't get all the innuendos and all the motives in one watching, however I will not be adding it to my collection.<br/><br/>Overall I advise that movie fans watch this movie because it is certainly not a cookie cutter approach and invokes deeper introspection when viewing the film in it's entirety."

The movie bears strong performances from all the actors that are in it and has many contrasting character types that make the film a lot more enjoyable to watch, I was particularly impressed with Benicio Del Toro's performance. The movie has a very gritty and dark feel which may be a problem to some viewers because there never was a moment of the film that ever even portrayed a sliver of lightheartedness. The cinematography and the directing style like all of Villeneuve's films is beautiful and crisp and definitely an attractive aspect to the film. However as the movie goes on it seems to almost lose its driving force an seems to drag on without real intensity making the end of the film seem very weak and extended, however the ending was far from poor it just did not feel as impactful as it could have been.

","The movie is a bit long, at two hours, but it is a good movie, so I can let it slide. The acting is very good and the low note music is driving the mood of the film right into your soul. However, that note is the only one you will hear or feel throughout. What actually happens is just cementing the one and only idea of the film, that if you go high enough there is no justice, no morals and that reality is uglier than any of us want to know.<br/><br/>The story follows a character that is supposed to take us through the rabbit hole. As a competent cop, but completely outside the drug related action, she is the unknowing individual who will get her eyes open, thus opening ours. However I found it difficult to empathize with anything she did or said. She came off as a petulant girl, trying to ignore what was happening to her, desperately attempting to feel in control when she had none. That was deliberate, of course, as the movie reveals our own petulant yet powerless stance.<br/><br/>There is nothing else to be said, really. It is a slap in the face for people who still believe in the high ideals of justice for all or in some semblance of power over our lives, but a rather bland film for those who have already accepted there are no rules and they have no control."
"TxMike","Null","0","0","9 January 2016"," A Mexican hit man is a ""sicario."" Drug action on the Texas border.
","This is a tight thriller and all the actors/characters are interesting. A ""sicario"" is Spanish for ""hit man"" and in a fashion the whole movie is about one hit man who is doing it all for himself.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is FBI agent Kate Macer and in the open scene we see her and her team discovering a cache of bodies behind walls, then an explosion as her men open a chamber in the ground. Back in the office she is concerned she may face discipline but instead she is asked if she would be willing to accompany a team searching for tunnels and illegal drug movement across the US-Mexico border.<br/><br/>The whole operation seems mysterious, to us the viewers and to Kate. She isn't told much, she is told to ""observe and learn"", while a larger group gets their orders for a mysterious trek into Juarez to bring back a prisoner. They really only wanted her to be present, as a way to make it legal for them to cross the border. They had no intent that she actually participate.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin as agent Matt Graver is the team leader and he always seems to be too relaxed for what is going on. The real protagonist- antagonist is Benicio Del Toro in a super performance as Alejandro. He had been an attorney in Colombia but one particular Mexican drug lord had killed and beheaded his wife, then killed his daughter, and he was bent on revenge. He became his own personal ""sicario.""<br/><br/>The movie is very well made with a number of tense scenes. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: The group confronts a number of Mexicans who had crossed to get information on where the tunnels were. They set up a nighttime sting and Alejandro held hostage a dirty Mexican police officer, together they tracked down one of the drug lord's men, then forced him to take Alejandro to the man's house, where he systematically killed each guard then confronted the family at dinner. After the drug lord smiled and explained to Alejandro that it had only been ""business"" Alejandro shot each young son and the wife, all at the table, then shot the drug lord. His revenge complete."

","Written by Taylor Sheridan and directed by Canadian Dennis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy), SICARIO is in need of editing and offering some back stories to make it the strong film it is trying to be. The topic of border problems is a prominent one in the media at present and this film does indeed address some of the issues the country is facing.<br/><br/>Strong on action, weak on dialogue the story has been summarized as follows; When drug violence worsens on the USA Mexico border, the FBI sends an idealistic agent, Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) on a mission to eradicate a drug cartel responsible for a bomb that had killed members of her team. To say who is the bad guy(s) and who is the good(s) would ruin the plot, but the characters are well acted by Josh Brolin, Benecio Del Toro, Victor Garber, Daniel Kaluuya, Maximiliano Hernández, Bernardo Saracino, Jon Bernthal and other smaller but significant roles. The surprise is how well Emily Blunt drops her British accent and débutante image and plays a fine FBI agent – hard as nails on the outside and soft on the inside . The films is difficult to watch at times due to some of the gruesome events, but in all it is a worthwhile movie experience."

","Sicario is a well-thought and well-made movie. The plot is not unique nor it is a sophisticated one. The strength of Sicario resides in the way the story is told and how the characters react to it. <br/><br/>It is not an all-out good vs evil war that is waged here, but something more pragmatic, and much more controversial too. The storyline on IMDb will tell you everything you need to know about the storyline, although I would rather recommend you to avoid reading any spoiler or watching any trailer. <br/><br/>The narrative in Sicario is strong, and it is reinforced by the intensity of the main roles (mainly Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro). The photography as well as the score are as effective as they enhance the oppressive feeling created by the events."

","FBI Agent, Kate (Emily Blunt) is asked to join a team to catch Mexican cartel leader Manuel Diaz so that he would lead them to the big cartel boss: Fausto Alarcon. She only agrees to join the team because she wants to find the people who just killed some of her team. Even though she agrees to join the team she is kept in the dark about the team's ultimate mission and who is this mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro)? (do you think he looks a little like Brad Pitt?)<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie we are told that Sicario means Hit-man. Although we are not sure, we do suspect that Alejandro is the Hit-man. (makes sense to me) As we go along we see Kate is always in the dark about what is going on. The leader of this team is Matt (Josh Brolin) who doesn't do things by the book and this disturbs Kate. Later we learn why Kate was allowed to join this team.<br/><br/>For the longest time, the most striking thing I noticed was the haunting music that often sounded like a run-a-way train or a hurricane coming in and gave the impression of impending doom, but it was rhythmical and well done. Kudos. <br/><br/>I suppose the only thing we can come away with is that things are not done by book to keep drugs out of the U.S. Be prepared for some disturbing images and brutality. But then there is the reason Alejandro is on the team. What could it be?<br/><br/>Notables: Victor Garber and Jeffrey Donovan. <br/><br/>This is a well told story. The acting and dialogues are spot on. Emily Blunt's character Kate was incorporated as someone who didn't like going against the Rule of Law. However, our attention was always on Benicio Del Toro as he just commands the screen big time. (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Disturbing images: Yes. Some brutality: Yes.

","While the trailers would have you believe that Sicario is drug war movie, and it is in certain aspects, it runs much deeper than that. We learn early on that the word Sicario means ""hitman"" in Spanish. Quickly after that we are introduced to the main character that Emily Blunt portrays. She's a by-the-book FBI agent who becomes recruited to fight the war on drugs that are passing over the border. Once briefed on her assignment, we are introduced to a slew of characters from all facets. Shady, straight/innocent, morally corrupt etc. From the first op she runs with the agency that recruited her, we quickly realize that everything isn't as it seems. We are left ""in the dark"" as much as her character is through out and it goes from being a seemingly action/thriller to a thriller/mystery in a short period of time. I'm not going to give anymore information away because I think you should see it for yourself. This movie has a lot going for it. Tension, violence, great acting from main and supporting cast and good cinematography. It may take a bit for you to really get into it but once you do, I highly doubt you'll fall out of the zone. Movie run- time was 2-hours, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners) and has already been green-lit for a sequel. While I was keeping it at a rating of 7/10, once the final act started and some questions were answered, I'd have to jump the rating up to a 8.5/10"

","I've been waiting with anticipation for this film for about a year, and let me be honest, it did not disappoint! Sicario, is Canadian director Denis Villneuve's return to storytelling at it absolute best.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the south of the United States, and Mexico, as FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) joins a team of military personnel to cross into the Mexican border town of Juarez, in order to bring down some of the biggest criminals in the Cartels. Benicio Del Toro plays a former Colombian lawyer Alejandro and Josh Brolin joins as CIA spook Matt Graver. I enjoyed watching their characters interact with each-other and particularly found Emily Blunt a sensitive yet determined agent, despite her lack of physical prowess. Well acted all the way through.<br/><br/>What really makes the film a pleasure to watch is how well the story it told through the cinematography and direction of some of the best in Hollywood. In my opinion, Villneuve's Best; 'Prisoners' (2013) was a much more personal story. He takes on a much larger and hugely difficult topic on how the U.S approaches, and deals with the violent drug cartels pushing mostly cocaine and heroin across the U.S/Mexico border. He manages to approach the subject objectively, even though we may not understand the depth of such a difficult problem. I thought the director's style wasn't his usual approach to film making, yet it still has just enough grit and depth of story to make it interesting.<br/><br/>Well acted, and very well told. In my opinion this puts Villneuve in the top echelon of cinema direction.<br/><br/>8/10"

It was like a bad documentary with a very weird structure. It starts with a bang and from there it never escalates, there is no climax. At the end you barely care about what happens.<br/><br/>Characters were never really built and we didn't care about them. There were all bit cliché: the CIA cowboy, the silent avenger that shoots more than he talks, the FBI woman that of course has no life and always follows the rules. <br/><br/>And of course there were plenty of unrealistic/meaningless scenes: <br/><br/>The one with transferring a very important Mexican criminal to USA by crossing the Bridge of Americas and ending up getting stuck in traffic. I was laughing out loud at this scene. I guess CIA can orchestrate a whole convoy of cars and jeopardize the safety of its agents instead of simply using a helicopter (that they use later so they do have one!). <br/><br/>Next, they torture the same criminal on American ground (the same CIA that used to send prisoners for ""interrogation"" everywhere except USA) only to make a plan so they can find a drug lord and very easily kill him by sending one (1) person to his house. John Rambo would be proud.<br/><br/>Not that killing a drug lord is the solution of bringing down the cartels. Cause according to our CIA cowboy's amazing logic, the problem is the demand of drugs and those who use them. Makes you wondering, will they start killing drug users anytime soon? I mean eliminate the demand you eliminate the offer. Right? Right?"

On her ""team"", the mercenaries may be more trustworthy. The people who sent Kate in harm's way, for reasons known only to themselves, may be no different from those who kill at will, and with impunity. In fact they may be worse.<br/><br/>The film, nearly as good as its brilliant and brutal sister - Incendies, reveals the dark underworld and raw truths of the cross- border drug trade. There is profound depth here. Explosions are not merely physically happening on screen, they occur in the characters, in the twists and turns of the story and in shattering the preconceptions of viewers. It is a world where violence knows no distinction between the guilty and the innocent. It is one that will never be stopped by force. It is remarkable that any nation even tries.

Just what sick Hollywood agenda is this supposed to satisfy?), are debriefed, it turns into a job interview for the girl, Macer.

Aside from the guy, Graver, there's an even shadier Latin guy whose name we don't learn for a while. He has some type of flashbacks.<br/><br/>They arrive in El Paso where she thinks the operation will take place. Instead there are sheriffs, marshalls, SEALs, and other operatives. The mission instead will be to drive to Juarez and grab a guy who is in custody there. Off they go and pick up the guy, a relative of the biggest drug lord. As they return over the bottled-up border bridge they spot some suspicious guys and decide to shot these guys up in the middle of the bridge. Macer is outraged, even though she, too, had to kill a guy. And she learns that Graver used her all along for his purposes. <br/><br/>The shady Latin guy gets to have the final off-the books interview with the bad guy. Now the team plans a double operation, to go after the bad guy's finances by interrupting some of his deposits in the US. This will cause him to call his brother to Mexico. They plan on using him to find where the main guy is hiding and plan a distraction by attacking one of the smuggling tunnels. Things go well, and Mercer learns that the Latin guy has her back.

During the operation Mercer learns that the shady Latin guy is again doing violent things off the book. <br/><br/>****Spoilers follow**** <br/><br/>She's outraged and threatens Graver who decides to come clean.

It in a way captures the excitement of those two movies and as with them the fantastic music highlights the tension. Aside from the two pointless Brits, casting is strong. Del Toro, even though he doesn't get to say much steals the show as the menacing yet humane...operative/adviser/whatever his character is. Brolin does a solid job and it's great to see Jeffrey Donovan, basically as Michael Westen back in the fold. <br/><br/>While for a good time it seems this movie is just about presenting a couple of tense operations, eventually a plot develops and ideas are provided. The more provocative idea is that the US government preferred the days when Escobar's cartel was the sole drug organization around the world. Instead now it's all chaos and all it can hope for is a bit of order. The far less original idea is this standard but unrealistic picture of the FBI as the law-abiding entity while the CIA is all full of rogue and dark operatives. Otherwise Sicario is a terrific thriller."
"paul-allaer","9","3","8","6 October 2015"," One of the very best, if also most brutal, movies of the year
","""Sicario"" (2015 release; 112 min.) brings the story of the fight against a (fictional) Mexican drug cartel. As the movie opens, we are informed about the origin of the word sicario (zealots of Jerusalem) and that it is the Mexican term for hit man. Then we are immediately dropped into the action, as we see Kate and the rest of her FBI Special Weapons and Tactic Team overpower the tenants of a house in suburban Phoenix, only to make a gruesome discovery. It's not long before Kate, who wants to bring justice to whoever did that, is recruited to a joint task force with DOD to track down a drug lord in Mexico. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: first, this is the latest movie from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, who previously brought us the outstanding (and Oscar-nominated) film ""Incendies"" a few years ago. Here Villeneuve examines the battle(s) between the Mexican cartels and the US government. Second, as the movie started playing out, when things are quite complex to grasp all that is going on, we find ourselves in good company, as it turns out that the Kate character is equally confused herself. It all becomes clear later on. Third, this is one of the most tense movies I have seen in a long, long time. From the opening scenes, you are clammed up as you're watching what is unfolding, and the amazing thing is that the movie simply DOESN'T LET UP. There are some unbelievable scenes that will have your jaw drop to the floor (no worries, I won't spoil). Fourth, it also must be stated that this movie is unrelenting in its violence and brutality. If that is a potential issue for you (and you know yourself better than anyone), please do not tempt fate. This movie is simply not for the faint of heart, and then some. Fifth, kudos to some outstanding performances, including Emily Blunt (as Kate). Watch her face when she expresses doubts about the legality of what is happening, and her superior tells her ""If you fear you're out of bounds, you're not. The boundary has been moved"", wow. Benicio del Toro is equally top notch as the mysterious adviser to the joint task force. Last but not least, there is a fantastic orchestral score, courtesy of Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson ( who previously gave us the equally delightful score for ""The Theory of Everything""). Bottom line: ""Sicario"" is one of the best movies I have seen this year, and that is saying something, as I see a LOT of movies.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" opened nationwide today and I couldn't wait to go see it. The evening screening where I saw this at in Cincinnati was PACKED, much to my surprise. Guess there still is demand for a top-notch quality movie that doesn't involve comic action heroes. If you can stand the violence and the unrelenting tension, do yourself a favor and go check this out, be it in the theater, or VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Sicario"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Things aren't what they seem as she's kept out of the loop. Brolin's the head of the operation and Del Toro is an associate with a mysterious persona and few, choice words. We're with Blunt all the way, knowing just as little, but feeling just as restless. Some tense scenes make the heart stop. A stand off on the border shows Sicario's peak in tensity. When Blunt's not being shot at, she's collecting thoughts and gathering emotions. Sicario's not just a powerful action film, with stunning performances from its leading trio, it's a thrilling drama as well, hitting the emotions hard and leaving you reeling at the same time."

","Sicario is a brilliant movie with extraordinary cinematography, amazing acting, a fantastic storyline and some impressive set pieces. The aerial shots were just so good especially the ones that showed the convoy of cop-cars moving on the roads in Mexico. The director succeeds in building up the tension needed to fuel a thriller like Sicario. The horror unfolds as the plot thickens and this is why I would like to laud the director, Dennis Villeneuve. His movie will make the audience cringe and keep them entertained at the same time. Very few directors can actually pull this off. He did something similar with Prisoners. But whereas Prisoner's ending was ambiguous and mind-bending, Sicario's ending is extremely idealistic. The ending could have been a lot more brutal but I guess it's absolutely fine because the movie, as a whole, is really enjoyable. Emily Blunt's acting cannot be described in words. She is intense and the audience sees the movie from her character's perspective. She was brilliant as Rita Vratasky in Edge of Tomorrow and she is just as good in Sicario. She plays Kate Macer in this movie. Benicio Del Toro has hardly ever failed to disappoint. He plays the title role in this movie. Sicario means hit-man in Mexico. Benicio Del Toro plays the hit-man with unparalleled swagger and the right amount of shadiness. Josh Brolin plays a shameless cop and he does a great job. All in all, Sicario is a fantastic movie and worth every penny you spend for watching it."

On the flip side, when that rare film comes along that actually exceeds ones reviews-based expectations it's like winning the movie lottery.

","I read somewhere that Emily Blunt's part was originally written for a man. After seeing this film, it's something that doesn't make any sense at all for all the heart and sensibility she brings to the role would not exist. It's not about innocent but of complexity and a driven sense of dedication and commitment that have no place in our world anymore.<br/><br/>She plays a government agent that through her achievements manages to stand out and catch another agency's eyes. Soon, she's asked to volunteer a take part of a task which might satisfy both, her thirst for justice, and the others' needs. Gradually, she discovers she might have made an unwise move, but the option to back out becomes more and more complicated as the case unfolds.<br/><br/>From the ultra violent opening scene to the emotional conclusion, Blunt shows her full potential as a woman who is navigating a truly difficult journey. She's shocked when she ""discovers"" the nature of her involvement, but this doesn't prepare it for the surprises that keep coming her way. Clarisse from ""Silence of the Lambs"" had a relatively easy time because she was facing her own demons and a monster she admire. She has no devotion to any of the people she's chasing or even worse, the rather muddled plan she's become a part of and which she wants to stop at any costs, just to find out she might even lose her life if she continues her way of thinking.<br/><br/>We know from the trailer, she will be facing some despicable people involved in the drug/cartel world. What she doesn't understand is how intertwined good and evil are, and though we know one doesn't exist without the other, the film shows that the lines have become more blurred as we get to learn throughout the film.<br/><br/>Blunt is exceptional as the reactor to the unfolding events, and Del Toro is perfect as the mysterious and devious ""Medellin"". Brolin and the rest of the cast do very nicely in minor roles. There are hints at the private lives of these soldiers, yet it's interesting how the only families we get to see are those who are in the ""bad side"". This is important in the end, as we hear that families are key to the heart of the story, and one of them tries to rationalize that anything done has definitely not a personal angle in this dark business world.<br/><br/>It's not an easy film to watch because people do get hurt, and it's rare to see any goodness at all. Children aren't shielded from evil, and they're damaged goods no matter which side they belong to. Look at the last scene. Still, there's good in here, and Blunt is part of the little there is, but it's her counterpart that surprises us the most because even in this world of darkness there's a little bit of hope among the wolves for a little lost lamb."

"punishable-by-death","9","3","8","22 September 2015"," Riveting action thriller with a unbiased political twist
","Dennis Villeneuve seems to really be hitting his stride. With Sicario, the level of tension is cranked to 11, building on the tense atmosphere that defined his effort 'Prisoners' while adding some action and political commentary to spice things up. <br/><br/>While the story is simple enough, as it unfolds the film is subtly commenting on the US-led War on Drugs, and not only its ineffectiveness, but what it can (and has) done to other countries caught in the crossfire. This is made especially clear in the final scenes. Sicario also must be commended for shining a light so intensely on what is in reality an ugly situation. None of us really know the true influence of their neighbours to the north over their country, but there is no doubt that Mexico is a violent place. In my humble opinion, leading a 'war' on drugs simply leads to more criminal activity – and this is certainly evident in the way Mexican Drug Cartels operate. Despite all this, this is not primarily a political film – it doesn't have an agenda. No sides are being taken here.<br/><br/>This lack of bias affects the action in a positive way, as Sicario does not shy away from the often gruesome nature of what goes on in these situations, and doesn't attempt to place any political blame on anyone. The action simply continues to move.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but effective. Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is a dedicated and loyal police officer. But at the start of the film her team stumble into a house whose walls are literally filled with rotting corpses; murders that are related to the actions of the Mexican cartel.<br/><br/>If this film has a weak spot it is Blunt's character – she doesn't really progress from the green, idealistic officer that she is at the start of the film. Following the discovery of this house, she is offered a change of job – a chance to really make a difference. She is hesitant but is always motivated by what she thinks is right and accepts the new assignment.<br/><br/>She is the moral compass of a movie that is filled with immoral behaviour, and despite the lack of development for her character, she does an excellent job.<br/><br/>The new unit Kate begins to work for don't treat her seriously because of these idealistic attitudes and her 'rookie' status. The unit features a hilarious Josh Brolin as Matt, a mysterious man whose employer is never made clear, and who also is a man who often makes inappropriate comments given the context, causing me to laugh in a very similar way to the way violent Coen films make me giggle. <br/><br/>But if we are talking about mysterious characters, we can't ignore a supremely intense turn by Benicio Del Toro – off the top of my head I can only think of 'Fear and Loathing' as a film where he played such an intense role and was so immersed in his character.<br/><br/>He is known simply as Alejandro, and if the motives of Matt are shrouded in clouds, those of Alejandro are buried. It is this mystery that makes much of the movie a guessing game, as we try to pinpoint each characters' true intentions. All we know is that their operation has something to do with the southern US border and the Mexican Drug Cartels that seem to operate on both sides.<br/><br/>After 'Prisoners', which suffered from a slightly overlong screenplay, Villeneuve has tightened the screws and has created a well-paced film, in fact the pacing feels perfect. When watching this film you get a sense that those behind the scenes really knew what they are doing. <br/><br/>The cinematography is also something worth mentioning: thanks to DOP Richard Deakins, we are treated to many beautiful aerial shots of Mexico, as well as shots of the massive slums of the city, as if to hammer home the point of how many people this violence affects. I lost count of the different camera techniques that were used, with a lot of odd framing used, while there are other sections where the camera zooms in past the point of pixelation. Each scene, each shot feels purposeful. It may be a 2-hour movie but it flies by and it doesn't feel like a single shot was wasted. At one point we see what the agents are seeing: night-vision and thermal imaging devices dominate a couple of scenes and create an incredibly immersive experience that again ramps up that tension. <br/><br/>The sound-editing/soundtrack here is also something that needs to be mentioned, as the work done is some of the best I have ever heard accompanying a film, period. Deafening silence dominates tense conversations where often barely a word is uttered as we wait on each word; while at other times the soundtrack booms and sounds truly dread-inducing, thanks to the work of Jóhann Jóhannsson, who also worked on 'Prisoners'<br/><br/>The sound of gunfire sounded incredible also – there are a few violent set-pieces and they are executed as well as I have ever seen for a film of this nature. This movie doesn't mess around.<br/><br/>Sicario is definitely one of the best so far this year. Go see it now!!<br/><br/>www.epilepticmoondancer.net"
"JacksonDonovan","8","3","8","22 September 2015"," A great, solid, crime drama.
","Sicario is the best film I've seen in theaters in 2015 thus far. Dennis Villeneuve returns once again with a complex, solid drama. <br/><br/>This film calls upon a delicate balance between mainstream and art- house cinema, and is sure to hit a sweet spot with fans of either style. Benecio Del Toro knocks it out of the park with a dark performance that is striking in it's understated power. Emily Blunt proves solid as our lead character, who manages to give a fine performance despite having a slightly underdeveloped character. Josh Brolin proves himself great as always too, giving a charismatically unsettling performance. <br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is gorgeous with Roger Deakins doing an (as per usual) fantastic job, particularly with his use of lighting in the nighttime scenes of the film. The soundtrack, by composer Jóhann Jóhannsson works well as the glue holding the film together, with perhaps his most haunting soundtrack to date. It cannot be understated, the soundtrack for this film is superb.<br/><br/>This is a dark film, with an incredibly consistent tone which successfully evokes unease; haunting in it's elusiveness. Dennis Villeneuve has put forth yet another great film for us all to enjoy.<br/><br/>8/10."
"shaneongley","10","3","8","17 September 2015"," Sicario (2015) - Review
","Well, this is my favourite film of the year so far.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, more than that, I think Denis Villeneuve is becoming one of my favourite directors. I absolutely loved Prisoners and while Enemy was a bit too crazy for me it was still a masterfully made and very unique film. This film is maybe slightly below Prisoners in terms of quality but only very slightly.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is really proving herself to be very versatile these days, she was awesome in Edge of Tomorrow but she plays a different kind of badass here. She's the idealistic one, pulled into some really dirty stuff and the she gives the best performance of her career so far. Both Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Torro play great characters, you are never sure where you stand with them, you're never sure what they are going to do next which creates a great sense of unease a lot of the time.<br/><br/>Speaking of unease, I feel like the highest compliment I can give a film is that it makes you feel something, be it sadness, happiness or in this case, extreme anxiousness. Villeneuve has some extreme skill at building tension, he did this in Prisoners too. There are some scenes in this that had me almost feeling sick I was so nervous, he drags these scenes out for just the right amount of time to build the tension and they never get boring.<br/><br/>The plot, while maybe slightly familiar was really good, it kept me guessing and while this is by no means an action film, when action was utilized it was really well done. Both the way the action was filmed and the sound design gave it a really gritty and intense feel, loved it.<br/><br/>Another masterful effort from one of the best filmmakers around today and my favourite film of the year so far, highly recommended."

"jbroc62","9","3","9","28 September 2015"," ""In Mexico, Sicario means hit-man.""
","Sicario is one of the darkest experiences I've had with a film since watching Se7en for the first time. However, this is also one of the best directed films of the entire year with outstanding performances from its main cast, as well as lush cinematography throughout its two hour runtime.<br/><br/>This film was directed by Denis Villeneuve, the director of one of my top five favorite films of 2013, Prisoners. With Prisoners, Villeneuve proved how skillful he was with creating suspense through his direction. Here in Sicario, he solidifies himself as a master of tension. The film has an excellent buildup where scene-after-scene the film gets better, gets more suspenseful the longer the film runs. <br/><br/>One thing that struck me about the way Sicario looked was that nighttime actually looked like it was nighttime. Something very common with films is that there's always weird lighting on actor's faces whenever a nighttime shot is being filmed. In this movie though, I never thought that a single time. And that just shows how brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins as director of photography. I don't know how he did it, but it its absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is spectacular as an idealistic FBI agent who is recruited to pursue the leader of a major cartel in Mexico. This is the best work I've seen from her. We experience the film from her perspective, and the shock and bewilderment we see her experience, from the environment she's in, to certain things that take place, is where the emotional core of the film sits with the viewer. Josh Brolin does great work as an extremely likable agent who likes to relax, maybe doesn't always play by the rules, but is very good at his job. However, Benicio Del Toro is the best part about this movie. I'm not going to say much about his character, but I will say that he is truly Oscar-worthy in this film, and his performance is absolutely magnetic.<br/><br/>Like Se7en, there is no hope to be found in Sicario. Everywhere you see these characters go, you're disgusted and haunted by what you see. Like the unknown land these characters cross into, you have no idea where the border is between right or wrong, black or white. Instead, everything falls into the gray area, and as a result, there are no limits on what these characters will do, and that is scary.<br/><br/>Sicario has some of the best performances of the year, incredible cinematography, and, in my opinion, shows that Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors working today, and now I can't wait for Blade Runner 2. This film goes into wide release this Friday, so go see it, because it's among the best films of the year so far."
"Troy_Campbell","10","3","9","25 September 2015"," Enthralling, tense and immersive. A masterpiece.
","Federal authorities carefully and silently approach a suburban home in Phoenix. They raid the house looking for a hostage; instead they find dozens of dead bodies packed inside the walls. This is Mexican drug cartel business, and it has now crept well over the border. Opening with this superbly crafted sequence, Sicario is an unrelenting portrayal of the seemingly unwinnable war against drugs and, more crucially, the ruthless cartel bosses who will do anything to strike fear in the people. Emily Blunt's FBI agent is our eyes and ears into this world, as she's pulled into a legally and morally cloudy task force supposedly given free reign to strike off the snake's head by any means necessary. Blunt is amazing, striking the perfect balance between the-way-it-ought-to-be idealism and the-way-it-actually-is practicality; never completely giving away which side she'll ultimately land. It's a ferociously gripping and uncompromisingly bleak story, as written by Taylor Sheridan, with Denis Villeneuve's direction raising the stakes even higher through taut, immersive and potent set pieces. There are at least three high-stakes sequences that are utterly exhilarating thanks to Villeneuve's unique vision and Roger Deakins' remarkable cinematography, yet the quieter moments are equally powerful due to a trio of scintillating performances. Along with Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro command the screen, the former as a charismatic but shady federal agent with a deep conviction, the latter as a mysterious ""contractor"" who is riddled with torment and anger. Sicario is a psychologically bruising film that offers no easy answers; it's also tense, enthralling and, quite simply, a masterpiece."

What is wrong with this? The guys watching TV have no problem with the smell of decaying corpses. The swatters don't smell anything until they start opening the walls. The corpses stand upright without any visible support (rigor mortis is very temporary). The walls are being prepared for painting. Did they think no one would notice how thick the walls would have to be to enclose dead bodies?"

","Yes there is much eye candy on show here with beautiful landscapes in between some nasty nasty men doing baaaad things to themselves and each other. Some kind of government people come along and talk amongst themselves then go and have a look but remember to bring along some heavies with guns just in case. Not only that their cars have really good suspension so bumps don't matter to their teeth or tools. Once they have had a good look around they go back to queue jumping... oh I missed a bit as they get to use the fancy firearms on some underwhelming locals for some reason. Meanwhile, a girl cop hides on the back seat looking bewildered but never mind the nice beefy men gather round to show how tough they are and she doesn't have to do anything.. then some other things happen involved underground shenanigans and bad stuff like drugs they shouldn't be having. Along the way there is some swearing and sweating maybe a little grunting but not really enough to fill 120 minutes of our time and attention.

","This movie starts off ridiculous. First of all, the title. Somebody probably learned a new Spanish word and thought it would be cool to use it as the title of a movie. The only problem is that this movie does not involve a sicario. There's no sicario in this movie. A sicario is a hit man. It's that simple. You pay someone money, and then they kill someone for you.<br/><br/>This movie is about a lawyer who is seeking revenge against a drug dealer for the murder of his family. He doesn't hire a hit man. He does it himself.<br/><br/>This is your typical tough guy/gal movie. Middle class people who attended schools for the performing arts dress up in flak jackets and pretend to shoot weapons. It's like watching little boys play cops and robbers.<br/><br/>A Big Yawner"
"themaxmagnus","2","2","5","18 September 2016"," What a waste
","Good and sometimes excellent acting, wonderful cinematography and yet, the result is a disappointment. This is what boring storytelling can do to a movie. No characters complexity whatsoever, the moral dilemma of the so called ""idealistic agent"" is never developed, the tough guy is tough and the dangerous mysterious man is, well, very mysterious. And very dangerous. No dialogues worth remembering. Zero surprises. Visuals are so great that made me watch this thing for two hours, tough; I would have left it after page 1, if this was a book. I really don't get why this movie received so many praises. To me, this is just another obvious, slow, violent movie that I'll completely forget in a few weeks."
"secretzfan","5","2","5","15 February 2016"," So much hype but was let down
","I don't know what it was about this film. but it just didn't work for me at all. The story wasn't that engaging and despite some great performances I wasn't brought in. The movie has a strange start as it tries to pull you right on into the action, but it just ends up feeling confusing and just leaves to viewers lost. Not to mention that the cinematography while great for the war scenes doesn't do much for those character moments at all. <br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve also did Prisoners, and while a beloved film by many it is also lacking and gets hate from those who love it. This director needs to learn how to balance emotional moments with good plot development without making the film feel dull and boring. Sicario just isn't a very interesting and enjoyable film. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt actually gives a pretty bad performance in my opinion. Instead of giving facial expressions of power and strength they feel more lost and diluted. <br/><br/>That being said Benicio Del Toro kills it with this film. Giving a far superior performance, and having a lot more better character arc as well that feels powerful as well. <br/><br/>Overall Sicario is not a film I would recommend for people to see. The whole film lacks emotions and strength making it a pretty weak overall film."

Don't watch it people its a serious waste of time. Better watch a documentary about Sonora desert and not spend time with such a movie a 12 year kid could write.

","Movie Love! #Sicario<br/><br/>On Sunday the 11th of October 2015 at 11.55 AMC cinema Manchester I embarked on what was to be an epic and intense journey. That journey was called Sicario!<br/><br/>Sicario staring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and the immense Benicio Del Toro has easily made it into my top 10 films since the start of 2000. <br/><br/>There are so many reasons why i think this but I refuse to name them all as i lack the imagination and English skills to do them any justice. But what I will say is from the Acting (everyone) stunning cinematography, musical score that builds the tension so much I could almost hear my arse tightening up! And also the plot and brutal story of the Mexican cartel gang world that just grips you by the throat, squeezes every ounce of air from your body and occasionally lets you breath gasps of air once each scene ends. <br/><br/>This film was very much like my sex life, lasted around the 2 hour mark and yet felt like I had sat down, BLINKED, then I was told to leave. But with a great feeling that I have just been involved in something epic yet brutal.<br/><br/>Ps. Even after seeing mutilated bodies, drug lords and corrupt police officers I still want to visit Mexico and eat there food.<br/><br/>10/10 as intense as being blue balled, says ***the_beauman***"
"wisaacnetherton","7","2","5","2 October 2015"," The Boundary Has Been Adjusted
","""Waaaah why can't it be from the cool tough guy's point of view""<br/><br/>If this had been told from Alejandro's point of view the mystery and moral ambiguity that drives his character's role in the story would be gone. His story, at least from his perspective, is quite simple. It is a revenge story. Even if we hadn't already seen the ""this person is going to get revenge but oooooh maybe revenge isn't all that healthy mmmmk bye now"" tale already told many times before, having Alejandro be the protagonist would be sacrificing the much more layered and beautifully uncompromising questions that this film raises for the viewer that isn't scared to ignore them. Alejandro is the protagonist for one single sequence in this movie, and that sequence reveals everything about him that we need to know after our perception of him has been built up and warped gradually up to that pivotal point.<br/><br/>Alejandro exists as the bridge between the two different takes on ethics this film presents with the characters of Kate and Matt. Want to find out which side you ultimately agree with? That is why Alejandro's true nature is revealed so slowly. I found myself agreeing with Matt in his view of compromising by-the-book methods for the greater good, at the very least when there's no other choice. However by the end of the film, I ended up mirroring Kate's mentality much more. Alejandro himself of course is more about priorities than ethics, and he is very sure about his priorities. Where Training Day presents a similar unraveling, this film doesn't compromise the difficulty of the protagonist's position by giving them lucky circumstances to provide an easy answer in the end. On the contrary, this makes Zero Dark Thirty look like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.<br/><br/>""Waaaah Kate doesn't do anything and it's slow and nothing happens""<br/><br/>Tipping the action/non-action ratio of this film in the action direction would not only ruin the film's marvelously well-crafted structure, but also its merciless atmosphere. Kate could be kicking ass every five seconds but that wouldn't mean she's actually ""doing anything"" any more than her having little to no participation in the action after the first sequence means that she's not doing anything. You see there's this element of most sentient life that isn't physical, but is in fact referred to as ""mental"", and sometimes, just sometimes, that's where the action is happening. It is quite slow however, and the final scene even echoes Antonioni. Wait, why does ""slow"" have a negative connotation again?<br/><br/>Take lessons, other movies. Seize your opportunities.<br/><br/>This film has two nightmares in it. The first is Alejandro's on the jet. We hear the end of it rather vividly but we don't see it; only him waking up in horror, before quickly putting his mask back on. The second is Kate's...awake, at the bar. This is her first attempt at relaxing since the day began so naturally the memories of what she has just seen are going to try and stop her. Again we just get the audio of her horror and this time it's quieter and much less distinguishable from the natural background noise, which provides a beautiful subtle contrast to Kate's breaking soul and Alejandro's broken soul. Another example is when Kate and Alejandro pass under the bridge and witness bodies hanging from it. Alejandro's ""Welcome to Juarez"" line precedes this traumatic image rather than following it, a move which elevates both the line and the image. And as soon as the bodies are out of Kate's sight, the stark silence quickly fades out as she returns to reality enough to hear the noises of the moving vehicle. This is the kind of editing that separates great films from shallow films.<br/><br/>You can say you dislike this, but you're kidding yourself if you think it's a bad film. This is the uncompromising execution of cinema that stays with you well after you've finished watching it, provided you're not too sore that its advertising tricked you into thinking it was just another movie for you to forget about and defecate like a happy meal."

","I can't be bothered to write detailed long reviews anymore (not in English at least, it's not my first language) since I don't have the time and or interest in writing them. But I like to blurt out stuff so here we go.<br/><br/>I had waited for the movie a long time and it didn't disappoint. I liked pretty much everything in the movie. The acting, the direction, the suspense, the score, the visuals. The plot was not as amazing as the rest of the movie, but it was good.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro were both amazing in the movie. Josh Brolin was good as well. I don't like Jon Bernthal, but he played a role that really suited him and he was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Directing and cinematography were great. The movie had a lot of great visuals. Sometimes it felt like I was watching a documentary about Mexican/Texan landscape, but I didn't mind that. It was great. It was something different. The direction really mixed well with the score. The score goes up and down and creates great tension and suspense.<br/><br/>I'm gonna say that this is my favorite movie of the year.<br/><br/>I have never seen a movie by Denis Villeneuve before. I will most likely check out his previous work."

"RforFilm","3","3","10","13 October 2015"," Though it's look at the Mexican Drug War is gritty, Sicario feels like a lot of other political force stories I heard before
","Mexico is having a bit of an identity crisis in recent years. It may be been hidden from me when I was still a child, I still recall when I saw the ""South of the Boarder"" country as a place people go to on vacation. My parents had taken several trips and I finally went on a cruise in 1997. The countryside and the beaches were beautiful, though I thought the cities looked liked the result of an outhouse taking control of a metropolis. It was sometime in middle school that I started to see the place as an almost third world that produced drugs.<br/><br/>The Mexican Drug War has become a nightly ritual on the news as we hear more reports about the cartels bringing their business over the boarder, how they may be helping with the smuggling of illegal immigrants and how they may even have ties with the Mexican government. It is becoming a serious issue that I still think the U.S. is not taking more control on. The big concern is that with the further influx of immigrants, more drug people are making their way to the states. Emily Blunt joins a group to take on a threatening cartel in Sicario.<br/><br/>An FBI agent Katie Macer (played by Emily Blunt) is with a group of other agents during a kidnapping raid in Arizona where they find many dead bodies in the walls and a bomb in the shed that kills two officers. Her actions lead her to be recommended to CIA agent Matt Graver (played by Josh Brolin) to join his team that are searching for a cartel boss that was connected to the house. She accepts, excited that she can finally make a difference on the drug war. <br/><br/>Her first trip takes her to El Paso where they meet up with Matt's partner, Alejandro Gillick (played by Benicio Del Toro) and find out that they will be going over the boarder to Juárez to extract a prisoner. Despite a bloody gun battle with a cartel interception, they take Guillermo, one of the cartel's top men for questioning. Katie, while impressed with how much information she's getting, is shocked by the CIA's lack of concern for the citizens of Mexico. They find out of a tunnel that's been a major use for illegal immigrants and drugs. Katies also learns about Alejandro's shady past with the cartels and that the CIA is actually going after a major drug lord.<br/><br/>Sicario is a movie that I was excited for. I knew that I was going to get a dark movie and got plenty of action, yet I felt board while watching it. The first half with Emily Blunt learning to ropes of the CIA and going into Mexico were thrilling while the second half that belonged to Benicio Del Toro and his confrontation with the drug cartel moved at such a slow pace that I almost felt like that I was in school and not watching a movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro give off some good performances and I wanted to see them serve some justice, but the story felt very familiar. Part of that has to do that the film feels structured in a similar format to Zero Dark Thirty. The big difference is then ending. While Zero Dark Thirty paid off with the government's hard work, Sicario's result felt more empty and bleak, like that no matter how much you care about making a difference, the real world only proves that it's unlikely. I know that film was trying to be realistic, but I found it too unpleasant to fully recommend.<br/><br/>I'll give this three tunnels into the U.S. out of ten. I wish I could say that Sicario was a favorite of mine like the rest of the critics, but I honestly don't see why their phrasing it as unique and original. It's just as gritty and black as a lot of other political force thrillers. I can also see Sicario getting lost within the mix, but I can understand that people may find the action satisfying and even new. I'd say that this film defiantly portrays the Mexican Drug War actually; I just didn't enjoy going in this deep."

She becomes disturbed by the way the task force, especially the mysterious Alejando (Benicio del Toro), appears to ignore established law enforcement protocols.<br/><br/>This film is brilliantly directed (by Denis Villeneuve) with eyecatching cinematography (by Roger Deakins), and the action setpieces are strikingly well staged, with some stunning aerial photography. That element of this film is flawless.<br/><br/>Then there is the intertwined plot thread about Kate's moral ambivalence towards what this group is engaged in. I understand that this is an important part of the film – it may even be the entire point of the film – but I found it tiresome. Specifically, I found Kate's character profoundly irritating. She was told on a number of occasions, ""If you don't like what we do and the way we do it, you don't have to be here,"" yet she continued to be part of the team while, at the same time, constantly questioning, arguing, disagreeing and undermining her teammates. I had a great deal of trouble getting past that and, for me, it made the film a less enjoyable experience than it would otherwise have been.<br/><br/>I guess I am simply too superficial to appreciate something for the morally ambiguous subtext it presents me with."

","Oh my god. <br/><br/>There is literally no better explanation for my reaction as I left the theater. (And I'm not one to throw around the term ""literally."") Not only was I amazed by the portrayals of Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), and Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), but the plot of this film completely captivated me. I actually found myself wanting the film to continue on for hours.<br/><br/>I have high hopes for this film winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Benicio Del Toro, who was absolutely breathtaking. Also, I would really like for Emily Blunt to win the Oscar for Best Actress, although I know that is not as likely with films such as Carol, Freeheld, and Joy coming out - all with extremely talented actresses as their leads.<br/><br/>The first scene in this film, without giving anything away, was probably the most intense and well-shot scene I have ever had the pleasure to watch - and yet, it is not the most intense or best scene in the movie. During every moment I was waiting for something to happen, whether it be good or bad. One thing I especially loved about this film is that it is so realistic in its portrayal of the violence that takes place on the Mexican border; it isn't overly graphic or gory, but it does seem frighteningly blunt. (No pun intended :P)<br/><br/>Along with having magnificent performances and an intriguing plot, this film also has a very important message that many US citizens would benefit from knowing. The issues with the drug war on the Mexican border are very real, and this movie does a very good job of bringing those problems to light. Before I saw this film, I had almost no knowledge on this subject, but now I feel well aware. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film for anyone who is allowed to see R-Rated movies (I myself am only 13, so my parents barely let me watch it...) because even if you are not a huge fan of thrillers or suspense, I believe this film may be so phenomenal that you would change your whole perception of what it takes to make a solid, impressive movie."
"azanti0029","10","2","6","31 October 2015"," So far for me, the film of the year!
","There are some films you just watch from beginning to end, completely enthralled when in the cinema, glued to your seat by a mixture of powerful performances, a gripping story and stand out photography. Sicario is one of those films. I saw this with my partner and they agreed wholeheartedly, this was a stand out movie from start to finish and will be making its way to my Blu-Ray collection as soon as available. Emily Blunt gives a solid performance as the lead, here she plays an idealistic FBI agent who wants to make a difference and is given the chance to do so against the Mexican drug cartels and their hit men, but just how far are you prepared to bend the law before you break it and become like them? <br/><br/>While I cannot claim to be an expect on the Mexican Cartel drug trade or the complexities which must surround American attempts to police and control it I felt like we got pretty close to the truth with it here. No one is quite who they seem and every character has their own agenda to the end. One of the nice things about the film is the minimum use of dialogue. The actors really have room to breathe here in their performances and are well complimented by the haunting photography of Roger Deakins who does a visceral job of bringing the landscape of this world to life, with its brutal soaring heat combined with the darker and more shady tones. There's no weak links in the cast here, the stand out performance is Benicio Del Torro who conveys amazing menace with his character 'This is the land of wolves now'. Josh Brolin proves that his career has now soared above and beyond his own fathers with another assured performance as the Government Agent who is quite happy to use whatever tools he has to in order to achieve his objectives. <br/><br/>While one might find plot holes if you really look I found this drama swept me completely away and was totally engaging. It is the kind of film I love to see on the big screen and gladly pay my money to the studios for. More like this please. A credit to everyone who worked on the film. Superb film making."

"KristianZacc","9","2","6","2 October 2015"," Extremely well made crime thriller by Villeneuve
","Minor/Vague Spoilers<br/><br/>Sicario is an American crime thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve about an idealistic FBI agent, Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt, who is enlisted by a government official to help a joint task force to take down a Mexican drug cartel. I was intrigued by the premise and after the buzz it was getting from the 2015 Cannes Film Festival I was excited to see this after it was finally released in Australia.<br/><br/>When I was aware that Villeneuve was the director of this film I was excited just from looking at his track record, his previous two films ""Prisoner"" and ""Enemy"" both being top 10 movies of their respective year, for me.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is amazing and effectively shows you the scope and brings you into the world that Villeneuve is trying to portray. Some of the shots would stay still for a few moments and I was on the edge of my seat even when close to nothing was happening I still felt like something might any second. The colours, yellow and orange, are very prominent which gives you the feel of the landscape being in a desert area.<br/><br/>The performances across the board were as close to perfect as you could get. The main protagonist Kate, is who we see the film through their eyes, so to speak, and when she first arrives and is being driven through Mexico we see the world and how shocking it is and we feel the same way she does. Emily Blunt is amazing, playing another heroine after her role in Edge of Tomorrow, she brings a lot of different sides to her character, both having just enough vulnerability and strength to make her relatable as a main character that the audience can root for. Josh Brolin, in my opinion, had his best performance since No Country for Old Men, playing Matt Graver, one of the people who recruit Kate. Alejandro, portrayed by Benicio Del Toro, is the star of this movie. Even though his character has a lot of blank stares and seems to remain extremely calm throughout the entire movie, his true emotions may be suppressed because of something that happened before the film. The three main stars mix well together and no one stands out for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Even some of the smaller side characters Victor Garber, Jon Bernthal, and Jeffrey Donovan bring something to the film and have great performances. Villeneuve certainly brings out the best in these smaller characters that certainly have an impact on the three main characters that create a nice through line throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Tonally, this is a very dark film and there isn't very many light moments, almost ever, even when it may look like there could be, it switches and goes straight back to the dark world we have become so used to. You are set up from the opening scene to know what kind of movie this will be. Maybe it speaks to some twisted person deep within me but I really enjoyed this aspect and how they never let up because that just made it seem even more real. Some of my favourite moments were when there were these tense, suspenseful moments that had no music behind them to try and enhance those scenes because it wasn't needed at all. These made me more invested in the film and made me highly anticipate what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>When the movie ended I was in awe and absolutely loved what I had just seen. Everything was strung together to create an almost perfect film and I really hope this gets a nomination because it definitely deserves it and I'm really looking forward to the next movie Villeneuve directs."
"baehr_adam","10","2","6","1 October 2015"," True Crime Juarez Style!!!!!
","OMFG. I can't emphasize enough in this review how much I absolutely loved this movie. I just finished watching this movie at 10pm and I had to get this review out ASAP. I will start with the story which is cliché but it's also indomitably told in real time. I know a handful of movies that use flashbacks to tell the story but this one doesn't and I enjoy that fact. I will say this much about the story that it's about an FBI agent tasked with helping a non-disclosed agency take down a Cartel. I will now move onto the acting which brought there A-Game for sure. The cast is incredibly strong with Emily Blunt,Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro being the main three characters. They are all fascinating but Del Toro in my opinion blows the movie out of the water with his character. They all have fantastic rapport. I will now move onto the action which while this isn't a Michael Bay movie the scenes that do take place are on point with excruciating detail that it boarders realism. The scenes are violent and bloody and are meant to invoke a certain feeling of awe and dread simultaneously. I must also talk about the cinematography which was done by Roger Deakins who is a mastermind when it comes to the angles and etc of the film and it's absolutely Phenomenal in every aspect and it brings the movie to life and the sounds of everything in the movie from the gunfire to the city aspect will leave you transfixed onto the screen. The banter between the characters including the Delta Force Operators is impeccably done. The director Denis Villeneuve was terrific and I applaud him for such a powerhouse of a motion picture. I will finish by saying this is my new favorite movie of 2015 which prior was ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" but this takes the whole bakery. I would recommend watching this movie without a doubt. A Masterpiece rapped in a bow."
"brendandevere","9","2","6","25 September 2015"," A Hit.........man!
","I was looking forward to this film. When I first saw the unusual title leap out at me, I knew that curiosity would get the better of my inquisitive mind. A brief research into 'Sicario' revealed the true meaning of the word, a smile grew across my face and the date of its release would be forever etched into my brain. In Mexico 'Sicario' is the name given to a hit-man but the true origins of the word go back two thousand years when the Roman's occupied Israel. Sicario was a term given to the hunters that tracked down Roman soldiers as their prey, and with this knowledge my excitement was only fueled at the anticipation of what this film would have install.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed, as from the very first scene, the violent world of drug cartels, FBI agents, death and destruction graced the screen leaving my eyes hooked onto the thrilling story that was unraveling before my eyes. Denis Villeneuve has reintroduced me to a genre that always grabs my attention and he has done it in a way that gives the audience an authentic depiction of life where drug cartels are the only reality for many people living in the border communities of Mexico. As the film simmers through the early scenes, building up tension, you begin to realise that nobody is who they say they are and not everything is what it seems to be. For those that remember Steven Soderberg's 'Traffic', this is very much in the same mould, but, whereas 'Traffic' looked at the drug trade on a larger scale, this story is much more personal when dealing with the narrative and its characters.<br/><br/>The audience is immediately thrust into an FBI operation lead by the tough but idealistic Kate Macer (Emily Blunt). After a brief but intense shootout, the agents realise that they have stumbled upon something much larger than they can handle. With the grim discovery still burning through her veins, Kate is introduced to Matt (Josh Brolin), a man that seems to work by a code that she does not fully understand. On the promise that real justice will be done Kate agrees to join Matt in a Task Force that sees them cross the border into Mexico. Accompanying them is a mysterious character going by the name of Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), who says very little about his involvement but delivers big when needed to. Kate's suspicions grow as the Task Force goes deeper into dangerous territory but she finds herself compelled to find out the truth even if it costs her life.<br/><br/>Villeneuve has recruited the very best talent to drive Taylor Sheridan's story with Emily Blunt holding her own in a world full of men that believe her presence is not in the best interests of the operation. She gives the story the opposition it needs. Her idealistic, righteous stance provides outstanding drama against the secretive and questionable constitution that Matt lives by. Josh Brolin adds the grit that the film strives for but Del Toro's performance is what gives the movie its thrilling underworld edge. He won the Oscar for his role in 'Traffic' and could get a nomination here as we watch the focus of the story move towards his characters clouded background. We are also treated to a memorably eerie score that compliments the essence of the film, keeping the audience suspended on the edge of their seats, knowing that something brilliant is about to happen.<br/><br/>I want to give 'Sicario' full marks but I was left a little deflated by its conclusion as if it didn't really have a purpose but perhaps this is what Villeneuve is trying to bring out in his film."
"zetes","9","2","6","27 September 2015"," Fantastic suspense
","A tale of the dirty, dirty drug war taking place between the border of Mexico and the US. Emily Blunt plays the audience surrogate, an FBI agent who, after stumbling upon a horrifying scene of cartel violence in suburban Phoenix, is recruited by a mysterious, obviously important government figure (Josh Brolin) to help him get the top people who are really responsible for the crime, which is just one of many similar crimes that are encroaching further and further into ""civilized"" territories. Even if you end up finding the story a little too vague (I didn't, but I could easily imagine someone thinking that), you have to admit it's one of the most suspenseful films to come out in quite some time. The whole entrance into and exit from Juarez near the beginning of the film is a master class in creating anxiety. It's more terrifying than the vast majority of horror films. And that's just one sequence among several great set pieces. I do have some slight problems/questions about how Blunt fits into the whole picture. In the end, I'm not sure it makes a whole lot of sense. I also think she comes off as a tad too naive. She's an FBI agent, not a small town police officer. I like her performance, but it may be a little too one-note to qualify as great. She is understandably in shock for most of the film, and the script has to resort to the old ""I picked the wrong week to quit smoking!"" shtick to have her emote. The best performance by far comes from Benicio del Toro, who plays Brolin's ""advisor"" who clearly has way more going on behind his shadowy mien. Any flaws are minor, though, and could perhaps be cleared up by a second viewing. This is most definitely a great picture."
"auxjohn","9","2","6","25 September 2015"," It Captivates You With Everything.
","Sicario, a film directed by Denis Villeneuve, starring Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin. <br/><br/>First of all let me start by saying that Villeneuve is an amazing director, he made Prisoners and Enemy. Two extremely well done films, perfect I might even say. Both of them had beautiful cinematography, music and tone, followed by some amazing performances. And this film, is the same as both of Villeneuve's last one.<br/><br/>Everything in this film works so well and it makes you wonder why Emily Blunt hasn't won an Oscar. Her performance is great in this film, showing the human side of the story, and not only that, but she also represents the audience. When something gross happens, she's grossed out and so are we. <br/><br/>For me, the best part of this film is the music and the cinematography and how the blended together, making the perfect tone of the film. Every shot in this film is beautiful and with the music by its side, it puts you inside the movie, making you feel like if you were in Mexico, next to Blunt and Del Toro. <br/><br/>I really recommend you to see this film, you'll enjoy it, especially if you like Villeneuve's previous work."

","Featuring tough-as-nails C.I.A. agents freelancing in the drugs trade, 'Sicaro' follows a fairly well-worn path. Nonetheless, I quite enjoyed it's first half, with its disorienting but realistic feel. Further on, however, the plot goes downhill, starting with a hook-up that goes implausibly wrong, and ending with a deeply unconvincing conclusion. In between, the movie swaps protagonists, and abandons Emily Blunt's heroine to show the vigilante-style antics of another character, even though until this point the central mystery of the film was that she (but also us, the viewers) didn't know what to make of him. The film's final scene affects to show real concern for those who live in northern Mexico under the rule of the drugs barons; unfortunately, there's a B-movie not too far behind this superficially serious portrait of their reign."

","Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya delivered the most boring, uninterested delivery I have ever seen in a movie as theatrical as Sicario.<br/><br/>Beautifully crafted set pieces throughout the movie keep the tension at a steady level where you always need to be on your toes as an audience member. You never knew what Del Toro and Brolin were planning.<br/><br/>Brolin and Del Toros characters were completely captivating throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Then Emily and Daniel show up to kill the mood.<br/><br/>First, Emily Blunt was done a humongous disservice by this film. Her character is quite literally *walk here, complain, get owned*<br/><br/>It happens over and over and over again. Her character was poorly written, and is almost so naive it is sickening.
First thing she does of any importance is accidently get and murdered by her Hitman, her Sicario. She is saved by none other than Benicio Del Toro. Then she holds a gun on Del Toro later in the next seen from the tunnel and is surprised when she gets shot at by a Columbian cartel lone wolf Hitman. She knew he was a Hitman and still decided to go through with this plan.<br/><br/>Next scene, she hit Josh Brolin in the face and then her supporting actor Daniel Kaluuya heroically comes to the rescue as they pick a fight with several spec ops soldiers. He gets owned. That's his role. Don't see him again. He is a taxi service, then he complains, walks somewhere, complains, gets owned.<br/><br/>Emily blunt in the last scene after standing by all her morals the entire movie, instead of accepting death like the stoic female lead she is, she caves and signs the paper saying that everything she saw was done by the book.<br/><br/>To cap it all off, she decided once again to rush to the balcony and point a gun at Del Toro. Again.<br/><br/>The reason I'm giving a 5/10 is because of Blunt and Kaluuya are detractors to the entire flow of the film. If it we're just Brolin and Del Toro 9/10."
"Mr_Sophistication_Uk","5","1","2","22 September 2019"," Not that great
","Sicario has some decent action sequences (especially in the last third) and an effectively intimidating performance by Benicio Del Toro, but these positives are outweighed by a pretty dull (and at times, hard-to-follow) script and a somewhat cardboard protagonist in Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>She broods, cries and pouts a lot for most of the movie, and ultimately doesn't do very much. Unless they lowered the bar in a misguided attempt to achieve gender parity at the FBI, it's very difficult to accept her as an elite agent... she's no J Lo in Out Of Sight, that's for sure.<br/><br/>I really don't have much more to add. With a more proactive lead, and a lot more of the excitement we got in the final reel, perhaps I could recommend Sicario. But the amount of chaff you have to sit through to get to the good stuff, it simply ain't worth it. File under 'Could Do Better'. 5/10"

","Sicario Directed by Denis Villeneuve contains such a compelling story along side incredible performances. This film takes you on a journey from the perspective of Emily Blunt's character. You think and feel as she would during some of the most uneasy situations I've experienced in a film. For the entire runtime, I felt consistently torn between characters I could trust and those who where manipulators. This is a film which plays with your emotions, and leaves you feeling on edge consistently. When the credits rolled I honestly felt dirty, due to the gritty visuals and blurring of morals. This tone was all successfully achieved from Denis' amazing direction combined with Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography. The beautiful natural shots with no artificial lighting, captures the most realistic darkness I've seen in film. Also Emily Blunt's performance was phenomenal. Her exhaustion, confusion, frustration and intense trauma was portrayed with such realism, that I genuinely forgot she was acting. Sicario was such an overwhelming film experience, containing such incredible filmmaking. So therefore I give It a 9."

There is something very grotesque and disturbingly mysterious about the Mexican drug cartels and the killing that ensues. Americans need their illegal drugs, and Mexicans are more than happy to make a quick buck. But how they use that money and flaunt it through such a detrimental earning method, is very scary.<br/><br/>Sicario presents the scenario from the cops as well as the cartel insiders. Benicia Del Toro is fantastic, and Josh Brolin plays the cool US cop guy very well.

","In my opinion Emily Blunt´s character is vital to the movie. Anyone who criticizes her being ""fake"" is wrong. She brings the necessary human point of view to the proceedings and is a person you can relate to. Without her this movie would be rather uninteresting.<br/><br/>Benicio of course owns the movie. The script, principal photography, direction and score by Johanssen are perfect. My only gripe concerns the lack of ""soul"", which is rather common with technically brilliant movies and directors - say Christopher Nolan and Stanley Kubrick for instance. That is perhaps the only thing that hinders Sicario from entering the club of truly classic crime films like The French Connection and L.A Confidential."

","Emily Blunt plays Kate Macer, the leader of a rescue response unit with the FBI. She gets recruited for a major offensive against drug cartels in Mexico, having to work for some very cagey people. The guy in charge is Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), and he's not forthcoming with many details. She also must deal with an enigmatic stranger named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), along for the ride in some sort of advisory capacity. There will be some surprises in store for Kate as she embarks upon this sordid journey.<br/><br/>The term ""Sicario"" gets explained at the outset; in Mexico, it's the word for ""hitman"". That lets us know that we're going to be in for something a bit different. You won't see the sort of typical action-movie treatment of such material. In fact, there are no real action set pieces to speak of. In their place, we get a nuanced, low-key, somewhat grounded drama of cops vs. crooks. We also get a narrative (written by Taylor Sheridan) in which ""good"" guys aren't always so clearly defined, and where you have people like Graver, whose job it is to sort of ""shake things up"" so that drug lords like Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cesar Cedillo) deviate from their usual patterns. In the end, this war on drugs reduces some people to utterly ruthless and cold-blooded methods.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve never tries to dazzle you. His filmmaking efficiency is of a more matter-of-fact style, as he eases you into the story bit by bit. There is a fairly devastating explosion (and loss of life) near the beginning that does influence Kates' actions for the rest of the picture, and a decent shootout in traffic as obviously unsavoury types are spotted by the authorities.<br/><br/>Extremely well shot (the cinematography is by Roger Deakins, so that comes as no surprise), it features good acting by a cast also including Victor Garber (""Titanic"" '97), Jon Bernthal ('The Walking Dead'), Daniel Kaluuya (""Get Out""), Jeffrey Donovan ('Burn Notice'), and Raoul Max Trujillo (""Apocalypto""). Blunt is fine as an idealistic young woman who gets an eye-opening, Brolin is pretty amusing, and Del Toro is excellent as he gives a very controlled performance.<br/><br/>Much tragedy and devastation has been the result of decades of drug wars, and ""Sicario"" illustrates this quite well.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"Lewis_Heather787","8","1","2","7 July 2018"," Incredibly tense , all round great thriller!
","Denis Villeneuve is on a roll...........this film is great and only enhances his position as one of the best up and coming modern directors today. Right from the opening scenes this film entices you in and never lets go of you, it is incredibly tense and hard to watch at times. There are two main reasons this film grabs a hold of you, one being the fantastic story/writing and the other is the characters/performances. <br/><br/>The directing across the board is sublime, gorgeous shots of Mexico that are obviously enhanced by Roger Deakins cinematography. These beautiful wide angel shots are complimented extremely well with really close up action set pieces. The set piece across the boarder in the traffic jam has got to be one of the most tense scenes in a film recently, incredible work.<br/><br/>As previously mention the story/writing of this film is extremely good and makes for a riveting watch. It carries along a really tough subject with a lot of complex character background without letting one overshadowing the other. All the characters backstories are fleshed out really well throughout the film whilst still contributing to the overall story. Taylor Sheridan definitely deserves a shout out for this, really good work. A story that I've never seen before, extremely realistic and grounded.<br/><br/>The cast is very very good, firstly Emily Blunt who is the audiences eyes as the film progresses as she is seeing the same things we are for the first time. Plays a sort of fish out of water but can stand her own ground. What I mean by fish out of water is the fact that she is completely out of her depth and doesn't know what is going in the outset. Her character arc throughout is really good and has a satisfying end. Josh Brolin is very good as the charismatic leader of the team that definitely has his complexities to him. As the film goes a long you never really know 100 percent if he is telling the whole truth, he is a little bit wild and unpredictable. This makes is relationship between his character and Blunts all the more interesting. <br/><br/>However the best performance of the film is Benicio del Toro, just jaw dropping at times, is seemingly peaceful and friendly one minute and the next he is brutally murdering people. Fantastic performance all round, probably has the most depth to his character as well, as to the reason why he is helping the Americans. Brutally fantastic.<br/><br/>Last couple of positives are Roger Deakins, his cinematography is always incredible and is probably the best cinematography around, truly beautiful work. The last positive is the score by Johann Johannsson which is extremely haunting and only increases the tension throughout the film, simply brilliant score and fantastic use of it, it comes and goes and is only used when necessary.<br/><br/>Overall this film is 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10, this is a very good film that has opened up an entirely new genre to explore, fantastic work from Denis Villeneuve, will this man ever make a bad film, probably not. Taylor Sheridan for the incredible story and characters. The three main cast members are all fantastic, must also quickly shoutout Daniel Kaluuya, good little role from him. Score and Cinematography are real highlights as well, there aren't any negatives really, I suppose it can drag a little and pace of the film can be hit and miss at times. All in all and truly great film not for everyone but extremely riveting and entertaining."
"daftartelefon","8","1","2","4 July 2018"," A movie worth to watch
","As an amateur viewer so do not bury me with you cinema knowledge for that.I saw this film and i really liked that.
In my personal point of view the best part of the movie is Del Toro acting. Beautiful , real and disciplined acting by Del Toro. His acting and movements so professional and classy.
Cinematography is perfect. Sound edit way perfect than it looks.
Most important thing is camera movement, Smooth .Simple and Enough , No camera on hand and run like crazy unlike the Hollywood movies these days. (Damn that camera on hands are headaches.)<br/><br/>There is just 1 minor problem in storytelling . I think the script needed to be saturated some more about the drug cartels and their operations.<br/><br/>And there is 1 big problem and that is Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya acting.
Blunt is flimsy and heavy , very much filled with fake and made-up confusing looks. She is so much unreal that you will ask during the whole movie : Why she is here ?! If you want to get to a cartel leader then you should know there is no written procedures for this type of operations. And if you do not like it , then why you and Kaluuya are here ? <br/><br/>You cannot pretend to want some maniac Druglord badly and yet behave like you don't know what these Druglords look like and question everything and demand everyone their intents plus their reasons and if she does not like those she threaten to walk.
No body forces her and his mate to join for this kind of operations.<br/><br/>Overall , this is very well made movie with a very good acting and story."

This was an amazing depiction of the dire state of affairs in cartel/gang controlled territories where the daily monotony of life is truly unconscionable. The story line examines how law enforcement is engaging with an enemy that is dangerous enough to overthrow the Mexican government. It is made very clear that the boundaries of morality are no longer defined, meaning that the viewer will be left to decide for themselves whether the each of these characters are justified in how the cope with their own plight.

","The exciting crime-drama from Canadian director Denis Villeneue, brought the already-perfect work of cinema to a more popular genre. His early work with films such as ""enemy"" didn't seem catch the audience as much as Sicario did. <br/><br/>We follow Emely Blunts character who dwells into the unknown territory of federal organisations, when hunting down mobsters and drug-lords in Mexico. The longer into the plot we go, the more interesting it gets! <br/><br/>The acting is really good, and the cinematography and setting is extremely satisfying to watch. From beginning to end, the film keeps us guessing in different directions, while the best parts of the plot are almost hidden in the details. This makes the film hard to follow for the first viewing, which is why you should watch it at least twice! Because there's a ton of details and characteristics to analyse on."
"Thomasccooke","9","1","2","25 February 2018"," Brutal, haunting film
","I was riveted by this film from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I won't quibble too much with some of the negative reviews here, but I think some of the reviewers missed the point. As a society, we are caught in a trap of violence, which the writer, Taylor Sheridan explores in his three recent films. We know the 'drug wars' are brutal...but we don't really understand just how brutal it is. To me, that's the reason for the charnel house opening scene, to really try and grasp how inhuman people have become.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character is obviously there as the point of view of the audience, 'the good cop', who believes in the rule of law, who knows that there is almost unimaginable violence in the world--but hasn't really accepted it yet.<br/><br/>Her having to face that brutality, and to turn away from her foundational belief in that rule of law is her character arc, and it's superbly done.<br/><br/>Everything about the film was excellent. Brolin and Del Toro were very compelling and I'm excited to see more of their story this summer. The cinematography was gorgeous, the raw landscape and towering skies are an integral part of the story. I thought the music great as well.<br/><br/>I've watched the film several times now, and have been impressed each time. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","1","2","24 February 2018"," Sicario builds tension through suspenseful orchestrated set pieces.
","Let's face it, it has put me off going to Mexico...forever. Joking aside, the visceral gritty thrills portrays Juárez as cartel central. Whether or not the depiction is entirely accurate, it's hard not to be absorbed by the dark world that is perceived. A keen FBI agent is recruited by a mysterious individual tasked with targeting the head of a Mexican cartel. She encounters Alejandro who's motives are blurred and, with cartel members around every corner, paranoia starts to settle. Denis Villeneuve's cinematic direction, Taylor Sheridan's sharp script, Roger Deakins' beautiful cinematography and the late Jóhann Jóhannson's unsettling score are impeccable. A symphony of tension that is individually powered by electrifying technical components. It comes to no surprise that all of the above are outstanding, they each just make film making effortless. The perfect scene to illustrate my point is the night vision tunnel infiltration. Monochromatic night vision, bass heavy score, first person viewpoint and dialogue that could prepare a succulent fajita in seconds. Absolutely incredible, scenes like that are rare to find in modern thrillers. Then we come to Benicio Del Toro who portrays a very elusive character, to which is one of his best performances. His stance, his cutthroat dialogue and his death stare all blend together to create an utterly intimidating enigma. Do not mess with him! Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya also bring their A-game. Several critics disagreed with the ending, however I found the tonal shift to work. The change in character focus which reveals true motives within the plot was seamless. What I do not agree with, is the use of Kate. As a protagonist, she was pointless and simply was a plot device which therefore meant I didn't connect with her. The incarnation of female empowerment she is not. This might be my least favourite Villeneuve film, but it's still impressive nonetheless. He has yet to put a foot wrong."
"Tweetienator","8","1","2","19 February 2018"," The King is Dead, Long Live the King
","I re-watched Sicario lately and well, it is still a fine piece of a movie.

Dark, outstanding and a must-see. One of the best movies in the past few years regarding the genre of crime and drama with a good shot of action."
"ptodorova-84221","8","1","2","18 February 2018"," The ineffectiveness of idealism
","Sicario places you in the shoes of an idealistic FBI agent, Kate, as she naively enters the enigmatic and brutal world of covert operations within the cross-border drug trade, hoping to make a difference. Kate represents our own naivete and idealism about the war on drugs. Like her character, the viewer is completely lost most of the time and occasionally enlightened to certain aspects of the operation only to later realize that they understood nothing at all. The film ultimately strives to break down your idealism and put its efficacy into question. <br/><br/>The CIA has essentially contracted a Colombian hit man, Alejandro, who is apparently a former Colombian prosecutor whose family was brutally murdered by a merciless Mexican drug lord. How Alejandro went from lawyer to special forces assassin is besides the point. Ultimately the CIA assists Alejandro in murdering this Mexican drug lord to help the Colombian cartel take over because, supposedly, they were better at keeping order, don't murder as many innocent people, and have probably made a deal to keep the brutality of the drug trade away from crossing the U.S. border. That's the end game: to reduce the violence by placing a less brutal leader at the head of the Mexican drug trade. <br/><br/>The CIA are not presented as good guys but simply as problem solvers. They know that as long as drugs are illegal in the U.S. and the public provides a demand, the war for control of the drug trade within Mexico will continue to rage. Inconveniently, however, it has gotten too close to home and spilled over the border and onto U.S. soil because the current drug lord didn't get the memo that he can't do that. And so this presents the problem they have been tasked with solving. They have to dethrone the gang that has lost control and allowed this spillover of violence onto U.S. soil. So they turn to the Colombian drug cartels for help. <br/><br/>Everyone is a pawn, Alejandro is using the CIA to get his own revenge, the Columbian cartel is using Alejandro and the CIA to gain control over the Mexican drug trade, and finally the CIA is using Kate to legitimize an illegal operation.<br/><br/>Over the course of the film, Kate's idealism is systematically broken down, which leads to the conclusion of the movie where she is forced to sign the paperwork legitimizing the operation. While she tries to hold on to some vestige of her idealism in initially refusing to sign the paperwork, she ultimately chooses not to shoot Alejandro as he is walking away. Why? Because she reluctantly has come to understand what he did and its necessity, and because she is not sure whether shooting him is the wrong or the right thing to do, just like the viewer is not sure what is wrong and what is right throughout the entire film, even as everything is finally revealed. That's how she holds on to the last piece of her idealism, she doesn't take action, making her ineffective. That is why she is not a wolf in a town full of wolves, as Alejandro tells her before he leaves. Ultimately, the film suggests there is no place for idealists in war, or at least the war on drugs, because idealists are paralyzed by their idealism and are ultimately ineffective because they cannot justify the means with the ends. At the same time, the subtlety of the film might also suggest that the idealists are better than the pragmatists and that the pragmatists like to think they are more effective than they actually are."
"sergelamarche","8","1","2","12 February 2018"," Bloody smashing
","Denis Villeneuve knows how to make them real, tense and smart. Flaws are few but there are some. A SWAT girl not knowing enough about the drug war to not get upset, seems unlikely. Also not listening to their experienced parners seems a big no-no when bullets flies that often. A big boss not having more than 4 body guards, also not likely.

""Sicario"" doesn´t spare anything , it shoots it all against the wall wether you like it or not.<br/><br/>""(...) and this is the land of wolves now""."
"mgruebel","8","1","2","14 January 2018"," Everyone uses everyone
","The score of this film consists of threatening hums and rumbles, underscoring the bleakness that pervades Sicario. In an effort to get at a cartel jefe, everyone uses everyone. A Medellín operative uses US agents to get the man who killed his family. US agents use and innocent FBI agent to legitimize a completely illegitimate operation. Everyone uses everyone in some way.<br/><br/>The drama (there is no action, except killings after killings to illustrate the depravity of the situation, on all sides, and even those with no side) stays tense throughout the film. No secrets are kept from the viewer as the main characters slowly learn what is really happening, very much in the style of Hitchcock thrillers, where the tension never relied on viewer ignorance beyond any ignorance of the characters.<br/><br/>It's a depressing film, but seems only too believable. When the fight for 'good' stoops to the same low level as 'evil,' everything just seems crass and brutish and disgusting. No wonder the heroine is about the only major character a viewer can identify with. She's like a babe in arms thrown to the wolves, as Benicio del Toro remarks towards the end of the film. Strangely, although she cannot kill him, she's the only character with any courage in this film, even though she signs off an affidavit legitimizing the whole affair with a gun at her throat.<br/><br/>The film made me mostly just shudder while watching it. If you're inclined to think that most drugs should be legitimized (like alcohol was after the prohibition), this film will do about the best possible to support your view. Cigarettes and alcohol kill a lot of people, but not with as much collateral damage."
"donaldricco","9","1","2","8 January 2018"," Del Toro is del bomb!
","In Spanish, Sicario means a hired assassin or killer. Boy does it!
Great opening! The first 7 minutes are crazy intense! Actually, the whole film is! It seems like every scene is filled with tension, stress, and danger. It's a very good movie, a deep look at the ""war on drugs"" along the U.S./Mexico border. And Benicio Del Toro is just awesomely savage and amazing in his role! My only negative, is that it really reminds me of a book that I read, ""The Power of the Dog"" by Don Winslow, which came out 9 years before this movie. It does not take anything away from the power of this film, I'm just saying they seem similar."

I know I know movies can be far fetched because they are just that. They are dealing with REAL bad guys and it's just another day. Emily Blunt plays her part beautifully and is in serious Synergy with Brolin and Del Toro. If you want to watch a movie that's not to over the top with bullets and has an actual story, watch Sicario.

Everything gels together, complimenting every aspect of the film. The characters are complex and rich with personality, the set design is a perfect recreation of the Mexican slums, the dialogue is natural, the cinematography by legend Roger Deakins is spectacular. I could honestly go on, but I'll end this by saying that Sicario is the most well-made film that anybody has bothered to make in the past decade. Definitely one to see."

This is The Movie of 2015. This movie deserved tons of Oscars. Bravo Denis Villeneuve. Bravo Jóhann Jóhannsson.

"alindsay-al","7","1","2","30 July 2017"," A good suspenseful thriller
","I have now finished my Dennis Villeneuve series with sicario, and I liked this film even though I think it is a little bit overrated. The premise of this film sees a FBI agent sent to a new task force to go after the cartels in Mexico. Emily blunt plays the lead in this film and she is great in the role, she is a strong female character but also portrays her vulnerability really well to make you truly care about her character. For the majority of the film you see this situation from her viewpoint and it causes you to root for her even more. The best part of this film has to be the performance of benicio del torro, he is easily the best character in this film. As you see his character develop throughout the film you become more and more interested in his journey during the film. Josh brolin plays the head of the task force in this film and he is a complex character as you try and see where his character is coming from. Victor Garber, Jon bernthal and Daniel kaluuya are also really good in there smaller roles. The story is interesting seeing these different people trying to deal with this crime in different ways some making unique moral decisions. But even though it is my favourite part of the movie the 3rd act is really bizarre as it shifts focus from blunt to del torro and it makes a weird ending. The script has some good dramatic dialogue in it but not a lot that stands out also the humour doesn't really work in this movie when used. The style of the film though is beautiful, the cinematography is terrific making this film a visual marvel to watch. But this film suffers from some real pacing issues that hurt its overall viewing pleasure as it trundles along at times. Overall I liked sicario and I think that if you are a fan of cartel thrillers then this is definitely a film for you."
"krocheav","6","1","2","5 March 2017"," Sicario Has Style But Has It Intelligence?
","The introduction for this film gave initial promise by shrewdly adding a title that states: Sicario were early warriors of Jerusalem who hunted down Roman invaders, but then goes on to tell us Sicario: also means Hit-Man in Mexican (doesn't leave much to aspire to). It's a studied exercise in the ugliness of today's drug trade – its main claim to fame lies in its overall style, both visual and directorial. Denis Villeneuvie's direction is taut (reminiscent in style to the interesting John Guillermin from the mid 50s – late 80s). Much of Sicario's success at seducing the audience to overlook several plot implausibility's is gained from the superb work of British cinematographer/cameraman Roger Deakins. This brilliant director of photography is worthy of higher projects to better use his considerable talents. It would have been interesting to have had the opportunity for him work with the likes of David Lean or Carol Reed. To date, perhaps the most intelligent use of his talent may have been ""Defence of the Realm"" in '85 – with possibly the most stylish being ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" in '94. I credit this fellow with adding much to the success of Cohen Bros movies than perhaps the often overrated Cohens themselves. There's also an evocative 'soundscape' score by Icelandic artist Johann Johannsson to help it along. <br/><br/>As for the screenplay by TV actor Taylor Sheridan - it adds little new ground to a heavily pre-trodden scenario and if not for the combination of smart direction, photography and slick editing its many plot deficiencies would be even more self evident. If modern movies are going to set themselves up as realistically true to life, then there has to be a greater level of believability, otherwise they remain simply the 'artificial recreations of reality' they always have been – except now of course, they just have to be overloaded with all the vile language and grotesque violent details that can be crammed into an average two hour plot. This work also has the feel of many TV series that stretch-out thin plots to fill endless episodes. Thankfully this is all over in two hours. <br/><br/>Sheridan's characters are mostly made up of so-called 'elite' professionals - lead by an idealistic female SWAT team member played by Emily Blunt (who holds her implausible character quite well) but, for high profile professionals they tend to make so many foolish decisions – Not to mention the many silly plot set-ups:(some minor spoilers here if not already seen) Sequences such as the corrupt policeman who just happened to be in an obscure roadside bar that is 'randomly' visited (totally without plan) by our heroine - coupled with the sudden appearance of her 'protector' are just too much to overlook. To top it off the Del Toro character's involvement is reduced down to just another clichéd 'revenge' plot – complete with his being able to gain access to one of the biggest players in the business by single-handily murdering all the personal protectors (who just happen to be in earshot of his victims but miraculously no-one hears anything) its just another of many stretches of credibility (like Kate's ex-SWAT partner who just happens to always be there, despite being previously rejected by the current government undercover team). There's also an ugly start to this folly with drug dealers hiding numerous badly decomposing bodies in the plaster wall cavities of a house. What possible purpose was that intended to serve? <br/><br/>For those who simply watch movies and go blindly with the flow - without thinking - this is seemingly good entertainment but, for a movie to be hailed as great or award winning, there has to be more depth. So, if you are looking for something offering intelligence, you may not find it here.<br/><br/>Also most disappointing is the obvious re-introduction of excessive cigarette smoking into movies (throughout the world) don't tell me this isn't deadly commercial product placement at its unsubtle worst - this sets the integrity of today's movie industry back over 50 years."
"sam-97903","10","1","2","23 February 2017"," Breathless
","As perfectly told in the Guardian, Sicario uses private planes, public roads and clandestine tunnels to slip back and forth across borders both moral and geographical, between Mexico and the United States of America. The title means ""hitman"" in English language. The movie keeps its plot to its climax. The performance of Del Toro and Blunt are remarkable. Would definitely recommend to watch or to add to your watch-list."

"sharky_55","6","1","2","30 December 2016"," (in Spanish) Time to meet God.
","By now, Denis Villeneuve can no longer be considered the promising young director even as he continually makes waves in Hollywood. Portions of Sicario resemble a sleek, well-designed action thriller, and that begins with his technical direction. The sound mixing is exquisite, combining the thudding, ominous score of Jóhann Jóhannsson with every booming gunshot that means another life taken. The cinematography by Roger Deakins captures a Mexico in decay, with a beige-seeped and yellowed palette contrasting the cooler blues of the American nightlife. See the difference between the climatic dinner execution, bathed in a warm domestic glow about to be sullied with blood, and the final confrontation in the cold sterility of Kate's apartment - this is no breeding ground for empathy or justice. <br/><br/>From this point Sicario makes a big show of emphasising how its characters are bound or unbound by their domestic situation. Kate is divorced with no kids, as her interrogation tells us, and that frees her up to make the harder decisions and be the whistle-blower to a corrupt system. Likewise Alejandro has lost his family, and that simultaneously drives him to be the lone renegade and allows him to cross legal and moral boundaries that a shackled family man might not be so inclined to. And I'm willing to bet a king's ransom that Matt also has no such immediate family to hold him back from casually rolling with all these murky dealings - he's even perfected the art of forgoing corporate pretense by the look of his flip flops. On the other side of the fence there are clumsy attempts to appeal to our sentimentality through brief and infrequent peeks into one specific Mexican father and his soccer-loving son. But the film is so preoccupied with how the American invaders feel it scarcely pauses to consider their perspective: ""This is how the world works,"" say the men with guns, and don't you dare try to challenge it with your own experiences. It's a rather shallow attempt at humanising them, and because we don't discover its relevance to the story until late on in the film, it seems to exist in an entirely separate reality from the drug-riddled Mexico that the soldiers tackle. <br/><br/>Emily Blunt, to her credit, never ever makes the suggestion that it is her femininity that allows her to make these observations, and the film doesn't suggest feminine weakness as a contributing factor to her powerlessness. She's not a token female, and she's tough enough to ask the hard questions where it matters. Yet the character irregardless of gender is a little hollow, poised to be willfully naive and painfully out of her depth - an early experience establishes her credentials and experience before waving them away to enable her to be our moral proxy. I lost count of how many times she stages confrontations that are thinly doubled to act as the audience's perceived moral outrage. Kate wants to arrest Díaz for money laundering, and Villeneuve just giggles and pats her on the head condescendingly. In reality this is not such a bad idea, since many high profile criminals have been nailed for much smaller crimes than their larger implied offences, but in the movie world it's an insult to the well-oiled machine of corruption that swallows pure-hearted idealists like her and spits out moral ambiguity. <br/><br/>It's problematic to begin dismantling her when there's little to dismantle. Kate's moral convictions are barely drawn and sparsely constructed of simple catchphrases like ""I have to know."" Though she may be interested in preserving legal justice and cleaning up the streets for the more fair, soccer-loving Mexican folk, the film doesn't attempt to link the two. That comes from Alejandro, Benicio del Toro as a video-game character come to life. He's not a person but a lean, mean assassination machine, lurking in the shadows and striking at opportunistic moments. With his guns and silencer he is an almost comical force of nature, and although the aim is not to glorify this type of vengeance (but regretfully admit its usefulness), he does so anyway. He's much too cool, much too efficient, and growls buzzwords that indicate the necessity of his job: ""This is a land of wolves now."" <br/><br/>Additionally, for all the film's moralising on violence it sometimes utilises it as a punchline - see how the nightmarish POV in the tunnel slowly uncovers ghostly footsteps, and then bloody bodies slumped up against the walls. There is little logic in a seasoned FBI agent gawking at the ground in a hostile raid - the shot is exploitative of the same type of graphic and transgressive content that her character argues so vehemently against. Sicario is so hard pressed and insistent on moving away from Hollywood-wrapped comfort and into the harshness of 'reality' that it revels in its ugliness and cynicism. Matt and Alejandro are correct in many ways, and the public would be content in reaping the rewards of their work whilst not looking too closely at the finer print. But to deliver it via such obvious, obnoxious caricatures feels much too simplistic, ironic for a film that champions the thought process of 'the ends justify the means'. It's the complete opposite of ambiguity; it keeps stacking the chips of the opposing sides higher and higher, trying to outdo each other with senseless violence, bravado and brutality. And then it feebly tosses Kate in the middle of this mess, hurls her around for a bit, then shrugs and says 'Eh, we tried'. It's the cinematic equivalent of pointing a gun to the audience's head and asking: 'You're either with us or against us', and then condemning you for choosing the lesser of two evils anyway."
"areatw","6","1","2","29 December 2016"," Technically very good, but the plot is lacking
","I was left with mixed feelings after watching 'Sicario'. The film is perfectly good for the most part, everything from the cinematography to the acting is on point. It is, however, let down by a plot that lacks the strength needed for such an ambitious film.<br/><br/>The odd minor plot hole or inconsistency can be overlooked, but the final straw for me was when the FBI agent gets a gun pulled on her by a 'colleague', forcing her to sign an illegitimate agreement against her will. Better writing and more thought earlier on and such a far-fetched scenario could have been avoided.<br/><br/>'Sicario' is a decent, satisfying crime drama/thriller that is unfortunately let down by a plot lacking strength and thought. A good attempt, but a underwhelming outcome."
"mohitextreme","8","1","2","1 December 2016"," An engaging crime thriller!
","Sicario is one those rare thriller movies that actually stick to their genre. There is no unnecessary love story or useless sub-plots. The movie begins with a chilling sequence and never stops from there. The pacing is pretty good.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job and none of them felt wooden or fake. <br/><br/>Another amazing aspect of the movie is its breathtaking cinematography and a haunting background score. The aerial shots were simply beautiful. The thumping beats added to the tension and drama.<br/><br/>The movie is dark. There are still a few funny moments but the director has carefully kept them low-key so that they don't interfere with all the serious hoopla.<br/><br/>The traffic sequence, the tunnel sequence and the climax were amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie for all the thriller lovers. It has its share of minor flaws but it is still a pretty nice movie. Watch it for the acting, the cinematography and the background score.<br/><br/>P.S.

"doxxman5","10","1","2","30 October 2016"," Villeneuve at his best
","No director around makes movies as good as Denis Villeneuve, perhaps the most hopeful voice of major cinema around. This is his 4th major movie and one of his best, combining the harsh reality of 2013's Prisoners with an even more devastating world of Juarez, Mexico. The drug war that rages on in that city alone is never ending, and any attempts to stop it or contain it may prove futile. That doesn't keep the US government from trying in this not-so-fictional tale of the sacrifices people make in the name of keeping the peace. There is brilliant scene after brilliant scene combined with a screenplay that makes you care about even the smallest characters (in some ways making the small characters the most tragic of all). The cinematography of Roger Deakins is just the icing on the cake, literally showing off a melting pot of USA/Mexico borders and terrain."
"Equalizer16","9","1","2","29 October 2016"," A real message hidden in perfect film making.
","Emily Blunt stars in the magnificent cold hearted crime thriller that brings us into the world of the FBI war against drug cartel. A solid directing work by Denis Villeneuve, who brought us Prisoners, Enemy and the up coming science fiction Arrival entering a cinematic display of down to earth drama.<br/><br/>Kate Macer (Blunt) is an FBI agent who is brought into the task force team against drug cartel between the American and Mexican border. As Macer enters a world she is not used she consistently questions the activity of her task force leader (Josh Brolin) and the true objective of their job. She is also becomes the colleague with the mysterious Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro) who is much more then meets the eye.<br/><br/>What is at the true centre of Sicario lies in Blunt's performance as the strong FBI enforcer but also is the troubled and confused member of an enterprise she is not sure about. Blunt is the cold hearted soul of the film as we join her through her in the expeditions through the borders. What Blunt holds strong is her authoritative persona especially opposite her partner Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), along with her vulnerable unknowing sympathetic character.<br/><br/>The other key master-class performer is Benicio del Toro delivering a brilliant dark and puzzling character with a past displayed only in the behaviour of his face. A true silhouette throughout the film especially in the first second he is seen, with much mystery and truth rapped up in inside. What you also have is the spot on laid back task force leader, role by Josh Brolin avoiding any questions about their activity by Blunt, and taking the serious matter in front of them far too lightly and at ease.<br/><br/>What also makes Sicario a significant piece of cinema is its cinematic presence displaying spectacular aerial and establishing shots of Mexico's desert lands, beautifully done by Roger Deakins making the film more than a standard drama. Bringing heart thumping and strong atmospheric sound to the table is also Jóhann Jóhannsson's sensational score, expressing the dramatic and tense themes.<br/><br/>Sicario is derived from the Mexican term for hit-man, in which the film suggest to be the real truth behind the enforcement of the task forces, meaning for them to be terrorising killers entering the innocent homelands of the local towns people. Here we find Villeneuve reaching out to the audience and revealing hidden truth behind war against the drug cartel.<br/><br/>A brilliant work in film making and a great message in a marvellous form with a great visual presence. 9.3/10"
"taikung1","7","1","2","9 October 2016"," A hit with a purpose
","Sicario gives a first person account of FBI agent Kate Macy who although no stranger to the cruelty cause by the Mexican Cartel, is seemingly put over her head in a new assignment. With the support of superb cinematography there brings out a sense of loneliness and self reliance as Kate attempts to figure out her role and the end game scenario being worked out by the US bureaucrats.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve gives a methodical crime thriller with a generous helping of suspense. Married to a constant stream of questions and mind wondering theories were surreal scenes of brutality coupled by imagery only observed when in deep thought. This style of cinematography created emotions of loneliness and self reliance as fears mounted towards how Kate was being used.<br/><br/>A stellar performance by Benisio Del Toro playing the roll of a dauntless Alejandro further added to the films mystery. Born out of a world where human lives are worth more dead because they make a stronger statement, Alejandro seeks revenge against the cartel with the US government at his disposal.<br/><br/>The questions to Kate's involvement become answered in a very matter of fact manner. Instead of keeping the level of suspense and concern for her safety the story drops the ball and although tries, can't quite grasp it as it bounces away. It was disappointing after being brought down the rabbit hole with Kate only to discover her roll was technical and minimally subversive. In an era of film making history where antiheroes are the new champions, this movie may have missed its opportunity for greatness by not basing the story more around Alejandro from start to finish."
"kevin-dietrich","6","1","2","14 August 2016"," A bit overrated, though quite decent movie
","The cinematography was pretty great, the score did a good job setting the tone of the movie, and the presentation and execution (pun intended) of the cartel felt realistic though at times a bit too Hollywood-y and dumb (why the corpse house?). And those are the highlights of the movie for me. Story telling wise, the overall pacing felt a bit forced, or even boring, at times. There are some scenes which are expected to be fast paced, feeling reinforced by the editing, yet are going in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>The main issue I have is with some of the characters.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character (FBI agent Kate Macer) ended up being so annoying and nagging in her idealism of the world and law enforcement that it lowered the quality of the movie for me. I don't really believe the character learned something new from her journey, except that breaking the rules is bad, though she already knew that since she is a FBI agent.<br/><br/>The crooked cop (and his family) felt a bit disposable and underdeveloped. The same could be said about Benicio del Toro's character (Alejandro) which really seems to be out of place (or too omnipotent).<br/><br/>The climax of the movie did not seem to be the logical conclusion to the events that took place before it, and seems to be here just to further Emily Blunt's character nonsensical behavior.<br/><br/>In any case, I think this is a pretty decent movie, though the director's previous movies were a lot better."

She soon realises that their methods are quite unorthodox, even potentially illegal, and the aim may be even more unconventional.<br/><br/>Great action-thriller, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies). Slow-burning intensity with a great deal of intrigue. Not your average cops-and-drug-dealers story in that, like the lead character, the viewer is kept in the dark about much of the objectives of the mission. This keeps you guessing and makes the reveal even more profound in its impact.<br/><br/>Great, realistic action scenes and good special effects.<br/><br/>After showing herself to be a very good action performer in Edge of Tomorrow, Emily Blunt gets another opportunity to further those credentials. Less action for her in this, but enough, and she does well. I can see her being the go-to female action star for a few years to come.<br/><br/>Good support from Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro and Daniel Kaluuya.<br/><br/>The end message is a bit unsatisfactory and the target for derision too easy, and those would be the main negatives.

"robert-temple-1","9","1","2","6 April 2016"," Why not to go to Northern Mexico
","This is a fascinating, if gruesome, drama about the drug cartels of Mexico and the weird agents who 'combat' them. The film is excellently directed by Denis Villeneuve, director of the famous INCENDIES (2010). The lead character is a young woman who works with the Arizona state police on kidnapping cases. It is an instance of the most inspiring casting that someone thought of getting Emily Blunt to play the role. She is absolutely perfect. She is seconded to work with a strange group who intend to carry out raids across the border in Mexico against some of the drug lords. The script by Taylor Sheridan and direction are so clever, because the whole film is essentially based on her point of view, as she enters into association with psychotic CIA agents and a member of the Columbian Medellin drugs cartel working with them who is seeking revenge against one of the Mexican drug lords for killing his wife and daughter. Blunt's shock and incomprehension are well portrayed as she experiences this new, brutal and illegal world. Josh Brolin very scarily plays a gung-ho 'kill 'em first and then ask questions' CIA ops man, who admits that he only needs Blunt to tag along to tick a box so that he can operate within the territory of the USA on his returns from Mexico. He admits that the Columbian Medellin cartel was officially supported by the CIA and he is merely wiping out their competition to get them back in undisputed control again. He says 20% of Americans insist on 'sniffing the stuff' and until and unless they stop, the CIA has to be in ultimate control of the drugs trade. People get kidnapped, beaten up, tortured, murdered, as Blunt looks on increasingly dismayed, her protests about the illegality of it all laughed at by the others. She herself gets beaten up more than once by her 'own side'. She is dismissively informed: 'You are not a wolf, and this is a world of wolves.' The location work in Mexico is a horrifying revelation. Juarez, Mexico, is apparently nothing short of hell on earth, and the whole of Northern Mexico seems to be a wasteland of violence, murder, and crime. And people wonder why Donald Trump is getting so many votes for saying he wants to build a wall on the border! This film must have helped his campaign enormously. If you are strong enough to watch brutal films, this one has a lot to tell us."
"sickofenjoyingmyself","8","1","2","28 March 2016"," Multi-faceted, tense drama
","Sicario is a tense, thoughtful and thrilling drama. It is an intelligent interpretation of the multi-faceted effects of cartel activity and the poker faced players of many of those involved. It considers that the problem runs deeper than simply the gangs themselves and explores the possibility of involvement from higher powers with self serving interests. Emily Blunt is fantastic as the pawn caught in a bigger game and convincingly conveys the conflicting emotions that could be felt from being in such a position. I give credit also to Daniel Kaluuya for a credible performance and Josh Brolin was appropriately pompous in his role. The star of the show is Benicio Del Toro. His portrayal of the haunted, ruthless assassin is both chilling and understandable. Such monsters are created in the ugly environments that serve the gang and drug trades the world over. In his world such cold violence is a way of life, a reason why 'nothing will make sense to your American ears'. The movie becomes increasingly tense as we begin to discover that Del Toro's 'Alejandro' is on a personal quest for vengeance. This ultimately results in one of the most memorable movie scenes I have witnessed in recent years. Ruthless, and astonishing - it truly is one of the most bad-ass moments you will witness on film. Del Toro executes it with perfection. A great movie."

Sicario had good prerequisites, but it did not provide wow! experience as a whole; apparently due to realism maintenance, most of the plot was arid, and the main character FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) was strangely ""colorless"" and non-dynamic, falling down on, in particular, Benicio del Toro as Alejandro Gillick and Josh Brolin as Matt Graver whose versatility bears the weight in the movie, following them maintain the thrill and cohesion of the plot. Besides, some twists were revealed too soon, thereafter one could guess how the things would go on and resolve.

Emily Blunt plays a police officer who volunteers to fight drugs, but witnesses atrocities and illegal practices from her team. Josh Brolin is brilliant in his role, and you don't really know whether he is the good guy or the bad guy. Del Toro is the most enigmatic, and in the end, his true motives are revealed. The directing is good. The shooting scenes all have tension building up. The deaths makes you feel rattled, rather than cheer for the dead bad guys. The use of vast empty desert landscape shot from above gives the feeling of both peace, and awe. This contrasts with the actual situation on the ground, which is rife with violence.

As the story advances we realize that there is much more than a war of gangs going on, and the questions that are asked are not only about the number of victims or arrests, or the amount of drugs that is confiscated or makes its way to the 'customers' but about the balance between law and efficiency, the price of human life and the tragedy of families who are collateral victims of the violence.<br/><br/>The quality of the film is built of the combination between the sure hand of the director, the music of Jóhann Jóhannsson and the splendid acting of Benicio Del Toro (in a role that fits him as a glove) and Emily Blunt who grows in the viewer eyes from a don-Quixotesque policewoman one can see only in movies to a key character for the whole story and a real person who carries on her shoulder the huge dilemmas of deciding between good and bad, between the rule of law and the need to win the war on crime by any means.<br/><br/>If you like any of the genres I listed at the start, you will not be disappointed by this film. If you are not the fan of any you still can enjoy this powerful drama and professionally made film, which exceeds the borders of the genres."

","In a year in which the movie industry is being raked over the coals for not being diverse enough, ""Sicario"" had the opportunity to give us a woman's perspective on a genre generally reserved for macho men. And it makes good on that opportunity for a while, but in the end, the film's decision to drop its female protagonist and let events play out in a very traditional and male way makes it one of the bigger disappointments of my movie year.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt plays an FBI agent who's recruited to join an inter-department task force whose objective is to take out a Mexican drug lord. Her role on the team is left intentionally vague, both to her and to us, for most of the movie; not until the film's last third do we learn that she's there so that the CIA can basically dot its ""i""s and cross its ""t""s in establishing clearance for doing whatever it needs to do, much of it illegal, to control the situation.<br/><br/>Stories about idealistic folk who wake up to the questionable motives and methods of whatever cause they've aligned themselves with are a dime a dozen -- just earlier this year the movie ""'71"" covered the same thematic ground but set it against the backdrop of the IRA conflict in Ireland. But for its first half or so, ""Sicario"" feels like a fresh approach to the subject, mostly because it's told from a female point of view. Emily Blunt is a very good actress, and though she's not given perhaps as full a character as she could have been, she's given enough to work with and she does well with it. But toward the end, the film decides it's no longer interested in her, and it instead follows Benicio Del Toro's CIA double agent while he carries out criminal acts in the name of U.S. justice, and that's where the movie lost me a bit. It wouldn't have bothered me so much had not the movie leading up to that been told exclusively from Blunt's point of view. We don't see any events that she herself isn't present to witness. The change in perspective is jarring and disappointing.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" is far from a total loss. It's quite a well made film and though it didn't live up to the potential it established for itself, I still enjoyed it. But how much more I might have enjoyed it had it lived up to its promise.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","If you've got nails before watching Sicario you certainly won't have after it, for this beautifully lensed and tension riddled Mexican cartel themed thriller is a nail-biting experience of a high order that from its explosive opening through to breathtaking night time finale will have you very much on the edge of your seat even if you don't know exactly what's happening or even care much for our main protagonists.<br/><br/>The 4th film on the trot that has quickly established French/Canadian director Denis Villeneuve as one of the inform directors of Hollywood – his previous films where the incredible Incendies (please anyone that has yet to see this film do so now), Enemy and Prisoners – Sicario once more showcases the directors visual sensibilities and skill with creating an intensely crafted narrative and while Sicario may fall short on emotional sensibilities it's very likely it was another part of the reason why Villeneuve has been chosen to helm the soon to be shot Blade Runner sequel.<br/><br/>The lack of emotion that runs through Sicario, from its characters through to its cold as ice handling of life and death, is likely a long thought about process that falls hand in hand into the way in which even our central character of Emily Blunt's dedicated and by the book FBI Agent Kate Macer is thrown into a world she knows far less about than she'd ever have thought and how the essence of her mission directives remain clouded by a murky world of politics and dastardly deeds.<br/><br/>Viewers feel a sense of being overwhelmed much like Macer herself feels but through this quick-fire and often frenetic journey we get treated to a haunting Johann Johannsson score, some amazing scenery and sequences shot by legendary D.O.P Roger Deakin's (who in any other year not against The Revenant would've finally had his long overdue Oscar) and a Benicio Del Toro performance that can count itself very unlucky to have missed out on some more awards attention. It's a great reminder of Del Toro's talents and the arc of his mysterious character Alejandro is one that elevates the film whenever his on screen.<br/><br/>Sicario is easily one of 2015's most accomplished thrillers and an uncompromising look at how the drama playing out daily in Mexico through its illegal activities is steadily finding its way into the land of America whether the nation acknowledges it or not. Cold as ice but on fire in many departments, Sicario is sleek Hollywood movie making and another win for director Denis Villeneuve in what's quickly and assuredly becoming quite the career behind camera.<br/><br/>4 interrupted family dinners out of 5"

","Denis Villeneuve's directing is incredible. The story in unflinching and unrelenting. Taylor Sheridan's writing is superb. True suspense throughout. It's almost ruthless in it's approach. This film is not for the faint of heart. The one spoiler I will give away is this is not a love story, at ALL and it is a fast moving film and you can't miss a moment of it. It's intense from start to finish.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is outstanding and Benicio Del Toro demonstrates why he is an Oscar Award winner. Daniel Kaluuya was solid as was Josh Brolin. Great casting all the way through.<br/><br/>I'm an action junkie but I still want a good, engaging story and that's what this is. Intense, realistic action sequences. It's like you are right there in the scene.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of The Kingdom directed by Peter Berg. Just as intense, but with a more by the numbers pacing. I mean that in a good way. This is a very linear film, but it still has mystery to it. It has suspense, climatic elements, and intense action.<br/><br/>I must reiterate that this film has some brutal imagery. It is not for kids or adults that don't like graphic violence and again imagery. The landscape is decorated by human flesh, not grass and flowers.<br/><br/>Just a great film. I was captivated by it from the minute it came on. It blurs the line between good and evil and shows that a Grey area does exist and it is ugly and unforgiving."
"radamanthe","8","1","2","27 January 2016"," Gripping
","Excellent thriller that tries to throw light at the consequences of the war on drugs. Emily Blunt's character is involved in a barely legal military operation at the US-Mexican border, in order to bring down a brutal Mexican drug cartel, only to discover that the rationale for the operation was altogether different. I know that quite a few people here complain about the selection of Emily Blunt for the main role, but i believe she has done a great job together with the rest of the cast. Her natural fragility provides a nice contrast to the male dominated world she inhabits and highlights the compromises she eventually has to make. The movie's direction and cinematography are great providing some beautiful and dramatic landscapes and the music is also very good. Overall, one of the best movies of 2015."
"brchthethird","9","1","2","24 January 2016"," An excellent examination of the morally foggy ""War on Drugs""
","How far we should go in prosecuting the drug war is the main concern of SICARIO, the latest directorial effort by Denis Villeneuve. The violence brought about by America's war on drugs is a sensitive one because of the complex motives and casualties on both sides. This film doesn't really offer any answers, but it does provide enough to mentally chew on as the morally gray areas inherent in such an effort are explored. The audience's surrogate is Kate (Emily Blunt), an FBI agent who volunteers for an inter-agency task force that takes her into the heart of Mexico with the goal of finding a top boss in the cartel. Along for the mission is a mysterious person, Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), whose allegiance and motives are unclear (at first). If there's one weakness in the film, it's Emily Blunt's character, unfortunately. While she and her FBI partner provide the bulk of the dramatic conflict, she never really develops satisfactorily, instead relegated to a mostly passive observer. Benicio del Toro's character is by far the most interesting and compelling, and he get most of the best moments and dialogue. From a technical standpoint, SICARIO compares well with Villeneuve's other work and features outstanding cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins (who also worked on PRISONERS). Slow and deliberate camera-work nicely complements the slow-burn pacing, which culminates in one of the tensest (and morally ambiguous) scenes in recent memory. If there's one thing that this film does extremely well, it shows that the drug war has far-reaching effects from the top of the food chain down to a cop who is just trying to provide for his family (even if it is on the wrong side of the law). I should also mention the excellent score by Johann Johannsson, although a key element of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's style. If I had seen this last year, it most certainly would have made my top ten. As it stands, it further establishes Denis Villeneuve as a talent to be reckoned with and is suitably entertaining to boot."
"EBWaxes84","9","1","2","24 January 2016"," Denis Villeneuve marks himself as a big-time director, Emily Blunt is wonderful
","With Sicario, Denis Villeneuve has marked himself on my short list of ""Oh, that guy directed it? I'm in."" Which isn't to say that I don't find some issues with his storytelling (see: Third Acts). Sicario is properly brutal, properly beautiful, and has the actors and performances to rate it as one of the best films of the (albeit terribly soft) year.<br/><br/>I so loved Prisoners' style and moral quandary, and the same kind of feeling is put forth here. A quick must-needed note on Roger Deakins- the circle jerk is real and proper. His images are amongst the all-time best in Hollywood. Does Deakins have an exclusive agreement with the Teamsters that cut the deals with Clouds? His clouds are always perfect, and everything else is much the same. And some of his finest work has been in his two efforts with Denis Villeneuve.<br/><br/>THIS is the kind of movie Hollywood should be throwing these mid-sized budgets at. Reported at $30M, though I'd be surprised if it wasn't closer to $50M- it's money very well spent. The kind of film that was made with regularity in the 1970's-1990's, these are now complete anomalies. Though when seen through the success that Sicario and Prisoners have both had, and his projects lined up well into the future, it's safe to say this director now has carte blanche at this budget level, and slightly above it. And that's a DAMN good thing.<br/><br/>So what makes it stand out from the rest of the similar action-thrillers at this level? Quite simply... This story is about human beings. When there is gore, it's earned. When there are explosions, they are earned. When there are heated exchanges, they are so earned with well-placed character development and story structure that nothing ever feels gratuitous. That's the lesson that other ""action-thrillers"" need to learn from Sicario. Story and characters matter the most. Anything and everything must derive from that. And this director understands and embraces that.<br/><br/>This shows off very well in the performances. From the small supporting roles to Benicio's (quite predictable) turn- it's spot on. But no one shines as bright as Emily Blunt. With this and Edge of Tomorrow, she's also quick becoming- for me- one of those actresses that I want to see everything she ever does. She's that good- and she's a career best here. Reminder: Awards are dumb. She's vulnerable and strong at the same moment. THIS is a feminist performance we should be proud of- with all the conflicting human emotions that make us round and whole. On the surface, she may seem subjugated, but whereas a role like the lead in 'Brooklyn' is actually just a tidy bit of emotional manipulation to SEEM strong- Blunt's character actually IS strong. SHE IS A WOLF, Benicio! F you!<br/><br/>Okay... so let's get to that third act. Just like in Prisoners, the overwhelming need for a TWIST seems to get in the way of the momentum and well-designed plot of the film. If you know even the tiniest bit of ancillary information (or watched Entourage), the mention of the Colombian cartel in Act One is a pretty dead give away of exactly what is going on with Benicio's character. But I guess here is where Sicario feels like it earns it's stripes... Even though I saw that coming a mile away, it was still well-placed and spot on. It made sense for the character, and there was no ex machina necessary to provide it for us. So, it gets a slide, but there was too much time spent on twisty-twists in the last 1/3 of the movie overall. I wanted pure focus on Blunt's character. I think it would have made a stronger overall film. But it's a minor criticism in this year's swell of the under-whelming. So far, Sicario and Inside Out are the only film's I enjoyed thoroughly despite their hype.<br/><br/>Just one final note... I would be re-miss if I didn't mention the tiny baby shark jump that this film made when it decided the villains' climax needed to be expressed through lines taken literally from TAKEN. And even though they felt better and more appropriate here, c'mon... those lines were in Taken, pretty much verbatim.<br/><br/>Please Hollywood- I implore you- more mid-range budget films like Sicario all day. Less everything else you're putting real money into!"
"atlasmb","8","1","2","22 January 2016"," A Shadowy, Intense Film of Suspense
","""Sicario"" starts with a dramatic scene of police in action. At first, the viewer is ignorant of what is going down; then the story comes into focus and revelation after revelation changes the viewer's understanding as the tension ratchets up.<br/><br/>Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is a seasoned FBI agent with experience in kidnapping cases and she is part of the team in that first action, as they invade a house where they believe hostages are being held. In the wake of that mission, she is given a chance to work with a task force with obscure authority. They promise her an opportunity to bring down those who were responsible for the deaths of two of her colleagues.<br/><br/>As Kate enters the shadowy world of the War on Drugs, she is a witness, our surrogate, our eyes. The deeper the story goes, the more the operations feel outside authorized legal parameters. And Kate, who has always operated strictly within her authority, feels more nervous. <br/><br/>Also on the task force is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a quiet, inscrutable man who is intense. We eventually discover his background, his intentions, and his loyalties. That is the real story of ""Sicario"", though it is also about Kate's journey and her education (and ours).<br/><br/>It is tempting to write about the political ramifications of the film's story, but that would reveal too much. I will only say that the prime movers in the shadowy world of ""Sicario"" are granted their powers by those who purport to despise them.<br/><br/>Much of the film's atmosphere, and its suspense, are the result of superior photography and a wonderfully moody score. The acting is--like the story and the scenery--sparse but elemental to the film's tone. It is easy to see why ""Sicario"" is considered one of the best films of this year."

","The first thing that struck me with this movie is the score. It draws you in and put you in the mood of the scene that's before you. The score helps to set the tone and it's tense. You can feel the tension in the film but there's also something looming on the edges that you won't be able to get to for the better part of the movie. It can be frustrating but if you're like me, it's the best part of the movie because you're trying to figure out what's really going on.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful in its gore, some scenes are bloody, gritty and very graphic, but they're so masterfully directed that they feel natural. So natural indeed that Sicario also shows that life continues even in the midst of horror, destruction, and violence.<br/><br/>The tension never lets up, and it's mostly due to the charismatic performances in this film. Benecio Del Toro completely steals the movie, he is mysterious, charismatic, and menacing in this movie. There's a glimpse of a softer side to his character that only accentuates the more chilling parts of him. Emily Blunt is also very convincing in this film, she's as lost as the viewers are but her character hangs on and tries to piece together the puzzle that is laid out in front of her. As for Josh Brolin his presence on screen and performance complement Del Toro's.<br/><br/>Sicario a tension filled movie suffers from the trifecta of having a solid script by Taylor Sheridan, incredible performances by the main and supporting cast, and a great execution by Villeneuve. Sicario is the kind of movie you watch after a palate-cleanser type of film.<br/><br/>By @garcwrites"

","I went into this movie after watching only 1 trailer. I was prompted to see it by all the reviews people gave it. I noticed that the reviews are very polarized. People were either moved by it or repulsed. I had to see why. From the very first scene, I was drawn in. Having a peripheral involvement in law enforcement myself, I had more than a passing interest in this movie. I was not disappointed!!! Unlike many, I see the necessity of unconventional methods to stem the flow of drugs and to halt the violence created by it. This movie very graphically portrayed the nightmare that is Juarez, Mexico and its effect on the US. The acting of Del Toro, Brolin, Blunt and Kaluuya brought it all home in a very real way but I honestly think the first star of this movie was the cinematography. These images brought home by the type of photography used was pulse pounding and seemed as real as life itself. I was riveted to this movie from scene one not wanting to miss a moment. The soundtrack, subdued and VERY dark, fit the movie perfectly. I've rarely seen a movie this good! I highly recommend it!!!!!"

","Sicario follows an idealistic agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), who joins the team of a CIA Special Activities Division undercover officer named Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), and his partner Alejandro Gillick (Benicio del Toro). Macer, her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya), and the team they tagged along with attempt to track down numerous drug cartel leaders and have them arrested.<br/><br/>There are many positive aspects of this film that deserve to be pointed out, such as the relatively strong cinematography and score. The direction out of Denis Villeneuve, especially compared to his previous film, Prisoners, is very average in Sicario. Benicio del Toro delivers one of his strongest acting performances in years, even though his character, Alejandro, does not have much dialogue in the final cut of the film (originally his character had more, but most of his lines were cut due to Villeneuve's artistic vision.) Josh Brolin does a fine job, and so does Emily Blunt throughout the film. The strongest aspects of the film are probably the cinematography and the acting performances. The story however, was a little slow, with not enough dialogue to get an in-depth description about some of the characters, especially the character of Reggie. This was not much of a surprise, however, considering director Villeneuve's preference of more character movement and action, rather than long dialogue sequences. Later in the film (spoilers) we learn of Alejandro Gillick's true intentions, tracking down and killing the man who murdered his wife and daughter. This was a slight disappointment, considering that this was only a revenge film in disguise for a good portion of the film. In conclusion, not bad by any means, but surely many people expected more from it plot-wise, below are the scores:<br/><br/>Direction: 7/10, Cinematography: 8/10, Acting: 9/10, Music: 8/10, Screenplay: 6/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"

","In the lead up to the Oscar nominations being announced this year there was talk of 'Sicario' possibly sneaking in for a Best Picture nod. I held off seeing it until after the announcement for this reason. After seeing it I'm surprised it was really ever considered a contender. That's not to say it's a bad film, it's just not really the type of film that would often find itself nominated (even with the now extended field). For me it often came across as a film more intent on style over substance. Every character had to be ice-cool and every line had to be delivered so suavely that it took the air of realism out of a lot of scenes.<br/><br/>Oscar-worthiness aside though it's a very watchable and enjoyable film. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt are terrific, but the real movie stealer is Benicio Del Toro (and I don't often like him in films). He doesn't have a lot of lines but when he does you listen, because whatever he said is either going to be very cool or very important - or both. <br/><br/>A film dealing with the Mexican Cartel is always going to have its share of violence, but I never thought 'Sicario' delved into gratuitous levels. Hats off to director Denis Villeneuve for his handling of what can be a tricky balance to find. The movie has an air of mystery around it that keeps the audience wondering and there's never a boring scene in between things. It's a beautifully shot and very well made movie that won't disappoint audiences anywhere."

","Sicario would appeal to any ethical and sensitive viewer but falls short of being a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Bernicio Del Toro's performance in the movie in the first appearance (shots in the aircraft) was stagey. As the movie progresses, you begin to admire him. It is definitely Del Toro's best role to date.<br/><br/>Villeneuve as a director is above average but never raises stuns you. But I will continue to view his films in the firm hope that he will deliver a masterpiece down the line. You admire his ability to use visuals and music to build the mood with a certain maturity that is rarely encountered in Hollywood. But then he is a Canadian filmmaker first--and in Canada they use restraint with music and camera-work. Roger Deakins (cinematographer) and Johann Johannsson (composer of the music) contribute so much to raise the quality of the product.<br/><br/>Made in Hollywood, on a US subject, ""Sicario"" for me is closer to Canadian cinema in style and production tastes. Cinephiles will note the parallels between this film and a real Canadian film, Larysa Kondracki's ""The Whistleblower"" (2010) that exhibit in the screenplay and development of characters."
"latinotoons","6","1","2","7 January 2016"," Surprising? Only if you know nothing about the Drug War
","Instead of the gritty realistic film experience it pretends to be, SICARIO is a well shot, wholly unimaginative and thoroughly ""Gringo"" portrayal of the Drug War in which the US is a major player. <br/><br/>If realism were the goal, consulting journalistic sources like Mexico's PROCESO magazine or the now extinct BLOG DEL NARCO might have generated a more realistic script. Instead of the usual Hollywood fantasy of the 80s and 90s, with overt messages of invading a country in order to spark regime change, the film tries to subtly garner support for illegal black ops in Mexico as a necessary result of ""growing up"" as the unfortunate neighbor (and not the author) of the drug war. This is further reinforced by Blunt 's character, who reminds Del Toro of his daughter, who died an innocent. Optimistic, procedural Ms. Blunt survives but remains innocent and weepy throughout, the liberal attitude she represents clearly derided for able to cut it in the battle against the ""barbaric cartels"".<br/><br/>The film's violence, peppered throughout, is the result of competing cartels, and ""surgical"" US intervention. Gone are the golden years of yore when the CIA coordinated trafficking, money laundering, and guns smuggling from the US to Colombia, Colombia to Mexico, and Mexico to the US in one smooth operation. (If this is news to you, you might want to look into the Kerry Report , published in 1994). Monopolizing the business with support from the US military is the only solution the film proposes, which is a) not a solution; and b) nothing new. Wouldn't a Mexican Noriega be nice<br/><br/>Finally, with sparse dialogue— in poorly spoken Spanish no less— it seems that in spite of budget, actual Mexican actors and consultants were in short supply.<br/><br/>Anyone actually looking to understand the narco issue should consider watching EL INFIERNO (2010)."

","Sicario opens with a sense of dread that sustains itself for nearly the entirety of its running time - the cinematography, music, minimal dialogue and understated acting only adds to its effectiveness. I have seen each of Villeneuve's films since his first short -The Next Floor - and have watched him develop his style over time, and I think he has now delivered us his best film. <br/><br/>If there is one criticism I might have towards his films is that they do sometimes favor style over fully coherent or satisfying narratives and conclusions. His themes are bleak, and his characters often hopeless and desperate. There is very little light to be found, very little redemption. There is only a sustained horror, and a feeling of profound and captivating inevitability. That said, Sicario was a haunting picture, and stayed with me for days. The atmosphere of a film and how it resonates into your soul sometimes will trump narrative inconsistencies, and I think that is true for Sicario. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see his take on Blade Runner."

","I had high hopes for this film which is winning awards and getting some Oscar buzz. The cast is amazing and the storyline is very interesting. However, there are some very gross flaws in the direction and characters in the film that caused me to give it a 7 (maybe even a 6) out of 10. The handful of great moments of intensity make it worth a 7, but this is not a best picture nominee. Without giving away any spoilers, I can say the following: THE BAD:<br/><br/>* Emily Blunt character does (or fails to do) what you expect she would. She fails to ask questions or show some basic skills you would expect for someone in her position. * She is not believable in her professional or personal behavior. We don't really get her. Yes, she's conflicted, but there are 4-5 times where it makes no sense. * The story gets confusing and convoluted. Who are they going after and how and why and how does it all work out. Beyond implausible, it's like they edited 50% of the film away and left us with some gaping holes. * Governmental agencies are jumbled and confusing to an absurd level. * A few action scenes are absurd. * Random locations with random people where you do not know who they are nor why they are there.<br/><br/>What I love about feature films in theaters is the level of realism, acting and storytelling is generally FAR superior to any TV show or movie. In this case, the director handles the character development and action scenes more like a TV movie. The cave scene being the most absurd and the main character (Emily Blunt) feeling like a poorly written TV character. <br/><br/>Benicio and Josh Brolin have their moments of greatness, but their characters are too gruff to care much about them. There is another storyline about a Mexican police officer that is also poorly developed. <br/><br/>THE GOOD: You will feel like you understand the complexity of the Mexico-US drug crisis. For those who feel doing illegal drugs does not harm anyone, this movie will give you a clear picture of the dangers to society and the corruption that exists along the border. Clearly, we have major issues that must be addressed."

","'Sicario' is directed by the critically acclaimed filmmaker Denis Villeneuve and it is based on a screenplay written by Taylor Sheridan. Idealistic FBI agent Kate Macer(Emily Blunt) receives a top assignment when she gets recruited by a mysterious government official Matt Grover(Josh Brolin). Kate ends up joining a task force for the war against drugs. Led by the shadowy Alejandro(Benicio Del Toro), the team travels back and forth across the US-Mexican border with the objective of getting their hands on the top cartel bosses.<br/><br/>I have really liked Villeneuve's previous outings as a director. He has already shown that he has his own distinctive style. After watching 'Sicario', his already positive status in my head has been further enhanced and now I can genuinely say that he is one of the best filmmakers working today. Like 'Incendies', Villeneuve captures reality in the most visceral and brutal manner in 'Sicario'. Juárez gets captured in the most realistic and stripped down manner in this film. Roger Deakins' brilliant cinematography seamlessly complements Villeneuve's style. Even though what was being shown was at times downright disturbing, but I couldn't look away due to Villeneuve's command on the art of creating tension and Deakin's beautiful visuals.<br/><br/>Another very important aspect of the film to be admired is Taylor Sheridan's deeply meaningful script. Villeneuve allows the depth and the message of the script to come to the forefront by slowing down the pace of the film from time to time. This could have easily descended into a run-of-the-mill standard action thriller, but thankfully Sheridan's themes and Villeneuve's visual flair go hand in hand instead of one overpowering the other. The primary theme of the film is to address the reality of how blind the Americans and people from other 1st world countries can be to the grim realities of the backward nations and the people of these nations. We are unaware of the complexities of the problems that face the world and its people today. The unfortunate truth is that viewing the world's problems in black and white is no longer plausible. Especially when it comes to the drug importation problem, there is no other option but to maybe get our hands dirty by choosing the lesser evil to ensure the existence of some kind of order because eliminating the problem completely is almost impossible under the current situations. It paints a bleak, pessimistic but nevertheless a very poignant picture of the drug situation in the US borders. There is no chance to play by the book because the book itself has become obsolete.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character represents all of us. She gets thrown into the hell of Juárez and clearly she is not ready to handle the scenes, the events and the revelations that await her there. In the scene where she sees the horror that greets her on her first visit to Juárez, Villenueve used quick close-up shots of Blunt's face in between the sweeping shots of the streets to establish her shock at the sight of everything around her. It almost felt like a baby looking at the world which is unknown to him/her for the first time in amazement. Some critics have panned the film for making Kate a 'weak female character'. I completely disagree with that criticism. I don't think Kate was weak at all. She was a very skilled FBI officer who was idealistic and who wanted to do the 'right' thing by respecting the law in a Serpico- esque way. Even if her character would have been male, it wouldn't have made a difference in my eyes, because the main focus is not her gender, but her nationality and her moral sense in the context of the film. Josh Brolin uses his charisma and presence to make his character Matt quite intriguing. You never quite know what he is up to till the end. But for me the stand-out performance comes from Benicio Del Toro who plays Alejandro, the most mysterious character in the film. This might be Del Toro's best work in quite some time. Every gesture of his exudes control and dynamism. His character gets the most back story in the film and Del Toro excels in expressing the darkness behind those steely, brooding eyes.<br/><br/>Overall, I think 'Sicario' is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2015. It has brilliant characters with great actors portraying them. It has a virtuoso director at the helm with a screenplay that has depth. The film is dark, somewhat pessimistic in its themes and will leave the viewer a bit depressed and cold just like the mental condition that Blunt's character Kate descended into towards the end of the film, but that is what the film intends to do. Villeneuve and Sheridan want the viewer to face and experience the same dilemma that Kate goes through towards the end of the film and encounter the hopelessness of the real situation and needless to say they succeed with flying colours."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","4 January 2016"," Unnerving 'Sicario' constantly challenges its audience
","Law enforcement battles with drug cartels tend to be the focal point of bullet-ridden crime thrillers with strong ""Type A"" heroes and despicable villains and a handful of characters who cross the line between the two. ""Sicario,"" on the other hand, is good-and-evil gray area for endless miles.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve, who caught audiences by surprise in 2013 with the superb crime thriller ""Prisoners,"" returns with a film equally as intrigued with the ugly truth and that cares less about placating its audience and more about unsettling it.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt plays an idealistic FBI agent who is recruited and ultimately volunteers for a high-level government operation to take down a Mexican drug cartel. She soon discovers, however, that the mission is more clandestine than she bargained for and that the men in charge, played by Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro, don't share her same scruples.<br/><br/>Villeneuve puts debut writer Taylor Sheridan's script on a low simmer. He is patient and methodical with the camera, taking a procedural approach that both combats and complements a story about whether breaking the rules is okay if it effectively accomplishes the goal. All of his lingering creates these moments to let these questions of morality sink in as the story develops.<br/><br/>Consequently, the action and suspense of ""Sicario"" don't bare the same Hollywood hallmarks of most films in this genre. Villeneuve does not intend for the action to be exciting or entertaining. The violence is not glorified but dreadful and unsettling; much of it is actually withheld from the screen. The suspense naturally ferments from it all, rather than Villeneuve deliberately controlling the pacing.<br/><br/>The marriage of Villeneuve and cinematographer Roger Deakins proves fruitful yet again; the texture, color and light of the film are impeccable and Villeneuve savors the best of it. A tunnel raid sequence splicing ""normal,"" night and thermal vision is memorable for what you don't see as much as for what you do.<br/><br/>Blunt's subdued and understated performance echoes the understated tone of the film. She is vulnerable and shaken throughout the story yet exudes poise and self- confidence for a character swimming in a man-infested world and being forced to question everything she believes in. The film's commentary on sexism is subtle but wildly apparent to the keen viewer. <br/><br/>Brolin and Del Toro also nail the thin moral line of their respective characters, with Del Toro expertly cast as the cutthroat and shadowy Alejandro. You expect something menacing to emerge from such a formidable character actor, but his casting merely threatens such an explosion. Instead, we get something equally as effective but even-handed and chillingly reined in.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" shakes its audience from complacency in so many respects with these performances and stunning visuals. Nothing stays within the audience's comfort zone in terms of genre convention or even story for that matter. What is ""right"" or who is ""right"" are complex concepts in this film, not reliable constants. ""Sicario"" will unnerve just about everyone who sees it, but it also appropriately pushes its audience to expand its perspective and leave room for moral growth.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" (2015) is wonderfully filmed, crafted and acted movie, but storytelling is not it's highest point. Script is very realistic, but plot wasn't very good in my opinion, it is a bit messy story although viewer sees everything from point of view of our heroine, i wan't very engaged in this movie. That said the first 45 min of this movie are after they return from trip from Mexico are highlight of this movie. Cinematography is mesmerizing, surely an Oscar (at least) nominee. Directing was intense, acting is superb by all involved, but i liked Benicio Del Toro's acting in ""Traffic"" much more, it is very good performance, but not that great. After ~45 min mark this movie was a bit of a let down, as story becomes more and more murky, maybe a bit straightforward narrating would be better in this case.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Sicario"" is exceptionally well crafted movie, with great acting ensemble, amazing cinematography, very solid directing, but a bit to complex and difficult to follow plot. It is a very solid movie, but i was expecting a bit more involving one."

","Sicario blew me away. Not only is the story well-told, the cinematography is stunning, the tension is relentless but there's also some amazing acting, especially from Blunt. Her acting were just extraordinary. Even though she doesn't have that many lines she killed it. You don't need her to say anything because her face and eyes told you what you needed to know. All that makes this movie one of the best of 2015. Denis Villeneuve (the director of Sicario) did an amazing job. He also directed Prisoners (8/10 according to me) which was a stunning film so I have really high hopes on his next movies and I must say, it looks bright."

","Good actioner with the customary explosions and buckets of blood. It's about Mexican drug cartels and the DEA agents quest to break them up. Lots of good bad guys and bad good guys, the latter led by Benicio Del Toro, a Colombian hit man hired by the CIA due to his knowledge of the drug trade. He holds the picture together through the confusing narrative and takes it over towards the end of the film. He is excellent in his role.<br/><br/>Not so excellent is Emily Blount who plays a local drug enforcement agent from the Phoenix area hired to lend legitimacy to covert CIA operations by signing off on whatever occurs in their localized drug raid. She doesn't know this, giving credence to my title. Speaking for myself I am tired of Hollywood giving us movies with scrawny, underfed women presented as macho-types who can shoot, punch and drop f-bombs (""GI Jane"",""Lara Croft, Tomb Raider""). Not believable for a second, and hampers my efforts for a higher rating."

"howard.schumann","9","2","7","3 November 2015"," A tense and involving thriller
","The ""War on Drugs,"" first proclaimed by President Richard Nixon in 1971, escalated in the 1980s to the extent that by 1997 over 400,000 people were imprisoned for misdemeanor, nonviolent drug–related offenses. In an ideal world it would be easy to distinguish between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" working in the drug war, but in the world of intelligence agencies, drug kingpins, and local police, the distinction is murky and the end justifies the means, whether legal or not.<br/><br/>In Dennis Villeneuve's sizzling Sicario (Spanish for hit-man), written by Taylor Sheridan, the naive and humane often find themselves only as pawns in the game. Such is the case with, Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), an idealistic FBI agent (is that an oxymoron?) who wants to play by the rules. She is asked to join an inter-agency task force but has no clear idea of why she was selected, who the people really are that she is working with, or what the ultimate goal of the mission is.<br/><br/>All she is told is that she and her colleague, Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) will be assisting in hunting a dangerous drug lord, and that she will work with Matt (Josh Brolin), a disheveled looking man who wears flip-flops and a stout, enigmatic man named Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), both alleged government contractors working for the Department of Defense. On their first meeting, Matt tells Kate, ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears, and you will doubt everything we do."" When the truth eventually does come out, it does not in fact make sense and the results are not pretty.<br/><br/>The film opens with a raid by the FBI and an Arizona SWAT team on a house owned by a drug lord near the Mexican border. To a pounding soundtrack by Johann Johannsson that ratchets up the intensity, the agents discover the gruesome sight of twenty-five dead bodies covered in plastic bags sealed into the walls of the house and a subsequent explosion that leaves several agents dead. It is a high-octane opening that sets the tone for the rest of the film. Though Kate is told she will be going to El Paso, she finds herself in Ciudad Juarez, a seedy border town that looks like you just skipped purgatory for the real thing.<br/><br/>In Juarez, the convoy of intelligence agents is accompanied by a police escort but Kate is told never to trust the police and to have her gun ready at all times. Along the way they come across one of the city's main tourist attractions, rows of dismembered bodies, presumably of illegal immigrants, hanging on a highway overpass. The treats are just beginning, however.<br/><br/>Soon we will witness a fierce shootout at a border crossing as a convoy of intelligence agents is attempting to bring captured drug boss Guillermo Diaz (Edgar Arreloa) to the US, and a tunnel crossing project that is designed as a diversion to allow Alejandro to come back to Mexico to complete his murderous revenge mission. After Kate learns the truth about Alex and realizes that the purpose of the mission was not to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. but to see who can control them to maximum profit, she is told by Alejandro, ""You will not survive here. You are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves now.""<br/><br/>Sicario is a tense and involving thriller with brilliantly conceived set pieces and outstanding performances by the three leads. It is Blunt, however, who is the standout, the moral center of the film whose choice to play the game or face death is a choice none of us should ever have to make. If the message of the film is just to tell us that moral compromise is the way the world works, it would not justify the screen being littered with dead bodies. It may, however, have a deeper message, one that suggests that legalization and regulation of the drug trade may be the only thing that could end this tragic standoff."
"vav-61764","9","2","7","2 November 2015"," Where The Weak Have No Place
","Addressing an issue significantly disturbing and heavy, Sicario brings up the sad reality of the fear and terror brought by the drug war between the cartels and governments in the borders of U.S. and Mexico. This movie makes you realize that this subject is not just black and white but has much more layers to its cause and happenings. In this fight for the control, there is no good guys, but a constant contest of who's in the command, and as always, the most affected are those who have nothing to do with the situation.<br/><br/>Sicario has some very repulsive scenes, they give a glimpse of the horrors that cartels are able to do in the places where they run. The partnership between Denis Villeneuve, director, and Roger Deakins, cinematographer, built a well-crafted film. As a result, the movie has a coherent and compelling story combined with some distinguished shots, such as aerial takes or outdoor scenes. The weight pressure in Emily Blunt's character, Kate Macer, is always noticeable as she's the one who is the most unfamiliar to what is done in these trenches of the conflict. The tense soundtrack cooperates to immerse the public in this picture since the tension only grows as the film progresses. Kate Macer is a FBI Agent who has a strict mentality in following the rules to do her job and is caught up in a situation where the rules are put aside in order to achieve the objectives. Emily Blunt's performance is incredible, her performance made the character very interesting and believable, as she's in a place where she might not belong. Josh Brolin plays Matt Graver, a government agent in charge of a task force that aims to break the cartel from its core, he passes the idea of being an arrogant and presumptuous guy, but he's willing to do anything to reach his objective. Alejandro, Benicio Del Toro's character is the most intriguing much due to the mystery around the character seeing that his goals or who he respond for his acts remains a secret."
"lwood28","9","2","7","24 October 2015"," ""One Of The Best Films Of 2015 So Far""
","Sicario is so far one of my favorite movies of 2015 so far. The acting in this film is outstanding. This is probably one of my favorite performance from Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin is also really good in the film too. The one performance that really sticked out the most was Benicio del Toro. His character was just scary and a bad-ass. I really do think Benicio del Toro is Oscar-worthy. Same thing goes for the score and cinematography. Also the directing from Denis Villeneuve is also Oscar worthy and it's one of the best directed films so far this year. Villeneuve is starting to become one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. The story is very tense and in the end you'll feel disgusted and shocked. Overall if your a fan of thrillers or very intense story telling then this is the film for you."
"bschultz_the_pally","7","2","7","12 October 2015"," Sicario is far from being a bad movie, but it's far from being a great one
","Sicario opens on the desert Arizona landscape. It's quiet. A platoon of armed agents tiptoe towards a small house, and moments later, the movie explodes when they burst through with a battering ram. The structure of this scene sums up the entire film; quiet and tense scenes, followed suddenly by an explosion of action and violence; rinse, lather, repeat.<br/><br/>Maybe the trailer was too good. Maybe the promise of Dennis Villeneuve's recent hits led to my high expectations; but unfortunately, Sicario did not meet them, and it's the exact formula above that hurts the film. After it's tense opening scene, the movie takes its time establishing its other players, like Matt Graver (played by the excellent Josh Brolin), a macho operative for an unknown agency who grants Kate Macer (played by the fierce Emily Blunt) the opportunity to find the men responsible for the deaths of other agents in the raid. <br/><br/>Although the movie doesn't comment directly, it shows just how unacknowledged and small a woman can feel in a world dominated by men; testosterone and male camaraderie fill the room at a debriefing full of agents with Kate being the only woman present. On the outskirts of the group, like her, is the mysterious Alejandro Gillick (played by the always-amazing Benicio Del Toro), an old friend of Matt's who may or not may be working with the same agency. However, his ultra-reserved personality gives Kate enough reason to question the mission, and she gets no answers.<br/><br/>This poses a big problem for the movie. The audience isn't really clued in at all as to who these agents are trying to find or why- not until the eleventh hour at least. Like Kate, the audience plods along into the unknown, frustrated with the lack of answers. Some of the action set pieces help to break up the monotony, but it doesn't help that the scenes in between crawl at a snail's pace, partially because each new location is punctuated by six or seven establishing shots each. Perhaps the editor did not want to cut some of the footage shot by the great Roger Deakins, but after one or two impressive helicopter POV's, you start to fight the urge to check the time.<br/><br/>It is not until a domestic brawl over an hour into the film that Sicario starts to give the audience some clues, but the movie truly reaches new heights in a scene that is a spectacle of suspense and action, reminiscent of the raid at the end of Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty just a few years ago. Through the rest of its duration, Sicario is unrelenting in action, twists, and the advancement of plot. It proves just how great Sicario could have been if it had just stayed in the editing room a little longer. The movie pulls no punches, so it's a shame that it takes way too much time to cool down between each punch, and only waiting until the end to pummel the audience into awesome submission.<br/><br/>The best parts about the film include:<br/><br/> Roger Deakins' understated camera work  The high-intensity action sequences  Benicio Del Toro<br/><br/>The things that don't work in the film include:  The exposition; the film takes too long to clue us in on what is going on  The idea of the film; Sicario might leave off on a great note, but without much purpose  The editing; ten minutes or so could have easily been cut from the film and advanced the movie at a much better pace<br/><br/>Sicario is far from being a bad movie, but it's far from being a great one. It's performances aren't showy, and I appreciate Villeneuve's subtle direction in contrast to his earlier film Prisoners, but the movie stretches a thin amount of plot over a large amount of time, and though it packs a hell of a punch at the end, it feels a bit hollow and leaves nothing to think about. Drop the expectations and perhaps you'll be able to enjoy the film more than I did."
"themadmovieman","7","2","7","8 October 2015"," An intelligent and enthralling drama that just lacks big thrills
","This is another impressive film from the director of Prisoners and Enemy, Denis Villeneuve. Much like those two films, Sicario is extremely gritty, violent and dark, full of hopeless despair and horrifying crime, but it works brilliantly in making an intriguing story throughout, and although it may not be the most exhilarating thriller you'll see this year, it remains an intelligent and very solid movie overall.<br/><br/>The story follows an FBI agent, acclaimed for her work in coping with cartel activity in Arizona, who is called up to take part in a much larger operation across the border in Mexico. The main reason that this film is so interesting, however, is that it doesn't look at the operation as a simple affair, but instead presents it in a very critical light.<br/><br/>The CIA's activities in Mexico are notorious, but this film doesn't assume it's all good and about justice, and very cleverly blurs the line between what's right and what's wrong in a desperate situation such as this. As a result, you always have the opportunity throughout this film to think hard about the ethical and political consequences of what's being depicted, and it makes it a much more interesting watch than you would initially expect.<br/><br/>That's another huge strength of this film, that it takes the story in so many different directions that you don't see coming. Shying away from a generic crime thriller, Sicario is hugely unpredictable, and although it doesn't necessarily succeed in making a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat experience, there are always surprises to come (very similar like the political thriller Zero Dark Thirty).<br/><br/>One of the other most impressive parts of the story is the portrayal of Benicio Del Toro's character. Yes, Emily Blunt is technically the protagonist, but her character isn't the most dramatic or exciting to follow, it's actually Del Toro that will really hook you on this film, as he plays a man full of mystery.<br/><br/>You really don't know where this guy's alliances lie, and as you're fed small pieces of information about him having seen some really bad stuff in the past, he just becomes absolutely fascinating, pulling you further into the drama of the story even more.<br/><br/>Finally, the direction by Denis Villeneuve is excellent. Again, he makes the film appear completely without hope, increasing the stakes significantly and making for more intrigue, whilst it's also a simply beautifully-shot movie to watch, with epic wide shots of the Mexican landscape, as well as enticingly dark images of some of the more gritty and depressing areas."

Especially Emily Blunt's character's ambivalence towards the participation in the scheme is not at all explained. The story could have created a backup story such as a father who instilled by-the-book idealism or something of that sort.

","In this case the character was the star of the movie. Ditch Emily Blunt and it's a great thriller.<br/><br/>I'm not much of a fan of movies these days as episodic television series have usurped the entertainment role formerly held by features, at least how I see things. I didn't expect to like this movie at all but I didn't allow my negative preconceptions to get in the way of enjoying the heck out of most of the film. The scenes were mostly brilliant and everything you should expect from a big-budget Hollywood thriller. The long sequence of the SUV convoy into very hostile Juárez territory ranks right up there with any action scene ever. I found myself staring in amazement at many shots in the film: a desert sky at night, ominous clouds on the horizon, drone shots of a barren landscape, and many more. A visual masterpiece! It's too bad this movie wasn't made into a series instead as its two hour runtime just wasn't nearly enough to tell this complex story. The characters played by Benicio del Toro and Brolin were only vague hints of what they could have been given a lot more time. The Mexican cop, Silvio, took up way too much screen-time whereas in a series his part could have been a great sideline instead of the distraction it was in the feature. His first scene clocked in a less than two minutes yet it seemed way too long for me.<br/><br/>The characters of Emily Blunt and her partner were almost completely superfluous to the story. Remove both of them and the plot would barely have missed a beat. She is little more than a pawn in the story yet much of the focus was on her.<br/><br/>When Alejandro talks about the boss of bosses in Mexico he says, ""To find him would be like discovering a vaccine."" He is 100% right so why is she so hostile to their operation? Why does she continue if she is so opposed to it? I never understood this aspect of her character and for me it took away a bit of believability for the story. Her boss asked her if she thought they were winning the drug war even though they had prosecuted more felony drug cases in the past year than in the two previous years. This was a question a reporter put to the ""Drug Czar"" William Bennet during his time in that post in the 1980s. He stuttered and stammered but was unable to give a coherent answer. We aren't winning and she knows it as well as anyone. So why isn't she on board? If she isn't on board what does she propose?"

When things don't go as cleanly as she thought they would bringing a prisoner back from Mexico, she starts questioning Matt and Alejandro's (Benicio Del Toro) motives.<br/><br/>As we learn more about the operations underway and get more attached to Kate's character, they switch the ending to focus more on Alejandro. I was fine with how things went, but it felt like a very abrupt ending to what Kate was trying to accomplish and just took the rug out from under her, without much closure. The last scene you saw her come to terms with what happened, but it felt like there was something missing.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie was amazing and I was drawn in right from the beginning about the attention to detail they gave in every shot. All the actors brought their A game, and you never felt bored watching any of them. The music built the suspense when needed and set the mood elsewhere. I just wish the end of the story gave a little more resolution to Kate's character."

","Unfortunately, I can't share the enthusiasm with which some others here review this movie. While I do agree that the plot-line is quite clever and that you don't really guess what will be revealed in the end, there are mainly two major issues that kind of ruined the film for me.<br/><br/>The first thing is that I find the characters quite unbelievable. With the exception of Benicio del Toro maybe, all of the characters remain flat. There is an agent that is supposed to carry out the toughest missions and worst crimes imaginable, that is, apart from all moral doubts, close to tears for literally all of the movie. I don't think that a person with her characterization would have ever gotten into such a position. On the other end of course, the tough experienced fighter, who sleeps in the plane and wears flip flops at work, not caring of anything because he is way above it all. I really don't get what is so hard about creating believable characters. Those are definitely not.<br/><br/>The second is that this is again America over everything. Maybe not concerning the moral but apart from that there are the American Super-Forces who show the simple people in Mexico how to do the job.<br/><br/>All in all, those two points drew my attention away from the plot so much that I couldn't really enjoy the good sides, that definitely are there. Shortly said: This is not a Don't-watch but it's, and here I disagree, one of the best movies of any year."

","""Sicario"" leaves you with bitter feelings; it's like too real for its own good. You can't help but look at the world as an ugly, violent and merciless place where only wolves can survive and sheep only pray for never crossing their paths. That the heroine spends most of the time totally powerless and clueless about what's going around her is very revealing of ""Sicario""'s message: there's no place for little hearts when it comes to fight drugs, money and corruption.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt plays Kate, an FBI agent joining a CIA unit, lead by undercover officer Matt, played by Josh Brolin, for a mission in the Mexican borders. The target is a drug cartel overlord, indirectly responsible for the deaths of two SWAT agents, during a kidnapping rescue mission in Arizona, where one of his men, made a big hole on the wall with his shotgun before getting an equal treatment from Kate's rifle. The hole revealed dozens of corpses rotting inside and to viewers a foretaste of what ""Sicario"" is heading to. This is no playground party, the stuff that'd rather make SWAT agents go outside and throw up.<br/><br/>And don't get fooled by the presence of a FBI female agent, she doesn't pull a Clarice Starling or other Girl-powers trendy Hollywood tricks over the course of the film. During the operations, you can visually take her pulse, she represents our perspective, she's not a rookie, but in fact, she is. She discovers the world just as we do, and while expecting her to reach a breaking point, as the film progresses, I found extremely refreshing to have such a passive protagonist, totally frozen by tension or fear. And don't take it as machismo, but this is the kind of vulnerability that makes Kate a realistic character. Yes, there can be powerful female cops, but in a hand-to-hand fight with a guy, it's another story.<br/><br/>And ""Sicario"" story seems to convey the message that only wolves can survive by displaying the same level of savagery and mercilessness as their enemy. We live in a Darwinian world, where your survival doesn't rely on giving the other cheek, but being as strong as the predator, becoming one basically. And when wealth buys more protection, you gotta get stronger than all the levels of protections put together and this is where intervenes Alejandro, Matt's Colombian partner, magnificently portrayed by Benicio Del Toro. You can tell that Brolin had a lot of fun playing Matt, and I mean that positively, it made me enjoy his character, but it was as delightful to see Alejandro being the yin to Matt's yang, and keeping this mask of mystery for two thirds of the film, and still strike as a complex and enigmatic character, even after you get all the answers.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" is built on a complex and intricate plot where we never know exactly the real goals and motives of everyone, who is the good cop and the bad cop anyway? And Kate, along with her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) are kept in the dark, just like we are. And we have no other choice than follow the course of the investigation, another masterpiece of documentary-like realism, reminiscent of great gripping 70's thrillers like ""The French Connection"" or ""The Day of the Jackal"". For instance, we're used to see aerial views of cities in action movies, but they never have been so significant to the plot than in ""Sicario"". We see the city of Juarez and we can observe it was build on a grid plan. Later, when we follow the long ballet of Police cars crossing the city, we can spot suspicious ones driving along parallel roads, and with the aerial view in mind, it all makes sense.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" is full of long panoramic takes, that never, never feel like exercises in style, it's always part of the narrative while adding a great aesthetic touch. It's a shame Roger Deakins will probably lose the Oscar to Lubeski's work in ""The Revenant"", but while the cinematography in ""The Revenant"" was close to perfect, I think the dazzling beauty of the natural locations helped a lot, while it takes some great work to make something beautiful out of slums or the sight of random and banal urbanism. The cinematography is also useful as the plot is focused on a world of violence and ugliness (you can't get uglier than a place where women and children can be killed, hanged, tortured and so forth) so the form works like a sort of relief from a rather heavy-loaded and difficult-to-watch content.<br/><br/>I applaud ""Sicario"" for its realism and its roughness, it's like raw meat with a delicate taste. The film was directed by Denis Villeneuve, and you can tell this is the work of an outsider, not an American, it's the Canadian school of brutal realism in a beautiful and subtly perverse way. The film reminded me of another masterpiece directed by a Canadian: David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"", a story that also shows that some people have violence in their blood, and if you don't want to be the victims, you either fight or you flee as far as you can.<br/><br/>And this is the message of the final confrontation that I won't dare to spoil. A lesser movie would have made the heroine do something very specific with the object she was given, a lesser movie would have made her a plain heroine, but the way it ended was faithful to the spirit of the film, and within its roughness, was a 'beautiful' ending.<br/><br/>I'd almost feel guilty to think the movie as beautiful while it deals with such ugliness, but how about the title itself, ""Sicario"" is such a pleasant, charming, almost lyrical word to pronounce, we wouldn't suspect it's the Latin historical word for 'hired killer'. There's a lot of ugliness behind the world's seemingly beauty, and after ""Sicario"", we long for the opposite experience."
"Zensha","6","1","3","16 February 2016"," A story that could have been told in a few sentences
","The plot feels realistic. But perhaps a little too realistic that it feels more like a broadcast from a news channel instead of a movie. <br/><br/>Any story can be summarized into a synopsis and told within a few sentences, and Sicario made me feel like it's more of a synopsis than a full-length movie, mainly due to the lack of character development and plot details.<br/><br/>***Spoiler Alert***<br/><br/>Similar to what some of the reviewers have already mentioned, I found myself questioning throughout the entire film why Blunt's role was even necessary (her acting was good though). They could have had Toro play the main character and added more depth to him. And even if they did need to pick a domestic agent, surely a more suitable person for the job would be an agent who would be more likely to agree to their unconventional methods, instead of a door-kicking naive girl who gets in the way all the time.<br/><br/>And why was here a need for Blunt to point a gun at Toro outside the tunnel when she didn't even know what the hell was going on? That was all in all a really silly decision to make. What about the bodies in the house? Was there a need to go through the trouble of hiding them behind the walls?<br/><br/>Too much time was spent on Blunt's character, which wasn't really going anywhere at all. Much more could have been done if the script was written better. I give it a 6 because firstly the acting was decent. Toro and Blunt was great, but I couldn't take Brolin seriously at all. I guess they were trying to make him into a hard ass character who never failed to laugh when everyone else looked dead serious, but to me he was just plain annoying. And secondly the movie felt like an accurate depiction of real life issues, which I found quite educational."

"alexrwatson-888-169026","9","1","3","1 January 2016"," Violent and Thought-provoking work of art
","Sicario is about Kate (Emily Blunt), a rising FBI agent that volunteers for a government task force charged with controlling the US/Mexico drug war. With the shady legality of the escalating actions of this government task force, Kate begins to doubt whether or not she's the right person for this war on drugs. Sicario is violent and thought- provoking, a rare combination that left me entertained but also thinking about the hard questions Sicario is not afraid to ask.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt plays Kate and once again proves that she can carry a film. Her character is strong-willed but is pushed to brink with the many morally questionable actions this task force begins to take. Her mental and physical deterioration serves as an emotional anchor for the audience to latch onto while the brutal actions of Sicario unfold. <br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro also gives a great performance as Alejandro, a secretive agent to this government task force. His character is damaged, and Del Toro does a great of conveying the darkness Alejandro possesses. Alejandro is also a very unique character and is one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Josh Brolin is in this film, but the more and more I see from him, the less I am impressed. Brolin comes across very one-note in terms of his performances, and this is once again the case as he plays the leader of the government task force. He isn't bad but is very forgettable.<br/><br/>The border war on drugs is ugly, and violent, and Sicario doesn't hold anything back. This film is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy), and he is one of my favorite directors working today. He again collaborated with 12 time Oscar-nominee cinematographer Roger Deakins for Sicario, and together they capture the brutal nature of the war on drugs without any gimmicks. There's no shaky, hand-held camera capturing the action, and there isn't an overuse of cuts during the intense sequences. The shocking action is seen perfectly clear, which is sharply contrasted to the moral uncertainty of the characters on both the American and Mexican sides.<br/><br/>Mexicans are not just the bad guys, and Americans are not just the good guys. Sicario does such a great job of presenting all these characters on both sides and letting the audience decide for themselves who are the real ""bad"" guys. While Sicario makes you question the characters' moral decisions, it also brings up an important questions that comes with the border drug war. Do the ends justify the means? Questions like this kept me contemplating the film's stunning events long after its initial runtime.<br/><br/>One gripe I do have with the film is it gets exposition heavy at points, particularly near the end. Sicario tells a great story and I wish the filmmakers would have trusted the audience a little more to understand what was going on rather than spoon-feeding information.<br/><br/>Sicario is an adrenaline rush from start to finish, with standout performances from Blunt and Del Torro. This combined with thought- provoking storytelling makes for one of the best films of the year. Keep an eye on the film during award season. So if you were on the fence (pun intended), make the leap and go see this film."
"FantasticMrK","9","1","3","1 January 2016"," Excellent Movie
","This movie, as expected from its trailers, was very good. The darkness of the movie, the darkness of the soundtrack, the gravity that pulls you in the movie is so good and strong that will actually make you feel the tension going on in the movie. Sicario, has a great story line, great Role play, far beyond expected, (in a good way!). A bit brutal, on killings, and other bad things, extremely advised for adults who like thrillers and for younger it is not fairly good for anyone under 17. Although things could be better while making the film, like gunfights, and etc. Even still it deserves good points. There were some bloopers making the film, which were totally acceptable, but afterwards, when you remember them, they may bother you, things I'm talking about are actually really tiny stuff, which of course will be a big spoiler, so I won't mention."
"Dr_Aristotle","7","1","3","21 December 2015"," Unrelenting Suspense
","This movie is certainly an interesting one, though it's not for everyone. On a technical level, the movie is very proficient, but the atmosphere it creates is both is biggest asset and weakness.<br/><br/>The actors all do a great job making their characters feel very dimensional; they feel like they have pasts and lives outside of the events of the movie. Benicio Del Toro does an extraordinary job portraying a steely, reserved hit-man, his precision over the course of the movie being very captivating. Emily Blunt is also a standout, having the arguably tougher role of portraying a by-the-book officer who refuses to compromise her morals. I've seen others deriding her performance because of their dislike for the character, but Blunt does a magnificent job and helps elevate the movie.<br/><br/>How much you will enjoy the movie is heavily based in how you interpret it's characters. If you believe that ends justify the means, then you will love Del Toro's character, and all he represents, while despising Blunt's. However if you believe that it's important to do things the correct, legal, and moral way, then you will appreciate what Blunt's character represents, and more likely get more out of the movie.<br/><br/>Another strong aspect of the movie is the music, which does a perfect job conveying a suspenseful mood. Whether it's a subtle humming or ambient thumping that builds over time, it makes you feel the tenseness that the characters do. Similarly the cinematography is breathtaking. It's wonderfully varied, makes great use of darkness and color, and is easy to follow along with. The shots match what the character's feel, whether it makes you feel on edge or on like a calm to a cold degree.<br/><br/>However how much you appreciate all these aspects is heavily dependent on if you enjoy the atmosphere of the film, which is a cold/distanced one. All of our characters are basically closed off people, which can make it difficult to connect or empathize with them. The plot isn't anything unique or especially captivating, so if you don't find the characters interesting and appreciate the movie's callous, unrelenting demeanor, it won't be enjoyable. The movie doesn't shy away from how it presents its subject matter, which makes it more difficult to get into, but all the more enjoyable if you do.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie, though I don't think I'll ever watch it again. However, I am glad to have experienced, and would recommend it to others."

","""Sicario"": This wasn't even a horror movie and I know that I'm probably going to have nightmares from this for the rest of my life. ""Sicario"" is the story about an FBI agent who joins a small group in attempts to put an end to a drug lord in Mexico. The intensity from its bleak tone is spine tingling, unafraid in going into the sheer depths of what true evil humanity is capable of. There are scenes in this movie where it is almost a descent into hell. That is how it is shot and how the score is playing over the select sum of scenes where that's the mood it is presenting. I feel sick to my stomach because this was a truly great film that dragged me into a pit of corpses. The opening scene deals with an entire house filled with dead bodies stored inside the walls, rotting away. At any moment someone could get shot in the back of the head like it was any normal daily routine, at least that is the mood that is set here. To the point where I wondered if I was going to get shot because of this movie. This is as dark as it gets; this isn't a straight up action film or thriller, but it is a blend of the two while bringing in a mystery to it as well that is actually compelling which is something that has become very rare nowadays, in my opinion. Everything about this movie worked; the direction was bleak and moody, the cinematography was gorgeous, the soundtrack was haunting I'm not kidding when I say that my heart was on the verge of a panic attack because of the musical score alone. The acting was great; Benicio Del Toro was full on intimidating in this, but while at the same time not being a two dimensional character. Del Toro's character is shady and mysterious at first, which is what drew me in and the movie could have not said another word about his back story and I still would have felt threatened by him. But when it doesmy goodnessthis is some real darkness going on. Emily Blunt's character, Kate, is easy enough to route for, but at times I wondered exactly what her purpose was to the plot for a small portion of the film. However, it did explain a few things making a lot more sense as to why she is there. Josh Brolin his also having some fun as this equal parts laid back hard a-- agent. Every character in this feels three dimensional, even when not much is learned about someone they still feel real. But this movie does take the time out to even show a minor character's living situation; we see the ins and outs of his daily life. In any other film he'd probably only be in one scene, but this movie has him and his family come in and out through the whole movie. This was a great piece of film making that scared me half to death. I thought that it was amazing and if you haven't seen it, see it. I'm gonna go take a breath or two"

During the operation her personal boundaries and beliefs are greatly challenged.<br/><br/>The cast is good, especially Del Toro and Brolin are outstanding. Main character Kate, portrayed by Emily Blunt is a bit bland to my liking and gets overshadowed by her male counterparts. She also seems just a little bit too pretty for the part.

"Red_Identity","Null","1","3","19 December 2015"," Astute, austere, and technically marvelous
","This was not what I expected, but perhaps that's why it was so talked about and loved by many. A contemplative, quiet thriller that is technically marvelous. It starts off really solid, but it's only as it keeps going that it really grabs you and shakes you in a powerful way. On the surface, I was ready to call its main flaw being its thin screenplay, but it's definitely in its third act where everything seems to pay off in terms of what it was doing and how it was altering expectations of some sort. I don't think the reveal of Del Toro and Brolin is surprising, but it also didn't seem to go entirely like I had assumed it would It reminds me a lot of Drive in terms of its mood being its primary strength and the reason its screenplay seems to come full circle by the end. Like I said, visually marvelous without calling attention to itself. Its assured editing, score, and cinematography probably make it a stand-out in each of those categories. I don't think there are many more films as carefully-drawn as this one this past year. Del Toro should have been in contention for more awards and for an Oscar nomination, and Emily Blunt's ""Quiet, strong action heroine type"", although it's threatening to become a cliché by this point, is to its full effect here. I liked Incendies and Prisoners well enough (although the latter's screenplay drag it down quite a bit), but last year Villeneuve really showed his directorial skills, and they're just heightened here in his best film yet"
"billygoat1071","Null","1","3","30 October 2015"," Powerful Dread
","Sicario is a movie where you breathe danger. It paces quite long and slow, allowing you to linger a progress that may result to something horrifying in their case. This is an FBI versus cartel thriller, but it's not about the information between the feud. It's about showing how corruption tears this world apart and the people who still cares about their morals end up being helpless to get things right. This is a terribly bleak world and that's what makes Sicario a powerful experience. It establishes the dark side of their mission until there is no longer safety on their ground.<br/><br/>The plot is basically a manhunt after a drug lord. And when FBI agent, Kate (Emily Blunt), joins with the CIA on this search, there is already something fishy about the operation, starting from introducing Alejandro (Benicio del Toro.) And it just keeps revealing more dirty strategies of finding their target, while the main character keeps getting annoyed by it. And that's pretty much the details you need to know about the story, because what this movie mainly offers is how things really go wrong with their decisions. Defeating their enemy isn't always triumphant when others get to die horribly, but their plan is their own justice and Kate has nothing to do about it, no matter how much she tries.<br/><br/>And the simple merit here is Denis Villeneuve's direction. This is the filmmaker who knows how to create atmosphere. He made a movie, that you have no idea who exactly the villain is, feel terrifying, despite of not making any sense. In Sicario however, it's all over the place. Violence can occur at any turn ;the quieter the scene, the scarier it would be; because the director expertly designed it that way. It's as remarkable as the cinematography really taking you into the bleakness and the horror, from wider angles to something else. The opening scene, the highway scene and so one; it's just brims so much suspense that overpowers a lot of thrillers this year. The acting is equally subtle; Emily Blunt makes her role relatable enough, but it's Benicio del Toro who brings it to the table by making his role both intimidating and quietly human. Josh Brolin is just fun. That is all.<br/><br/>Sicario is really about experiencing how things really go wrong and the moral complexities of their mission. The obvious, you won't find any good guys or heroes here. Good ideals will always struggle, violence will always be their easier justice; which makes the world a crueler place. And the movie pictures it terrifically; from imagery to atmosphere, we all know how its tension works: it's all ticking bomb. It takes you away from the comfort zone completely and lets you linger on uglier details and deadlier places. It's chilling, yet magnificent. It's an incredible kind of hopelessness that you'll have to swallow."

","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: Another story about the drug wars that gives us more of the same but with style <br/><br/>GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Sicario means hit-man. That is all you need to know to understand the underlying theme in this thriller about the drug wars. There will be much blood, carnage, revenge, and savagery. That is part of the territory in this crime genre and Sicario follows that proved formula and rarely strays off course. That is both its strength and its weakness. The literate screenplay by Taylor Sheridan shows the gritty and grisly side of the Mexican cartel and its ongoing success in illegal drug trafficking.<br/><br/>￼We follow an idealistic F.B.I. recruit, Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), as she undertakes an new assignment, meeting unsavory characters and slowly learning the corrupt system that is in place in this drug-infested borderland area between the USA and Mexico. In her baptism under fire, she partners with two old pros: Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), a gruff but knowledgeable government agent in charge of the operation, and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a tough and intense policeman with many secrets and demons. The three actors are fine in their roles and make their characters very believable. Adding strong support are Daniel Kaluuya as Kate's partner and Jon Bernthal as Ted, a one-night stand.<br/><br/>￼This is standard but effective storytelling. Nothing much surprises here plot-wise, but director Denis Villeneuve adds many nice visuals to this conventional tale. (The talented Roger Deakin's cinematography helps immensely.) The film's chief asset is the director's skill in contrasting the common lives of the Mexican people and their nonchalant attitude about the crime and violence that infects their everyday existence in the subtlest of ways. He doesn't shy away from the horror of decaying corpses or bloodied victims caught in the crossfires of the drug wars, sometimes lingering too long at the grotesque images he creates.<br/><br/>￼Sicario takes us to an ugly and depressing world but it is not to every moviegoer's taste. While most of it is often predictable and unoriginal, the film remains interesting and compelling. Still, Villeneuve's technical expertise takes direct aim of its difficult subject and allows Sicario to hit the target at very close range more often than not.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

I imagine Sicario is as clear, deep, and honest a view into the world of the Mexican/American drug trade and the USA's dysfunctional ""war on drugs"" as we can get. No simple good-guys or bad-guys. No master-plan. Just a bunch of flawed individuals and institutions doing the best they can to resist the ugly reality of the society we live in, where drugs are a symptom of larger problems that may never be resolved. The characters are magnetic and deep. The music is phenomenal and eerie. The story is brilliant and complex, and Benicio Del Toro is an absolute shoe-in for best supporting actor (again).

Benicio del Toro performs an outstanding character, and the film poses a very interesting issue about the morality and the rule of law within the drug war, so that poses a very interesting critic to the current state of that problem.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to just see a lot of fire guns, this might not be the case, I think it just contains the necessary amount of action, but yet a stronger message, that's what makes it an outstanding film.<br/><br/>Totally recommended."
"Xi-persei","8","1","3","13 October 2015"," Send a Thief to Catch a Thief...
","This movie was definitely poignant and recommended for all suspense lovers. Some will be shocked if they are not aware of how ""Aztec sacrifice brutal"" the Mexican drug war killings are. But Aztecs honored their brave war captives in death and there is no honor shown here to the victims much less blood for the Gods. So Jeffrey Donovan's US agent character remarks that the narcos are smart because they make people believe that the brutalized victims must have done something bad to deserve such gruesome deaths.<br/><br/>You have a lot of high tension and uncertainty caused by the need for extreme secrecy required for the success of the protagonists' hidden agenda. Emily Blunt and her U.S.border agent partner don't seem to grasp this basic military premise that you may get killed by the enemy at anytime on a mission but that doesn't give you the right to know what's going on. While her acting is superb, her character's inability to ""go with the flow"" seems naive and out of touch with basic operating truths. But maybe she is intended to be the voice of reason in the Land of Wolves. <br/><br/>The terrific irony is that the one person who doesn't outright lie to her (beside her partner who almost gets her killed by mistake) is Benicio Del Toro's ""consultant"" character. He admits from the start that he is employed by people in Colombia when she asks him. He saves her life though he later threatens possibly falsely to retract it. He is the great white hope in this operation who surely has his own agenda but who seems to respect his opponents and make their required elimination in this live chess game as painless and quick as possible. <br/><br/>And the guiltiest truth we have to admit is that Del Toro, the consultant-sicario is the hero of this tale, not the legal-minded idealistic border agent who has all the usual markings of nobility. The only addition I wanted to see was more camera time on the narco-traficos side (other than the crooked but amiable Mexican state cop who plays soccer with his son) but that might detract from the Us versus Them atmosphere crucial to the film."

","FBI Special Agent Kate Macer leads an anti kidnapping team raid an Arizona house tied to Sonora drug cartel's VIP Manuel Diaz. Surviving an IED, she finds her boss discussing about her with a ""DOD adviser"" Matt Graver. Matt asks her to join his team targeting Fausto Alarcon, Diaz's leader, and Kate agrees. She meets Matt the next day and he introduces Alejandro. They fly to El Paso and join in extraditing Guillermo, Diaz's brother, from Mexico back to El Paso. Kate pries about Alejandro and he reveals he's Colombian. They make it back pass the border but get stuck in traffic near the border post. Everybody scouts for possible attacks. Alejandro tells Kate to draw her weapon, to her confusion and hesitation. Soon he spots a car with gang members and calls it in. The team gets ready as Matt orders to follow the gang's actions in engaging. A gang member steps out and the whole team quickly exits the cars aiming at the gang members, warning them. One wrong move from a gang member sends the entire gang crew dead by bullet storm.<br/><br/>Kate questions the shooting claiming it out of protocol, suspecting Matt as CIA. Matt dismisses this as he brings Guillermo into a building. Guillermo seems afraid as he sees Alejandro. At night they fly back Arizona. Reg picks up Kate but Matt orders them to join him to Tucson. There they question immigrants from Nogales, Mexico, where Guillermo claimed a secret tunnel into the US is located. The next day sees them busting Diaz's money launderers in a bank. Despite Matt's warning, Kate goes in the bank seeking evidence to build a case against Diaz, and puts her face on the CCTV. She brings Matt evidence but he refuses to build the case. Kate and Reg take this to their superiors, who deny them any action, hinting that Matt's team gets the approval of an elected office way above them. Frustrated, Reg takes Kate to his regular bar. There he meets his friend a local cop and introduces her to Kate. Kate brings the cop to her place. But she stops as she notices he wears the same bracelet as on Diaz'd money. He tries to kill her as she fights, but Alejanro comes at the right moment. The next day Kate and Reg witness Matt's team's unique resources, such as drones and SpecOps soldiers, in hunting Alarcon.<br/><br/>Matt confirms their first objective is accomplished as Diaz leaves for Mexico to meet Alarcon, whose location is unknown. Matt feels it's the right time to strike the tunnel, and reveals that CIA cannot actually operate within US soil except the operation is endorsed by another domestic agency. This reveals that he's been manipulating Kate all along. Yet Kate decides join the tunnel strike. Alejandro tells the team he'll move ahead as point, not needing help. The assault goes well although Kate loses her rifle. She follows Alejandro as he reaches an exit and ambushes a local Estata Policia officer delivering drug cargo. The cop asks whether Alejandro is Medellin and Kate appears behind him. Alejandro takes the cop hostage. Kate asks what Medellin is, but he instructs her to go back and don't follow him. She refuses and instead aims her gun at him, to which he replies with two stunning shots to her body. He then leaves with the cop as hostage.<br/><br/>The team helps Alejandro track Diaz and he makes the cop pulls him over. He tricks Diaz into taking him into Alarcon's place, and kills him after he gets inside. Kate returns to the team, punching Matt in the face. As she settles down, Matt reveals that Alejandro is their second objective, the agent infiltrated into Mexico to kill Alarcon. Alejandro casually kills off Alarcon and his family, settling his vengeance over his wife and daughter. The next day Kate finds Alejandro in her place as he asks her to sign a letter expressing that the operation had gone according to procedure. He threatens her as she refuses, to which she finally yield and signs. As he exits the place she manages to assemble her gun and aims at him, but she refrains from shooting him.<br/><br/>The story seems quite interesting although to be honest this theme of drug war has more recently descended into the script for B-movies. Thus the movie producers have quite a big job in regaining the interest of the action thriller audiences in general. Starting the movie with the raid scene is a common move to plant interest into the movie's opening. Yet I have to say that after that the movie tends to became a little bit disappointing.<br/><br/>The movie nicely plays on at the thriller side, adding more and more tension into the scenes and audience anticipation by adding suspenseful scoring and duration. But I find that the duration adding at times had gone too far to where the turning point actually happens and harvest from the built intensity of the thriller.<br/><br/>The action side however helps to focus more on the thriller side very much. By giving short doses of real action but instead emphasizing on the short action's quality and tying it critically to the story flow, the movie nicely grasps its more thriller side of its nature.<br/><br/>The acting overall is quite good although I find some imbalance between the main roles. Emily Blunt's acting is just adequate, nothing really special. It's just enough to portray the curious and |by the book| attitude of the character. Yet she could done better as she did on her last role on Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Josh Brolin did enough to cover his angle for the story, but Benicio del Toro's performance is somewhat nice. His acting can really grasp the whole mystery and secrecy shrouding the background of his character.<br/><br/>My final view for Sicario (2015) is a score of 7 out of 10."

","Just saw ""Sicario"" and I will say that certainly in my opinion it's not a great movie, yet still it's intense enough and raw with drama for any crime drama movie fan to view. As is so common in today's headlines from the news it's Mexico against the United States in the drug border war and a lot of those problems involve the Mexican drug cartel. This drama story centers around a young and hard working up and coming FBI agent named Kate(Emily Blunt)who joins a federal task force to go to the U.S. and Mexican border to fight the drug war. And from the start Kate sees that this is a brutal and blood like war with guns and body after body being discovered. Along the way good supporting help is provided from Matt Graver(Josh Brolin)yet the anti hero and key player in helping find the Mexican drug leader is a renegade named Alejandro(Benicio Del Toro). It proves that in life and war you don't always play by the rules as many times they are bent and broken, overall this movie is raw, gritty, and downright blunt!"

","There is no hope.<br/><br/>Sicario comes to us from Denis Villeneuve and stars Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio del Toro. In Sicario we follow the twists and turns of trying to take down the leader of a cartel, and not all the methods are the most ethical. One thing is for sure. Don't go to Juarez.<br/><br/>Denis brings a disgustingly beautiful world to our eyes, and even after seeing it, it's something I wouldn't like to know about. That isn't anything to do with the films quality, but with how messed up this world is. It's so dark and twisted and hopeless, but that's probably how it is in reality.<br/><br/>The films strengths are vast, and the storytelling was the biggest highlight. We are following Emily Blunt's character, and she doesn't really know what the plan of her superiors are most of the time, but we know as little as she does. It works brilliantly because it limits pointless exposition and gives us credit as viewers. This isn't a story, it is just a viewing of events taking place. I NEED to mention the cinematography too. It was phenomenal from great Roger Deakins. At this point, Sicario is THE winner of the best cinematography Oscar.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler Below:<br/><br/>My only real complaint about this film is that Emily Blunt isn't nearly as important to the story as she appears to be. I won't get into it any more than that..<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>A brilliantly crafted film with a tense story and breathtaking visuals. Other than a few character shortcomings and an overwhelmingly brutal world, the film was one of the best of the year."

On her latest case, a drug lord on his way back to Juarez Mexico, leaves a nasty explosive present behind and several agents are killed. When Josh-a CIA agent-and Benicio-a mysterious Mexican collaborator-ask for Emily's help in tracking down the bad drug lord, she doesn't hesitate in trying to get herself a little revenge. Victor plays Emily's boss that lets her go, thinking she might learn something from the CIA, but it turns out to be just the opposite. Josh and Benicio keep her in the dark about almost everything that is going on. They let her know just enough to keep her confused about things. Emily soon learns that it is hard to trust anyone involved in the drug business-both good guys and bad guys- Can you believe it? Some of the good guys are bought off by drug money!

The characters : well their backstory can be summarized in a few words or one sentence at best, so to say that they are shallow is an understatement. To see great actors like Del Toro and Brolin playing those lifeless, uninteresting cardboard characters is a real shame and a waste of talent. The plot : it is convoluted and isn't really going anywhere in the end. The film has nothing to say ! The cinematography : the director tries to build tension by showing long shots of random landscapes, but it just ends up being as boring and pointless as the rest of the movie.

"guchrisc","Null","2","11","12 October 2015"," A boring, clichéd, dull, pointless and silly story about the drugs war.
","An FBI Agent played by British actress Emily Blunt takes part in a raid that exposes drug-cartel activity. She then volunteers to join a joint task-force planning to disrupt the cartel by 'shaking the tree'. Other members of the task-force include Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.<br/><br/>The trailer for the film looked promising, and the trailer is an accurate representation of the early scenes in the film. However, this action film is unbelievable as an accurate portrayal of the 'war on drugs'. Having said that, when assessing how the 'war on terror' was conducted, perhaps the film scenario cannot be completely ruled out. This would certainly have been a more accurate film if the cartel and the drugs were not in the film and it had just been a straight war film based on the 'war on terror'. If this is a true representation of the 'war on drugs', it is clear why that war is being lost. Those fighting the 'war on drugs', in this film, are plain stupid. The 'shaking of the tree' tactic, adopted at the start of the film, is bad enough. However, when the 'grand strategy' is finally revealed, it is laughable in it's simplicity and stupidity.<br/><br/>The film itself consists of a number of scenes, each of which, whilst engaging enough in themselves, do not logically link up in any real way. The original scene is merely a McGuffin that is used to get the characters together and bears no relation to the following scene which is in the trailer. Then there is the bus scene, which again seems to have no connection with anything else. The bar-scene is unnecessary and the following scene is unbelievable. Most of the following scenes also seem unbelievable too.<br/><br/>One saving grace for this film is that while this year's (2015) recent 'Solace' was a good story that was very badly filmed. 'Sicario' is a bad story, that at least is very well filmed. There is an authentically filmed night scene, however I have to admit that I just found it boring. On the other hand, one standout scene is the aerial film- shoot of the border. This was clearly a labour of love for Cinematographer Roger Deakins and interestingly shows that 'Donald Trump's Wall' is already partially built. There are also many vivid scenes of majestic mountains and run-down towns.<br/><br/>The actors do their best. Miss Blunt acts her part well, showing much believable emotion. However, sadly her character is not believable. Her joining the task-force and going on the first mission is not believable. It takes her character an hour to realize what I realized at the start of this film. The film is shot from her POV, but the plot is so obvious that there are few, if any, surprises.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro is a quiet brooding presence. Apparently, he requested, and got, a lot of his dialogue deleted. Good job too. Sadly though, again we have a completely unbelievable character. His back-story is meant to explain how he got to where he is. It merely contradicts. His actions in this film totally contradict the back- story. I was always expecting so much more from his character, but I got zilch. Nothing. There was just nothing to his character. However, when Mr Del Toro has some decent material to work with, he can give a very fine performance, such as his so well-rounded character in the drama 'Things We Lost in the Fire' (2007).<br/><br/>2007 is also the year that Josh Brolin appeared in two drug-themed films, 'No Country for Old Men' and 'American Gangster' so this is familiar territory for Mr Brolin. In 'American Gangster', Josh played an abrasive cop with an easily discernible character. Here though, in 'Sicario' his character is much more laid-back and subdued, reminding me of John Malkovitch in 'Ripley's Game' (2002). Josh Brolin's career can be said to have peaked, and he reached the summit, in his fine performance in the recent 'Everest' (2015).<br/><br/>British actor Daniel Kaluuya plays well his small part as an FBI Agent. However, Maximiliano Hernandez and Kim Larricho played two minor characters that we saw far too little of. What little they did, they did well. However, I am left thinking how much better this film would have been if their character-roles were much more central to the plot.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve and Writer Taylor Sheridan have delivered up an unbelievable film and story. If it were true to life it would be a massive indictment of the 'war on drugs'. However, it is rather a massive indictment of poor and unbelievable story-telling. Action after action, and scene after scene, are just not believable. These things just would not happen. As improbability piles on top of improbability, perhaps people should just accept this as a silly action film.<br/><br/>To see a much better film about drug-cartels, with real rounded three-dimensional characters, go and get a DVD of Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'Collateral Damage' (2002), or the more recent 'End of Watch' (2012) starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pina.<br/><br/>I thought 'Sicario' might have been a decent action film. Sadly, it just turned out to be unbelievable rubbish. <br/><br/>Avoid! 5/10."

","With a high IMDB rating and reviews, I decided to watch this movie and was disappointed. It seems like a Documentary or a TV show packaged as Movie. 
Someone who has grown up on 80's action, the type of action shown in this, fails to impress. In the name of realism, there is only sound and light show. With movies like this, labelled as action/thriller, I can see why comic book movies are doing so good. Even if its CGI, its action, its thrill, its fantasy. 
In the name of realism I came across something boring. 
I don't care about that technical brilliance, if its dull and boring. <br/><br/>Even the plot doesn't have much substance. I mean, there are many loose ends. Who were those people, whose bodies we saw in opening and why were they killed etc etc. From kidnapping, to illegal immigrants, it finally zeroes on to drug use.<br/><br/>Everyone is clueless in movie about why certain things are happening, what to do etc etc. Only Josh Brolin and that other guy Benicio Del Toro seem to know everything and they are keeping it to themselves. 
In the end they reveal everything, with a casual one liner. Which doesn't even raise an eye brow, neither from the viewers or even actors. 
Emily Blunt, she looks tired and worn out.
Better to call it a Drama, with a international border drug smuggling theme than an action/thriller, because there was hardly any thrill in it."

","40 minutes into this and Blunt has 70% of the screen time and 5% of the dialogue. Its like she was given the same instruction as A Quiet Place -- don't say anything. One reviewer compared this to Traffic. In that it is about Mexican drug wars, yes. Traffic however had script, plot, character development. Note to the director; maybe two or three shots per film you can extract some artistic value from an actor's facial expressions, if you do it 9 out of 10 shots it gets lame fast. Really unbelievable scene at the El Paso border just adds to the non-cerebral result of this film. Going to my review of Miss Sloan now; 9/10. Sloan has more dialogue in first 5 minutes than Blunt has in the whole film of Sicaro."

","Yes, this is another one of those movies where skinny armed girls fire high caliber weapons without suffering any kickback. The opening scene sets the silliness. Emily Blunt is a member of an assault team taking down a drug lords house. Blunt looks like Snoopy in his flight helmet, her tiny head overwhelmed by the armor. After the action, we slide fast into the ""knitted brow"" school of acting pioneered by knocked knee, flat footed superstar Leo DiCaprio; the knitting of the brow compensating for the lack of physical grace needed for a believable action star (Mitchum, McQueen, The Duke, Eastwood). Blunt can knit a brow along with the best but it just can't save this PC casting silliness."
"rblenheim","10","1","4","1 March 2016"," Another masterpiece by Canada's greatest filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve!
","Arguably the best film of 2015 is Canadian Denis Villeneuve's electrifying and morally-ambiguous portrait of the war against drugs on the border between the US and Mexico, ""Sicario"", a telling of the rite-of-passage of an idealistic and inexperienced FBI agent, superbly played by Emily Blunt, recruited to join a covert government team to bring down one of Mexico's most dangerous drug barons. She's accompanied by the team's leader, expertly played by Josh Brolin, a tough practical guy who believes the end justifies the means, and has no qualms about ignoring any laws that stand in his way. Also with them is a Mexican assassin played by Benicio Del Toro who has his own agenda. (""Sicario"" derives from the Latin word, ""Sicarius"", meaning 'dagger man'; also 'hit man' in Spanish.) Villeneuve's past work comprises some of the finest films made the last few years (e.g., ""Incendies"", ""Prisoners"", and ""Enemy"") and ""Sicario"" is a tour-de-force of brilliant technique used to develop character as well as to encourage viewers into questioning their own moral choices in following proper laws or circumventing them for expediency. One critic called this film 'a punch to the gut' and it most certainly achieves that while never losing its grip on the audience, its action heightened by Roger Deakins' evocative cinematography utilizing the finest aerial tracking shots I have ever seen, along with crackerjack editing, and a pulse-pounding electronic music score by Icelandic composer, Jóhann Jóhannsson. Described by its director as ""a dark poem,"" it is a tough, virtually perfect thriller that will stimulate your brain while gluing you to your seat.<br/><br/>As far as its music score which skillfully blends acoustic and electronic sounds with harmonic and dissonant minimalist music, Jóhannsson shows himself to be one of the truly great original film composers today. He has been scoring films in his native Iceland for over 15 years until writing a brilliantly evocative soundtrack music for Denis Villeneuve's 2013 ""Prisoners"", and now, also for Villeneuve, ""Sicario"". While making the film, the director told Jóhannsson to ""create sounds that you wouldn't only hear but that you could also feel,"" and the composer managed that by using simple ambient sounds to music that rhythmically employed lots of percussion and unusual guitar and cello tones creatively, often so subtle as to seem subliminal. The end effect is disturbing and haunting, allowing the music to complement Villeneuve's visuals and the film's editing patterns perfectly.<br/><br/>In summary, the hypnotic and visceral ""Sicario"" is a suspense thriller that you cannot afford to miss."
"Im_Disappointed","9","1","4","11 January 2016"," Brutal slap in the face for bleeding-heart liberals and fanatical feminists.
","This film got a lot of hype before release due to the fact it looked like an action/thriller, smelled like and an action/thriller and was promoted as an action/thriller - with a female lead (Emily Blunt), heading the charge, guns blazing, against the Mexican cartel.<br/><br/>It turned out to be a somewhat different beast.<br/><br/>Feminist commentators went from exuberant exultation to exasperated angst. Why? Because the female lead wasn't a butt-kicking, cartel-cracking, bullet-bunting she-samurai from Lesbos. No, she turned out to be a vulnerable, easily-manipulated, surly, unstable, naive, idealistic and ultimately dominated tool, used as a means by intelligent, driven men to achieve their ends. And for this the filmmakers have copped considerable - and amusing - criticism from the fairer side of the commentariat.<br/><br/>In my opinion, what Sicario did was present a brutal, visceral, painfully-honest portrayal of the war on Mexican cartels (not drugs), and what sort of tactics - and people - are required to fight this war. Idealistic women do not make the cut.<br/><br/>The film is layered and extremely well constructed. A second and third viewing reveals dark and disturbing depths (such as the interrogation/male-rape), and at no stage does it present the 'good guys' as angels. More like demons on God's payroll.<br/><br/>The violence is overt - but not gratuitous. The language is realistic - but not crass. The characters are understated - but not boring. The story is small in scale - but large in the telling.<br/><br/>Del Toro was superb (as always) and Brolin was perfect as the CIA spook cum real-life troll. Blunt played a woman out-of-her-depth very believably, (as she was completely out of her depth in this film), but the real winner was the cinematography and the score. Both simple by design, but majestically rendered.<br/><br/>In summary, if you are a bleeding-heart progressive, who loves feminist ideals, and hates the USA cutting corners to fight its enemies, then I suggest you steer clear of this film .<br/><br/>As the final line in the movie to Blunt's character makes clear, ""You will not survive here - you are not a wolf, and this is a land of wolves now"". In other words, the US must take off the gloves if it wishes to protect its citizens and defeat enemies who recognize no borders, know no boundaries and engage in brutality in its most extreme forms. If this upsets you, then time to pack your bags and get the hell out of Dodge."

This is the story of an FBI agent ( Emily Blunt ) who is seconded into an elite unit that deals with the drug barons on the Mexican border but not is all it seems. She is told very little and what she does know she doesn't like. This film is intense. It really does grip you. The first half an hour , especially the scenes when we are in Mexico , are stunning .

"autumnhendersonbrazie","8","1","4","14 December 2015"," Sicario is dark, broody, and beautiful.
","I still remember how my heart leapt when I saw Sicario's trailer for the first time. Emily Blunt as a baddass FBI agent taking on the drug cartel? Sign me up! I had known the premise for sometime before I saw the visual, though, being that I'm an avid stalker of Blunt's IMDb page. This, along with the sterling critics reviews got my hopes up to astronomical heights.<br/><br/>Let's talk about Emily Blunt for a second. Honestly, I could talk about her forever, but for your sake I'll try to keep my love fest brief. I first saw her in The Devil Wears Prada in which she took a supporting role opposite the very talented Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Blunt was an absolute scene stealer. Yes, she stole scenes from MERYL STREEP. She is truly one of the more versatile actresses I've ever seen. She's never played the same role twice, in fact, she seems to not even try the same genre twice. Blunt can go from portraying Queen Victoria in the very sweet and well made The Young Victoria (2009), to battling futuristic robots with Tom Cruise as the ""Full Metal Bitch"" (Edge of Tomorrow, 2014) seamlessly. Needless to say, I was thrilled to see her cast as the sympathetic and ambivalent FBI agent Kate Macer in Sicario.<br/><br/>You should know, she has that facial expression for like 50% of the movie. You should know, she has that facial expression for like 50% of the movie. Sicario boasted a cast of accomplished and critically acclaimed actors: Emily Blunt (Golden Globe), Josh Brolin (Oscar), and Benecio Del Toro (Oscar), and each of them more than pulled their weight. However, the best performance in the film was not by anyone in front of the camera, but rather the director Denis Villeneuve. This film did not feature a lot of dialogue, so instead, every facial expression, eye twitch, cough, and tear had to move the story along. Moreover, the cinematography and score became characters in themselves. They established the tone, carried the plot, and breathed emotion into what would otherwise be a dark, but relatively ""empty"" story. The format reminded me of the movie Zero Dark Thirty, but with a less impassioned leading lady.<br/><br/>The movie opens on a raid that Agent Macer (Blunt) is leading in search of hostages. What she finds instead is that the walls of the house are riddled with dead bodies. This raid puts her on the map for shady might-be-CIA Agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). Macer is quickly swept up into the dangerous and corrupt world of the drug cartels in Juarrez, Mexico. This is not what she signed up for, though, so she spends most of the movie infuriated with the amoral goings-ons of American government agencies on Mexican soil, and on the verge of a mental break down. Yes, she even has a ""what have you become"" mirror scene.<br/><br/>Agent Macer is a far cry from the futuristic war goddess that Blunt played in Edge of Tomorrow in terms of combat effectiveness, but she's human, and her inclusion serves a specific purpose for the film maker, audience, and supporting characters.<br/><br/>Not a lot is known about the man who recruited her, Agent Graver (Brolin), other than he's not telling Macer the full truth. His objectives and motivations remain shrouded in mystery for the majority of the film. He's cocky, with an irreverent sense of humor and a belief that the ends justify his means.<br/><br/>The third member of this talented trio is Benecio Del Toro as Alejandro, a non-American former lawyer who now runs with Agent Graves. Revealing too much about his character and back story will major plot points away, so unfortunately I can't give you much insight other than he's relatively standoffish and very serious. At the beginning, Macer attempts to befriend him, which should tell you how desperate she was for some semblance of a human connection. I will say this: Benecio Del Toro played his role to perfection, and the last scene between he and Blunt was by far my favorite of the movie.<br/><br/>Sicario is dark, and broody, and beautiful. It gets my recommendation."
"rubenm","7","1","4","10 November 2015"," Violence, suspense and emotional depth
","During large parts of this movie, lead character Kate Macer doesn't have a clue what she's gotten herself into. Neither does the viewer. And that's the strength of the film: you get drawn into a shady, murky world that never becomes very clear or transparent, but never stops to fascinate.<br/><br/>Macer is a young FBI-agent who joins a special team of law enforcers, led by an outside 'adviser' and a Mexican ex-prosecutor, formed with only one purpose: eliminating an importing drugs smuggler. She is uncomfortable with the violent methods and unorthodox procedures of the group, but she is told that everything is cleared by the political powers that be.<br/><br/>The film contains breathtaking scenes. One shows a convoy of black SUV's, transporting the law enforcers across the Mexican border to Juarez to pick up a criminal and get him back to the US. Director Denis Villeneuve perfectly captures the fear and nervousness of the group, which can be attacked by gang members any minute. The expected violence occurs at the border control on the way back, where they engage in a shooting amidst cars waiting to enter the US.<br/><br/>There are many scenes like this, filled with suspense and violence. The perfect execution of these scenes is what makes this film special, more so than the script, which contains some sidelines and is not always easy to follow. A stroke of genius is the choice for a scrupulous woman as the lead character, trying to stand her ground in a masculine world without many scruples. It gives the film necessary emotional depth."

","Sicario is tense, well made, and makes great use of the talented Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Gritty realism combined with a series of escalating situations - Sicario blends environment seamlessly with characters and content. Strictly as an invention of the writer and director, this movie shines as well made piece of visual fiction, but there is so much more to stop and think about after the film is done. This film flirts with an often over used term: masterpiece.<br/><br/>At it's heart this film is a mystery, and Emily's character is our gateway into the gray area of the drug war, its combatants, and a vicious circle of violence.<br/><br/>Casting: brilliant. Each character is believable, tangible, real.<br/><br/>Directing: superb. This guy is on a roll, he knows the material, and did a stellar job of translating the writing into visual fiction.<br/><br/>Location: a rare treat to witness such seamless integration of the environment into the content of a film. Disquieting use of camera and sound punctuates growing intensity, and clever use of light and dark guides the eye with visual symbolism.<br/><br/>Realism, I think, can at times be more difficult to analyze and critique, especially if the viewer is hypnotized by what they see and completely buy into the story. This movie makes presenting the abstraction that is film look so very easy.<br/><br/>With such generalizations, who will like this movie? Fans of the cast, people who like watching military ops, and media junkies who like a good mystery. Sicario is violent, harsh, and does not pander to what people want to see - it is an unrelenting journey into a world of predators and their victims, as well as a exhibition of class film making.<br/><br/>nearing perfection: 9 out of 10"

","""It is a land of wolves now."" The aforementioned escapes the roaring gasps of Benicio Del Toro as he slips in an advice to Emily Blunt. Sicario is a thrilling ride into the US-Mexican ongoing drug war, where the story takes you into the deep waters of perversion, vengeance and corruption. Mexico reeks of death. The drug has polluted its air.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve has a knack for helming beauties. Sicario is yet another product of his extraordinary brain.<br/><br/>What I love most about Denis' direction is the fact that his frames carry the perfect amount of profundity. They are thought provoking, and give you ample amount of time to feel the thrill. You are able to focus properly and contemplate between his lingering frames.<br/><br/>Brilliant top scenic views that blend in with the gorgeous Johann Johannson music, deafening helicopter shots, or the silhouette of the private jet over a barren land depicting the long exhausting travel, carry Denis' suggestive flair.<br/><br/>The acting department is literally thriving with exceptional performances by the stellar cast. The screenplay too is very well written, taking the crime genre into account. <br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: One of the most gorgeous bits of the movie is when Emily Blunt is shown ""the fireworks"" - a city breathing on tragedy, bleeding with death, and burning in fire. The unfolding of the main Sicario was one helluva twist to the tale that was written beautifully by Taylor Sheridan.<br/><br/>Another thing that I loved was Hernandez's character Silvio. A dispensable soul who was manifested subtly by Denis. Like any other Mexican, he was a guy with fingers in dirt. Oblivious to what was coming, with a prepared family. Denis shows such a way of living is common in Mexico. How they have accepted death as a way of life! The movie ends quite dramatically as it leaves Kate Macer with a choice, the choice to shoot a Sicario like Alejandro and do the right thing, or let him breathe and let the city smother itself in the flames of vengeance. As the final bits rush in showing the Silvio's death aftermath, we see his son trying to play football, his mother trying to cheer him when we hear bullets in the backdrop. Their world stops to heed at the distraction, but then again, they have accepted it to be a part of living, and they still continue. It is an extremely poetic bit that makes you pity their lives."

","An idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by an elected task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the US and Mexico.<br/><br/>Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve returns with a suspenseful and ever surprising cartel thriller. Sicorio begins with one carnage scene which sets the apocalyptic tone for everything that follows. In fact the plot demands attention but never becomes too difficult to follow and displays an almost sadistic level of suspense. The message is: are we willing to bend the rules and sell our souls to fight a war that will probably never be won? Plus, who earns our sympathy? From Brolin's to Del Toro's characters. The answer is no one. The environment characters are constantly surrounded by sips into the audience and you feel the crashing weight of their situation. <br/><br/>Some may complain that the lead, played effectively by Emily Blunt, is a sexist portrayal. But this might just be the best piece I've ever seen from her. In a terrific performance that recalls the ferocity of Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs. Though she's still young and naive enough to believe that there's a right side in this war and that the US is on it. Moreover, Benicio Del Toro is every inch impressive, with a considerably more complicated character. Calm as a predator lying in wait, or revealing flashes of humanity when least expected. Even sometimes a Hannibal Lecter-ish lust for this young woman thrust into his path. Denis Villeneuve is a master of the kind of creeping tension that circles around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey. <br/><br/>The opening sequence is a marvel of action and exposition. In fact, the film opens with a drug-raid sequence, slickly handed by Villeneuve. Still Sicario has a definite beginning, middle and end director isn't interested in cosy, comfy three acts armature. The film smoothly departs first into a kind of Zero Dark Thirty style and then it wades into an old fashioned No Country for Old Men blood-and-revenge territory. The movie flows extremely well as a suspense film. Even scenes where nothing remarkable happen, you are waiting for something to happen. Villeneuve stages one extraordinary suspense set-pieces after another. Using sharp, colour saturated, compositions of cinematographer Roger Deakins - probably one of the best cinematographer alive; and airtight cutting of editor Joe Walker and the subtly menacing score of composer Johan Johansen. There's no hope, this film is utterly dark. <br/><br/>Overall, Denis Villeneuve with Sicario delivers (once again) an impeccably well crafted film."

","FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) has quickly risen through the ranks of a predominantly male profession. Now she has received a top assignment by a mysterious government official Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) of assisting a task force for the purpose of combating the escalating war on drugs. Her team, led by an equally mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), primarily travels back-and-forth across the U.S.-Mexico border while using one cartel boss (Bernardo Saracino) to get to a bigger one (Julio Cesar Cedillo).<br/><br/>If I had one word to describe this film, it would be intense. It definitely doesn't sugarcoat things. Their part of the world affected by the drug war that it is attempting to depict is very bleak and filled with despair and it approaches this in a very real way. The cinematography is very good here with its use of lighting and shadows and its utilization of the terrain and setting that the world acts as another character in the film as it becomes its own living entity. I thought the music was just as powerful as the cinematography as it matched the tone including the cliché ramping up during the more intense moments and perhaps may have taken it too far at times. The film also did get a little violent at times but when viewed in the context of the film's subject matter, is not gratuitous. I thought the film started off a little slowly but it does have its intense moments that were full of action which were well done where the realism is the most evident but I just wish that there could have been more because when nothing was happening, I will admit to being a little bored. What bored me was not the performances but rather the story as I was not completely sure what was going on in the story until roughly halfway through. I liked it when I got it because that was when I thought Del Toro's Alejandro took over. I found his performance started off as very restrained and intense with his serious gaze and few word answers and then developed over time as his motives and intentions become clear. I'm not really sure how to describe it but he just took control of every scene he was in, almost like Johnny Depp did in Black Mass. Blunt was good as her performance consisted mostly of looks and emotions and her character was used as a vehicle guiding us through the film's not-exactly-black-and-white world. I don't really think she stood out because I think her character could have been played by someone else and it would have been just as good. Brolin was okay serving as kind of a comic relief and then as with Del Toro's character, who started off a little less mysterious and opened up a little. The difference between the characters is that his motives were never fully explored. Overall, I thought this was a pretty exciting, well made, film but I think the story lagged slightly behind.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com"

","I don't normally review films. I watch a good movie, say ""Hey, that was a good movie."" But today, I blindly went to the theater to see Sicario. I didn't know what to expect. I hadn't watched a single trailer for the film and I only caught what was a 7 second glimpse at a commercial earlier in the week(The Martian's been getting all the TV spots recently). I do not regret my guide-less venture one bit. Sicario was truly something. Incredibly enjoyable and it keeps you intrigued with everything and everyone. It had the right amount of action(not too much and not too little), the appropriate tone of dialogue, and smart casting decisions. Not only is this one of the best films of 2015 but it is without a doubt one of my favorites. I recommend this to A) people who love films B) people who love a great story C) everybody"
"jmoneyjohal","9","1","4","2 October 2015"," This US vs the Mexican cartel action thriller, is one of the best films of the year.
","Have you ever wondered how people like Osama Bin Laden or El Chapo come to power, and become gang lords, and then are killed/arrested at a timely convince. Well Sicario has a theory of all things mentioned above, one may say its a conspiracy theory etc but like they say there is no smoke without a fire.But all withstanding, what I saw on screen felt like a true story, and it was thought provoking. Sicario is a dark, and eerie tale about what happens just a couple miles away from the American border in Mexico. Daily many innocents Mexicans die due to the cartel drug war. And Sicario highlights the cruel killings, and how one needs to combat the drug lords. <br/><br/>Rarely do you see a film that from the first frame not only does it engage you but it takes you into the nail biting action which is happening on screen.Numerous times I had my heart pounding, and jaw on the ground from action and suspense unfolding on the screen. Simply put Sicario has the best performances, and dialogues I have seen in a film this year. Film of the year? Well its in contention for sure.<br/><br/>Story wise the film talks about the escalating drug war the Cartel are engaging in on American soil. After FBI agent Kate Macer invades a house in Arizona and finds about 40 dead bodies which are collateral from the Cartel drug war, she is recruited by the a government agency to take down the real players of the drug war. This agency is lead by two men Matt Graver, and Alejandro a columbian man. These two men target Manuel Diaz because he can lead them to the kingpin of the cartel because he is right hand man of the kingpin( Diaz lives in the USA, and fronts as a business man). After arresting Diaz's brother Guillermo on Mexico soil in a operation, he leads them to a tunnel used to transport drugs from Mexico to the US.How this tunnel leads to Manuel, and his boss is what forms the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>Acting wise Benicio Del Toro is just mindblowing good, I thought Johnny Depp for Black Mass was the best performance of the year, but Del Toro gives him a good match. A Oscar worthy performance for sure. Josh Brolin is superb. And Emily Blunt is fantastic, she shoulders the film at many junctions.<br/><br/>Its difficult to find any negatives in Sicario, because even the smallest details have been dealt with beautifully. The films pacing is a bit slow, but the concluding 30-45 are adrenal pumping no stop thrill and action, so that makes up for any pacing issues. Sicario being such a great film has many positives them being the dialouges, especially the ones mouthes by Del Toro,two dialogues in particular where ""time to meet god"", and ""the wolves are taking over, and you wont be able to live with wolves so leave""(in the context of the film, there are mind blowing). Secondly the films acting which i mentioned above. Finally the film is the definition of what a perfect action thriller must be, the film is extremely detailed, its has a dark atmosphere, the way the film highlights the cartel violence, and how the Americans have a hand in the drug trade, is also handled perfectly. In short in Sicario content is king, and the script and screenplay are amazing. A special mention for the absolute amazing pre-climax sequence, i got my tickets worth in just those final minutes.<br/><br/>Overall over the years Denis Villenue has become one of my favourite directors, and with Sicario he only solidifies his title. The film is a must watch, because if you don't watch it now, you will after seeing its Oscar nomination list because its just that good.<br/><br/>4.5/5* or 9/10"
"beheadedchicken1","9","1","4","2 October 2015"," Intense, disturbing, and important.
","I'm not going to explain the story or give a synopsis, you can read it above.<br/><br/>Sicario is a worm that slowly wiggles its way into your head and nests there, carrying the dirt and slim in with it. This is a pretty disturbing movie, not simply through its violence, but through its depiction of a world that we too often forget about. <br/><br/>The movie way too effectively draws you into the conflict, and Emily Blunt essentially serves in part as the eyes and mind of the audience. Naive, sceptical, ethically in tune, but intrigued, consumed. You know everything happening is wrong, and the words being said probably aren't true, but you HAVE to know.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve's last two movies (Prisoners, Enemy) are both two of my favourites in the last couple years, and Sicario is his best so far. Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro both give the best work I've seen them do. Everyone's favourite, Roger Deakins, does another excellent job of capturing the ugliness south of the border. The music is phenomenal, the best all year. Unsettling, creepy, intense, whatever it has to be to fit the moment. The movie is intense, really intense; sweaty palms will be commonplace. <br/><br/>Like Prisoners, Denis (and Taylor Sheridan) again tackles incredibly complicated moral situations better than anyone right now, and gets you thinking. He's described it as a revenge movie, others have called it a (drug) war movie, but I think its just important. <br/><br/>It's a morally stimulating movie for one, but it's also a movie that pushes you to tackle thoughts and world events that you normally don't - or don't want to. It's the kind of movie you want to sink into the collective conscious because, though it isn't full of facts, it's informative. We should all see it, and all think about its subject matter.<br/><br/>Horrible things happen, and more importantly, horrible things are ALLOWED to happen, in our country, and below the border. In case the crime you read about in the newspaper everyday isn't enough, this movie helps drive that home.<br/><br/>But of course, why would you want to experience that if it weren't expertly crafted, inherently watchable, and consuming. Good thing it is."
"cbak223","8","1","4","2 October 2015"," Welcome to Mexico!
","Sicario, meaning ""hitman"". Obviously this film strikes a nerve with everyone especially, Americans, Mexican Americans, and especially illegal immigrants. This films subject matter is a dark, underworld that lies within our own backyards. Americans, we want to live in this country, and for the majority of us we were born here. Some of us, not so fortunate. Immigration is an on-going, controversial battle right now, I'm not sure who wins, if anyone ever does. This film has big name stars attached to it while dealing with a good subject line, Emily Blunt, fantastic actress, Josh Brolin, & Benicio Del Toro, two of the best. The movie starts out as a swat team raid on a house, lead by Emily, the end up discovering a horrific site, I'll let you watch to see. After this there's a task team lead by Brolin and he wants her, to ""ride along"" and get her feet wet in the fight against Cartel violence, in America and Mexico. This film is beautifully directed by Denis Villeneuve, and add a gorgeous, haunting soundtrack by Johann Johannsson, that sticks with you after the film is over, job well done. Now as a film critic, I love films, and this one is right up there. But I can see where some people might not, for starters, I think there should have been a better ending involving Emily's character, Benicio finishes this film, and in great style. It's almost co-main stars, she started it, he finished it. This is definitely a must see film, I just wish there was a touch more action, longer ending involving Emily, but I still have to give it an 8/10."
"UsernameHype","8","1","4","1 October 2015"," God damn is the only way I can describe this movie.
","The story follows a FBI agent who is working with a group to go after a Mexican drug lord. The story is interesting, but the middle of the movie felt a little dragged out or long, I can't really describe it. But the movie was plenty of moments that make up for that. Now, I have to talk about the intense scenes, Jesus! If you have seen Prisoners, by the same director, you know he can do intense scenes, but Sicario... has intense scenes, ones you forget anytime soon.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing, I wouldn't be surprised if some or all of the actors get put up for Golden Globes or Oscars, because they deserve it. Emily Blunt did great, possibly her best performance yet. Benicio Del Toro again, did an amazing job, he just keeps getting better and better. I could go on, but it would be to long.<br/><br/>Now I can't do a review without talking about Roger Deakins. The master, my idol. This man is amazing. Every single shot was nice, crisp, and sucked you in. Even the scenes at night, felt like they were night time. During the night you couldn't perfectly see peoples faces and there were silhouettes. Unlike some movies that try and emulate night time, this actually felt like night time. I can't describe the shots in this movie, so many are great and deserve frames up on the wall.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack was also very good. The ambient, pulsing sounds and even silence added to the atmosphere of the whole movie. The soundtrack fit perfectly with the film and made scenes. They did a great job.<br/><br/>I liked Sicario, it was a great movie. I feel like I need to watch it again though to fully feel my thoughts. The middle that felt a bit long winded might have been because of the annoying ass guy with popcorn next to me in the theater, so if I see it another time it may not feel this way. The movie is definitely worth a trip to the theater."

","An action packed start sets the tone with bodies in walls and booby-trap explosions. It was an enjoyable ride with suspense and tension hiding around almost every corner, but don't expect to know who anybody is, where they are going or what the real objective is, that's above your pay grade!<br/><br/>The film is shot beautifully, I especially loved the night vision footage; it was sublime. The brutality presented is stark, perfectly capturing the scourge of the Mexican people that is the drug trade and the cartels.<br/><br/>the film also hides its plot well. It's not until late that we understand the true significance of 'Sicario'. Looking back there were plenty of hints along the way though. I rarely guess these sorts of things early.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that the female protagonist can't to come to grips with the reality of the covert operations she has been thrust into. For a regular person this would be perfectly understandable, but this character is supposed to be a FBI agent. Blunt's character tries to be our moral compass but it just doesn't work; I didn't buy it.<br/><br/>Still, Blunt was impressive in this film as were Del Toro and Brolin (although Josh chewed a lot of gum!). The language lover in me also enjoyed trying to understand the Spanish and there was a decent amount.<br/><br/>Brutal thriller 7.8 out of 10"
"michaelradny","8","1","4","29 September 2015"," Sick-ario
","Whilst if you look hard enough into Sicario's storyline, you will probably find nothing too interesting, but unlike many other films, it's the surface that really matters. A beautifully shot film that comes together with terrific acting and an ultra unpredictable and stunningly gory story. It never lacks charisma, giving you eye candy throughout the entirety of its two hours. But I will reiterate, nothing remarkable really happens; whilst shocking at times, it does feel a little one dimensional, but never lacks excitement. <br/><br/>If I was to give Sicario's storyline one thing to be proud of, it's the fact that it melds two different story lines together almost seamlessly. Two peoples missions, with these two people standing on the opposite side of the law, whilst being the law, if that makes sense at all. A truly terrific feat in what can be done when not given much at all."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","1","4","29 September 2015"," Executed as perfectly as can be considering the story did nothing for me
","This movie just screams Denis Villenueve. Its got that same dark, twisted feeling about it that I got from his masterpiece Prisoners and his less brilliant Eh-nemy. Sicario, whilst it doesn't scrape Prisoners altar even a bit, does confirm that he isn't a one-hit wonder and is in fact one of the most talented individuals in the business. He can match Kathryn Bigelow in tension and the Coen brothers in twistedness. He can do dark better than most of the horror directors in the business. He knows how to utilise the techs better than anyone I know – his use of Jóhann Jóhannsson's otherwise unremarkable score is incredible for building tension.<br/><br/>That Roger Deakins hasn't won an Oscar after his career is criminal. I think Sicario might just be his best work yet. This film is BEAUTIFULLY shot. The night sequences are so natural I felt like an observer. The thermal image scenes are incredible. There are some long aerial takes, including one of five black 4WDs crossing a checkpoint that is one of the best takes I've ever seen in a movie. Its Deakins' time, Academy!<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is one of my favourite actresses in the business, and she gives a stripped back and bleak performance that makes it easy to forget that it's the star of Edge of Tomorrow and The Devil Wears Prada. I didn't buy for a second the subplot about her not being able to find a man, even less so when her partner calls her ugly. C'mon man. The casting choice of a woman and a black man as two cops who were out of their depth in a cross-border operation run by white men I thought was subtly clever as well. Daniel Kaluuya's Reggie is a serviceable character but I felt like he popped up more than needed – he was rejected from the taskforce but always seems to be around.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin is my favourite part of the film as the almost playfully unconventional Matt. He's the ultimate boys boy, he likes to sleep on planes and joke around with his teammates. Benicio del Toro received the film's raves, and whilst I have nothing to complain about, to rave about a layered character is a stretch for me. Discovering his backstory was a bit too much of a let down, because we've seen it all before. <br/><br/>The film is almost perfect in execution, but unfortunately the story just did nothing for me. Not one thing happened that I hadn't already seen before or didn't see coming. Two scenes of note include a dalliance between Kate and Ted (always excellent John Bernthal) and a conversation between Alejandro (del Toro) and a lead cartel man. Only Villenueve has the dark guts to pull off the latter the way he did. Other than that, I found it very conventional and sadly predictable. Del Toro's character arc is probably the least difficult since Magneto in X- Men First Class. There's a hugely unnecessary subplot about a cop named Silvio that eventuates to nothing. Even some of the script choices ruined what I was loving – one character icily tells his victim to finish his meal before his death, which I was ready to celebrate as filmmaking genius, then the gunman kills him two seconds later. Maybe don't tease better scenes than you've got, guys.<br/><br/>Sicario should be shown in director's school, or at the very least cinematographer's school. It's a class act on what to do from a technical viewpoint, but for me, Sicario only makes me realise that Villenueve needs to partner back up with a more talented writer like Prisoners scribe Aaron Guzikowski."

","Rarely do you walk into a film and feel your heart rate rise from scene 1. That's how this film, Sicario, starts off and continues throughout. This is not an action film, in fact there is very little action in it at all, rather a Drama-thriller type.<br/><br/>This movie is driven by giving the audience, from the view point of the main character portrayed by Emily Blunt, little bits of information to continue the plot in the high stakes, high intensity world of drug cartels. Excellent performances from Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro, and all around good performances from the supporting cast. This movie will be most enjoyed by those who like movies that don't shove the story line obviously at you, and by those who like a high intensity thriller/drama type film."
"AliceofX","7","1","4","22 September 2015"," A Bleak Thriller
","Sicario is a film about the powerlessness of man when faced with great evil. When it all comes over you, more akin to a storm or some other natural catastrophe.<br/><br/>The film has a slow pace and it takes its time building up to the main point of the story. The final scene with Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro is among the best that I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Sicario's combination of gruesome violence and minimal soundtrack creates this strange atmosphere to the film. It is amidst the most depressing I've see. Now I'm not talking about tear-jerking sad films, but about that sort of bleak hopelessness that is hard to get right.<br/><br/>Recently there was an article that said they are planning a sequel with Benicio Del Toro's character and I wondered how would they do that since the film's focus is on Kate. She embodies the film's point. Very quickly you notice that she is the only female character in a land of men. I think this was a deliberate choice to further showcase how she stands out in this world, a world without the good guys. A world where those who play by the rules can't win.<br/><br/>Overall, Sicario might not be a film for everyone but I think it will definitely have a place amongst this year's best."

","Dreary is the best word that comes to mind if I had to pick one to describe Sicario<br/><br/>Dramatically uninvolving, sluggishly paced, and poorly acted, Sicario gives us a sample of the Federal Bureau's war on drugs with Mexico without illuminating anything about the people involved that makes it a story worth telling.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is massively underwhelming in the main role. She goes through the motions with no motivation other than doing the scripts bidding, and she lacks the fortitude needed to be a convincing FBI agent.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuvre was a small Quebecois director who has, in relatively short time, found his way into Hollywood. It is truly a remarkable achievement because he does not make loud or bright movies, his movies are very quiet. His approach was better suited to his last film Prisoners (which resembled se7en) but in Sicario he fails to channel the same level of ominous and suspense that made you hold your breath at times. Aside from some spectacular aerial shots Sicario is Visually uninteresting, bland and dramatically empty."

"CyclopsKnowsBest24","9","1","5","2 November 2015"," A marvelous cinematic journey into a corrupt and very real world...
","""Sicario"" (2015) was a film that I walked into knowing only the basic plot. The film follows an FBI agent (Emily Blunt) who joins a special U.S. task force to aid against the war on drugs near the border in Mexico. From the plot description, I figured this film could either succeed by being an intense, suspenseful character driven film, or it could be predictable and boring take on an issue we (as US citizens) know little about.<br/><br/>Thankfully, ""Sicario"" proves to be a film driven by intriguing characters, claustrophobic scenarios, and a very relevant and modern view of the war on drugs.<br/><br/>The acting and character development in ""Sicario"" delivers Oscar winning performances. Emily Blunt proves, yet again, that she is more than just a pretty face who can deliver a line. Her characters mannerisms, accent, and mental changes are portrayed in such a way that it is hard to believe she is acting.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin takes a unique turn portraying a character who is so casual and relaxed, that it's hard to believe he was the opposite in ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007). Benicio Del Toro also captures an emotional and subtle take on his character Alejandro. He doesn't ever overact in this film.<br/><br/>The acting isn't the only thing to brag about in ""Sicario,"" however. Most of the credit, in my opinion, should go the screenwriter, Taylor Sheridan. The writing in this film does a outstanding job of blurring the lines between the corrupt and not corrupt. ""Sicario"" is never black and white with this war, and it really causes the viewer to actually be interested in this issue. Very few films take on a political issue like this, leaving the viewer questioning if the US is always in the right with their methods.<br/><br/>Despite this, ""Sicario"" doesn't try to be a ""high and mighty"" film that totally bashes our government. It shows that both sides are in the wrong and the war on drugs is never going to be a simple issue to solve. The final scene of this film captures every emotion the audience is feeling throughout this film... frustration, fear, and hope that we can one day stop this terror.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" is not a film that you should watch for mindless entertainment. It causes the viewer to become emotionally invested and frustrated all at the same time. The violence on innocents can be very grotesque and realistic, which may turn some viewers off.<br/><br/>As for this film being an Oscar contender, it does have the possibility to win something (especially the screenplay). I fear that it may be over looked towards the end of the year, however.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood to watch a great film that is relevant to issues of today, I highly recommend ""Sicario."" <br/><br/>My movie recommendations: <br/><br/>If you like it: <br/><br/>""No Country for Old Men"" (2007), ""The Departed"" (2009), ""American Beauty"" (1999) <br/><br/>If you don't like it: <br/><br/>""Jurassic World"" (2015), ""The Martian"" (2015), ""Interstellar"" (2014)"
"codex-92736","8","1","5","1 November 2015"," Sicario Review
","""You're asking me how the watch is made. For now just keep your eye on the time.""<br/><br/>SPOILER FREE ZONE<br/><br/>Sicario stars Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin in an intense crime drama about drugs on the border of the US and Mexico. It is directed beautifully by Denis Villeneuve who directed Prisoners. From his IMDb page I could tell what type of movie to expect. <br/><br/>These types of movies rely on the performances of the main actors as well as the story, more than the big action sequences that we often get from big budget movies. Sicario very much falls into that category. That being said the cinematography of this movie is stunning. Every shot was visually pleasing/horrifying to great effect. It showed a very real representation of Mexico through its decades long cartel wars. The colour tone fit well with the pacing and story being told. But that's where Sicario didn't sit well with me as much as I hoped. It felt very slow and dragged in some scenes. I didn't care much for the story until it got to the big scenes (you'll know the scenes when you watch it). However a lot of that is made up by the phenomenal acting performances by the three leads of the movie.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is quickly becoming a highly regarded action/thriller actress and I think this role pushed her over the edge of being one of the best actresses in Hollywood. That being said, she may have been the lead of this cast but she was out shone by the other two. Josh Brolin has really grown on me as of late. He shows his ability to play more than just a one dimensional character throughout Sicario. Now let me get to Benicio Del Toro. My goodness this guy is phenomenal. He deserves to at least get nominated for an Oscar at this stage. Every time his face is shown on screen, you can feel the intensity from his facial expression (even when he has shades on). Not enough praise can be given to his performance and that is for me what made the movie.<br/><br/>SCORE: 7.5/10<br/><br/>SPOILERS GALORE<br/><br/>There isn't much to spoil in Sicario. There are a few scenes which stand out; the raid, the border crossing scene, the tunnel sequence and the dinner scene. By far the one the one I remember most is the dinner scene. I was already at the edge of my seat at that point but that one basically had me jumping of it. Again Del Toro played it brilliantly.<br/><br/>If your looking for a thriller with brilliant acting at some beautiful cinematography, Sicario is a must watch. <br/><br/>SCORE: 7.5/10"
"gsygsy","8","1","5","28 October 2015"," Border disputes
","If, like me, you like that disoriented feeling of not quite knowing what's going on or what's going to happen, this is a movie for you. A gripping, atmospheric thriller without those horrible, clunky scenes of exposition. What's really going on only becomes clear well over halfway through.<br/><br/>The powerful opening sequence sets the tone for this tale of the moral degradation surrounding drug cartels. There are several other jaw-dropping set-pieces, but the film is never bloated by them, since they are skillfully contrasted with small-scale scenes, whether set in a police interrogation room or a kitchen or a bedroom. Director Denis Villeneuve and editor Joe Walker do a brilliant job of controlling the pace. Also noteworthy are Roger Deakins' cinematography and JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson's score.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is excellent, cast against type as an all-action police officer. Even better is Benicio del Toro as her mysterious colleague: a compelling, charismatic performance.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, especially for those who like having to concentrate on what's happening on screen."
"kunalkhandwala","9","1","5","26 October 2015"," 'Sicario' isn't triumphant for society but it truly is one of the best thrillers that shows the merciless environment created by the cartels on both sides of the border.
","The biggest war that America needs to win isn't in the middle east or South Asia. It is deep within its heartland where the drug lords of the Mexican cartels have spread the highly influential poison and there is no sign of it ceasing. Tons of illicit drugs pass through secretive tunnels beneath the borders of USA and Mexico, accounting to some very wealthy and powerful cartels while scores of Americans perish under their harmful effects. Parts of Mexico are literally the most violent places on Earth and while Denis Villeneuve's 'Sicario' showcases all these realities between the borders, it serves merely as a backdrop to the true motive hidden beneath the story's surface. This covert war on drugs by America is completely in the gray area of morality and justice of which, Kate (Emily Blunt) is an exponent. She is, however, only learning to cope with the reality around her which alters itself brutally and that, makes her the perfect proxy for the audience.<br/><br/>The cartel has pushed deeper into American soil with Manuel Diaz controlling much of their trade through his legit businesses. While raiding one of his properties for a kidnapping investigation, FBI agent Kate discovers several decaying bodies hidden behind the walls of a house in Chandler, AZ and a subsequent explosion in the backyard shed leaves two of her agents dead. Determined to bring Manuel to justice, she agrees to volunteer in a covert CIA mission led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). On their way to El Paso, she is introduced to the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), whose shady background keeps Kate on guard but whose sharpness on field soon gains her respect. What follows is perhaps the most tense, suspenseful sequence where the agents extradite Guillermo (Manuel's brother) in and out of a prison in Juarez. Brilliantly executed with escalating build-up, aerial cinematography of chaos and a thumping background score, this has to be among the finest moments in recent cinema. Emily Blunt's performance thereafter, portraying Kate's disbelief in the irresponsible engagement with the cartel members at the border in the midst of civilians, is outstanding. Throughout the film, she shows her righteous side that upholds justice, procedure and law. She is vocal about the ambiguity of the mission but as the events unfold, she is left with no choice but to become part of Matt's anarchic team. They soon track down Manuel and initiate a plan that would require him to meet the Cartel's head in Mexico to answer some questions. Against the backdrop of an incredible sunset, the team discovers the tunnel that would lead them to the cartel but Kate sees things she wasn't supposed to. Josh Brolin really gets into his character as he enlightens her about the reality that will be too much for her to handle. He is a bad-ass agent who isn't shaken by the guns firing around him as he chews his gum. Brolin depicts Matt's coldness but with purpose as he sets himself to pursue the bigger objective of the mission. Between Kate's idealism and Alejandro's darkness, Matt is simply a reality check for the situation and Josh Brolin delivers that superbly. Mayhem on a personal level ensues after the tunnel episode and without revealing much of the story's twist, it should suffice to say that it all makes sense in the end. Benicio Del Toro revisits the cartel world after 'Traffic', 'Che' and 'Escobar'. His insight into Alejandro's character seems naturally easy with a rock solid composure under any circumstance that is a result of his dark past. We will never know what he precisely did with the 10 gallon water container that he took into the interrogation room where Guillermo was held and that, is the level of intrigue held by Del Toro's performance. <br/><br/>Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan doesn't just focus on the menace of cartel activity on the streets. The film also goes into its effect on a completely normal family of Silvio, a police officer in Mexico who gets his hands dirty for that extra income. Kate's evolution as a special agent in the war on drugs is in sharp contrast to Silvio's journey. The cinematography by Roger Deakins truly brings out the thrill of imminent danger with vast aerial shots, wide sunset shots and close, dark encounters in the tunnel sequence and the minimalist background score by Johan Johannsson's simply augments the effect. Villeneuve delineates this covert war on drugs without the typical mainstream approach. He shows monstrosity taking over both sides, resulting in total neglect of judicial process, law and morals. Benicio Del Toro is the manifestation of this monstrosity in a laudable performance that should win him a nomination for the Oscars. 'Sicario' isn't triumphant for society but it truly is one of the best thrillers that shows the merciless environment created by the cartels on both sides of the border. <br/><br/>8.987 on a scale of 1-10."
"SquigglyCrunch","9","1","5","21 October 2015"," Rightfully Hyped, Did Not Disappoint
","Sicario was my most hyped movie for 2015 (yes, even more than Star Wars), and I made sure that I saw it in theaters, even if it involved driving for twenty minutes there and twenty minutes back. I was so pleased to find that the movie was not a letdown, and was very well done. <br/><br/>The movie is very well-paced. There's action when it's appropriate, but generally it's pretty slow. Nevertheless, the movie isn't afraid to show something creepy or even something a little grisly, and it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Something you wouldn't expect in a movie like Sicario is humor, and yet it manages to pull it off. The jokes are extremely well-timed, and never take away from the darker, more serious tone of the movie. A simple joke implemented here and there really adds to the development of the characters, and makes them feel a lot more real. It's not overloaded with humor, but the jokes themselves are actually funny, while still telling something about the characters and their relationships with one another. <br/><br/>The characters are actually really well done. They weren't horribly well developed, but the movie isn't character driven. It not always obvious what each of them is like right off the bat, which is good to see, as it makes them feel more authentic and real. They're all developed well enough that their interesting, but they never go too far into depth with all of them and it makes sense in the context of the movie. We spend as much time with them as the main character, so we know as much about them as she does. <br/><br/>The action itself is quite well done. It's not overly graphic, as most of the killing happens off-screen, but it's not glorified or overdone. It's realistic, and that certainly adds a lot to the effect and the experience of the film. <br/><br/>Overall Sicario is great. It's well-paced, realistic, and interesting. The acting is very well done and the characters they portray are well-developed and interesting. If you've got time to spare, I'd suggest seeing it in theaters while you still can. But if you can't, pick yourself up a copy when it gets released, it's well- worth your time."

","Occasionally, a film comes along that moves you enough to write a review on IMDb. So here it is. This movie fully commands your attention. The subject matter is grim. The way the director and the art producer has laid out the feel of the movie is what really makes this a deeply disturbing, unforgettable movie. I did not pay attention to the other movie called Enemy by this same director. This movie has nailed it. The cast is sublime. Emily Blunt, Benecio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Daniel Kaluuya all bring a depth to their respective roles to the point that it almost takes on a documentary or news footage like reality during certain brief periods. <br/><br/>On the whole I highly recommend this film. Quite possibly the best film of the year. Do you remember the movie called Traffic? Well, this one is more gritty and digs deeper into the viewer."
"deproduction","8","1","5","21 October 2015"," As good as action films get
","This is as good as a film of this type gets. The easiest film to compare with Sicario is Traffic. Both were flawlessly acted and directed and revolve around the same subject-matter, though from different perspectives. I imagine Sicario is as clear, deep, and honest a view into the world of the Mexican/American drug trade and the USA's dysfunctional ""war on drugs"" as we can get. No simple good-guys or bad-guys. No master-plan. Just a bunch of flawed individuals and institutions doing the best they can to resist the ugly reality of the society we live in, where drugs are a symptom of larger problems that may never be resolved. The characters are magnetic and deep. The music is phenomenal and eerie. The story is brilliant and complex, and Benicio Del Toro is an absolute shoe-in for best supporting actor (again). Everyone else is equally good, but his role is a rare gem, and if he deserved it for his role in Traffic, he is a lock for his role in Sicario."
"Benkenobi510","9","1","5","12 October 2015"," Sicario
","Lord Pretentious himself, Peter Greenaway, has often spoken of how cinema has always declined in quality, especially in recent years. ""Cinema is dead"" etc. This is undoubtedly unfair, despite today's climate of saturation, because a fine example of cinema being well and truly alive in 2015 is this, Sicario. <br/><br/>Sicario follows a basic structure and one that is very familiar in Storyteller. A young whippersnapper in the FBI (Emily Blunt) is asked to join a group of under the radar operatives to get to the heart of the drug cartel in Mexico. The film has a very dark tone, presenting itself in a gritty, often horrific, crime thriller. Despite it's realism, it never resorts to hand held camera or shaky cam. The gun battles and set pieces are shot beautifully and with nail biting authenticity. Whether or not this kind of dubious stuff actually happens is irrelevant because first and foremost, the characters are believable and engaging. Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt are great but it's Benicio Del Toro who truly steals the show as a shady character who links are unknown. The film ultimately rests on his shoulders as his arc is the most complex and he pulls it off with ease. <br/><br/>The Director of Photography on this picture is Roger Deakins. At times, he makes the film look like a David Attenbourgh documentary with the plains of Arizona and Mexico and at other times, like a Michael Mann film. The way the cities show sparkle in both day and night are fantastically done. <br/><br/>Sicario is not an easy film to watch, some of the most simple actions are the most heart wrenching. Denis Villeneuve proves that by putting the characters in uncompromising situations, it will affect their lives forever and thus, the audience. Simplicity is the key to brilliance, after all."
"thefilmlawyers","9","1","5","5 October 2015"," A bleak, yet rather grim and true view on the War on Drugs
","Sicario, the third Denis Villeneuve feature film after the highly successful Prisoners and Enemy from 2013 and 2014 respectively. The movie stars Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow), Josh Brolin (Everest and No Country for Old Men), and Benicio Del Toro (Escobar: Paradise Lost and Traffic) in a drug-fuelled action movie set along the US- Mexico Border. <br/><br/>The movie is a clichÃ© storyline with characters that have been seen before. But the way that the characters are played is what makes this movie stand out. It should be noted that the posters may show that the movie might be about Emily Blunt's character Kate, but the crucial performance is the performance by Del Toro in his portrayal of Alejandro. This is a performance that hasn't been seen from Del Toro in quite a while. I would have to say that a Best Actor Nomination should easily be coming towards Del Toro's way. An honorable mention to Josh Brolin, portraying the team leader Matt. His character brought comic relief to a movie that was disturbingly serious. <br/><br/>Now the movie itself. The first thing to note is the cinematography. The movie is beautifully shot, which is not a surprise with Director of Photography Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men and Skyfall) at the helm. The panning birds eye view shots of Ciudad Juarez along with street side shots showed the bleak circumstances that the people in Juarez were living in. <br/><br/>The defining message from the film is the bleakness of the War on drugs in the Southern US. It shows how agencies have to ""work together"" just to have a shot at a cartel leader and even getting rid of a single cartel leader just means that another leader has already propped up and ends up being a never ending circle of massacre. <br/><br/>It's not the story that contributes to the high mark it will get, it's the characters in the movie who you connect to immediately, with audiences most likely to latch onto Alejandro's story after his background is revealed. Sicario may not get a Best Picture nomination but might have at least 1 nomination for Best Actor. Sicario gets an A grade."
"SoTotallyDude","9","1","5","4 October 2015"," Sicario sets the bar very high for tense thrillers.
","Simply calling Sicario a tense thriller would not be doing it justice. This is a film firing on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand, this movie is as tense as they get. From the very first shot Director Denis Villeneuve grips you in the palm of his hands, walking you through the craziness of the war on drugs at the U.S. and Mexico border. Emily Blunt is our eyes and ears throughout the film as an idealistic FBI agent thrown into a world she thought she understood until the truth is slowly revealed, layer by layer. Her and her partner take part in confidential operations across the border and are constantly left in the dark, never knowing what their objective is and who they can really trust. As incredible as Blunt is in the film, it's her co-stars who almost steal the show. Josh Brolin paints a character who is disconcertingly casual in his demeanor which provides some humorous moments, but its Benicio Del Toro who will ""wow"" you. Del Toro commands the screen playing a man who is almost wolf-like, dangerous and clouded in mystery. I wouldn't be surprised if Del Toro receives a nomination for his work and would love to see nominations given to almost everyone involved with Sicario. It's that good. Director Denis Villeneuve is never heavy-handed in his approach to the material and with the help of legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, the images created are stunning and the action set-pieces expertly crafted.<br/><br/>Thanks to amazing performances, masterful direction, and beautiful cinematography, Sicario is a visceral experience that will open your eyes to the brutality of the war on drugs."
"graupepillard","8","1","5","3 October 2015"," Idealism vs. realism
","What are the rules of engagement in fighting the Mexican drug cartels especially if US law enforcement agencies go into foreign territories where they have no jurisdiction; does the end justify any means? Denis Villeneuve's intense new film SICARIO (which means hit man in Spanish) takes us into the tactical underbelly of those cryptic individuals who carry out US policy decisions ""from on high"", cloaked in legitimacy, though they are prohibited maneuvers that would be considered illegal in any court of law.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is beautifully filmed - either pale, washed out ochers depicting the long dusty border between US and Mexico, or the rich deep blues and blacks of the evening with night - vision goggles irradiating the world around them into skeletal images. Put a young, female FBI agent into this mix - Emily Blunt as Kate, a dedicated officer, former head of a kidnap-response unit based in Phoenix, who is forced to question all that she has practiced and been taught in the Bureau; her fiercely held personal values are turned upside down by the reality of being recruited into the midst of anti- cartel ""warriors"" who can behave as dark and dirty as their enemy - the drug lords that control the populous by murdering and slaughtering men, women and children, stringing up body parts hanging them from electricity wires like abandoned baggage on clothes-lines.<br/><br/>Transporting, manufacturing, shipping and controlling the wildly lucrative drug industry necessitates making alliances - everyone is corruptible from the dealers to the federales and police on both sides of the border - all partaking of the spoils, while their interior sentiments become ghosts evaporating into the surroundings. ""It is not personal"" are words that exemplify the cool calculations of those in power whose humanity has been shredded, and who barricade themselves with bodyguards and fancy homes from the brutality that they inflict on nameless people.<br/><br/>Kate and her FBI partner ( a good performance by Daniel Kaluuya) are the two newcomers brought along on a mission that they were not briefed on - so the ""fog of war"" is indeed literally murky. Everything becomes clear with time, but meanwhile we in the audience are as mystified as the protagonists. We meet a team of hardened DEA operatives with Josh Brolin as Matt - the wise-cracking, gum chewing leader who is a cipher, offhandedly refusing to respond with a straight answer to any question put before him. Despite his Cheshire-like grin, there is a man beneath the lumbering, impenetrable veneer who is callously determined to fulfill the U.S. government's calculated goals no matter the toll.<br/><br/>Benicio Del Toro is the ""star"" of SICARO, brilliant as the mercenary Alejandro - a person whose face reveals little, but whose eyes and body language betray a passionate resolve for revenge, and a history of incomparable pain and suffering at the hands of the drug-lords becoming a person for hire with no longer a ""soul"" to lose. He is the ""enforcer,"" expert at torture and killing, yet despite his horrific activities, every moment he is on the screen it is filled with his abundant presence and an acute sense of heartache. <br/><br/>Kate's sojourn from an idealistic FBI agent to an awareness of the brutal realities of the contaminated policies used by the United States to combat the ""drug war"" is a bit naive and inconclusive. We sense that she remains a staunch believer in the underlying principle of the ""rule of law"", but we know all-too-well that she is standing on shaky grounds."
"swilliky","8","1","5","3 October 2015"," Slow and steadily dark
","Being familiar with Denis Villeneuve's work, I wasn't expecting an action-packed thriller but a slow, tense, mounting drama that leaves questions long after the viewing. I was not disappointed. Emily Blunt is one of my favorite actresses and her character was great. She should probably get nominated for her descent into the dark underbelly of CIA and Juarez. I also enjoy seeing both Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin in any film so their duo of CIA contractors (or whatever) was fun to see on screen. The violence starts early and I can't remember another film since Traffic that has depicted the violence of the drug war so explicitly. The extraction of the key witness and the resulting highway shoot out was intense. Jon Bernthal makes a surprising cameo,which was one of the best parts. The cinematography was beautiful, such amazing shots. However, I do think Benicio stole the show and it is more about him than Emily's character despite what I picked up from the previews. This will be in the top ten movies of the year unless some surprises. Another great part was the subplot of Silvio with Maximiliano Hernandez (who I recognized from the Marvel Univers). It really showed the drugs wars effect on families."

","I saw the preview for this movie a couple of months ago, and it seemed interesting enough for me to wait for it to come out on video. It gave me the illusion of a modern day Traffic. After seeing a couple of reviews online from some critics that I usually trust to give valid opinions, and calling this a must-see, I thought I'd give it a shot. Also coming fresh off of watching Narcos on Netflix, my Latin drug dealers appetite was still there.<br/><br/>So first and foremost, I have to say this movie did an excellent, and I mean excellent job of putting you in suspense from the beginning and keeping you there until the end. We were able to see this world open up through the untainted eyes of FBI agent Kate Macer played by Emily Blunt. As the protagonist of the film, she was just as much in the dark about what was going on as we were. Every time I found myself asking, 'What the hell is going on?', you can see that she was wondering that too, and when the time was right those questions were answered; but with every question answered we were taken deeper into a really ugly world where the bad guy, good guy line is completely blurred.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that this movie had multiple layers, and each layer that we delve into uncovered something surprisingly dark and unexpected. All three of the main characters were also layered and the more you learned about them, the more you understood their characters and what they really stood for.<br/><br/>The cinematography was exceptional. The beautiful sky's and dark landscapes of Arizona, the sheer scale of the small SUV's entering into the massive, flat and impoverished city of Juarez. Each large landscape scene was used to give the viewer a true understanding of the environment that the officials were about to encounter and it held no bars.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie and the director understood how to use each scene to keep tension throughout the film. There was one part where I thought it was a filler scene and seemed out of place, but then it ties that filler to be just as important and puts us back in that bubble of tension.<br/><br/>The Score! Holy Crap, THE SCORE! The music in this film created a sense of dread in the viewer whenever there was an infiltration of extraction of some sort. JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson needs to win an award somewhere in the near future for how awesome this score was.<br/><br/>Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin were absolutely amazing in this movie. Both had polar opposite personalities but knew were in tune idealistically on the goal of their mission.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: A<br/><br/>I've scrolled through all the movies I've reviewed and this is the first movie I gave a solid A to. I couldn't find much flawed about this movie. The pacing of the film was amazing, the the movie was beautifully shot, the actors all put on great performances, THE SCORE was phenomenal, and the surprises were never expected. I wanted to clap at the end of this movie, but no one else did so I held it in; but this film is definitely a must see. Check out more of my reviews Daniel Ortiz Rants on wordpress"

","My all time favorite Emily Blunt film is Edge of Tomorrow. This movie comes in as my second favorite Emily Blunt movie. Lots of Action, Suspense, Brutal Blood and Gore, and did I say suspense? Yes, this movie is very good at showing you the darker side of humanity and really making you feel it. It blurs the lines between good and evil, and demonstrates the realities of the darker side of ""the system"".<br/><br/>Emily Blunt played her part perfect. Great all-star cast. The script and directors and producers did an A+ job at bringing into this film the darker side of humanity. I truly recommend this film for all the thrill seekers. This movie reminds me a lot of ""End of Watch"" and it gives you the feeling you got from the first time you watched Seven or Silence of the Lambs."

","One very sick, sick movie. It grips you from the beginning, and holds you to the end. It is so realistic, it will make your gut wrenching. At some point you have to do a reality check- you are in the movie theatre.<br/><br/>It is so naturalistic, so you do not recognize some actors who plays. Emily Blunt is excellent, she is very much herself, and along with Del Torro, probably only recognizable right away.<br/><br/>Probably an Oscar nominee in most categories. Beat Argo by a mile, or why I even compare it to a sleazy version of ""Thomas the Tank Engine"".<br/><br/>I haven't seen anything darker or violent in a long, long time. You do not see the level of such violence anywhere, but may be in current reports from Middle East, posted on youtube.<br/><br/>...and this is right next to our doorstep, and it is real, just across the border.<br/><br/>Makes Donald Trump sound like an amateur."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","6","16 November 2015"," A compelling movie that loses focus
","There's an effective, quiet pall that hangs over every scene of Sicario, an appropriately nervous sense that we have entered into an atmosphere of death. This is refreshingly new. Movies about federal agents at war with the Mexican drug cartels have a tendency to be very slick and unafraid to get into the messier bits of such an unsavory industry. Sicario doesn't do that. Here is a movie that isn't afraid to get its hands dirty. Pulled out of our comfortable American of commercialization, the film takes us into a world that might look right at home in a post-apocalyptic thriller. Yet, this is not about any grand catastrophe between nations; it's about the drug war that stretches from the southwestern United States all the way into the deepest heart of the Mexican desert.<br/><br/>The purpose of Sicario (which is the Spanish word for 'hitman') is to take us into this world and then ask us a question. Should our federal agents have free reign to move into Mexico and bend the rules in order to crack down on drug lords who are spilling poison into our country and theirs? The answer is not as simple as you might think. It is easy to think that procedures must be followed, that laws must be upheld. But what are our government agents to do when a community has become so overrun by drug cartels that naked, decapitated human bodies are displayed in public as a warning? It is a moral dilemma that lies at the door of FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt), a relative greenhorn whose experiences are beginning to morph into PTSD. As the movie opens, we find Kate and her fellow agents busting into a house in Chandler, Arizona to find a kidnapping victim. They don't just kick down the door, they're tactics involve driving through the sidewall of the house. After a clumsy gun battle with armed criminals, something comes to light that is first spotted through a bullet hole in one of the walls â€“ a gruesome tableau of death. Bodies wrapped in plastic turn up, rows and rows of them. Who are these men? Why are they here? And how did they meet such a gruesome fate? The search for those answers begins the next day when Kate is hired to join the intra-agency task force that will move into Mexico, and attempt to disrupt the drug business there. Her immediate superior is a smiling wise-guy black-ops cowboy named Matt (Josh Brolin) who isn't exactly loose with the details of their mission. She's none-too-trusting of Matt or his team, and is especially suspicious of a soft-spoken former prosecutor named Alejandro (Benecio Del Toro), a hulking specter whose positioning in this mission has a lot more to do with breaking down the cartels then meets the eye.<br/><br/>Traveling into Mexico with Matt's squad, Kate is appalled by the lack of procedure at hand. What they do, and how they get information. What is most galling to her is that Matt and his team are not interested in arrests but in getting to the kingpin at the center. The method (as spelled out in the trailer) is to stir the pot, the create a war within the community that will smoke the head man out. What seems reasonable to everyone else, is appalling to Kate, who still believes that policy and procedure must be observed.<br/><br/>That, really, is the movie's weak point. Kate spends the entire movie in private protest over what is going on and how things are being handled. We, in the audience, applaud the men who are willing to bend the rules. We understand that they are operating in a den of vicious animals, and certain lines must be crossed, but Kate remains in protest long after it might have seemed that she would come around to their way of thinking. One might think that she would either be on board for this, or be sent home.<br/><br/>I was also put off by the movie's third act, where it might have been interesting to see where the infiltration effected the cartels themselves. Instead the movie turns inward and becomes a more personal drama leading to a showdown that has little if any real resolution.<br/><br/>Those objections aside, this still a very good movie. It was directed by Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve who made the excellent kidnapping drama Prisoners two years ago. What he shows in both films is his ability to orchestrates scenes. The scenes involving the feds infiltrating the inner sanctum of the cartel are handled very well because we understand it as part of the story, not as a series of confused editing as a Michael Bay film might. Villeneuve has the patience to tell this story as it unfolds rather than make it all obvious in the first few minutes. He gives us that sense that we are wandering through the valley of death where bloody violence springs up out of nowhere and human life is meaningless. It's not a perfect movie, but it is a very well made movie, one that has you thinking about it afterwards."

","This is a film that I was excited for ever since I saw the the director of Incendies, Prisoners and Enemy's name Denis Villeneuve attached to this project. though I was worried that the first-time writer's flaws would show, this being his first script - I was surprised to find a great, suspense filled story with interesting characters. this is a film that feels unlike any other, with its different style/approach to the story, set pieces cinematography - with legend Roger Deacons putting one of the most visually striking films to screen. This film is extremely hard to predict, and is riveting to watch all the way to the end, despite the middle feeling like its loosing its way. I thought this as a flaw the first time through, but upon a second viewing I realized that every scene was needed and played an important part to developing characters, story and themes/messages. The performances are nothing short of amazing, and i refuse to give away and details so ill end it at that. Try and refrain from watching any promotional material for this film - as I found this as a more interesting experience from only watching a single trailer. <br/><br/>This is an awesome and intense movie - that should be a required viewing for anyone interested in the art of film making."

","This one is not easy to digest and not easy to shake off. So be prepared. Some of the ideas behind the movie are the same as in traffic. When idealism must face a very gruesome version of reality and realize that the only solution to this is escaping before it sucks you in. The action scenes are cold, brutal and leave no room for glorification or judgment. The killings just happen. No regrets and no emotions just daily business. What you see are people who already set in their path(except for Emily Blunt's character) and who are just executing what has been decided or happened a long time ago. Emily Blunt's character is a indicator of what will happen to a normal person if sucked into this world. She is dragged through the events of this movie without really knowing what happens to her until its too late. This is what i like to call a reality horror movie. It shows us that you don't need a imaginary biblical underworld for having an idea what it is like in hell. <br/><br/>The only disappointing part of this movie were Benicio Del Torro's character. Not the actor himself but the character. Del Torro's character is too far gone to be interesting (in contrast to his character in traffic). There are no pivotal moments no emotions left in his character. He is just executing his revenge plan. Even at the final dinner scene, he did not show any sign of emotions. Relief or anything remotely human. This world and the characters in it drag you so far down that even the last dinner scene, where Del Torro's character kills the cartel leader's family, won't shock you anymore. I watched the scene several times, but given the world which was presented in the movie, it was not shocking anymore. Movies like these don't need a climax (dinner scene) just a fitting end. <br/><br/>This might sound strange, but i can't really recommend watching this movie. The acting is solid, the scenes, the plot, the visuals are all excellent, but this movie makes you feel scared in a very uncomfortable way. A feel-bad movie so to say."
"VladIIITheImpaler","9","1","6","10 October 2015"," Brutal
","The most horrifying part of ""Sicario"" is that everything that happens is the god-honest truth, right down to the sheer amount of death and violence that most Mexican civilians have witnessed as a result of the ""Mexican"" drug war. I put quotations because as one cartel leader in Sicario posits, most of this war was fueled and instigated by the US, unleashing a chain of reactions that has led up to this point. <br/><br/>There is very little in Sicario to suggest that any of it is exaggerated, despite the amount of explosions and gun action there is. The acting and script combined leave you on the edge of your seat about 98% of the time and the other 2% is just a bit of breathing room before the next big event happens, but it all remains plausible. My only issue is that Emily Blunt's character was a little underdeveloped - she starts out as the protagonist but by the end, we're left unsure whether or not she is or Benicio del Toro's character is the real star. It also wavers at times between being a gripping expose and a revenge story for del Toro's character who works as a ""CIA consultant"" to get access to the men responsible for his wife and daughter's deaths. All in all, once you leave - be prepared to lie down after you leave the theater."

","Sicario is dark, dramatic and mysterious that makes it a compelling movie to watch. Its' tension and amazing cinematography make the film more enjoyable in terms of realism. <br/><br/>Led by Benecio Del Toro, who captivates the viewer with his character personality, and Emily Blunt who brings to life a confused character brought into a dilemma. In addition, director Denis Villeneuve; who adds to his already impressive resume another great drama thriller that bring to life the drug war and its cruelty in full effect. <br/><br/>Overall, Sicario is a great visually shot film with wonderful performances that will please the viewer and keep them on their seat."
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","6","4 October 2015"," Land of Wolves
","After Prisoners and Enemy in back to back years, two of the more thought provoking films of the past few years, I have been awaiting Denis Villeneuve's next project. Of course, Emily Blunt is my favorite actress right now, so in my mind the two of them were enough to get Sicario on my most anticipated list for 2015. I can assure you, the film doesn't letdown. Sicario is about an FBI agent, played by Blunt, who is brought along by a government task force to help on the border of Mexico and the U.S. as drug cartels rule the area.<br/><br/>One of the most chilling parts about Sicario is its realistic nature. I had a Zero Dark Thirty vibe in that it doesn't hold back in its brutality. They both have a brilliant female lead as well, although much different characters by motive. Blunt is complemented by Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin as the main three agents. Part of the greatness of Sicario is its cast but I think the marketing was a bit misleading. We are led to believe that Blunt is the central focus of the story, but there is almost as much if not more of Del Toro than anyone else here. It's both good and bad. I was looking forward to seeing Blunt as the integral part of the story, but Del Toro was just as good. <br/><br/>I think the real star of the film is Roger Deakins, the director of photography. He once again gives an incredibly beautiful looking film through his award winning cinematography. Even though this film may fail to get any acting nominations or any of the other big awards, I think it's safe to say that Deakins is a lock for cinematography. It's his panning shots of the border along with J贸hann J贸hannsson's score that give the film an eerie and ominous feel. <br/><br/>It's very difficult to talk about any details without spoiling anything, but I can say that it's a really good movie. I was reading a review that talked about the intensity of a scene before the intensity really begins, if that makes sense. It wasn't the gunshots or explosions that gave me chills. It was the quiet calm scenes before the storm. It's not the mind bender that Enemy was nor the shocker that was Prisoners, but Sicario is one of the most beautifully shot and well acted films this year.<br/><br/>+Blunt can do no wrong<br/><br/>+Eerie score<br/><br/>+Deakins' cinematography<br/><br/>+Brutally real<br/><br/>+Very very very intense<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"trelerke-politics","9","1","6","3 October 2015"," dark, smart, understated, tremendous craft, sad and true
","incredibly well observed and written and directed and acted. Weird violence at the beginning though, not sure why the ""hostages"" were killed and put in walls, that took a lot of work and was a super powerful image but I'm not sure what this was in service to. Why wouldn't you get rid of the bodies? Was it a warning? to who? Anyway, there was menace and creepiness throughout, at night, during the day, any particular scene would turn into something else. A pickup scene in a bar goes terribly wrong, worst date ever! An easy private jet flight has intimations of major trouble as Del Toro's character has a tremor and terrible dreams. Brolin's super casual and easy style/behavior/comportment is equally misleading and menacing. The two police officers are simply covers to allow a super expensive hit mission to proceed for god knows what ultimate purpose. This is a more realistic version of ""no country for old men"" (Brolin was great in that btw)) Hellishly violent as civilization's best angels are missing, as the ""drug war"" sponsored by US consumption and the huge police apparatus serving it, churns through the lives of so many. The little story of the Mexican state police officer was important and hardly ever seen in a movie with such scope. The ending was not Hollywood, there were no heroes, nothing good resulted, the putative heroine is left bereft and barely survives. Very well edited, things are not overstated, we aren't let by the nose."
"jevrio","9","1","6","3 October 2015"," The movie has balls. In a good way.
","Sicario got balls. There's the movies and shows that teases with stepping over the line, going out of it's comfort zone, then at the last second pulls back. And there's some that just doesn't give a damn and does what it wants. This one fits under there. They could go further, but it's both staying respectable, and doing it's own thing. Seems to be a thing with the director, which also made Prisoners, which was rather mature as well. This movie kills people, shows very dead people, and overall shows what I believe is a very good presentation of how bad Mexico can be.<br/><br/>Kate Macer works for the FBI. At a raid on a house, they find more than they hoped for. She joins some group in hope to do some good in the war against drugs, getting the source. This group has been doing their thing for a long time. It's a completely new level for Kate.<br/><br/>They have several longer clips. Not like in Stalker, where every clip is 1-2min long, but long compared to what we're used to in most movies with action. These are very well executed, and each offer something.<br/><br/>Like American Sniper and Everest, Sicario also does a great job with the audio. The music blends in greatly. Good usage of some kind of electronical music, in the form of bass or something. Builds tension so well.<br/><br/>There's a weird thing during a night scene. NVG's are used, but they switch between normal green/noisy effect, and some negative/BW effect. I do not know the reason, and it was confusing.<br/><br/>Towards end end, I was ""blown away"", I did not expect a movie these days to go this far. Turns out it's from the same guy that did Prisoners though. I do recommend this movie, if you like it when things have balls to go far. It respects the viewer in a way. It doesn't care if it hurts your feelings."

Action-Sequences are gruesome, but effectively executed. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro & Josh Brolin take 'Sicario' to an even higher level of greatness, by their performances. Blunt is absolutely stunning in her portrayal. She's affecting & real. del Toro is astonishing. The amount of power he brings to his part, is something to be seen.

The movie works, works well! Main problem is that Emily Blunt got screwed playing this role. Although she does an excellent job approaching her role from an actress stand point, the script, the director and probably even editing makes her role in the movie pointless. It becomes clearer as the movie progresses that the actress got lost in a game which is likely out of her league. Otherwise she would not have gotten into this position in the first place. Everything she does becomes more and more predictable, and at times the script is not consistent with the character's basic self. Nevertheless, this movie is a great head start for Emily in this genre. Hopefully she'll be smarter next time around."

"cultfilmfan","10","1","8","5 October 2015"," Sicario
","The new film Sicario, is a film that if I had to do my best to describe it, I would definitely call it an experience. It is one of those films where once the film starts, it takes you into it's own world with it's characters and the events going on and you get so engrossed and fascinated by what is going on and at the same time the film affects you deeply and leaves a big impact on you during the duration of the film and also once you have left the theatre. The film is so stylishly done and such an intense film to watch and in regards to this intensity and the suspense that the film generates, it is all because of the amazing directing job of Denis Villeneuve who as we have seen in the past with films like Incendies, shows that Villeneuve really knows how to frame a scene and evokes excellent performances from his cast and with his use of music in a film as well as just how every single frame and shot is stylistically done to perfection is one of the truly great things about this film and this is a film that is quite intense to watch and I mean that in the best way possible. Once it gets a hold of your interest it does not let go for the remainder of the film till the end credits when you are finally able to breathe and to pause and reflect on what you have just watched. The film when I say this is not a horror film and nor is it scary either, but just very suspenseful and intense and as I have said above, is just totally captivating and it sure takes us as an audience on this ride and takes us into it's own whole during the 2 hour running time of the film. The acting here by the whole cast which includes Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro is all superb, but I think of all the performances the one that really stood out for me was Del Toro's. He plays a character who is shrouded in mystery and we only start to learn more about his character and his character's past as the film goes along. His character is certainly ambiguous in a lot of ways, but that is a great thing because whenever you are watching his character Alejandro, you really do not know if this is a good character, or a bad character, or if you should be rooting for him, or as cautious, or as on edge as some of the other people in the film (particularly Emily Blunt) is around him. This is a character we watch with great fascination and at times he can almost be chilling to watch and yet it is such a captivating and unforgettable performance that I think in particular that this character and performance will not soon be forgotten and if I had to give my two cents worth, I would say that Del Toro will definitely be up for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance in the film. The performance is that powerful and that good. Emily Blunt is also very good here as a character who questions constantly what is going on around her and if what the people she is working alongside are doing is ethical, or if they are just making up their own rules at the time. She is a strong character in many ways, but you also see that at times she can be scared and in her own way also quite vulnerable. She was more or less the common sense character in the film who had the morals and gumption behind her, even when others didn't. Josh Brolin's character was cocky, arrogant and definitely full of himself and he was a joy to watch because at times the performance could be quite entertaining and almost humorous to watch. Here he proves again what a good actor he is. The film stylistically as I mentioned earlier is one of the best looking films I have seen this year, or really in any other year also. The cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, who I consider to be one of the best in the business. He has given us so many beautifully shot and haunting and yet beautiful scenes in so many films and here he again does an excellent job. In fact I can not think of when his cinematography was not amazing, but it is here as well and captures the haunting yet almost tragic circumstances the characters are in and some of his nighttime shots are just amazing. The film's musical score by Johann Johannsson, is more of an electronic score, but oh how it suit's the film perfectly and adds to that perfect intensity and suspense that the film needs. He does a great job here as well. Ultimately this is a film with very little character study which would usually bother me, but here it is not a problem as we are so glued to the events and characters we do have and here we have the case where the less we know the better. This is certainly a film experience and one that I was so glad I took and again I hope to revisit this film again some day and be totally captivated by it again. One of the absolute best films of the year."

","For two hours, sicario, a thriller about a drug cartel, gripped the audience's throats. From the gender of the main character to its ambiguous theme of morality, the film constantly breaks through the constraints of genre films. In a rare combination of the serious themes of a mainstream drama and the sheer entertainment of a torture cell film, and with one of the best cast combinations, the film doesn't mess around at all."

","I'm watching Sicario now for the umpteenth time as I'm on lock-down due to the coronavirus (all bars are closed and football is postponed-what do you do with yourself in Spain without these options?). I haven't reviewed it before so that motivates me to watch it again carefully. This was almost an excellent film. It's about 80% excellent, and very close to one of the best in this genre. One of the obstacles keeping it from being excellent was Emily Blunt and her character, equal parts of both.<br/><br/>What the film does well, it does very well. It starts off with a real bang. The opening minutes a very compelling, and then the story segues into a complicated and interesting story. The action is soon ramped up to the highest level with the scene crossing into Mexico, a scene filled with foreboding and tension until the climax.<br/><br/>""Why are we going?""
""Because CIA can't operate within U.S. borders without a domestic agency attached.""<br/><br/>This brief exchange is why the movie is good but falls short of great. Had her character not been the protagonist, had some other person been picked for this honor, the film would have been outstanding. The director was a little too intent on pointing out the moral ambiguities in the drug war and ended up erroring on the side of confusing and boring.<br/><br/>Instead of highlighting Emily Blunt's character, imagine a lot more time devoted to that of Benicio del Toro. Alejandro had so much more at stake in this war than she. I would have loved to see his back story, the loss of his family. This was something that also could have been covered in the dreadful sequel to this film."
"carbuff","5","0","2","20 February 2020"," I don't really want to think about it, but maybe we do need some of that ""diversity"" stuff
","I went into ""Sicario"" with really high expectations and left feeling quite disappointed. Perhaps this movie has just aged really rapidly, as movies often do.<br/><br/>I won't be writing any spoilers, but we all know that this film is based on the on-going ""Great Mexican-American Drug War"". Emily Blunt plays an FBI agent and the other Americans are a bunch of shady operatives. I'm an aging (God it hurts to admit that) American male and naturally drawn to action movies, although they're the minority of films I watch.<br/><br/>This film starts off under a steady rain of testosterone, which keeps building steadily throughout the movie, until it's a straight-up Category 5 hurricane by the end. Basically, it's about hard men in a hard world. Playing on that theme, I expect that copies this movie are being peddled in the back of men's magazines alongside ""pheromones"" and ""natural Viagra"". Way before it ended, I was overdosing. (Maybe I'm just too virile as it is and simply couldn't take any more hits, at least not without an opportunity to work it out of my system winning the Tour de France or becoming a home run king.) At least ""Mission Impossible"" flicks aren't intended to be serious commentaries on society.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character was a joke. I'm not that big a guy and not in the best shape of my life, but unless she's some kind of black belt, I'd rip her limb-from-limb. Playing an up-and-coming, hard-core, door-breaking, FBI agent just seemed ridiculous and there was no way to suspend disbelief on this matter. Mostly she came across as a whiny, 90 pound, teenage girl. This isn't misogyny, only the hurtful truth. Total miscasting.<br/><br/>Still, this film's testosterone overload makes a pretty good case for all those annoying diversity activists (should have more particularly mentioned that I'm a white male--the worst kind). Quite reasonably, most of us probably don't want the anti-heroes of ""Sicario"" solving the world's problems. I'm pretty certain that these ""Ultimate Men"" could do no better than another ""Ultimate Solution"", a bit of history best not repeated. Guys like these are the ""Typhoid Marys"" of PTSD. It's like when you elect a psychopath as President--the President's just fine, it's everybody else who suffers. I never thought that I'd ever find myself using that abhorrent, simple-minded, put-down ""toxic"" masculinity, but I'd consider making an exception here. Even the bits of supposed nuance in this film hit you over the head like a 20 pound sledge hammer.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm still giving ""Sicario"" 5 stars, because, at least if you're a guy, it'll almost certainly hold you attention all the way to the end. Shamefully, it did for me. Also it's a very slick production. I remain personally very disappointed though, since so many reviews implied that the plot had depth. I suppose if you're extremely unfortunate you can drown in a wading pool, but it's still not the deep end, even if you can't swim and it's really windy."

"mickdlee","6","0","2","4 January 2020"," Good but flawed on one major point
","I was blown away with the cinematography, soundtrack, acting of Del Toro and Brolin. And I was very entertained. Great premise, only spoiled by Blunt's character.
Don't get me wrong, I love a strong female lead, and the part was well acted, just not well written. Here's my issue.
Blunt is hired after being a presumably superb firearms/Swat cop after narrowly being shot and taking out a cartel member and discovering a grisly scene of 45 cartel victims secreted in a house, which is booby trapped.
She is then hand picked, interviewed, and accepts the job, knowing they're going for cartel members. Massively dangerous job. That, in fact, is why she accepts.
Why then, does she (and her male colleague) then behave like a naiive primary school teacher?
Why, when on a top secret mission, does she choose to go out, go to a redneck bar and pull some random guy? (who proves to be her would be assassin?) Why does she pull a gun on del Toro and punch Brolin?
I understand the need for some conflict of character between Del Toro at one extreme, and her, but it was like she just didn't get it one bit, even after, about a third of the way in, Brolin and Del Toro literally SPELL IT OUT to her about why she's there. Yet, she carries on with the mission, and still whines about why she's there.
When she was in the tunnel, and her head hit the ceiling, so she takes off the helmet and draws a sidearm when she can hear raging automatic fire? Come on. I know we don't have to be ultra realistic, but from a highly trained firearms officer?
Maybe the director should have shown a character arc. For example, Blunt ends up on the final mission with Del Toro and SHE ends up killing the cartel boss and his family. Now that would really give her and us something to think about. Disappointed, because this could have been amazing with some character progression. Won't be watching it again."

","While a lot of action/war/thriller movies are produced in stereotypical and commercial ways, ""Sicario"" manages to mix action entertainment with a real psychological detecting. The difference between two kind of police agent groups, that have to work together, bring the the relation between them to fight against law or moral sense. The main protagonist is a woman that thinks police as an activity all based on the respect of laws: attending this different group for a mission in a cruel Mexico, she discovers the fact that other policemen acts for justice but often using their ways, destroying strict rules or also mixing job with personal revenge. The evolution of Blunt's character is all played inside this space of not coincidence between law and morality, and the difficult to understand what is really good to do.

The film is slow and methodical, building tension and dread as it moves towards its disturbing finale. This is perhaps the best drug trafficking movie since ""Traffic"" (2000), which, coincidentally, Benicio Del Toro won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. ""Sicario"" is a ruthless, violent, and grim thriller that is crafted with such skill and precision that it's darn near impossible to look away. Some people I've talked to complain about the pacing of this movie, or the way that the action scenes aren't actiony enough for them. I urge those people to watch this again.

Emily Blunt's character wasn't so necessary, she had no goal but just going with the waves of this movie, but with her amazing performance, she convinced me -or I pretended being convinced- that her goal is cleaning the world of it's dark crimes, but for me, it's uneven.<br/><br/>Some scenes were so confusing, and there was nothing to give any hope, it's just dark.. from the beginning to the very very end!<br/><br/>These are the flaws of this movie, everything else was well made.. the breathtaking scenes mixed with amazing performances with great story.<br/><br/>Sicario is a great movie, and I'm gonna give it an A-.<br/><br/>Alright, next one is Sicario: Day of the Soldado, stick around.

"El-Dod","7","0","1","9 November 2018"," Not my cup of tea though it's a unique one.
","Sicario is no doubt a very well made film with a director with a vision and imagination as he is always. The music written for the film along with the cinematography must be taught to those who want to make a good movie. The action scenes were done brilliantly by Villeneuve and made me in the middle of the action as If I were there along with the camera movement and it's live shooting with the direct gun shooting. However, despite the great performances , the movie lacked a powerful story and protagonist, by power I mean a solid story with more action scenes and not stretching in the drama and plot scenes that caused me some boring. Also Emily's character despite being the protagonist was completely restricted to it's fear , Ignorance of what's happening and being shocked. Even the movie's end didn't depend on her but gave her a scene in the end which was completely pointless for me and through her vision I couldn't feel the whole film as It suppose to be and it's pointless to have her neglected like that. I can tell that It's one of the weakest protagonist I have ever scene despite being a good character. Villeneuve's work and scenes are distinctive in the film , but the drama scenes that most of the film depended on it with a few action scenes wasn't that good. I say that I can be satisfied with cinematography , the music , the 3 or 4 action scenes including the beginning and ending and not satisfied about the rest even the screenplay that had good lines. 6.5/10"

","The first 30 minutes, and the final 30 minutes are great! The middle hour is rather boring, and it drags on and on. It is funny because Del Toro is mostly in the first 30 minutes and last 30 minutes. He is the highlight of this movie and has the best action scenes. Speaking of action, this movie barely has any action. There is an intense and cool little shootout on a Mexican bridge, and then there is a cool final 20 minutes that have a lot of action and thrills, but overall this movie is actionless. <br/><br/>Even if it didn't have action, I would mind if the characters were interesting. Del Toro and Brolin are the two most interesting in this movie, but they decide to focus on Blunt, whose character is so annoying. All she says is ""What is this? What is happening? What the hell? What are we doing?"" Her character is also poorly written because she is so scare and suspicious about what Del Toro and Brolin are doing in Mexico, but then she goes to a bar and hooks up with a dude without any suspicious thinking. She eventually gets attacked and almost raped by the man.<br/><br/>Overall, the sounds of the guns are great, and the music is thrilling. I just wished this movie had more action and less of Blunt's character. The movie does end with a really cool quote that would fit perfectly in 'Game of Thrones,"" or ""Lord of The Rings."""

","Sicario has been described as another crime drama based on the war of Mexico-USA border. Though, Sicario does many things well such as its storytelling and the overall plot. The film has a slow build up within its first hour but afterwards becomes very much quick paced and more intriguing and engaging. The performances from its leads is what elevates the film as it becomes a much more enjoyable and deserving watch. Especially by Benecio Del Toro as he steals his scenes within the second half. Josh Brolin plays his role well, as does Emily Blunt as the central character (although we can see as to why her character is considered the worst of the three).<br/><br/>Sicario was not as big of a success at the box office (making $85 million on a $30 million budget) but since it has been praised from critics and fans, a sequel is on its way next year, as we expect bigger success than the original. As the film passes, it becomes more intense which is always a positive for thrillers. Although not many twists are included, the film becomes a much watch. Highly recommend.
As a rewatch 05/16/19' Sicario remains one of the finer drug cartel drama thrillers to date. Position stand by the characters, with Del Toro being the most intriguing character between him, Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt."

","Denis Villenueve is slowly becoming one of my favorite directors nowadays. He usually creates great movies, with great atmospheres, with gorgeous visuals and a fantastic cast. This are his main trademarks.<br/><br/>Sicario is about a group of agents and police men of the USA government who are trying to stop the horrible things that are happening because of the drug cartel in the frontier between USA and Mexico. The story is not that original, I think, but what is great about this movie is that it takes a simple story and tells us that story in an original and fascinating way. I was staring at the screen for a really big part of the movie, watching the amazing cinematography, the tense moments and the fantastic cast.<br/><br/>The main character is Kate and FBI agent played wonderfully by Emily Blunt. She is the character who introduces us to the story, and with her facial expressions she is able to transport us to the dark and gritty world of the drug traffic. But she is not the only one who delivers. Josh Brolin also creates a really good character, charismatic but also enigmatic, but the true star of the show is, without a doubt, Benicio del Toro. He is the most enigmatic character, the one that says the least, and the one that you really want to know more about. He is fantastic in the role and I think he won a really deserved Oscar in the supporting role category.<br/><br/>The problem (not big, but still a problem) I have with this movie, and that's why not the 10 stars rating, is the role of the friend of Kate, that I don't really feel he adds anything to the story, more than some moments of friendship between them. And also, there were some moments around the middle of the movie, that I felt a bit slow, and almost unnecessary, but maybe it's a bit of nitpicking on my side.<br/><br/>Apart from that the movie really keeps you on the edge, but with no need of explosions or car chases. Just with the visuals, you are stuck. That is because of the amazing directing by Villenueve, that keeps you in tension in each scene, with the help of the wonderful Roger Deakins, who is able to keep all the shots interesting and beautiful, transmitting you the tension even in a just talking scene. Also, I need to mention the hypnotic score by Johan Johannsson, who add a lot to the building tension of the movie.<br/><br/>Definitely a must see to the cinema lovers, to the lovers of Villenueve, and to everyone who wants a good story told in an amazing and fascinating way."
"gotmyorangecrush","9","0","1","18 August 2017"," ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears and you will question everything we do, but in the end you will understand""
","That quote is one of the things Alejendro (Benicio Del Toro's character) says to Kate Macer (Emily Blunt's character) at the beginning of the film and it really sums up this film perfectly as the viewer is basically in the same position as Kate in regards to understanding what is going on in this film and as a result, you really do question everything that is going on and you really don't understand everything until the end. Honestly, this is one of the best drug related movies I have seen in a very long time!!<br/><br/>I don't want to give any spoilers away as to do so would be a crime to the people that haven't seen this film yet. Its got an absolutely fantastic script and the directing and cinematography are both absolutely off the hook brilliant. One of the things that stood out the most for me was just how amazing the control of tension was in this film. There is a scene in the beginning where the team crosses over to Juarez Mexico to pick up a high level drug detainee and brings him back across to the US. It was roughly 10-15 minutes of the movie and the tension in that scene just builds and builds throughout the entire scene. It was just a masterfully crafted sequence of the film, in every single aspect of film making, and the film only gets better and better from there. <br/><br/>The cinematography in general was just absolutely brilliant throughout the entire film. The car scene I just mentioned in the beginning, the amazing aerial photography shot on the border and in the city of Juarez, and in particular the use of satellite imagery, drone imagery, and the use of night vision photography towards the end of the film. They even use security camera footage. Its just a masterful blending of a whole slew of different photographic tools and styles and it really helps give the film a sense of realism and really helps put you in the shoes of Kate and the team. I'm a professional photographer so I tend to focus on cinematography more than your average film goer, but this cinematography is so well done that I think most movie goers that appreciate a beautifully shot film will be talking about just how amazing this aspect of this film was when the credits start rolling. <br/><br/>And the casting is just top notch. Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, and Benicio Del Toro all give top notch performances. Benicio Del Toro's performance is definitely the best of the 3, but that's mostly because his character was the most interesting of the 3. There is a lot of mystery and intrigue behind his character and you don't find out the real story behind Alejando until the end of the film and Del Toro does a brilliant job with the role. You can see Kate trying to figure out just who Alejendro is from the very beginning of the film and were only given small bits of information on his character as the film goes on. One of my favorite aspects of Josh Brolin's character, Matt Graver, was just how much he enjoys sticking it to the bad guys. He is a man that truly loves what he is doing and you see him smiling in many scenes where most people wouldn't be. And Emily Blunt definitely holds her own. All 3 play off each other really well and the result is one of the best acted films I have seen in awhile.<br/><br/>If there was one weakness in regards to the casting it was with Kate's partner Reggie. Its not that he did a bad job, its just everyone else did such an amazing job that his character just doesn't hold up and feels kinda boring. Fortunately, even when he is there, the focus is usually on one of the other team members so his performance really doesn't hurt the film at all. Again, his performance just wasn't up to par with the rest of the performances in the film. <br/><br/>All in all, Sicario is just a brilliant film. It has a fantastic script, great casting, top notch performances, and some of the best cinematography I have seen in some time. It has action, tension, intrigue, and it has some great twists and a great ending. Ultimately, this film was a very different take on the whole ""war on drugs"" genre of films. <br/><br/>Definitely a solid 9/10 for me!!"

","The Mexican drug cartels that are responsible for a large part of drug trafficking across the United States' southern border and the FBI that is responsible for pursuing them are front and center in Denis Villeneuve's thriller 'Sicario.' The cat-and-mouse chase that is widely known by many but understood by few makes for an interesting plot, but it's really the politics, red tape and difficult decisions that need to be made that are explored in the film.<br/><br/>In 'Sicario,' an up-and-coming FBI agent named Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is summoned to support a multi-agency effort to weed out a kingpin drug lord on the El Jason border - an effort led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and a chameleonesque Mexican agent played by Benicio Del Toro. As the sting gets underway, Macer quickly learns things are not quite how they appear on the surface, and through the process she is tasked with acting on her principles or what others believe is the appropriate thing to do. This set of moral dilemmas is what increases the interest level in 'Sicario,' rather than the action sequences that dominate the screen time.<br/><br/>The film's strengths are namely the screenplay, cinematography (including earning an Academy Award nomination) and acting performances, particularly when it comes to Blunt, Brolin and Del Toro. The tug-of-war between the dueling priorities among the U.S. team's side makes for an exciting premise from an acting standpoint, as there is a lot of tough talk and tense situations that must be navigated. There are plenty of twists and turns before we get to the climax, and it's fair to say the resolution will leave many questions among audiences.<br/><br/>'Sicario' is the kind of thriller that will fly under the radar but still be held in high regard among fans of the genre."

","Sicario is a movie Directed by Denis Villeneuve the same director and writer associated with the new and amazing revelation of 2016 Arrival. The first thing we have to keep in mind is how deep the characters are, and how well portrayed.

Benicio Del Toro represents the opposite, Ice cold murderer with a very justifiable goal. Amazing pace and incredible end."

","SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Have yet to see over the decades whether it ranks up there with Luc Besson's Leon for re-watchability, smart writing, excellent story telling and characterization, but Sicario has been one movie I've re-watched happily several times because of all this.<br/><br/>The brilliant cinematography manages to make a typical 'soldier movie' very unnerving and dynamic. You don't feel a static moment in the entire movie and it just rockets from start to finish with unrelenting inevitability for the main hero.<br/><br/>Because the story isn't a 'standard' war movie, it allows for the hero to feel uncomfortable and uneasy throughout, and that's further brought up by the excellent audio and music mix that accompanies it. It's one of the cases where the audio really does heighten the tension, and adds much more to the cinematography.<br/><br/>Without relying on tons of special effects due to the smaller budget also gives this movie a far more 'real' feel than the latest 'Battleship' and such because everyone's forced to work on location rather than green-screened. <br/><br/>Multi-dimensional story, characters with good conflicts in difficult situations, and the feel that everything is constantly out of balance.<br/><br/>Wonderful, worth watching in the theater and the BluRay buy.

","Whether it's the limitless expanse of the Desert Southwest or the danger-filled streets of Ciudad Juarez as captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins, ""Sicario"" is a film utterly attuned to the drama of its spaces - especially when, within those spaces, there is occurring an intractable drug war that threatens to lay waste to the land and the people on both sides of the U.S./Mexico border. <br/><br/>Directed with brio and style and an unerring instinct for visual impact by Denis Villeneuve, ""Sicario"" stars Emily Blunt and Daniel Kaluuya as two FBI agents brought in to lend ""legitimacy"" to a shady CIA operation headed by Josh Brolin. The ostensible goal is to bring the head of a Mexican drug cartel to justice, but could there be another, more personal reason for the mission - and exactly how far should two federal officers, sworn to uphold the law, be willing to go in overlooking some of the questionable means being used to achieve that end?<br/><br/>The screenplay by Taylor Sheridan takes us to a dimly-lit world of bloody cartels and government malfeasance where morality is murky and all sorts of ethical lines are crossed in pursuit of some larger goal - be it ""justice"" in a cosmic sense or just plain revenge for a wrong done and a personal loss suffered. Sheridan keeps not only Blunt and Kaluuya's characters in the dark much of the time but the audience as well, generating and sustaining an air of mystery and heightening the suspense.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" features excellent performances from its cast, with a special shout-out to Benicio del Toro as an enigmatic, shadowy figure whose role in the proceedings is initially unclear but who steps forward, in sometimes shocking ways, as a major player in the series of events as they play themselves out.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" is rare among American movies in that it refuses to provide the kind of neatly packaged conclusion we've come to expect from commercial enterprises, choosing instead to show that there are no easy solutions to complex problems and no happy endings for anyone involved in the messy, violent business we euphemistically call ""the war on drugs."""

","This movie is a combination of several movies about the Mexico - USA drug traffic drama. It's a mix that works, however it falls short in several places and the plot leaves too many holes in the plot. You should just watch it and avoid to make too many questions. But the most surprising aspectof this movie is the way the director wasted the role of the main female character played by Emily Blunt. I still don't understand why she accepted this role after reading the script. Her role in the movie is just a first row spectator. With or without her the movie plot had developed exactly the same way and her character doesn't even get a full explanation why she was invited to join the team in the first place. She is just dead weight. Probably they needed her name to help increase the movie revenue, probably she was bored or lose a bet.

"Tarx309","8","0","1","10 August 2016"," An incredibly intense and unique film
","Sicario was one of the most overlooked movies of 2015. It was given little recognition at the Oscars, yet was far more entertaining than many of the other nominees (I'm looking at you, Bridge of Spies). Sicario is a contemporary movie set in the drug-ridden streets of Mexico. It is a simple, relatively small-scale movie, but very entertaining. The opening of Sicario unfolds at such an intense level that it seems impossible for director Villeneuve to sustain it, let alone build on it, but somehow he manages to do just that. The edging tension building up throughout the movie is the product of some very strong directing, which is evident throughout the movie. The movie is relentless in its tension, which doesn't cease until the credits role.<br/><br/>The cast is also one of the movie's strongest points. Emily Blunt is a fantastic lead, with a great realism to her character. Benicio Del Toro's acting is strong also, as he plays a mysterious and almost creepy assassin with next to no empathy. But perhaps Josh Brolin plays the most memorable character. Witty, passionate and surreal, Josh Brolin truly shines here. The most annoying part is that Jon Bernthal, who is listed as the 5th top star here on IMDb, is unfortunately in less than ten minutes of the movie. It seems bizarre that they would hire such a great, upcoming actor behind roles such as The Punisher and Shane Walsh (not to mention some big, Oscar winning movies like The Wolf of Wall Street) and barely even use him. Still, his brief appearance is still noteworthy. <br/><br/>It's hard to find fault with Sicario. On the level of craft and performances, it's spotless. If you're looking for a great meaning or message, you'll be disappointed here. The movie would perhaps benefit from not being so small-scale, as by the end there is a feeling that it all didn't amount to much. Still, it's an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is sure to stick with you for a while."

"jgtrek","9","0","1","4 May 2016"," Very good, tense thriller with a cast that shines.
","Sicario is Spanish for ""hitman"" or ""assassin"". I learned this from watching the trailer. For the majority of the film, I was waiting to find out what its significance was. It paid off in a very slow, tense, and anxiety ridden way that subverted the usual type of plot twist that tries way too hard to ""blow your mind"". Sicario starts out by using tropes we're very familiar with in crime dramas or police procedural. Some examples: <br/><br/>-Rookie FBI agent recruited for extra special secret dangerous mission. -Sassy partner/sidekick. -Super clean, futuristic government offices with glass walls, glass tables and lots of flat screen monitors. -Viewing security cameras in the back of an unmarked van. -Black government SUVs with tinted windows. -Mysterious, unconventional mentor. -Don't touch that, it's going to- Yep, it blew up. <br/><br/>It uses those tropes very well, though, and drops most of them by midway through the film. Emily Blunt stars as Kate, and up and coming FBI agent working the drug trade routes along the southern border. She is recruited by the unconventional (He wears flip flops in the office! So unconventional!) government agent Matt, played very well by Josh Brolin. The real star is Benicio Del Toro, who is a shady government ""consultant"" working on the team. I won't go much more into plot details, because its best if you go in fresh, but the overall plot is relatively simple. Where Sicario really shines is pacing and the building of tension. The score is extremely minimal, and gives a sense of dread the minute it starts. The type of tension is also something that's rare now-a-days; it's not ""edge of your seat"" in the ""wow this is an exciting, fun adventure"" sense, its edge of your seat in the ""wow I'm scared, I feel sick to my stomach and am actually sweating right now"" sense. Director Denis Villeneuve has demonstrated with great skill how he can impart a sense of pure dread on an audience. <br/><br/>My one and only gripe with the film is that the main character felt relatively flat up until the third act. She just goes along for the ride, literally, for the first 40 minutes of the film. This is explained away in the end but sort of feels unrealistic to add an FBI agent to your team just to have them do nothing. Blunt plays the character very well, and an arc is apparent by the end of the film. Josh Brolin does a good job in his role, but is overshadowed by Benicio Del Toro. Del Toro's performance starts out benign and kind of mysterious, but slowly morphs into something you'd check under your bed for before going to sleep at night. <br/><br/>Like I said, the plot and overall lesson of this film has been done many times before. How far will you go to stop the bad guys, will you risk resorting to immoral means to win, etc. Where Sicario really shines is in pacing, tone and casting. Overall a very good crime thriller that subverts some genre tropes to make for a memorable experience."

","Sicario is about the war against drugs and the drug cartels in Mexico. The FBI agent (Emily Blunt) gets hired by the CIA for a secret mission to bring down a drug lord. She will together with a special force working directly under CIA's special departments, cross the border into Mexico and bring back a powerful ally to a drug lord. Joshn Brolin plays a supporting character as a cocky CIA leader and Benicio Del Toro plays a mysterious hit-man whose participation for a long time remains a mystery. Sicario is raw and contains a brutal realism that really reflects the reality it is supposed to represent.<br/><br/>The film starts immediately and Kate who works for the FBI, stumbles across a huge find that takes her to the CIA's special departments. Soon she works under strict secrecy and is forced to question her own morale values. It is here that Sicario starts to get really interesting. Everybody in the CIA has a pretty relaxed and cocky tone, despite the serious and sometimes brutal things they actually experience. I get the same thoughts and feeling as I got when I watched humans being tortured by relatively normal and not particularly affected people in the film Zero Dark Thirty. How far are we willing to go to defeat this evil, and can we come out of this with our ideals and values intact?<br/><br/>Sicario goes on i a decent tempo with only a few slow parts here and there. There is an incredibly exciting car scene about halfway through the film that contains a lot of action, but besides that aren't there really that many action scenes. It is rather the politics and the questions of how to fight this brutal criminality, that are central for the film. Sicario is definitely a film worth watching for the problems and thoughts it takes up. The plot sort of twists itself by the end and I feel content afterward. All in all a solid film, a strong 6 out of 10.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"
"Tehmeh","9","0","1","8 April 2016"," Intense, even when nothing is seemingly happening.
","Just watched it on blu-ray (a really stripped release, at least here in the nordics, no extras at all which is a shame). Trying to gather my thoughts here. <br/><br/>""Sicario"" isn't a tight story in the traditional sense. It's not focused on a single central character or point from the beginning to the end, but it's not a mosaic either. It's not like ""Traffic"" or ""Crash"" where stories of certain characters overlap. It's just a movie that shifts its focus at times without losing the big picture. And I must say that even if I'm not the biggest fan of movies that do this - because I want to focus on one thing only and let the story happen around that one thing - they really made it work.<br/><br/>In some ways, this is a disturbing movie. It doesn't run on shock value and the point isn't to burn horrifying images into the viewer's brain, but it's tense. Even when nothing is happening, I feel the tension. And when something happens, I feel the impact. This wouldn't happen if everyone didn't handle their parts well. Director Villeneuve, all the actors, cinematographer Deakins, the sound department - great job. Flawless execution. Writer Taylor Sheridan got on my ""watch this guy's movies if you can"" - list as well.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" doesn't force-feed you anything. It prefers showing rather than telling, and Villeneuve knows how movie language works. Scenes are powerful in a way that few movies nowadays are, and every beat seems to have a purpose. It's a great movie to look at, too. Effective visuals all around.<br/><br/>This movie had a few nice surprises to it. So many times when I watch a thriller, I know what's going to happen five minutes before the fact. This isn't the case here, because the audience isn't treated like a bunch of idiots. And even when there are a few familiar moments, they're executed so well that I felt rewarded. Another surprise is how well the action was handled. It had real weight, real impact to it. Every moment mattered. I rarely see this kind of execution that puts many good action movies to shame. And this isn't even an action movie. I'm genuinely impressed.<br/><br/>About the actors. They nailed it, and the funny part is that they didn't really get to show their range as actors. They don't have much wiggling room. No Oscar bait performances here. It's almost monotone, but the little nuances are there, and they are powerful. Emily Blunt is at her best, as is Benicio Del Toro (who shows how intimidating he can be). Even Josh Brolin was very good. Blunt and Del Toro had amazing chemistry. There's a scene in the end between these two, and it's amazing in its almost stressing simplicity. We don't get to know much about the characters because the nature of this film - which is a little unfortunate - but we get enough. We get something to latch on to.<br/><br/>My only real gripe is this: ""Sicario"" is not about a tight or a personally compelling story, it's more about a series of events. Not a mess of events by any means, and it does paint exactly the kind of picture it aims for, but I guess it's just my preference to have it some other way. So while I wasn't personally as invested to the characters I would've wanted to, I do realize what they were going for and I think they succeeded.<br/><br/>This is a movie for movie lovers. It can be a little slow at times, so it's not a popcorn flick nor an action movie, but a really well executed film where even the little moments matter. Everyone involved brought their best. Definitely recommended."

"gavin6942","7","0","1","21 February 2016"," A Different Look at the War on Drugs
","An idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is enlisted by a government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.<br/><br/>Let me start with this: Officials of Ciudad Juárez criticized the depiction of that city, El Paso's cross-border twin, expressing their view that Sicario portrayed their city in a bad light, for instance in its sequences depicting nighttime firefights in the city, and tortured bodies of dead hanging from downtown viaducts.<br/><br/>While the movie is not a true story, it is intended to send a message about a real situation: the violence associated with drugs. And because it intends to get a response, some level of realism ought to be encouraged. I have no idea if the CIA is doing border raids. I have real doubts that American soldiers can go within a mile of the border and kill citizens indiscriminately. If we are supposed to sympathize with Blunt's character, we ought to a) feel the violence by Americans is not justified and b) believe this is something that actually happens.<br/><br/>But, even if it is an exaggeration, it still has a kernel of truth. El Paso is a nice city, but just over the border are slums. And we have to ask why that is. And while the film never touches on immigration directly, there is that topic always lurking in the background: can we blame Mexican citizens for illegally entering America if they are fleeing such violence and crippling levels of poverty? Legal or not, they could be said to have a moral right to defend their children by any means possible. (I am not advocating here or attempting to be political, but merely saying there are multiple issues and angles to consider.) The real breakout actor here was Benicio del Toro. This might have been Blunt's film, but del Toro really carries it in the second half. Rumors are that there will be a sequel that follows his character. Not sure how that is possible, but it could be interesting. He came off as a cross between Dirty Harry and Jason Bourne, one man against all the drug cartels. Could be an interesting story to follow if done right.<br/><br/>The film received three Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Editing. As far as Best Sound Editing goes, I have no way to judge that properly, and cannot give an intelligent assessment one way or the other.<br/><br/>Interestingly, on both Score and Cinematography, its biggest competitor is Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"". And if it were up to me, I would split the difference and give them each an award. While the score for ""Sicario"" is very distinct and stood out in my head as few others do, it is up against Ennio Morricone. Ho do you compete with a living legend, especially when this is likely his last chance at an Oscar? So I suspect that even if ""Sicario"" has the better score (which is debatable), ""Eight"" takes the statue.<br/><br/>And we go the other way on Cinematography. What ""Eight"" has going for it is the unusual decision to release a film in 70mm. But because so few theaters can even show it, and so few scenes of the movie really need it, it comes off as a gimmick. In contrast, ""Sicario"" has great aerial shots, night vision shots, thermal shots... a whole range of ways to see the world not often used in one picture. And the man behind the camera is Roger Deakins, possibly the greatest cinematographer alive. So, give him the award."

","Maybe the reason Sicario didn't do so well at the box office or nominated for more deserved Oscars, such as Best Screenplay, Acting and definitely, Picture, was because of how bad the title is. I can barely pronounce it, unless I look at it, or even remember the title. In fact, when I went to go to recommend this at work today to my friends after seeing it for the first time last night, I had to Google it each time.<br/><br/>I get what the word means: hired assassin, and it does, very appropriately, fit into the movie. But, that doesn't stop it from failing to get the great word of mouth it truly deserves. I mean, c'mon people; this is a great movie!<br/><br/>From moment one, the movie looks gorgeous. It's so beautifully and carefully shot, it better win one of the (only, gasp!) three awards it was nominated for: Best Cinematography. What further grabbed me was the story began in Chandler, Arizona, a Phoenix suburb close to where I work, of all places, and not the obvious choice of Arizona's largest city and capital, Phoenix, itself. That's so cool.<br/><br/>Beyond the location and immediate intrigue – this movie wastes no time getting into an extremely interesting story, the high quality acting and direction are immediately present. Emily Blunt blasts onto the screen with a character and acting ability that makes us quickly emerge into her world. <br/><br/>Blunt's FBI agent, Kate Macer, is recruited by some incredibly confident ""secret government agents"" that convince her she'll be helping them catch the drug lord(s) who are terrorizing her home of Phoenix (and suburbs) especially after the location mentioned above – a Chandler, Arizona home – practically blows up with a trap set by the drug bad guys.<br/><br/>Not without a conscience, Kate is baffled on how the real war on drugs is fought and alongside her even more suspicious partner, she questions and attempts to do the right things to get convictions and build cases against the czars while her new leaders pretty much act all Jack Bauer in Mexico and here against the baddies.<br/><br/>There's more, much more, as this onion gets pealed, and I'll leave all that up to you to see for yourself. As you should. In fact, go seek out this movie now and see the greatness for yourself. <br/><br/>This movie is absolutely intense and raises so many ethical questions. It's easy, and common, for me to say, YES, do law by the book. Heck, I even have previously built a case against the vigilante, The Batman, on how he always breaks the law every time he leaves the Bat-Cave. But, all the way through this, and seeing the grotesque scenes in Mexico, I found myself sometimes siding with the ""Super-cops"" Kate is internally battling and at other times, agreeing with Kate's morals. <br/><br/>Now, without giving away the ending, but keeping with the same point, I have to wonder if I chose the right side. That said, or not said I guess, I LOVED the ending. Even though the movie is fiction, we're usually left with the twist and ironic ending. No, I don't usually like those, but generally respect the writers for doing what they thought right. THIS was how I wanted it to end and made it all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Definitely should've used a different title. I bet that would've gotten the word out more and more people would've seen such great efforts all around.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: My friend and professional movie critic named this as his favorite movie of 2015 and called it the horror police procedural ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (summing up his words.) Well, like I stated above for the title, I've never heard of it, but taking both his word on the best of 2015 and him comparing it to my favorite movie of all time, The Silence of the Lambs, I had to see it. <br/><br/>And yeah, it was kinda like The Silence of the Lambs. Totally can see that. So, thank you, Kevin. Glad I finally listened to you."

","Sicario is more than just an action-thriller about the brutal, pointless drug war in North America. Its graphic depictions and nihilistic tone flip a sizzling pan of heroin into your face over and over again, forcing you to confront the grim realities of wealth, power and addiction.<br/><br/>The cinematography is a treat and the bleak landscapes of the American desert and the gang riddled ghettos of Mexico are themselves a metaphor for the emptiness of the struggle our characters endure. Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt all put in excellent performances and the script is clean and efficient, eschewing needless exposition in favor of short, smart dialogue that focuses on pushing the plot forward and not wasting time or insulting the intelligence of its audience. The ominous soundtrack and excellent pacing keep you on the edge of your seat as you move from one barbaric encounter to the next.<br/><br/>The ending is truly climactic and impactful, but it offers the audience a chance to meditate on the events and meaning of the piece before the credits role. It is a complete, coherent, well planned body of work that trusts the intelligence of its viewers, which makes it the rarest kind of film these days."
"lucasnochez","9","0","1","3 February 2016"," Film Review: Sicario
","Scorching with the dry and arid heat of the desert land, an aerial view of Phoenix, Arizona fills the opening screen of French Canadian director Denis Villenueve's newest feature Sicario. Sweaty, pulsating with uncanny tension and trumpeting with constant uncertainty, it seems that the land in which Sicario is based on is inhabited solely by the ravenous animals of the desert; and no, it isn't referring to the four-legged desert beasts hungry for blood.<br/><br/>Premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier in the season, Villeneuve's newest film seems to touch upon a current trend plaguing all new outlets, artistic commentaries and current events; immigration, and not just at a national level, but from a very large and vast international one.<br/><br/>Sicario takes places in the rural desert areas of Arizona and Mexico, setting the tone for a very corrupt and dangerous world where Mexican cartels rule the land, and the sounds of gunshots are as frequent as the cries of wolves. Drug cartels keep citizens in fear, police are as corrupt as the cartels themselves, and the efforts of the United States and their universal judiciary right for ""peace"" is as subtle as the low-efficiency Black SUV's snaking their way through the hot highway pavements. With the high exposure of Trump's high-attention media-driven campaign, as well as age-old conflicts between land, boarders and people in other areas of the world, the issues of immigration are as universal as the numeric system, which makes Villeneuve a perfect candidate to direct a wrought, unbiased and highly effective piece of fiction and reality.<br/><br/>Yet, with all its high-profile media attention and concurrent position in all the headlines, Sicario doesn't soar to its conventional storyline of corruption and intrigue of mystery for loyalties and alliances; the film itself exceeds due to its honest portrayal of people playing people, dealing in real ways with the abundance of injustice and violence.<br/><br/>The spearhead of these real people is highlighted by the impeccable performance from Emily Blunt. Blunt, who trades in glam for grit, plays Kate Macer, an idealistic Special Weapons and Tactical Team agent who believes in justice and the greater good. During a routine kidnapping raid, Macer and her trusty partner, Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), encounter a total of forty-two corpses hidden within the walls of the abandoned home, as well as an explosive device that detonates, killing two officers, and wounding Kate and Reggie. With the aftermath of the explosion behind them, Kate is offered a position working for the CIA and Department of Defence, lead by the egotistical and reckless Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). Using brute force and unconventional and highly illegal methods of dismantling the Mexican drug cartel, the special unit, paired with the help of a very mysterious and highly intimidating Alejandro (Benecio Del Toro), break the rules of law in order to get their men.<br/><br/>Sicario is an uncomfortable film, in every sense of the word. Recommending the film would be a hard sell. If it wasn't for the always spectacular Del Toro, who chimes in an Oscar worthy supporting performance that requires very little dialogue, but masterful minimalist acting, the film itself isn't the most commercial in theatres. The intensity of the film stays true to the very blurred lines of federal justice while crossing State lines; constantly being under strict surveillance. Although the characters seem to be always out of their own jurisdiction, Kate seems to be the teams only voice of reason. It becomes quite clear early on, that everyone else in the ops are crossing the rules of the terrain, forcing Kate to bend her very strong and unwavering moral conscious. What might appear to be a very annoying character trait, in reality becomes a selling feature as Kate's ability to humanize the very barbaric people around her is something audiences admire, not begrudge.<br/><br/>Much like the memorable performance from Del Toro's Alejandro, Sicario embodies the characteristics of the most memorable strong, silent type characters in cinema. Without over- stimulating the senses in the way Hollywood knows how to, Sicario never lets up its aggressive demeanour, despite its scarcity. Thanks to the wonderful work of Jòhann Jòhannsson (Prisoners, The Theory of Everything, Foxcatcher), who sets an unsettling score with natural sounds of harmful creatures (buzzing of bees, howling of wolves), the film's score paces the very slow moving material at a very heavy and fluid pace. Matched with the wonderful cinematography of master Roger Deakins, the confident and tremendous direction of Villeneuve, and phenomenal transformation of Blunt as Kate, Sicario is one of the most, if not most, complete films of 2015, in all regards, cinematically speaking.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a diamond in the rough. Deakins, the most deserving man working in the world of cinema for an Academy Award, blends his previous knowledge of shooting No Country for Old Men, which took a very open scope desert and added hints and cues of blue and orange, and transformed a landscaped soaked in the red of innocent men's blood, and added a humanistic and unmeasurable grainy quality to the film that elevates the notion of feuding neighbouring countries to alarming heights.<br/><br/>Written by actor turned writer extraordinaire Taylor Sheridan, much of the film's script is guiding by the gazes of promise and the hope for change. Yet, the film itself is a violent and very realistic facade of impossible compromise and shattered dreams. Graver, a jokester and impressionable man with very shaky loyalties, at one point in the film, taunts Kate with lines like, ""you are dramatically overreacting"" or ""you saw things you shouldn't have seen"". While Alejandro assures Kate that no matter what actions are taken by the team, ""Nothing will make sense to your American ears"". It is through these desensitized scenarios that many of the muddled strategies of governments, bureaus and of individuals can never really be truly understood in the eyes of other people; which becomes the greatest dichotomy of Sicario."
"deloudelouvain","9","0","1","5 February 2016"," Excellent movie with gripping moments.
","It has been a while since I saw a very good movie. I thought Sicaro was an excellent movie. A great cast, where all the actors bring something to the movie, especially Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Really well acted from both of them. During the movie you have at least three really good suspense moments, where you are gripped into the story. I don't get that feeling a lot in other movies. At the border and in the tunnel were my favorite parts of the movie. The excellent sound effects add a big contribution to the suspense. To me it's essential for a good movie, and a lot of times in other movie that's what it lacks to make them really good. The actors, the sound, the filming and the whole storyline makes this movie one of the better ones I saw this year."
"miikanissinen","6","0","1","30 January 2016"," Good, but far from it's potential
","Sicario starts with slow pace, giving promises of possibly developing into excellent movie but is all of the sudden rushed to it's conclusion. And the conclusion of the movie is so, so mediocre. Yes, I definitely didn't see what was coming, but what it actually was were far from the potential that it could have realized. Minute by minute I'm getting more annoyed how lame the climax of the story was. Plot was actually created in a way that didn't a single clue what really was going on, but that just makes it harder to accept, that things were revealed too fast and the plot line is not very innovative. Yes, this movie is in someways really good, but it's story is not consistent, and won't offer anything special that requires to be seen. Acting isn't good or bad, so also it won't be worth to mention (well, maybe Josh Brolin and his cocky part is something worth mentioning and what I enjoyed). All in all, if you prepare to see a movie about drug wars, don't raise your expectations too high. It really won't dig deep into the issue, and no one does anything more than what is needed in terms of quality, and that annoys me much because this film has the visible potential to raise above it's mediocrity.<br/><br/>I admit, I am being very provocative with my grade, because world is full of movies worse than this. But this one's problem is it's lack of ambition. There were possibilities to film far greater movie, but none of them were used and that's why this movie left me with great frustration. I thought I was going to get a movie about Mexican drug wars, but all I got was a special operation to murder some drug-lord, although interestingly the main assassin is actually person from other side of the law, which is nice twist revealed pretty late in story. But the way of revealing the background is so boring, that whole thing feels very lame. One perfect example how good idea is ruined with one bad. If done better the movie would have definitely given more chances to think it views afterwards, but boringly they wrote to plot that accidentally one main character finds herself somewhere she shouldn't:t be and reveals crucial and unpleasant truth. Unpleasant for her and unpleasant for them who enjoy plot twists to really surprise. Laziness in coming up with some original turn in story makes it once again very hard to have warm thoughts about this movie. My opinion is that they had potential to write a movie that would have left impact for a long time after credits. We already make movies that shows life is often far from the straightforward battle of good and evil, mostly different scales of gray and because everyone of us has opinion about that, so well written movie without straight answers can be excellent way to see life in light not seen before, and that is one of the important ways to understand ourself and each other more and maybe make this planet better place to be. I am not demanding from any film to be larger than life or be discussion-opener, but artist is making something very important and honorable if trying so.<br/><br/>I advocate art that raise inspiration in light or deep questions about life and art itself. There would have been enough of philosophical dilemma just showing legal police forces helping drug criminal to get him his vengeance which include very cold-blooded assassination of his target's family under the eyes of their father. That was brutal but honest, that was something that wasn't underlined and that actually made it one of the most memorable things this movie has. That shocked and moved me, not the faith of the cop who lost his job and dignity, that story has been told millions of times, and in millions of ways. And this wasn't much after seeing how two sons and wife were killed in front of their family head. Have to say that the last act where she pointed gun at him, makes me now wonder why she didn't do it. By the reaction to the signing of that paper bit earlier you could guess, that her days as police, at least as some detective in larger bureau were history and realistic option would be officer in little town. And next second she had possibility to end that mans life. Though I remember her expression weren't any positive, maybe there was something high in moral that told him not to kill him or that killing him won't make anything easier. Why, that will be a mystery but one final example of what movies are capable in best.<br/><br/>Subject is interesting, but this movie has too many flaws to be very recommendable. Life there from the view of anybody whose life is touched by drugs in one way or another should easily inspire whole bunch of movies. Sicario brings up very important issue, but unfortunately it lacks consistency and quality in story, won't leave feeling that exceptional movie usually does and neither actors nor their roles have potential to be memorable. It's somehow bipolar because of the slow and long start but then without warning starts to reveal the action and I'm not saying that it is a bad thing, but definitely a noticeable feature.<br/><br/>I clearly didn't enjoy Sicario as much than average viewer here, but it's definitely not a bad movie. It could have been way, way better but as it's only few hours long and any particular phase of boringness even I think it won't be hours spent badly. If you are interested about drug wars in real life as watching recommend documentary of Miami's raise as cocaine state called Cocaine Cowboys and if you like reading, than Roberto Savianos pretty new book Zero Zero Zero is excellent book about cocaine, it's history and how it effect our society's."

","great scenery of El Paso and Juarez true streets and violence but ridiculous story and terrible acting. Critic over-rated because nobody is willing to down play a movie about the tragedy of the drug cartel violence. But in reality a documentary would have been more impactful. By intermixing a fake situation with absurd American actors into the real life violence is just insulting to the situation. The happy go lucky CIA bad cop doing good things = terrible actor; the frivolous female cop whose only purpose in the movie is to gasp at the horror then pretend to be the big girl and join in the fight with sissy slaps = terrible actress; The Colombian hit-man was good and played the dark quiet Clint Eastwood character good but since the story sucked it was just him walking around and grunting. Note: the real story is hidden in this bad movie and it is a short sub-plot of a Mexican cop and his family caught up in the drug cartel violence. Confusing why this was there when watching the movie but afterwards you realize it was the movie.. Very powerful and true to life of really a good man but just caught up in working for the cartels. This should have been the entire movie with more back story of how he became entrapped."
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","1","2 January 2016"," Dark, visceral stuff
","Denis Villeneuve's previous films, 2010's Incendies and 2013's double-whammy of Prisoners and Enemy, delved into the darkness of the human psyche at its most primal level. Sicario, penned by actor- turned-writer Andrew Sheridan, continues the trend. While its setting demands something all the more high-octane to what we are used to from the Canadian director, Villeneuve makes sure to keep his primary focus on his lead trio, all who are suffering psychologically in some way from the extreme violence they witness on a regular basis. But Sicario delivers on the set-pieces too, sculpting a steady stream of intense set-pieces handled delicately and with a refreshing coherence.<br/><br/>During a SWAT raid of a house believed to be hiding wanted kidnappers, strong-willed agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) and her idealistic partner Reggie (Black Mirror's Daniel Kaluuya) make a gruesome discovery. Although the raid is a success, it doesn't come without casualties, and soon enough Kate and Reggie find themselves sitting outside an office where high-ranking officers from a variety of agencies are in deep discussion. Flip-flop wearing CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) wants Kate along with him as he and his team head out to Juarez, Mexico, to find the men truly responsible for the carnage and bring down cartel boss Manuel Diaz (Bernardo P. Saracino), with the hope that it will lead to an illusive drug lord.<br/><br/>Just why Kate has been asked to tag along for the ride isn't made clear until near the very end, but Kate's stubbornness and natural curiosity means that she is determined to see it out, regardless of the questionable methods employed by Matt and another mysterious figure, the shadowy Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Sicario asks questions of whether bending the rules or using brutality can be justified when faced with an enemy willing to do anything to live another day. When the team first roll into the war-zone of Suarez, mutilated corpses dangle from a bridge to serve as a warning to anyone entering. How can you truly stay within the law when faced with an opponent so devoid of humanity? The psychological weight of these questions press down on Kate as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The film often paces briskly from one set-piece to another, without forgetting to amp up the tension beforehand. A stand-out scene takes place on the Bridge of the Americas as the team are transporting one of Diaz's top men back to the United States. Caught in a traffic jam, they immediately sense danger as vehicles stocked with tattooed men slowly pull up nearby. It's a nerve-jangling moment, one of many in the film, and the action is dealt with clinically, not allowing any of the characters to be forgotten or blurred within the frenzy. Towering above everybody else is Del Toro as the mysterious Alejandro, a man Kate cannot truly unravel. His background and ultimate purpose is left in the dark for the most part of the film, but it soon becomes clear that this is in fact his story. This is dark, visceral stuff, bolstered by an outstanding cast and an intriguing tale to tell."

"DareDevilKid","7","0","1","2 January 2016"," A Gritty, Pragmatist Look at the Drug War on the U.S. Border
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5/5 stars<br/><br/>With unjust police shootings and guys like John Connolly making deals with Whitey Bulger, it's getting near impossible to tell the good guys from the bad. Emily Blunt no doubt would agree after what she goes through as FBI agent Kate Macy in the kill-or-be-killed thriller ""Sicario."" Kate's the proverbial babe – and I mean babe – in the woods, a still wet-behind-the-ears agent working out of the Phoenix office. But she has moxie, that one ingredient necessary for every G-gal who's ever stumbled into a movie. Which is good, because she's going to need it after receiving a can't-refuse invite to join a black-ops group tasked with using ""any means"" to bring down a major drug cartel working out of the body-strewn war zone known as Juarez.<br/><br/>The force of black SUV-driving water-torturers is led by Josh Brolin, the go-to guy when it comes to typecasting Texas shitkickers standing knee-deep in a pool of tough-guy sarcasm. He's Matt, which is about all Kate – or any of us – will ever know about him. No clue who he works for, or whose interests he represents, despite Kate's persistent inquiries. But compared to Benicio Del Toro's Alejandro, he's practically an open book.<br/><br/>Making like Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western, Alejandro is an enigma of few words. He lets his automatic weapons do the talking – loud and lethal. His purpose, his presence are the film's central mysteries. He's also the likely reason the movie is titled ""Sicario,"" which in the lexicon of Mexican gangsters means ""hitman"". He plays a character that's quite similar to the one he had portrayed in his Oscar- winning turn in Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"". But ""Traffic"" was so long ago (2000) that you've probably sufficiently forgotten Del Toro's portrayal of a Mexican cop hooking up with the DEA to bring down a drug lord. Well, it was a good part, so why not do it again? In fact, why not make ""Sicario"" just like ""Traffic"", sans the soap opera? That's clearly the thinking of wunderkind director Denis Villeneuve, who envelops his story in all the angst and gloominess we've come to expect from the guy who brought us ain't-no-sunshine joints like ""Prisoners"" and ""Incendies"". He loves wallowing in the muck. And as hard as you resist, you like wallowing with him. Say what you will about the guy – that he exploits human frailty; that he hates happy endings – you can't deny that he knows how to entertain the pants off you, even though the ""entertainment"" consists almost exclusively of murder and torture.<br/><br/>With actor-turned-writer Taylor Sheridan (""Sons of Anarchy"") at his side, Villeneuve wastes no time bringing the dread by opening with a ""Straight Outta Compton""-like drug raid that ends in multiple deaths. And that's not counting all the people who were already deceased, their bodies encased in plastic and jammed between the studs of a bullet-riddled Phoenix crack house. All are suspected victims of Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cedillo), the cartel boss an unsuspecting Kate is about to play an unsavory hand in bringing down.<br/><br/>The film thrives on Villeneuve's keen eye for action. Aided immensely by uber-cinematographer Roger Deakins (a shoo-in for his 13th Oscar nomination), Villeneuve turns your nerves into a twist with two masterful action sequences. The first involving a terrifying shootout on the Bridge of Americas, and the second a nighttime raid inside a crudely dug desert tunnel that Deakins films with an infrared camera that perfectly sets an eerie, foreboding mood as blood and ideals are spilled in a barrage of bullets. It's simply breathtaking, as is the final scene, like ""Traffic"", set on an athletic field. It will not only haunt you, but it will also – this is for you Donald Trump – drive home the reason so many people will do anything to flee to the U.S.<br/><br/>What's not so great is the flat storytelling, which presents precious little of what's at stake for the characters, particularly Alejandro. The entire film builds and builds to his climactic moment of revenge porn. It's powerful, but not as intently as it could have been if Villeneuve created a more palpable sense of suspense. Still the performances are strong, and Deakins is amazing, doing for normally boring, bland desert-scapes what he did for the snowbound tundra in ""Fargo"". In fact, his ingenious camera-work is ""Sicario's most addictive drug. Whether that's enough to get audiences high remains to be seen. But even with all its impurities, ""Sicario"" remains pretty kick-ass dope."

"KineticSeoul","9","0","4","20 December 2015"," One of my favorite films of 2015
","I didn't know much about this movie, just that it will involve a group of agents going after the Mexican drug cartel. So I at least knew it was going to be violent, messy, gritty and gruesome. Because, well it's revolves around the Mexican drug cartel and they have no limits when it comes to what they are capable of. Like they have zero conscious when it comes to guilt. And the fact that it's directed by a talented director who knows how to bring out certain amount of realism, especially when it comes to the cinematography made me feel nervous and felt like I had some adrenaline pumping into my veins. Now the story isn't something that really stands out or anything like that but good enough and the directing is really well done, especially with the spot on cinematography, it really brings the film to life. As for the cast, let's just say that there was no miscast. Emily Blunt plays this agent that is feminine and yet capable of doing her job. I am glad that they didn't make her character into this tough cookie that is a complete badass and proficient at what she does. But is a character that has certain levels of vulnerability, which added to the tension during serious scenes. She looked confused half the time and yet knew what she was doing at the same time while being persistent. Again great acting from Emily Blunt, she seems to really nail this military type or roles. Anyways her character is sort of like the view point of the audiences, where what she is thinking is what the audiences are thinking when watching this for the first time. The last film I saw Benicio del Toro in was in ""Savages"" where he plays this ruthless villain who is part of the drug cartel. So I found it interesting how he plays this badass with experience that knows what he is doing and is also a mystery man. And Josh Brolin as this laid back CIA agent and adviser, that doesn't dress professionally and you don't know what his exact motives are. Overall this film does have believable and well developed characters and the plot although not anything spectacular isn't all that predictable. And it feeds the audiences bit by bit on what is going on in a impactful fashion. Watching this movie was sort of like watching a live action ""Ghost in the Shell"" movie. Except instead of echnobabbles it leans more towards jurisdictions and boundaries. While bringing out the instinctual and emotional human behaviors. This is a highly impactful thriller that I would highly recommend.<br/><br/>9.3/10"

"ReelBrew","9","0","4","12 December 2015"," An FBI agent gets sucked into the violence and corruption that infests and infects the war on drugs.
","Sicario is a film that packs a punch and doesn't mind fighting without gloves on. Meaning hit-man in Mexico, Sicario tells the story of three lawmen, hit-men, soldiers and consciences working their way through the streets of morality and legality in an effort to put a stop to the war on drugs. Emily Blunt plays the lawmen and conscience of the film, with Josh Brolin and Benecio Del Toro playing smoke and mirrors on the streets of Juarez wearing masks of lawmen and soldiers in order to regain control over the underground drug trafficking that has filtered over the border.<br/><br/>From the first scene Sicario comes out of the gate swinging, jostling your senses with a gorgeously timed house raid that plays out some thematic elements of action and horror that quickly let you know you aren't in for a singular note in this crescendo of movie making magic. After witnessing a few dozen bodies piled in between the walls of a suburban home in Arizona, we're quickly taken over the border, accompanied by Johann Johannsson's thumping drone and neo-classical score that gets your heart rate beating and demonstrates an amazing control over suspense. Not a stranger to crafting a story out of a simple notion, with Prisoners telling the tale of a family dealing with the kidnapping of their daughter, Denis Villeneuve manages to layer his film with enough tension, gritty action and dimly lit atmosphere that he makes setting a masterwork seem obvious.<br/><br/>Benecio Del Toro is no stranger to this character, showing elements from Way of the Gun, Traffic and Che, but watching him slip into the quiet he brings to these roles is something else. His character is a man seeped in mystery, control and intensity that is handled with such grace that when Alejandro, who is clearly haunted by something, springs into action it's like watching a lion sneak up on a gazelle. Emily Blunt has quickly become the new Sigourney Weaver with her silent strength and hard edge that soon unravels to expose a tattered soul that beats with a heart only an actor of her caliber could bring. The chemistry these two actors bring to their characters and the relationship that unfolds between them is beautiful and terrifying, and something that plays into the story amazingly well.<br/><br/>Seeing Sicario is witnessing a melding of genres and a dance of characters from actors at the top of their game. With a pulse pounding score that shifts each scene into place with subtle ease and cinematography by Roger Deakins continually pushing the audience forward, Denis Villeneuve's latest film is one that shouldn't be missed. Sicario is a film that should be applauded and heralded for utilizing film as a multifaceted tool, giving us a work of cinematic depth and beauty."

It's a film that depicts the crucial killings of men and women and of the narcotics that are transported from one place to another. Based on true events, both Bordertown and Sicario show gruesome events that are happening now as we speak. Kate Macy (Emily Blunt) plays a very weak character who is ignorant of what is going on in Juarez, Mexico and in how her fellow comrades are using her. Similarly to ""Bordertown"", Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez) is sent to Juarez to investigate a series of murders near an American factory on Juarez territory.

Throughout this harrowing, violence-packed, 2 hour endless tragedy, ""Sicario"" drives home the almost forgotten notion of the war on drugs – the thought that it was over.<br/><br/>Starring Emily Blunt as Kate Macer, an idealistic by-the-book FBI agent, the film dives right into the war with the Mexican drug cartel in a scene that keeps the viewer right on the edge of the seat. Alejandro (Benicio del Toro), a sadistic yet cunning assassin for the CIA leads Macer into the harrowing abyss of the true operations of the government along the U.S. – Mexico border. Macer seizes the opportunity but quickly realizes that she is well out of her investigate-first element; here, gunshots speak louder than words.<br/><br/>Typical to the action genre, words are not of the essence. However, breaking traditional pre-established notions of this genre are one of the greatest elements found throughout this feature film. When one thinks of action-packed movies like ""Sicario"", the may often imagine Chuck Norris with hilarious-yet-legendary one-liners that make the whole movie. Instead, ""Sicario"" makes every scene with extensive dialogue one to remember, with nothing being said that isn't necessary to the overall development.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" draws the audience in. They most likely have not felt the repercussions of the war on drugs, so when Villeneuve has Alejandro mercilessly murder men, women and children alike, it definitely feels uncomfortable. Not once is this war glamorized to any extent – the raw emotion and homemade feeling attribute to the unrelenting abyss of drama."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","0","3","20 November 2015"," Fighting fire with much more fire.
","While I was underwhelmed with Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners, I found his followup Enemy to be a much stronger and focused piece of work. Sicario may be the best of the trio, though it doesn't have the same intricate character work, opting to deliberately keep us in the dark. Instead, it's a fascinating morality study on how the U.S. fights fire with too much fire in the war against Mexican drug lords and criminals. It's more effective and thoughtful than the sloppy Zero Dark Thirty with the way it follows these ethical lines between the U.S. being just as bad as what they're fighting against. I'm not sure if its ultimate revelation works as well for me, and it can be a bit on the nose at times which breaks its expert subtlety, but it's no less thematically valid. <br/><br/>Unlike moments in Prisoners and Enemy, it demonstrates a great level of restraint that keeps a consistent level of tension aided by Johann Johannsson's ominous score and Roger Deakins reliable and crisp cinematography. That unease is often disarmed by Josh Brolin's breezy performance, who tackles this interesting balance between the lines of necessity and cruelty. Emily Blunt is the highlight of the film however, even if the film isn't interested in extensive character development, and gives a committed sense of vulnerability that drives the stakes. It's not all gloom fortunately, as writer Taylor Sheridan gives the ensemble plenty of wit without overdoing it. This is controlled and impressive work from Villeneuve, though it doesn't necessarily soar when it can.<br/><br/>8/10"
"lucasversantvoort","7","0","4","18 November 2015"," Deliciously dark thriller
","I must confess this is my first time watching a Villeneuve film. I've heard good things about his films, but Sicario is my entry point. Not that it matters, because either way, Sicario is a damn fine film, a slow burn thriller of the highest order.<br/><br/>In a dusty American suburban neighborhood (think Breaking Bad), FBI agent Kate Macer raid a house and discover a grisly scene: corpses in the walls wrapped in plastic sheets. Not only that, but two agents end up dead when they 'discover' an IED in the nearby shed. Shortly after, Kate is recruited by Matt Graver, a strangely confident CIA officer. He'll be leading a Delta Force group to find the men really responsible for the tragedy that has occurred. Because of her idealism, she joins the mission. They're also accompanied by another mysterious figure, Alejandro, an 'advisor'. Kate, however, is kept pretty much in the dark on what they're doing. First of all, although Matt said they'll be going to El Paso, they're actually going to Juarez. Kate becomes frustrated at Matt's flagrant disregard of protocol and finds it increasingly hard to help Matt simply because she's told they're doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Sicario isn't interested so much in the war on drugs as in the people that wage it. Throughout the film, we get a better idea of how it's not all about fighting crime and fighting the war on drugs for these people. Some relish the thought of killing an enemy while others like Alejandro hide more personal motives. The film also deals with notions of how to fight this war. Kate would prefer to do it by the book, but Matt would argue the only way to really hurt these criminals is to go outside the book.<br/><br/>There are physical borders, of course, but the film deals with all kinds of borders and how quickly these borders blur and lines get crossed. Some characters don't want to be on the side they're on, while others pretend they're on one side. Some do what they do because they believe it's the right thing while others do what they do because they have to. Time and again in this film people are told that what they're doing is the right thing, whether it's for the sake of one's family or for 'the greater good'. Usually, this ends up meaning very little and people always end up getting killed.<br/><br/>The action scenes are a terrific bunch. They're executed with a clinical precision that reminds me of Zero Dark Thirty and the Bourne trilogy. Especially the climactic action set piece is so sparsely filmed that every single bullet fired scares you shitless. There's something terrifying yet fascinating about watching a character go from point a to b, dispatching enemies left and right, in as brutal yet clinical fashion as seen here.<br/><br/>If the film has a weakness, it's pacing. We know the operation is building to a final mission, but it takes the entire film to get there and we lose interest because we're kept in the dark too much. I can't count on two hands the scenes where Blunt or her colleague ask Graver and Alejandro what they're really doing here only to be stonewalled, ending up walking back to their car all angry-like. The ending makes up for it, but it's still a valid criticism.<br/><br/>Sicario is tight in terms of acting. Blunt and Brolin are fine, but it's Del Toro who truly shines. He is all melancholy, yet icy stares and zero words. He speaks occasionally, but it's his face that conveys so much yet hides so many secrets. I'm told Del Toro insisted much of his dialogue be cut and his background kept a secret longer to add to his mystique. Del Toro ends up playing a crucial role and ends up taking Sicario to the next level. I hope the film can maintain some momentum during awards season so that at least Del Toro will end up a supporting actor nominee at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Sicario is a terrifically dark and poetic thriller. It manages to paint a complex portrait of the war on drugs and the people involved in a mere two hours all the while tying a nice action-wrapped bow around it."
"joebloggscity","8","0","4","14 November 2015"," Gutsy thriller on the US law enforcement & the drug trade
","What we have here is another one of the dramatisations that tries to have a real feel to it. Granted it's not based on a true story (like Zero Dark Thirty) but it still attempts to capture the feel of authenticity even though it likely may irk those in the know. Anyhow, fits into the genre with Zero Dark Thirty, The Hurt Locker and the like, but this is a thriller.<br/><br/>We have a dark setting of the Mexican drug trade with the US enforcement officers on a mission which we are never wholly made clear what is going on. We have Emily Blunt as the as an FBI agent who is dragged into this world, with Josh Brolin an untrustworthy lead character and then a shadowy Benecio Del Toro.<br/><br/>The film is gutsy, brutal but always captivating. Great tension building, and some great camera work. It's a great thriller that remains fascinating from start to end.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to most. It's a damn hard edged movie of which I'd like to see more of in the cinema."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","3","12 November 2015"," A Bone-Chilling Portrait Of Border Warfare!
","A downright intense, gritty & unadulterated journey into the world of Mexican drug cartels that also contemplates the darkness of human behaviour, Sicario continues director Denis Villeneuve's steady rise in the film industry as this immensely talented filmmaker delivers yet again with a highly captivating thriller that's impressive enough to rank as one of the finest offerings of the year, so far.<br/><br/>The story of Sicario follows an idealistic FBI agent who volunteers to join a covert operation to battle the escalating drug violence in the border areas between USA & Mexico. Assisting her in the mission are a supposed DoD adviser & a mysterious agent who has an agenda of his own. After witnessing the illegitimate manner in which the assignment was being carried out, the new agent is pushed to her moral & ethical limits.<br/><br/>Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique, Incendies, Prisoners & Enemy), Sicario opens on a high note for its first act is a masterwork of tense, gripping & razor-sharp storytelling and presents the promising filmmaker in sublime form. The film is able to grab the viewers' attention from the beginning and its foreboding atmosphere is maintained till the very end. And while it slows down a bit after its tightly-packed first act but even in those moments, it never drops its gear.<br/><br/>Taylor Sheridan's screenplay is no slouch for the story puts greater emphasis on characters inhabiting this crime thriller although it shifts its focus from one to another over the course of its runtime, which was quite unexpected, but since the primary characters are so expertly written, the change in focus doesn't become much of an issue. One drawback, however, is a sub-segment involving a Mexican cop that shows up at various intervals but has nothing relevant to contribute to the story.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, Roger Deakins' camera-work is pure wizardry for he stages some truly breathtaking shots through ingenious use of camera angles, smooth movements, slow pans & precision lighting while also making efficient use of desaturated colour palette to encapsulate the whole film with a spiritless ambiance, which fits its narrative. The pacing is methodical throughout its 121 minutes of runtime, and further elevating its tension is the pulsating score from Jóhann Jóhannsson that turns nearly every segment into a nail-biting moment.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, Sicario features a dependable cast in Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Daniel Kaluuya, Victor Garber, Jon Bernthal & a few others and everyone is excellent in their given roles. Blunt is impressing a lot of lately with the kind of roles she's picking to play & her utter devotion to her character here makes it one of the finest works of her career, so far. Brolin also chips in strongly with what was expected from him. Finally, the ever-reliable del Toro only gets better as the plot progresses & in the end, effortlessly steals the show with his quiet but brooding performance.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Sicario is a tightly-structured, tautly narrated & sharp-edged thriller that packs in an engrossing story filled with compelling characters and also brims with palpable tension from start to finish, is narrated with a tight grip on all aspects & is further elevated by outstanding performances from its cast, especially Blunt & del Toro. While there was still some room left for improvement and the rigidness of its tightly-knit first act is lost once the middle act takes over, Sicario is still worth your time & money and deserves a watch for its fascinating portrait of border warfare alone. Strongly recommended."

","""You will not survive here. You are not a wolf, and this is a land of wolves now.""<br/><br/>It's been over a month now since I've seen this film and it has stuck with me in a way few films have this year. Denis Villeneuve is a talented director who knows how to build the right atmosphere for his movies. Sicario is all about tone and atmosphere. We've seen the premise of this film done to death, but somehow Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan manage to tell a familiar story in a very unique way. The success of Sicario isn't that it has a unique premise or a fantastic twist, but that it manages to tell a familiar story in such a captivating way with some of the best performances of the year. Sicario will be included in my list of the best films of 2015 without a doubt, and it is a must see for movie fans around the globe. Emily Blunt continues to expand her acting career with another brilliant performance although its Benicio de Toro who will get all the accolades for getting the stronger dramatic material to work with.<br/><br/>The film has the best opening sequence by far in a movie released this year as we are introduced to Emily Blunt's character, Kate Macer, who is leading a SWAT team across an Arizona desert and into a house where they suspect to find one of the Mexican cartel leaders, but end up finding much more than what they bargained for. Kate is a tough DEA agent who is determined to bring down the Mexican cartel. Once they arrive back at the station she is introduced to Josh Brolin's Matt Graver, a superior who wants her assistance in catching the cartel leader who was responsible for the events that unfolded at the house. Graver has a suave persona, he may be in charge of the operation but he seems laid back with his flip flops and cargo pants. His right hand man is much more silent and mysterious. It's Benicio del Toro's Alejandro, who certainly seems menacing and is hiding something underneath his calmed demeanor. He is evidently a man who has seen and experienced a lot of things in life. Kate accepts the mission despite not being fully informed of what she must do and she becomes a surrogate for the audience as she tries to understand what these men are up to just as we do. Villeneuve keeps the audience hooked and engaged while taking us through the Mexican border an back again with some magnificent cinematography from Roger Deakins. Sicario is a brilliant film that maintains the tension throughout its entire runtime. My only complaint is that the second half isn't as strong as the first.<br/><br/>Sicario is a film that should receive several nominations come Award time and I can't see how Del Toro won't be nominated for his superb supporting performance here. Although I must say that Brolin and Blunt are equally deserving for their work. Blunt is much more subtle in her approach as she has to adapt to this masculine dominated world and is constantly left in the loop of things. Brolin plays a character that he could play in his sleep with his suave and cool exterior, but he does it so well that it's hard not to sympathize with him. Del Toro is menacing and his turn as Alejandro will be one of the most memorable characters of the year. He has some great scenes. It's hard to avoid some comparisons with Zero Dark Thirty, especially the way some of the scenes were shot and how it focuses (although in a very different way) on two strong motivated female characters who are determined to accomplish their goal in a masculine run world. It also happens to be a very intelligent thriller that manages to tell a familiar story in a fresh way. Sometimes it's not what you say, but how you say it that makes the difference and in Sicario Villeneuve manages to craft an engaging work of art. This is the Zero Dark Thirty of war on drug films. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"jose_reyes-29440","7","0","2","5 November 2015"," Tension everywhere
","It is a ""good"" thriller, it have exciting moments of tension, amazing gun fights and incredible performances by del Toro, Broling and Blunt. I couldn't drink my soda because of the tension generated on screen almost at the entire movie. But, yes it is only a good movie and it has some points that could have make it better.<br/><br/>First of all and the biggest disappointment, the Spanish spoken on the film, yes I know is a Hollywood movie written in English, but if the director had to bother of filming in Mexico, using the border, a prison and vehicles that seems like the Federal Police; at least they could hire an actual Mexican translator to re-write the Spanish dialogue. No kidding, the ""Mexican"" characters use phrases that no one speaks, they have weird accents (Sound like actors that born and grew up in the US and Spanish is their second language) and seemed forced to give some emphasis on speaking a language that is not their mother tongue. It is disappointing because it seems that the writer just copied and pasted the dialogues in Google Translate.<br/><br/>Secondly, the lack of information about cartels, it is so funny to think that the biggest head of a cartel, ""El hefe"" (As the ""Mexican"" actors pronounce) just have 5 guards in a mansion and poorly trained, no security cameras or neither a control point in the middle of the highway. It's simply fantasy, you can see in other movies or series like Narcos that the main chief is highly secured and well armed. But the boss of Sonora's Cartel just have 5 well dressed guards, give me a break.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Emily Blunt's character, to be fair the agent has the same relevance on the story as the protective plastic on a smartphone, yo can leave it there or not but you won't tell a difference. Even it will be better if you just simply remove it. The agent never get fully involved with the mission or their partners, she looks weird in all the situation and even at the end when she is supposed to take a good action in due of his ethical persona...she just get scared. I mean the character never evolved to be someone important on the story and is Benicio del Toro who takes the lead role on the film, even though his first appearance was completely forgettable.<br/><br/>Just my point of view, good movie though"
"peter-stead-740-486963","7","0","3","4 November 2015"," Almost
","Sicario reminded me that it is still possible to be thrilled at the cinema. There is brooding, understated acting galore and dramatic set-pieces that don't feel like ""set-pieces"" ie they just naturally come from the story.<br/><br/>As a result, the flaws within the story don't undermine the film as much as they should. Emily Blunt plays Kate Mercer, a kidnap rescue SWAT specialist brought into a cross-agency narco-operation. In theory, it's her skills that need to be brought to bear on the op, but actually they don't need her, even as a patsy. She is used as bait at one stage, but this is an in-the-moment improvisation that doesn't really explain why she was brought in in the first place.<br/><br/>Her sole purpose seems to be being screwed over by her own team leaders and to find out what the real dark purpose of the operation is. In fact, she ends as she begins - screwed over, which is unsatisfying from a story point of view. From the point of view of the operation it succeeds exactly as it was meant to - thanks to the relentless Alejandro (Beneficio del Toro).<br/><br/>Still, it does grip throughout. It feels authentic. The direction and acting is superb and it is so refreshing to see films made about real issues affecting us now."

","This movie is different from those we use to see of this kind. It has other elements such as personal motivations and relationships, police corruption and the opposition between legal and illegal ways of fighting drug traffic. A CIA agent included in a SWAT team that is trying to find and arrest a drug traffic Mexican boss uses violent and illegal methods of dealing with traffickers while capturing and interrogating them to which an idealistic DEA lady agent who accompanies the team is opposed and refuses to collaborate. This leads to a conflict that is shown in some expressive and intense dramatic scenes. Besides this the usual violent scenes of chasing and shooting are appalling and very well filmed. If only by its unusual theme development this movie is worth to be seen."

","Blunt exhibits Kate's weathering with dynamic devolution. She droops her already stale stare while an increasing reliance on cigarettes shine a growing fault in her armor. Yet Blunt moves with conviction and talks with adamant purpose despite knowing and being repeatedly told she's out of her element. Perhaps the most intriguing part of Kate's character, though, has nothing to do with Blunt. Whereas the majority of feminist films are concerned with building a strong female character, 'Sicario' rather tears its down. Kate is already atop the FBI, she's being asked to join a CIA op, and has displayed prowess in leading the aforementioned raid, and apprehending several other prominent cartel figures. In Mexico she's still surrounded by burley men and still taking orders from masculine superiors in Brolin and Del Toro's characters. Subconsciously we want to believe these conflicts are what empower her as a woman, but, the part being originally written for a male, we rather see Kate's strength where she's weakest. ""I'm not a soldier,"" says Kate, and we believe her because the harassment, violence, and horrors she witnesses justify her loosing grasp on the law and make her human in a land of wolves.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: http://indieadam.com/2015/10/04/sicario-review-indieadam/"
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","0","1","31 October 2015"," Despite sharing some of the same troubles as its lead character, I found it to be compelling and highly sophisticated in its performances and its visual design
","Emily Blunt is terrific in the new crime thriller Sicario, the name of which means ""hitman"" in Spanish. After starring mostly in romantic comedies, the English actress Blunt has transitioned into the action genre with films like Edge of Tomorrow (2014) and Looper (2012). But here, she delves so deeply into her character's confusion and internal angst that the actress recognisable from these films disappears, replaced by a tortured and immersive performance of the highest order. She excels playing FBI agent Kate Macer, a woman with few personal connections, except for her friendship with fellow investigator Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya). Following a raid in Mexico, which unveils multiple corpses and an explosion that kills several cops, Kate and Reggie are enlisted by a shady set of government types who recruit them with a mission to hunt down a drug lord; they use Kate's desire to bring the men responsible for the ambush on her colleagues as emotional leverage. The most prominent of these men is Matt Graver (Josh Brolin, doing some of his best recent work) and the other is the mysterious Alejandro (a tremendously oily, mysterious and unpredictable Benicio Del Toro). Alejandro is the most ambiguous figure, as no one will outrightly say if he belongs to an organisation like the CIA or some other allegiance. Only towards the end of this complex investigation do his motives become more transparent.<br/><br/>The tight relationship between the director Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners), cinematographer Roger Deakins (True Grit) and Blunt is unearthed in a number of sequences that show precise visual and stylistic choices. There has been a lot of discussion recently about films losing their visual flair as they look to imitate the dialogue-driven form of television, given to the rise of HBO and similar channels. But thankfully, Sicario lays waste to the misguided notion that films are no longer cinematic or visually inclined. The film is superbly photographed and framed by Deakins and Villenuve, who use the shape, locations and spatiality, rather than words, to convey the thematic ideas in the narrative. One of the most impressive sequences in the film is a set piece where Kate is seated in the back of a car and being driven through the streets of Mexico. In this incident, the big black cars accompanying her vehicle fall into a procession and become indistinguishable from one another. The same is also true of the various police vehicles on the road. Meanwhile, Deakins also employs enormous, sweeping overhead shots to emphasise the anonymity of the various housing blocks and streets throughout Mexico. Through these formal choices and the images, the film creates visual conflict as an extension of Kate's inner most feelings of self-doubt and vulnerability. Like the audience, her destination at the hands of these men is confused; similarly, her surroundings in this hugely dangerous and creepy world, where bodies are strung up in public, blur together into a haze, where the cops and criminals become inseparable. In a standoff in the traffic, the police open fire on gun totting thugs before they even raise their weapons. A police officer also opens fire on Kate, forcing her to dispose of him. The visual anonymity, created by the formal choices, are paired with the action sequence to reinforce how political and moral boundaries dissolve when no one is accountable and their identity isn't confirmed or realised.<br/><br/>The spatiality of the interior scenes is also used in interesting ways to convey ideas about the truth and the hidden motives of the characters. In one very confronting sequence, a man is interrogated by Alejandro, who shoves his genitals into his face and then, we assume, water boards him. The way the camera cuts away to a drain in this scene isn't a compromise; it's a continuation of a thematic goal about how the truth is distorted and contained within the film's tighter, closed spaces. When Kate first meets Matt, who wears thongs at a government meeting, Deakins employs a visual motif as simple as a pane of glass between Kate and her colleagues to reflect her distance from their true motives. The interior of the meeting room and the aforementioned interrogation room are cube shaped to again reflect the truth being withheld —a stark contrast to the wider open spaces that invite danger and violence. It is a fine mixture of visual and personal drama, particularly when the film is told from Kate's perspective; the camera tightens regularly on Blunt's face, who is so convincing in using her eyes to stress her character's unease and her failure to understand her situation. Where the film falls short is this same ambiguity, which is often intentional but sometimes not, and it does become slightly convoluted about the true motives of these characters. Meanwhile, some will understandably reel from the amount of violence and its savagery; however, from the film's very first scene, we see the police vomiting and kneeling over from the same horrors we've witnessed. Though it is incredibly tense, calling Sicario a straight action film is a cheap, unnecessary tag to apply to something interested in more than body counts and casual thrills. The film is about someone in search of the truth, pitched against blurring moral lines and anonymous figures, and the convoluted motives of dodgy characters. Despite sharing some of the same troubles as its lead character, I found it to be compelling and highly sophisticated in its performances and its visual design."

","If you want to see a Hollywood film that includes explosions, cheesy dialogue and cgi galore. Go see a different movie. If you want a well written, deep characterised and excellently shot film that fulfils it's directors purpose, see Sicario.<br/><br/>I didn't know much about the film when I saw it, other than the fact it was directed by the ever brilliant Denis Villeneuve. A man who has yet to disappoint me. So I had no predisposed reviews or feelings as was able to go into the screening unbiased.<br/><br/>The first few minutes grabbed me. It throws you directly into the plot of film, establishing some characters and relationships so you know the type of thing you're getting into. A good few minutes that leads up to where it gets interesting.<br/><br/>The following half an hour (to the average movie goer) seems like a pointless collection of dialogue, establishing shots and facial expressions of confusion, and admittedly it does drag on for about 5-10 minutes more than it should. This is why it takes some patience and some intelligence. Once you realise the intention of Villeneuve within this segment, you start to understand and appreciate what he's trying to achieve. As an audience, to be put in a position where we are just as confused as the main character, it is generally quite hard to follow and enjoy a movie. Sicario achieves this level of confusion but also allows the audience to continue being entertained.<br/><br/>From then on you're taking a roller-coaster ride of suspense and character interaction, during which it is never clear who the real good guys and bad guys are. The fact that this is kept in the dark throughout the film is something that movies tend to get wrong (apart from the few exceptions) and end up just leaving the audience with no one to relate to. Sicario isn't one of these films, it excels on all levels it hopes to achieve."
"socrates99","9","0","4","22 October 2015"," One of the most artfully realized movies I've ever seen
","About an hour into this film, I smiled to myself thinking these three excellent actors, Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro, must have realized as they were shooting what a beautiful collaboration they were in. Seldom are actors allowed to contribute so evenly to the success of a project as here. Emily leads the audience on with a simplified, legalistic approach to drug enforcement, Josh Brolin has a more violent and almost clinical solution in mind, while Benicio's very Mexican attitude toward the murderous cartels plaguing his country tends to supersede the others. Essentially the story is that of letting Emily's character be shaken to the core by its head on confrontation with Benicio's idea of dealing with drug kingpins.<br/><br/>Since there's virtually no heed given to political correctness, there's a difficult case to make. Very probably most of the audience will be on Emily's side, but the film is very emotional and pointedly directed, and I doubt if many of those aren't at least moved by it.<br/><br/>Benicio gives his best performance ever, in my opinion, as the sort of person he is depicting is very real but rarely seen in the states. I was personally amazed at how well his portrayal captured people I'd forgotten I'd ever known. He really deserves some recognition for it though I doubt he will get it, only because the Academy will probably not realize he is portraying someone who can actually exist in Mexico.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's character was a little more problematic. Much of her attitude toward the task force she joins is difficult to understand. It still works but I couldn't follow her complaints very well. No doubt someone along the line decided it didn't matter, and they were right. She is still the center of attention and she holds it very well.<br/><br/>Josh Brolin had the more stereotypical role here, but he still managed to imbue it with detail and attitude that seem to show his familiarity with task forces, but is almost certainly completely craft and talent.<br/><br/>The two most important names behind this film were definitely the director and writer. At this point I will watch anything Denis Villeneuve does. I'm also going to have to watch what this Taylor Sheridan writes from now on. They're a very impressive pair."
"rjsf96","9","0","3","21 October 2015"," A Deliriously Thrilling Ride
","Director Denis Villeneuve is no stranger to dark, gritty and compelling thrillers. His whole filmography to date is almost solely comprised of them. 'Sicario' proves that even if this is well trodden ground, it does not matter when the film itself is this riveting to watch.<br/><br/>When FBI Agent Kate Macer is selected as part of a task force to combat the war against drugs in Mexico she will find her ethics and morals challenged. It is all too soon when she must accept the horrors and the line between corruption and justice.<br/><br/>What's striking about 'Sicario' is its approach to its subject matter. Not many Hollywood films would open with a tense scene of a horrifying slaughter house. But then Villeneuve has never been one to use clichés from the genre, he would much rather subvert them. From the Director that brought us 'Prisoners' it would be expected for the cast to show their value. Emily Blunt as Macer is in way over her head, she cannot even comprehend the horror of what is going on behind the scenes. She helps convey the intensity of her character and her ongoing search for the truth. Everyone in supporting roles from Josh Brolin to Benicio Del Toro outline their character traits so that they never feel underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Roger Deakin's cinematography has to be commented on. From the vastness and washed out colours of Mexico to the bright blue and secure safety of the Border of America just beyond the horizon.<br/><br/>The music swells and it made my hands shake with nervousness and my forehead sweat as if a tap had been turned on. Johann Johannsson's score is a masterclass in what well composed music can do for a film and most importantly the impact it can have on a viewer.<br/><br/>Although I would love to delve into the inner workings of 'Sicario' like the sick and demented maze that it is. I will not. I just refuse to spoil the twists and my advice is to go in blind. I did and I was thoroughly scared, thrilled and impressed throughout its runtime. It's hard to remember a film where the direction was so outstanding and superb that it made me feel smart for figuring the film out. Yet 'Sicario' is ultimately unpredictable. You could not plot out its beats from start to finish because it has so many twists, that it's impossible to see all of them (if any) coming in advance.<br/><br/>'Sicario' is a rewarding experience. Rewarding for the viewer that wants to have their intelligence applauded. It lets you figure out the film on your own without telling all. It succeeds on many fronts, mainly because we anticipate the story, tension and character arcs. In all honesty the ending feels unsatisfactory but the thrills that it generates along the way make it all too easy to push aside any potential flaws that are highlighted along the way. 'Sicario' firmly cements Villeneuve's incredible talent as a Director whom is sure to define this generation of thrillers, the same way that David Fincher defined the last."

","First, the good stuff. The cinematography is spectacular. Angles , color , longshots..brilliant. Casting: excellent. Emily Blunt cast against type and it works. A female in a man's work, she is very credible as the do right agent looking for justice. Del Toro is the best bad man in film. Think No Country for Old Men - part 2. Just great. Not a big fan of Brolin but he was good. Audio a little difficult to hear at timesespecially his. The story is current and eye opening. Nothing makes you sit up straight like headless bodies hanging from street lights. Its quite unbelievable. The two stars I didn't give the film were because the plot was hazy. It was unclear what the mission was and what the relationships were between some characters. It would have made the film more enjoyable if the viewer had a clearer understanding of the background of the Juarez situation in real life and the working relationship between some of the federal governments agencies. The director may have assumed the viewer had more knowledge of the Mexican -USA drug problem than he/she does. Much of this info did come together later in the movie but I think earlier would have been more helpful. A very good movie"

All away from clichés, a billion miles from everything you have already seen about the subject, with the usual scheme of the good American authorities fighting against the evil cartels. Nothing of that here. It's not good vs evil scheme, but evil vs ""eviler"". That's all. Period. Benicio Del Torro will forever be for drug cartel films what John Wayne was for westerns. And Del Torro's character's name in this feature is Medellin.... One more thing. This settings could have been Afghanistan or Irak where Special Forces would have to fight against Muslims terrorists. But instead of that, this movie takes place in Mexico, near the US border, and the fight in question against drug cartels instead. The kind of action film, busted with testosterone, that won't be forgotten, and also which makes you think long after the viewing. A pure true masterpiece."
"gothrockachick","10","0","4","20 October 2015"," Sicario: Our Dark Pleasure
","From director Denis Villeneuve of ""Prisoners"" (2013) notoriety comes an equally if not more claustrophobic and thickly tension drenched feature in 'Sicario'.<br/><br/>Presenting a simplistic if not often clichéd genre in a 'Tossing up the Mexican gang lords like a salad"" situation, you already know (or should know) going into this movie that it's not the story your strapping yourself in for, it's the characters, performances and near perspiring atmosphere.<br/><br/>The first thing the film does expertly is prime the small world you and the characters are stuck in for the next two hours. The brilliantly shot cinematography and camera angles by Roger Deakins direct your vision often into impossibly tight spaces, keeping a constant pressure on your pulse points and restricting your field of view where in most movies you've come to expect more control.<br/><br/>Praise to Jóhann Jóhannsson and the sound editing team for delivering a deep, grinding score, roaring gunfire and a muffled almost disquieting ambiance, leaving the audience with the feeling of being unable to wash off the invisible grit creeping under the skin.<br/><br/>Not enough could be said for the films three leads; Emily Blunt is regal, consistent and unrelenting as her character of Kate Macer. She utilizes the best of her skills some of which were seen in last years Edge of Tomorrow. Josh Brolin's Matt Graver is the epitome of a man obsessed with the success of his ventures whether they be legal or not. He indulges in his outgoing narcissism and knows how to use his human tools, to what end this is in the film is what solidifies Brolins' on point portrayal of this character. Alejandro is someone that could have turned out very different, if not for the fact that Benicio Del Toro saw that the mysterious character needed to be set free. In the last 1/3rd of the film Del Toro mentally flips a nuclear launch switch that left myself and others trembling in the theater.<br/><br/>As heavy and unhappy as this film is described, in the end it is unwilling to shove any one particular ideal or point down your throat. It stays truthful to what is written in the script, not what the audience thinks it wants in the process. You want quality film- making, memorable characters, sets, script and the best performances that are surely Oscar nomination worthy, there is simply no reason you shouldn't go and see Sicario"
"MOOVYZ","9","0","3","19 October 2015"," This is the best movie I've seen in 10 years!
","I'm not going to go into great length here, there are plenty of reviews who have covered the specifics. I'm simply going to tell you why I think it's the best film I have seen in many, many years.<br/><br/>I love movies. I love many movies. But most fall into the 6-7.5 range for the ones I generally enjoy.<br/><br/>I've only given 1 movie a higher score than this and that was ""Shawshank Redemption"" which I feel is near perfection! Because nothing it truly perfect, I'd give that film a 9.5. This one gets a 9.0!<br/><br/>OK, here's why... like many movies in the genre and style (let's say ""Traffic"" and ""The Departed"") there's a great story, told well. That is true of ""Sicario"". But unlike the others, this one is told in such clarity that, at no time, was I having to wonder who was who or what was happening. That's not to say this movie is simplistic, it's not. It's simply done so well that the tale is near perfectly told.<br/><br/>Now, what else makes it so great? Well, how about the performances? Emily Blunt is superb... this girl can act! Josh Brolin is always great and here is no exception. Benicio Del Toro is fantastic, his best performance by far.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also excellent. Especially ""Spoiler Alert"" the filming of a lengthy scene with night vision. Great work!<br/><br/>The direction and editing are again, superb. (I'm running out of superlatives).<br/><br/>If you only see one film this year, make it this. Be warned, this is NOT a family film, nor is it a ""feel-good"" film. It's dark and edgy. But the story is told so well that you walk away completely satisfied.<br/><br/>9.0 out of 10!"
"peefyn","8","0","2","19 October 2015"," Bleak and brilliant.
","I am not observant enough to know exactly how they did it, but this movie feels almost like a documentary. The ""establishing shots""(?), bird's eye view or at an angle, probably helped. They could have been made digitally, but somehow they felt more real. Like the movie was showing that these are real locations. Long takes, and the camera not always in the middle of the action, probably helped as well. It really made the movie feel grounded in reality. I'm not familiar enough with cartels, FBI operations and the other players in the movie to say anything about how realistic it actually is - but it was all very believable.<br/><br/>The plot itself is both intelligent and interesting. It's all about force, where the ones with the most power are the winners. People using each other. Hopeless situations. Not exactly sunshine and rainbows.<br/><br/>Lastly, the cast is amazing. Josh Brolin has found his calling in these ""no bullshit""-characters, similar to the ones he played in MIB3, No Country for Old Men and Inherent Vice. Emily Blunt was great in Edge of Tomorrow, and she is just as great in this movie. Del Toro makes me want to see every movie he's ever been in."

"lneil-51-106502","9","0","2","18 October 2015"," Cinematic excellence with unexpected depth.
","As far as cinematography, sound, acting, production and direction go, this film achieves superior marks in all categories. Character development is not intense or deep, nor does it have to be. The actors do a superb job of portraying the personalities and characteristics required to be in the positions they fill. Del Toro is a standout as an amoral killer with vestigial remnants of emotion that do not, however, sway him from his cold efficiency in executing his chosen tasks.<br/><br/>Depth does not require complication. Sicario succeeds sublimely by providing a very simple illustration of several apparently paradoxical premises; the total futility of attempting to successfully fight evil (the drug cartels) within the boundaries of civilized western laws; the relative powerlessness of the morally upright idealist who would rebel against potentially effective but illegal methods (CIA and DOD black-ops) to achieve those ends; the moral paradox of supposed 'good guys' using methods no better - or even worse - than those used by their opponent.<br/><br/>Some reviewers seem to be disappointed in this film's lack of a satisfactory 'conclusion'. It appears to me though that the bleak and unsatisfying ending is exactly what the director desired to portray. How else could such a set of circumstances end? The clean-cut good guys could never win out in such a dirty reality. Does that make them pointless and futile? No, but I see the director using them to illustrate the difficulty for all of us in reconciling so much that is right with what could be seen as expeditious or even necessary. The trailing off of story is also illustrative; wars such as this will go on indefinitely, descending further and further into violent amorality.<br/><br/>I rate this as a superior quality film that is presented almost as parable. Recommended for any intelligent viewer seeking more than a run-of-the-mill action flick."

","Sicario (2015). The relatively unknown Villeneave brings us a crude yet tasteful thriller, using the traditional 'drug cartel' modality as its canvass. Adopting a slow paced linear speed with interspersed shock violence reminiscent of the Coens' 'No Country For Old Men', this morbid snapshot of Mexico's darker manifestations is just as disturbing as Scott's 'The Counselor'. Sicario's apotheosis rests in its poignant music. The livid drum resonating at key segments of the film draws the senses into pandemonium at just the right moment. Benicio Del Toro affirms his prowess for the malignant after proving his capacity in 'Escobar: Paradise Lost'. We can trust and look forward to this new style looking to the future. Villeneave, merci beaucoup."

","So after liking Black Mass my bias for crime films continues further here, I really liked Sicario, it was well directed, acted and the cinematography was beautiful. At the heart of Sciario, the plot is quite simple, a talented FBI rookie- Kate (Emily Blunt) gets called up to a higher up narcotics unit who claim that their fight makes a difference and if she wants to make a difference and start dealing with higher level cartel mafia they were the only unit which can help her out. The said unit led by Graver (Josh Borlin) has hired a special contractor Alejandro Gillick (Benecio Del Toro) of mysterious origins who is a smooth multilingual talker and a ruthless killer all rolled into one; basically James Bond without all the womanizing and silliness. Gillick and Graver take liberties during their missions and don't go about their business by the books in fact sometimes they seem bigger criminals than the drug cartel they fight against. Kate is an idealist and this disturbs her, but at the same time she also wants to make a difference, this theme is the meat and potatoes of the movie. I personally found this theme a lot more relatable than Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners' ""I will fall to any depths for my child"" theme because I am not a parent and but still old enough to realize that how many times I wish I could have done something which really mattered to the society I live in. Everyone's great here, Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin perform well but the man who is the spirit of this movie and it's namesake is the Sciario (meaning The Hit-man) himself- Benecio Del Toro, we find the Academy Award winner here in top form, I was reminded of the fact how physically imposing he was when he towered above Josh Brolin (who is a big guy himself); coupled with the fact he was so intimidating, this was a great casting choice and I hope to see a nomination for Del Toro in Best Supporting Actor category.<br/><br/>Some things I wish the film did better was if it dealt with the details, the nitty gritties which I enjoyed in Black Mass, what's the hierarchy of the cartel? How is the business carried out? How is the load distributed? Answers to these questions are lacking in this movie and it is details like this which truly elevate crime films and make them realistic. The ending was also a little too Gung-Ho for my liking, I also liked the fact while this film had better editing than Prisoners, the film still had some ""fat"" and could have been trimmed by fifteen minutes or so. Lastly, I am glad that this movie had a very unique well shot encounter between the Cartel and Narcotics unit it was in an underground tunnel of sorts and the shots alternated between night vision and normal vision while ominous music played in the background, good stuff, I like that Villeneuve has made this more visually appealing than his previous works."

","Sicario opens with startling intensity, unsurprising given the thematic elements of director Denis Villeneuve's previous features. Our protagonist, Kate (played by Emily Blunt), is thrust in the middle of the war on drugs where either side is leaderless and directionless creating intense chaos in the center. She is an uninformed, reactionary bystander throughout, while Josh Brolin's and Benicio del Toro's characters seem to have clear direction (even if it is unclear from where that direction came). Though this narrative setup is an understated, impactive commentary on the war on the drugs, it leaves us unable to truly savor its climax as in more traditional thrillers.<br/><br/>Where Sicario really impresses is in Roger Deakins' cinematography. It is visually stunning throughout. The use of infrared and night vision cameras in the third act is truly remarkable.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was a satisfying addition to Villeneuve's filmography that probably merits more than one viewing to truly appreciate."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>After a disastrous drug bust on the US/Mexico border left some members of her team dead, Federal Agent Mercer (Kate Winslet, sorry, Emily Blunt) is left feeling disillusioned with the war against drugs, until she is approached by Agent Graver (Josh Brolin) who is setting up a Task Force to go after a big time drug dealer who may have ultimately been behind her teammate's deaths. Assisted by the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), she and her close partner Wayne (Daniel Kaluuga) are dragged into a morally skewed, uneven world, where the ends justify the means in the most brutal and unfair of ways, and no one escapes squeaky clean.<br/><br/>With an odd title that is explained away at the beginning as meaning 'hitman' in Mexico, Sicario presents itself as a typical action thriller centred in the drug world, albeit one with more emphasis on a hard hitting, no nonsense style of delivery, and in many ways achieves this objective. But Denis Villeneuve's film penetrates much further than this, serving as more of an eye opening, unbiased glimpse into this most murky of worlds. With echoes of Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, and the Italian crime drama Gomorrah, and even the recent Cartel Land, it emerges as a very pleasant surprise and far more than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>It gets by, more than anything, on a silent, moody, lingering atmosphere throughout, that accompanies the unfolding story perfectly. Our unwitting, unsuspecting central protagonists are drawn into a world where terror and misery permeates everything, where there is deep seated unhappiness on every corner, and little hope of anything ever changing, if the excesses of wealthy America continue to channel the demand for exploitation on the other side of the border. There's no nice, neat and tidy happy Hollywood ending to wrap everything up with, just characters who've crossed lines they can't cross back from and seen the ends have justified the means in the most horrific and unthinkable of ways.<br/><br/>We're left with a subtle reminder that there's only the promise of more of the same to come, and the cycle of hopelessness is doomed to continue. Sicario promises one thing on the surface, and ends up delivering something far more dynamic and compelling, the latest gritty, no holds barred assault on the doomed war on drugs. ****"
"Anurag-Shetty","9","0","2","15 October 2015"," Starts off slow but, more than makes up for it in the second half.
","Sicario is a movie about FBI agent, Kate Macer(Emily Blunt). After a mission in Arizona goes awry, the FBI have to take a stand against the drug cartel in Mexico. The drug cartel is worsening the war against drugs at the border area between the US & Mexico. A special task force is assigned by the government to take down the Mexican drug cartel. This task force assigns Kate as one of its members. Other members on the task force are, Matt Graver(Josh Brolin) & Alejandro(Benicio Del Toro) among others. Now, it is up to the task force to put an end to the drug wars on the US & Mexico border, by any means necessary. <br/><br/>Sicario is a brilliant film. The first half of the movie is slightly dragging. Apart from a few action set pieces here & there, not much happens. People who are not fans of dramas may get fidgety. However, the second half of the movie is a pulse pounding action packed thrill ride, that definitely makes up for even the slightest bit of boredom experienced in the first half. The climax is the highlight of the movie. The suspense & build-up in the final 45 minutes of the film, is commendable. There are so many twists & turns that, you have to devote your complete attention to the movie to keep up with them all. Please, no texting while you're watching the film! Director Denis Villeneuve strikes gold yet again, after Prisoners(2013). Although, if I had to choose, I liked Prisoners(2013) more than this movie. That's mainly because I prefer the genre of Prisoners. So, don't be prejudiced. Villeneuve's latest directorial effort is equally well made. The cinematography by Roger Deakins adds to the tension & growing feeling of dread as the film progresses. The music by Johann Johannsson is haunting, yet captivating. The talented cast definitely adds to the appeal of the film. Emily Blunt is amazing as Kate Macer. Blunt portrays Agent Macer's various emotions, with ease & grace. Benicio Del Toro is outstanding as Alejandro. Del Toro's intense performance is another highlight of the film. Josh Brolin is spectacular as Matt Graver. Brolin adds some much needed humor, to the otherwise dark proceedings. Victor Garber is great as Dave Jennings. Jon Bernthal is superb as Ted. Daniel Kaluuya is awesome as Reggie Wayne. Maximiliano Hernandez is impressive as Silvio. The supporting characters are effective too. Sicario is a must watch. Go for it!"

","Sicario<br/><br/>How far would you go to bate the seemingly inextinguishable inferno that is the Mexican drug war? Sicario raises this and many more questions about the dark reality of the American war on drugs. In a post 9/11 America, we've become comfortable with achieving moral goals through amoral means. Siciario's portrait of this shadow war doesn't attempt to preach one way or the other, but rather holds an objective mirror to this complex moral paradox that has come to define our nation. Perhaps the only way of achieving a greater favorable outcome is to allow agencies like the CIA to blur the boundaries of the law? Is the greater good for America realistically achievable without some evil? As long as we're safe, do we care how it gets done? <br/><br/>The movie itself is a beast of awe whose suspense and pacing grips you from the first shot to the last, methodically pounding away at your psyche. Everyone involved is running on full cylinders, from the simple yet deep story, to the immersive, weighted acting, to the remarkable score. However, what may stand out the most is Roger Deakin's incredibly intricate cinematography. The movie is shot with a shadowy filter that bleeds with the darkness woven through the narrative. Delta force silhouettes against a vibrant desert sunset. Enrapturing colors and atmosphere. Slow zoom shots twisting and turning through your mind. The warped faces of the dead manifesting themselves on the mountains and vistas. <br/><br/>Siciario isn't just this year's best thriller, it's a beautifully dark story of a character trying to do the right thing without losing her soul.

"ryanmark-57919","8","0","3","14 October 2015"," Depressing but Excellent
","Wow. This is one of the most intense and at the same time depressing movies I've seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong, it's a great film, but the way it portrays the drug trade in the United States and Mexico is disheartening. Some of the deaths and tortures that we see in this film are brutal but I guess it helps to get the point across. Drug traffickers will do just about anything to get their product out there and to make some money off of others' suffering. Let's talk about the story a little.<br/><br/>Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is an FBI agent with a pretty good record of responding to drug related crimes in the Southwestern United States. She and her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) are trying their best to keep the drugs from coming in but they realize they're losing. After a particularly terrorizing case, Kate is convinced to join a special task force designed to hit the drug traffickers in a more direct fashion. This new task force is headed by a man named Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) and his mysterious partner Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Kate soon learns that Graver and Alejandro are willing to use illegal procedures to get what they want and Alejandro himself isn't being totally honest about who he is.<br/><br/>Once again, we get another movie full of excellent talent. Emily Blunt is easily one of my favorite actresses working today. She's tough most of the time but we see her when she's vulnerable also. We see that she's trying her best to do the right thing but she's afraid to cross that line that Graver and his men stepped over long ago. I've said it before but I'm a huge fan of Josh Brolin. He always seems so comfortable in all of his roles and it makes his characters feel like actual people. And of course, Benicio Del Toro. What really needs to be said about this man? He's excellent in everything he does. I feel like he's either playing a very serious character or a goofy one and this character is definitely the first. He's straight up terrifying at times because of what he's willing to do but when we learn his reasons it's difficult not to empathize with him.<br/><br/>Mexico really doesn't look great in this film but that's the whole point. This country has become so corrupt that corpses and gunfire are common place and the poverty is visible in nearly every aspect of the cities these poor people have to live in. Everything in the environment and the way the characters act just screams of hopelessness. One of the major themes of the movie is the seemingly insurmountable odds facing the FBI and others fighting against the drug trade. This is why the task force headed by Graver do what they do but is it too late to change anything? Another one of the major themes of the film is the differing ideologies between Kate and Graver. Kate believes that everything should be done by the book while Graver is willing to cross the line into illegality (and seems to enjoy it) as long as the ends justify the means. In theory, both views have their pros and cons but Kate's view is easily the inferior in this film. She constantly complains about everything Graver and Alejandro do and doesn't seem to bring much to the table herself. She's obviously very idealistic and intelligent but Graver's methods constantly produce results while she keeps on getting herself into trouble. I found myself agreeing and siding with Graver but it would have been nice to see if Kate's own views were justified in any way. She actually came off as annoying at times since she couldn't seem to make any real change on her own but she's willing to complain about what every one else is doing.<br/><br/>The character of Alejandro is interesting since he's such a major character but the main plot doesn't seen to require him until the end. Most of what he does is doable by Graver but he keeps showing up and helping Kate out of some sticky situations. When we eventually find out what he's doing there the movie takes an even darker tone, if that's even possible. I don't want to spoil too much but he's a very tragic backstory. It's easy to empathize with him even if it's hard to condone some of his actions.<br/><br/>I have to say that I really enjoyed this film. The acting is great, the story is interesting, and the action is exciting if not brutal at times. It's not exactly a unique premise but it's done really well in this movie. It would have been nice if Kate's arguments actually made more sense but Graver was easily justified in his more direct approach. It's too bad he's so sadistic at times but he did get results. It's an interesting movie and I would definitely recommend giving it a watch."

Another assassin or crime-related movie thing with a sweeping scope. Can't possibly be as good as how they're trying way too hard to hype it. They're not even trying to be subtle. <br/><br/>Like Heat, though, it turns out the tone, development, payoffs, performances, blah blah blah in Sicario are actually way beyond expectations. I could go on and on about the tone and pacing. The restraint is incredible. The dissemination of info is even more impressive. In less than probably the first 20 to 30 minutes you'll figure out you're watching a masterwork here. Brilliant direction. <br/><br/>I didn't care for Prisoners because it never needed to be remade. The original was fine. But this guy's a MAJOR talent. I am floored. Prepare to be schooled with the new benchmark in you-are-not-supposed-to-get-to-see-this-kind-of-inside-stuff voyeur action/thriller/suspense/shooter/mystery/crime flick.

","This is my review of the tense crime, thriller Sicario (spoiler free). Sicario which means ""hitman"" in Spanish takes place in Mexico and the FBI go there to investigate some murders and kidnappings that have been happening throughout the country. There isn't really much of a story involved but that is what makes it good, now I will go through the good points of why I think this is the best action film of the year: <br/><br/>1. All star cast: an all star cast such as Emily Blunt, Bencio del Toro and Josh Brolin star in this film which is what makes a must because it's people you know.<br/><br/>2. Good action scenes: In the film I think there are about 5 action scenes but they keep you on the edge of your seat with well timed tense points for example explosions.<br/><br/>Sicario is a must watch film because it goes through a lot of police business and then you get the fun action scenes which are very bloody and glorious. It has great acting from all three main cast members. There are some slow points but you keep watching because then you learn about why they are after these criminals. All in all Sicario is a very intense crime thriller and a must watch 10/10 (highly recommended)."

","Sicario (2015) The great writer Carlos Fuentes once described his Mexico as a ""tragic country,"" that is like a Greek tragedy. The sad and unspoken fact today is that Mexico has been consumed by the illicit drug business. Drug lords preside over monarchies that divert inconceivable wealth from Mexico and the Latin American economies to satisfy an unquenchable thirst of demand from so-called developed countries with the U.S. being the largest trading partner.<br/><br/>Freely translated.""Sicario"" means Hit-man. The writers for this picture danced around too-hot-to-touch serious issues and barely touched on the realities. For example, the street scene shots in Ciudad Juarez only indirectly showed to the astute eye the posters of the missing women which is a very real serial murder going on today and a much more interesting plot topic than what was presented. Our hit-man, perfectly cast with Benicio Del Toro, is on a personal mission to avenge his murdered wife and daughter at the orders of a cartel. Let's visit this one again. A professional killer for money is on a mission to kill the people or group that killed his love ones using paid killers. But wait, there's more. A tandem plot is a CIA driven rogue unit attempting to flush out through various illegal cross border raids into Mexico to create enough of a disturbance that the jefe will emerge from his hideout to settle matters. And then they got him. Never mind international law. They know better and only a select and privileged few know what is the right thing to do. ""Just watch me."" No questions please. They then plow through this distortion of history in a good guys-bad guys John Wayne joke. Thank God this in only Hollywood (I hope).<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is completely miscast and misdirected but does an admirable job with what she is given. Between some serious cigarette drags (they even showed the brand! Really? Awesome), her character objects, almost quits this fiasco, and more than politely questions a small army of macho dudes with all kinds of military hardware to play with. Despite the story line so fantastic it could have been dreamed up by the Reagan Administration there are some areas that shine, particularly the sound track and the photography.<br/><br/>This film is a fine example of how a mediocre, humorless, bad airplane drama can achieve a level of interest and tension through a musical score. Stark desert scenes, the panorama of Juarez that stretches poverty to the horizon, the hideousness of the Wall, are all scored with dramatic music and tones that do more than words to remind the viewer of the tragic side of Mexico."
"kevjfarrell","8","0","2","13 October 2015"," Tense thriller
","I appreciate the message of this movie and think the Director has done a pretty good job. It shows the real ugly side of the narcotics industry controlled by powerful cartels.<br/><br/>The real tragedy of this business is both the end users (self-inflicted), and the mules who are treated as the lowest form of life and are expendable. And at times, if they step out of line in any way, they sometimes get killed and have their bodies displayed to frighten off any other people who might try to cross the cartels.<br/><br/>It's a war for sure. I wish the people who use drugs either for recreational use or through addiction could see for themselves the misery at the source and distribution level. I have a certain amount of sympathy for the cheap mules that are used to get the drugs across the border - they are trying to support their families under very difficult circumstances with poor work prospects. It is a dog eat dog world for those people - that's partly the reason so many of them want to cross the border illegally in the hope of a better life.<br/><br/>I wish there were easy answers to this problem from every angle. To be honest, I believe it needs to start with the users - since when have narcotics improved somebody's life? It is somewhat ingrained in American culture, that there is a pill to cure anything we don't like about our lives. People need to come to terms with the fact that most of our problems need to be addressed and acknowledged by ourselves in the first instance.<br/><br/>Anyway, I digress. The movie is a good tense thriller and fairly realistic. The acting is good. The Director is obviously a fan of movies like Traffic, The Hurt Locker and American Sniper. Read the synopsis of this movie to see whether it's something you would enjoy. I liked it and would recommend it if the theme appeals to you!"
"lumpacidshadow","7","0","2","13 October 2015"," Confusing by Intention: the Anti-Story of Sicario
","Here we have Sicario. It's a film that twists and turns from its opening minutes, presenting a gritty tale of unprecedented carnage and deception. The world of the film is a smear of desert colors and rolling storm-clouds, high tech government labs and sprawling, dilapidated shanty towns. Sicario presents a striking visual style that cements the setting of the story.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt's Kate is among the first of the characters we're introduced to. Their names we learn usually by proxy, and the film quickly introduces more characters than you can handle, all the while escalating the action and intensity as Kate is pulled back and forth along the Mexican border, which exposes two very contrasting territories. It's a story about catching the real bad-guys and making a difference in the drug war, or so we're led to believe. Of course, what unfolds is the proverbial ""tip of the iceberg"" scenario where everything Kate, our surrogate, considers to be right is turned on its head and left spinning as she makes the plunge.<br/><br/>The film does have some problems, mainly with pacing. One entire subplot remains detached from the main thread until the climax of the film, and sees no real development despite reappearing multiple times throughout the film. The payoff is meant to be a shocker, but it ends up being fairly predictable by the standards the film had already set for the world. Having said that, the climax itself was gripping, as well as the minimalist score which is used to great effect. The ending leaves something to be desired, though I believe the effect is to leave one saying ""wait, that's it?"", just in the best possible way. The reality is that to this tale, there is no real resolution - to continue is a matter of resolve, to continue if one dares. In all, there are a few scenarios that make it difficult to uphold a suspension of disbelief, but keep in mind that this movie is designed to be a disturbing journey through and through. While it has its low points, the film never leaves your attention to wander for too long. <br/><br/>Very good film, all in all. Don't bring kids to this (somehow, this snagged a 14A rating in my country of residence)."

","Sicario establishes Denis Villeneuve as Canada's most prominent director. It's not quite as profound as his Incendies but it's still remarkable. <br/><br/>If he has an auteur theme it's the loss of innocence in a jaw-dropingly corrupt world. His signature tone is a tightening tension that approaches the unbearable. He never softens the material at the end. <br/><br/>Here two innocents are sucked into America's corrupting war against the drug cartels. The black lawyer and blonde kidnapping squad cop witness slaughters beyond their apprehension and acceptance. The losers are families, from the lost wife and daughter Alejandro sets out to avenge, through the corrupt cop Silvio's family, to the cartel boss's sons and wife.<br/><br/>The most intimate human relations are trampled by the vicious gangs driven by greed. So, too, Kate nearly gets herself killed when her try for a one night stand tumbles her into the world of bought cops. <br/><br/>The film's overwhelming suspense serves its theme, the imminent threat of humanity turned into wolves. Alexandra's prediction of a society of lawlessness and savagery earns the tension we feel throughout this experience. And it is an experience, not just a good story.<br/><br/>The several god's eye view shots of the landscape paradoxically suggest this is a godless world. The shots bespeak man's technology not a higher understanding. The aerials show a desiccated, arid, lifeless nature in which humanity is reduced to negligible, passing specks. They're like Edward Burtynsky photos — the mangled and ruined nature man leaves in his wake. It's eerie and nightmarish but with an awful beauty. Their deadness makes them an emblem of the characters' soul. Even in the innocence of the kids' soccer game the war lights up the background.<br/><br/>Kate doesn't belong in this world. She signed up for a career that would restore family lives, recover taken members, not serve such wholesale destruction. But the CIA needs her to legitimize their acting on American soil. She serves as their ""mule"" the way the cartels deploy their carrier ""mules."" She's denied any will or knowledge beyond what they need to control her. Her dire actors make a point of denying her information, lest they lose control.<br/><br/>Amazing that we still have innocence to lose. But we do. We keep finding hope that our humanity and morality will win out. We keep being reminded they don't."

If you've seen previous films of his, you know what you're getting into. The directing is incredibly good and well-paced.

Everything you see on screen is portrayed beautifully in the music, using a nice array of instruments and sound design to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>The writing felt realistic and aided the actors with depth to their characters. If the script was bad then the film simply wouldn't be as great as it is. That's the standard for any film.<br/><br/>Sicario is a must-see for fans of high-octane thrillers and gruesome story-telling. If you're looking for an action packed flick, this is not the film for you. <br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve returns after his 2 year feature-absence with true style and this proves that he is now one of the most talented and masterfully intelligent directors around.

Both sides can't really end the game without making a colossal move and it's only a matter of who is willing to do it.<br/><br/>Sicario makes us doubt about how we should solve our problems. It is scary how relatable this movie is to our approach with daily obstacles. Should we play it by the book or should we just do what should be done without thinking about the costs?<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are top notch. Emily Blunt and Benicio del Toro play two different kinds of human being. Although Emily Blunt was marketed as the star of the show, Benicio del Toro is the real star here. He truly acts like how acting should be done. We do not need excessive amount of dialogue to understand what he wants even from the first time we met him.<br/><br/>Director Denis Villeneuve has done it again! The movie is full of visual goodies and he captures the thrill of the hunt in a beautiful way. One of the most memorable sequence is when they use the night/thermal vision goggles, the director also nails that sequence.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a recipe for success with a grade A performances, killer script, and an amazing direction. Unfortunately a sense of predictability lingers near the end of the movie because of the lack of character development. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie and consider it as one of this year's best."

","I loved Indendies, Prisoners and Enemy so had high hopes for this - and thankfully it delivered more than expected. I've read a few user-reviews since and find that plenty of them spoil the experience of the film, so I would advise not to read too many. I've remained completely content free here in terms of story, character etc. Its best enjoyed going in blind, so you can share in the unknowingness of the central character (Emily Blunt). <br/><br/>With Sicario, Villeneuve (with the help of excellent DP Deakins and a very talented cast) creates an entirely immersive world. This alone makes the film extremely engaging, gripping and fascinating - you feel like you're there. The soundtrack creates a feeling of horror and dread, you don't know what's going to be happen, but you don't doubt that something horrible could happen at any moment. There aren't any distracting moments or gimmicks to pull you out of the immersion - no CGI, no directorial show-off moments, no side characters saying ""that doesn't look good"" etc that ruin tension in most thrillers. I realise that Villeneuve excels in this - he doesn't sell out to ""please"" or amuse the audience - he understands the integrity and depth of experience that comes with telling it straight and efficiently. <br/><br/>Sicario is a masterful and impactive film on every level. If you're cautious of going to theaters these days with all the let-downs, remakes and trashy nonsense, then Sicario won't disappoint - its a strong thriller of the highest calibre."

","Sicario is a gripping tale of a devastated, troubled but ruthless shooter, Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) who together with American task force, led by Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) hunts for a drug cartel operating from Mexico. Embroiled in this hunt, is a female, strong willed FBI agent, Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) who is a bit wary of violence and finds this mission too hot to handle. Right from the start, the tone of the movie is set to be thrilling, sombre and uncertain. While watching, at least initially, it would seem that one has suddenly become a part of a large, very complex episode and would immediately relate with Kate who seems equally clueless and anxious. This enigma compounded by powerful cinematography and pulsating background score doesn't allow the eyes to blink or search for popcorn. Benicio Del Toro is a sublime actor and his magic is palpable throughout the movie. When the movie is over and you realize that you are no more involved, you come out of the theater with a heavy heart – a bit because of violence and majorly because of Alejandro's character which simply grows on you."

","Sicario (9/10) - A Dark Poem<br/><br/>Sicario begins on a tense note, a raid on a hostage house goes bad. Soon the tension rises as a FBI agent (Blunt) is brought in as part of an inter agency anti drug team. She now has to work with two Department of Defense 'consultants' - one who talks too much and the other who doesn't. Both manipulate in their own ways. Blunt's character is clueless much like the audience in terms of what is exactly happening but as the tense thriller unfolds and you begin to find out, just like her character you may not like where you are. With each passing moment, the tension rises and stays till the last scene. For some, it may not leave you once you have left the theater.<br/><br/>To me the highlight was the political undertones of the film, is what is happening right? Did what happens in the movie make things better or worse? Questions that only you as an audience can answer depending on which side of the politics you sit on. While you are grappling with the tension and morality questions. The film has already owned you as a technical masterpiece. You are mesmerized by panning aerial camera shots, by an exponentially rising music score, by emotional performances (esp. Benicio Del Toro in a character made for him), by a strong story-line and by one liners which would easily make AFI's top 100 quotes list - 'Don't you ever point a gun at me' The US Mexico cavalcade sequence about transporting a drug witness across the border was by far one of the best I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Remember, Sicario is not an action film. It is a realistic crime thriller. It is dark, disturbing and unfortunately real. Almost like a dark poem. There is No CGI, no cars flying around, no people jumping in mid air shooting guns but the violence when it occurs is brutal enough to make you close your eyes.<br/><br/>I could not help but compare it with Traffic that other classic drug war movie also starring Benicio Del Toro also ending in a shot of children playing a sport (so much for spoilers). I would have to say Traffic was a better film but Sicario would still easily make it to the top 5 films of the year.<br/><br/>My prediction: Sicario is a 100% certified Oscar Winner for 2015. If anything else they would it give it for cinematography (high time Roger Deakins got his due) or even sound editing. I wouldn't be surprised if all three Josh Brolin, Emily Blunt and Del Toro are nominated for their performances. Del Toro may bag his second Oscar (his performance is the best i have seen this year) Too early to say best picture but it would surely get a nomination there.<br/><br/>Catch Sicario on a big screen with a good sound. One Word: Unmissable."

It turned out to be a good one.<br/><br/>A movie like Sicario makes impact by its cinematography and soundtrack which you will experience in full zest. The cinematography of the movie by Roger Deakins, capturing the empty horizons, the tunnels, the below-par life on the suburbs and the drab look and feel of a semi-arid region infested with drug lords and gangwars, is awesome. So is the soundtrack by Johann Johansson which enhances the subtle, understated drama at every level. Benecio del Toro (havent seen much of his work would love to) steals the show with his chilling, ice-cold,<br/><br/>hawk-eyed, single-minded endeavor, one of the best grey-shade characters we have seen for a while. He is definitely up for an Oscar nomination along with Deakins and Johannson. The director shoots these scenes with great precision utilizing the slow- burn approach that Breaking Bad perfected. <br/><br/>This film isn't concerned with tender moments, but when it takes a breath and surveys the meaningless chaos in the world, it hits hard with some great lines delivered by Toro. Sicario being a movie that belongs to black cinema genre will not be liked by all. The movie falters perhaps in the tale itself which is a storyline which is quite predictive. The twists and turns are in the characters more than the story. So while the movie presents an interesting view of characters, the tale itself leaves space for improvement. Blunt becomes less and less significant as the movie proceeds, until the end where she becomes nothing more than a dotted line. Yet, it is a decent watch.<br/><br/>Watch it for great cinematography and one of the best chilling soundtrack and for Toro's brilliant acting."

","There are aspects to this film that resonate not only with the South American drugs war but also the grim events playing out in the middle east. As such, the film sets a terrible scene through whose colouring we are to view the rather too idealistic 'law enforcement' intentions of the female FBI agent. It is this character, played admirably by Blunt, that is the weakest link. This character seems incapable of asking questions, of making intelligent assessments of what is going on around her and, at one point, is reliant on a much more junior operative to do what she should have done. We are then supposed to believe that this character knows no self-defence moves and nearly gets herself murdered. To cap it all, whilst refusing to 'sign' a false declaration on grounds of principle nearly does the most foul of deeds - shooting a man in the back. Ridiculous, and really takes the edge off what should have been a really hard hitting, realistic and thrilling drama. Benicio Del Toro pulls off the most impressive performance of all as Alejandro. Well done."

","If you know nothing at all about this film, then the enigmatic title is hardly going to be a draw (in the opening moments, it is explained as Spanish cartel slang for hit-man). But the promotion for the movie puts British actress Emily Blunt - playing FBI agent Kate Macer - as the central attraction and she gives a terrific performance as someone tough and brave, but vulnerable and principled. It's good to see her being used more in action roles, following the success of ""Edge Of Tomorrow"". However, although Blunt gets top billing, Josh Brolin as an unorthodox CIA agent and Benicio Del Toro as a Columbian adviser on the drugs trade both offer superb support roles.<br/><br/>This immensely stylish thriller is wonderfully crafted by (first time) Texan-born screenwriter Taylor Sheridan, Oscar-nominated, Quebec-born director Denis Villeneuve and (long-time) British cinematographer Roger Deakins. From the very opening, we have tense music and an action sequence that sets the tone for the whole movie. For quite some time, Kate - and the viewer - have little idea what's really going on, but plot-wise things gradually become clearer, while the moral ambiguity of the whole operation is never resolved. As with the film ""Traffic"" (which also starred Del Toro), this is all about American law enforcement agencies efforts to contain - if not combat - the smuggling of drugs in the face of widespread corruption and violence.<br/><br/>In another recent film ""Good Kill"", a policeman asks a member of the military how the war on terror is going and receives the sardonic response that it's going as well as the war on drugs. At the conclusion of this thoroughly absorbing and hard-hitting film, you won't disagree."

","Sicario is a Spanish term for hit-man. This was introduced to the audience at the beginning of the movie. The movie focuses on Kate, an FBI agent who volunteered herself to capture the people in charge of operating drug cartels in Mexico. As they arrived in El Juarez, Mexico, the agents faced reality of how drug traffickers took over the land. Dead bodies were hung by rope over a bridge and gangsters drove through the streets to patrol the area. The agents knew that they needed to act quickly in order to clean up the mess.<br/><br/>""Sicario"" was a suspenseful movie where the director, Denis Villeneuve, did a wonderful job on tackling the relationship between the movie and reality. Portrayed by actress Emily Blunt, Kate joined a mission without knowledge of what was going on around her. She came from a background where she learned to be on top of every mission and knew exactly what happened in her surroundings. However, Kate struggled to follow the assignments given to her because she was not aware of the specifications of her duty and new endeavors to overcome. Higher authorities were often bribed to run deliveries, protect dealers, and hint information to cartel members.<br/><br/>Denis Villeneuve attempted to portray accurate the views on state police members. When a dealer went through the tunnel and needed a ride, a state policeman was usually the one that gave him a ride. The corrupted officials often gave cartel members information on what was going on around the states. If any whistle-blowers were to be caught, the cartel members would send people after their family. <br/><br/>This movie brought out the best in all the actors and actresses. From an audience member's point of view, each cast member acted out their roles perfectly. Cast members were able to depict their characters' lives, allowing the audience to truly understand the lifestyle in the movie. In addition, the cinematography captured every aspect of El Juarez to the smallest details.<br/><br/>I did have a critique about the movie. If there were to be a change in the movie, I would suggest to add or remove the bar scene. Kate and her friend, Reggie, ran into one of Reggie's ex-coworker at the bar, who happens to be a state policeman. Kate decided to casually date him. Unfortunately, he ended up working for the cartel in which he tried to kill her when she found out. What I did not like about this scene was how it was a coincident for both Kate and the officer to hook up, as he ended up being a corrupted officer. Realistically, a good friend would not intentionally introduce someone to an individual that would cause harm. If Reggie were to invite him out on a separate occasion, this would have been a better scene than just running into each other at a specific bar.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Sicario"" was wonderfully directed; I was captivated throughout the whole movie. It was full of suspense and never had a dull moment. Denis Villeneuve invoked emotion with each scene and connected it with real life situations. This movie was an eye opener to the audience because most people never understood how corrupted the state officials can be. Working within a cartel will never end well; members will either shoot or get shot at. With a movie this realistic, people will now understand the war against drug cartels."
"oscaralbert","9","0","4","8 October 2015"," SICARIO documents the need to immediately move . . .
",". . . the population of Juarez, Mexico, and any other non-Americans currently within 100 miles of the U.S. fence far enough south so that they're no longer within this international buffer zone. If we were being informed of what's ACTUALLY happening in places such as Chandler, AZ (where SICARIO shows how Mexican cartel members slaughtered 42 random American collegians and dry-walled them in a single suburban home in observance of pagan customs) EVERY U.S. citizen (except maybe those like the sniveling, bleeding-heart, ""by-the-book"" FBI agent cry-baby and drug-lord enabler played in SICARIO by Emily Blunt) would be demanding AT LEAST a 100-mile-wide No Go Zone down South. As SICARIO proves, our ""border"" presently is riddled with drug terrorist tunnels, and any crime-lord committing genocide against America can buy his way out of detention by bribing the ""authorities"" of this totally corrupt society (as happened this summer with the prison tunnel guy). Maybe some Americans have forgotten that we already have ""won"" the entire ""nation"" of Mexico in the Battle of Vera Cruz. As the U.N. mandates, ""to the victor go the spoils."" That 100-mile-wide No-Go buffer zone now features little but squalor and human suffering. When it's totally depopulated (and policed 24/7/365 by the U.S. Air Force and drone program), Americans will be MUCH better off, and Mexicans won't be any worse. See SICARIO--and vote for change!"
"jaimedcastillo","9","0","3","8 October 2015"," In Mexico Sicario means hit-man
","Sicario, Latin meaning for ""hitman"" is director Dennis Villeneuve's latest thriller. Staring Emily Blunt, she plays Kate as a brilliant FBI agent recruited to be part of a mission in the lawless border between U.S and Mexico. Unaware of the main objectives of the mission, Kate is exposed to some of the most dangerous and uncomfortable situations international drug trafficking can offer. Government task force agents Josh Brolin as Matt and Benicio Del Toro as Alejandro lead the mission smoothly up until they start using secretive methods of violence and deceit that Kate notices. At this point it makes you realize that we are in for a fishy situation that no one can really predict the result. <br/><br/>Right of the bat Sicario unloads with intense shooting scenes. FBI agents including Kate invade an Arizona home in search for a kidnap victim. The discovery of bodies wrapped in plastic behind the walls of the home is one of the many gruesome scenes that you will see in this movie. Headed south of the border, Kate gets a close look of what Ciudad Juarez is like on day-to-day basis. Bodies hanging in plain sight and constant police activity make you believe that this is normal and believable if you know or don't know about the constant drug war struggle in Mexico. It's evident that Kate's purpose in the mission is unclear as Matt and Alejandro are purposely keeping her out of the loop. There is a lack of leadership on both sides of the drug war, which creates confusion as to who really is the protagonist. The communication between Kate and the task force is unclear all throughout which didn't allow the storyline to fully develop. Unclear communication led to conflict between Kate and Matt as she sees Alejandro do something that caught her off guard feeling like he's the one they should be going after. <br/><br/>What drives Sicario is the cinematography and acting. Villeneuve pushed for suitable and realistic scenes that take you in to what it's really like to live on the other side of the border. The suspenseful and bone chilling sound effects make you feel that at any second something crazy will happen. Del Toro and Blunt's remarkable acting makes this movie a good thriller yet confusing in a sense. The flaw I see is Kate's role because the movie is seen through her point of view most of the time. She is confused and nervous of what will happen next. As the viewer I felt I was unaware of what was truly happening in regards to the mission. But ultimately Del Toro's role saved the movie from being OK to good. His presence fit well in this dark shocking film because he makes it seem like he's cool guy who is following everything by the book but soon enough you will realize that he's the last the guy you want to be around with. Getting a better perspective of what Alejandro was really up to would have been nice to implement in the movie. I mentioned how the movie lacks clarity of the mission's objective, but we have to face reality. There is so much competition and evil flowing around these drug wars that sometimes being unclear with those you even trust is your best bet to be a winner. You can't trust no one and have to be on your own. I would of liked to see how that persona of Alejandro was thinking and planning on doing more than what was really shown in the movie."
"isheikher","8","0","3","8 October 2015"," Sicario mostly side steps mainstream predictable expectations
","An idealistic FBI agent is enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico.<br/><br/>Sicario is another well crafted, tense thriller from director Denis Villeneuve, scripted by 'Sons of Anarchy' writer Taylor Sheridan, and shot beautifully by none other than Roger Deakins. It drags you, face first, into the raging drug war between US forces and Mexican cartels. South of the border, we see a house raid that uncovers dead bodies decaying behind walls. An explosion results in the deaths of several men belonging to Emily Blunt's team. It puts her on a mission to draw out one of the major drug lords responsible, with U.S. forces led by Josh Brolin, cooperating alongside the silent and mysterious Benicio del Toro.<br/><br/>Once into Juarez, Mexico, we see a disturbing scene of mutilated corpses hanging in the street. This is part of a 15 to 20 minute scene of pure tension that grips you from start to finish. Steady photography follows a police convoy through the streets and traffic. Ariel shots glide over the city and dry landscape. A haunting score with it's ominous deep rumbling is present throughout. The scene ends with a brutal shootout on a border crossing. It's the beginning of Blunt's journey into a mission that blurs the line between crime and justice.<br/><br/>The cast are all on top of their game. Emily Blunt has starred in a variety of roles in different genres, and here we see her tough yet vulnerable, a believer in justice and going by the book. Benicio del Toro becomes more important as the story progresses, his motivations unclear until the end, a frightening figure with a hunger for revenge. Josh Brolin is also great, a shady task force leader who knows everything about the brutal world he operates in. My one complaint was the little time given to the the drug lords who are only introduced towards the end.<br/><br/>With a runtime of two hours, the film never out stays it's welcome. The tone is consistent and rarely strays from the tense and grim style, with spots of humour here and there. The pace of the film ticks along nicely without over explaining or rushing important scenes. Again, the score by Johann Johannsson is fantastic with low rumblings that build into a wall of noise. <br/><br/>Suspenseful, compelling and sophisticated on it's own terms, Sicario mostly side steps mainstream predictable expectations, and it's all the better for it."
"vinsim27","8","0","3","8 October 2015"," A Suspenseful action film from Denis Villeneuve.
","From the director of Prisoners, Enemy, and Incendies comes a disturbing action thriller with fantastic cinematography, great acting, and fantastic direction. <br/><br/>Sicario follows Emily Blunt as Kate Macy, an FBI agent who winds up working for another group of officers attempting to take down the drug cartel in Mexico. The two male protagonists are Alejandro, (Benicio del Toro) and Matt(Josh Brolin) draw Kate to a distance with their unorthodox, and often disturbing methods on gaining information, and the result is a messed up crime film with some elements of vengeance to add to the excellence.<br/><br/>When I think of films like this, the first other movie that comes to mind would be Zero Dark Thirty, which is very similar in terms of structure, but Sicario is the much more well executed feature with a much more f****d up tone. The cinematography was definitely Oscar- worthy, seeing as it was done by famous cinematographer Roger Deakins, who worked with Villeneuve on Prisoners two years ago. Keeping with Villeneuve's tradition, the acting was great as well. The director definitely knows how to get great performances out of his actors. Whenever a child actor was in the film, Denis was able to actually get them to act well, which is refreshing because of how a decent child performance is so hard to come by. Benicio del Toro gave the absolute best performance in the whole film and really made me feel kinda uncomfortable whenever he was on screen. Josh Brolin as the slacker agent was pretty excellent, and Emily Blunt was also great, with the exception of one scene in which her delivery while she was talking to Brolin was kind of off. I won't spoil the scene and I have a feeling that you will know it when you see it.<br/><br/>Overall, Sicario is a film that was very masterfully crafted in terms of acting, shot composition, direction, and it's aim to be disturbing was definitely successful. After watching it, you're probably gonna want to take a shower."
"rencnielsen","10","0","4","8 October 2015"," Loved this movie, it was better than i expected
","I knew this movie would be right up my alley, action, guns, cartel, etc. But it was even better than I expected. The plot line was fun and the characters were interesting. If you like rated R action movies that involve guns, you'll like this. The acting was also superb. Oh, one more thing, the score of this film was amazing, the music complimented the story line and dramatic scenes well. Loved the soundtrack. I am a little surprised IMDb makes me write 10 lines of text for a review. Its hard to write this many lines and not give away A) Key plot details B) give away spoilers or C) reveal too much. I like to keep movies somewhat hidden before I see them so the screen writers can lead me in any direction they want, which in this movie happened so I like to avoid previews."
"jakobgf-95","7","0","3","8 October 2015"," Gets better as it goes on.
","When i saw the first poster for this movie i decided to see it only because i really liked the design. But of course, i looked up who was involved in the creation of this film because i'm not made of money and decide very carefully which movie i pay to see at the theater.<br/><br/>After finding out that the director is Denis Villeneuve i had a real, legitimate reason to pay for this movie because he has made a few great movies recently. Once again, he teamed up with cinematographer Roger Deakins who really knows how to do his job. The visual choices they made here are absolutely amazing and it gets better as the film goes on.<br/><br/>I also have to give credit to Jóhann Jóhannsson who composed a great soundtrack which underlines the already great built up to the various action scenes which are also done very good. <br/><br/>The characters and the dialogue are written very well and the performances of the actors are great. There are only few little details that really bother me. In one scene a character smokes a cigarette and you can clearly see that it isn't burning and in another scene one character tries to strangle another character but he is clearly not putting any pressure on the throat with his thumb. I don't know if this would bother an average movie goer but for me it was really annoying.<br/><br/>And this might not be any criticism about the film but during my view nobody in the room was competent enough to turn his or her phone off or at least turn it on silent mode because i heard ring tones at least five times during the film and there was also some worthless piece of trash two rows in front of me who checked Facebook almost the entire time. I don't know how such incompetence can even exist but is it really asked to much to put your shitty phone away for two hours? This is really impolite and anyone who does that shouldn't be allowed to leave the theater alive.<br/><br/>But the movie was great. Definitely go and watch it."
"Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer","9","0","5","6 October 2015"," Not The Hit-man You're Thinking Of
","Sicario is directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan. It stars Benicio Del Torro, Emily Blunt, and Josh Brolin.<br/><br/>Sicario revolves around an idealistic FBI agent enlisted by an elected government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. I adore this movie I really do so I want to get my problems out of the way before I dive head first into all the goodies. My problem with the movie was simply the pacing. For the first half of the movie the movie drags and picks up in equal measure till a bar scene which just makes the movie flawless onward.<br/><br/>Firstly the writing was phenomenal! Taylor Sheridan demonstrated perfectly all the darkness brewing under the surface between drug cartels. He also showed that it takes both sides of the border to do these crimes.Thus demonstrating the evils of the U.S. and Mexico. Through this, it was made clear that the corruption and greed of the U.S. go hand and hand with the poverty and desperation of Mexico to the point of true unadulterated terror.<br/><br/>Next is The one, the only Dennis Villeneuve. With mastery of the material Villeneuve painted all the characters a shade of gray before revealing their true selves. He accomplished this through beautiful camera work and magnificent shots. With the help of living legend cinematographer, Roger Deakins this movie is a technical masterwork.<br/><br/>Just as great if not better was the acting. Emily Blunt offers some of her best work, giddily ridding the underbelly of drug busts with remarkable finesse. Her role demanded sheer brutal emotion and she more than delivered. Accompanying her, Josh Brolin does some of the best work he's done in years. Working as a bit of a comic relief and as a brutal wake up call to both U.S. and Mexican citizens alike. Heart wrenching and breaking these two fine actor's churn out the very best in each other.<br/><br/>By far the best supporting performance I've this year was offered by none other than Benicio Del Torro. His cool and understated performance is can only be compared to Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men."" He was as menacing as he was sympathetic and all the audience and do is sit and watch in amazement and disgust as we slowly unravel this multidimensional character. Del Torro's performance can only be called bravura.<br/><br/>Sicario is a wonderfully dark and twisted, yet timely and poignant movie with a strong cast led by brilliant work by Del Torro. Sicario Gets an A or a 9/10."
