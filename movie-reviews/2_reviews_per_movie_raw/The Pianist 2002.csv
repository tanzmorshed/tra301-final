","I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.<br/><br/>How wrong I was.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. <br/><br/>Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.<br/><br/>I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.<br/><br/>I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. <br/><br/>World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Fella_shibby","10","58","65","9 September 2013"," A Masterpiece. Awesome acting by Brody.
","This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody."

","The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.<br/><br/>
Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).<br/><br/>Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.<br/><br/>In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).<br/><br/>This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).<br/><br/>Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.<br/><br/>Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood."
"FilmOtaku","8","284","343","28 April 2003"," An astonishing film
","The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.<br/><br/>Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.<br/><br/>Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.<br/><br/>A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.<br/><br/>Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.<br/><br/>The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"dtb","10","139","176","9 January 2004"," Adrien Brody's Minimalist Acting Packs Maximum Emotional Punch
","This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)"
"ashcoounter","9","137","174","1 February 2003"," Brilliantly Narrated, Visually Stunning!
","Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.<br/><br/>Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.<br/><br/>Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.<br/><br/>Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.<br/><br/>Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.<br/><br/>The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.<br/><br/>Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10."
"jotix100","10","153","198","21 January 2003"," To hell and back.
","The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.<br/><br/>The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.<br/><br/>There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. <br/><br/>What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  <br/><br/>Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.<br/><br/>In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell."
"Nazi_Fighter_David","10","77","98","6 September 2005"," Definitively an inspiring epic...
","'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' <br/><br/>In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: <br/><br/>Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...<br/><br/>Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... <br/><br/>Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...<br/><br/>Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better."" <br/><br/>Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...<br/><br/>Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...<br/><br/>Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...<br/><br/>Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...<br/><br/>Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... <br/><br/>Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..<br/><br/>Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...<br/><br/>Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay... Once Brody took the stage to accept his Oscar, he was so overwhelmed with happiness, that he swept the gorgeous Academy Award-winning Halle Berry off her feet with a long, steamy kiss..."
"baba44713","9","178","239","7 April 2005"," terrific movie, if relentlessly gritty and realistic
","I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.<br/><br/>Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.<br/><br/>While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over."
"Quinoa1984","10","132","176","16 January 2003"," Stoic, haunting tale of survival
","The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  <br/><br/>This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).<br/><br/>In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+"

","last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.<br/><br/>the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.<br/><br/>
bottom line: ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.<br/><br/>ten out of ten, best movie of 2002"

","Ok - so some might disagree and suggest Schindler's List is the best WW2 film but for me it was the Pianist - such a raw and painful representation of Nazi brutality and desperation of the people.

"classicsoncall","10","13","17","3 February 2013"," ""You musicians don't make good conspirators.""
","Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.<br/><br/>Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.<br/><br/>Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked ""The Ghetto"" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in ""Shtikat Haarchion"" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"", if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term ""Never Again"" be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world."

","Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.<br/><br/>Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.<br/><br/>He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.<br/><br/>We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman ""is"" -- or rather ""was"" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.<br/><br/>When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, ""Then why the ****ing coat?"" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, ""I was cold."" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.<br/><br/>It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.<br/><br/>One of the better films of the year."

","My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. <br/><br/>This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. <br/><br/>The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.<br/><br/>This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once."
"ma-cortes","8","8","11","18 November 2008"," Intense biography about a Polish pianist named Szpilman during the Warsaw ghetto
","This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and proper experience on his childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides splendid actors, Frank Finlay,Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. Evocative cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's usual. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor, Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.<br/><br/>Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following manner : In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world.The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates.Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died.The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires.Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000. From Warsaw Jewish resistance moved to swamps and forests."
"Derek237","10","17","28","30 March 2003"," Shock appeal?
","The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.<br/><br/>I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much, though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passion,and throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on, no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones, just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?<br/><br/>Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.<br/><br/>There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him, ""Why the f-cking coat?"" Brody, with his hands still in the air, a terrified look on his face, almost crying, replies: ""I'm cold."" That did it for me.<br/><br/>The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"Buddy-51","Null","11","17","14 June 2003"," gripping though flawed drama
","`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.<br/><br/>This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.<br/><br/>Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.  <br/><br/>Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.<br/><br/>`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves."

","I knew Roman Polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to Hell, described in painstaking detail. I'm physically upset after watching this film. The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.<br/><br/>I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.<br/><br/>The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.<br/><br/>This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi.

"tedg","Null","13","24","21 April 2003"," Film and Music, Pain and Fire
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Nearly any film is for me a double experience: the watching and the post-coital rumination. That second phase can make the experience worthwhile even when the film itself is ordinary or poorly done.<br/><br/>But it works the other way as well, especially when a film is designed for discussion: the film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done. This film comes so charged. Szpilman wasn't `Jewish enough' to be the center of an important holocaust film, goes the most ordinary and loudest of them. I suppose there are some things about the commingling of descriptive art and definitive life to be said there. But one likes to have more freedom in post-film thoughts and that whole topic is dominated by the sorts of reflexive responses manipulated by film.<br/><br/>There's a second prepackaged topic concerning whether `Schindler' was better or `worse.' I don't consider Spielberg's film a holocaust film at all: he lives in a happy world, where justice and right (and lots of other happy values) always triumph. His observations are always external. His goal is always to tell a story, a stance that furthers the distance between his films and reality. Polanski's project has no story at all, merely a life of accidents. His camera is within the artist's personal space. His own mannerisms are Eastern European and depressed, congruent with what he shows. (Speilberg's Schindler really did have the silk unctuousness of the East, but as observed from California.) So I credit Polanski's vision as having more historical credibility than Speilberg's, knowing that despite the best efforts of us all to avoid having practical history made by the movie marketplace.<br/><br/>(One exception, where Polanksi is offensively theatrical: when Szpliman runs from the destroyed hospital, he faces a street of desolation as far as one can see, `High Noon'-wise.)<br/><br/>Much more interesting to my mind is the portrayal of an artist. Polanski has always been deeply self-referential in his work: always there is an examination of the artist within the art. And I make a minor hobby out of collecting film experiences that do this with music and mathematics because I have some personal experience to work with. <br/><br/>For those who don't know: Polands pride is Chopin, who invented a relationship to the piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance. (Film would follow this lead in 1941.) Chopin built pieces designed to be bent in performance, designed with empty rooms that a pianist could explore. Unlike, Bach for instance, where the magic of the performance was in attuning to Bach and his intent, the performer of Chopin really could bring his own soul to parity with God. Szpliman was a strong pianist, and therefore more than a national character, instead a reflection of the Polish heart.<br/><br/>Here, we  watch this man compromise his own pride, eschew his religion, run away from every opportunity for dignity in order to keep his hands warm to play another day; and not just play, but play on the radio for Poles. So during this painful journey, we assume what we are meant to in films about tortured artists: that the pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all. His own personal denigration - what is done to him and the denigrating choices he makes - are worth it overall.<br/><br/>This is where the fatal pessimism of Polanski stops, because he doesn't let us know the musical truth. This is not Szpilmans playing of course, but not much unlike him. Szpilman was a `safe' player, one who never had the strength or desire to add much to Chopin. That's why he was on the radio: his `interpretations' were unchallenging and palatable. But he would never have been considered an artist of note at all if he had not survived the perfect brutality of the Germans, whose own music, though sentimental was constrained in ways that Chopin's never was. The payoff is supposed to be that after his trials, the artist is now - theoretically - capable of expressing the pain and yearning of the world. That we are meant to so think is clear from the end, where he plays with the glow of Dreyfuss from `Music of the Heart.'<br/><br/>Ah, but not so. The sound we actually hear throughout is by Olejniczak, a similarly ordinary man. Szpilman did not in fact come through a better artist, but much worse: a meek pianist. `Shellshocked,' postwar contemporaries would say. <br/><br/>Contrast this with Artur Rubinstein. Jewish Pole of the previous generation, and the first giant to explore Chopin's rubato. He had his own dark nights, but not because the world was inhospitable. Listen to his recordings (freely available) compared to Szpilmans (hard to get) or even Olejniczaks on the soundtrack. These are two different universes. One is merely pleasant, the other life-altering.<br/><br/>Polanski has made some great films (including the under-appreciated `Ninth Gate'), and his thinking through of the intellectual reach of a project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here. Implicit in much of modern Jewishness is the triumph of enrichment of the people through their tribulation. Perhaps that is true, but this film undermines the idea when selecting Szpilman as metaphor.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished.

Well, it gives us a string of Nazi atrocities, very realistically depicted, and it gives us what I suppose is supposed to be a main character, but it gives us precious little else!  Most of main character's screen time is given over to him being acted upon by circumstances and by other people, but very little of him being pro-active, himself.  And even his passivity might be interesting if we knew what he was thinking or feeling.  But we are never given that information.  We never know what it is that he really wants.  Or how he feels, say, about the fact that his family was shipped off to their probable death, but he was saved by a fluke.  <br/><br/>The picture is certainly well-made from the stand point of art direction and cinematography, but story-wise, it's a shambles.

Like Schindler's List, The Pianist accurately documents the horrors of the holocaust to such an extent that it exists less like a work of art, and more like a public service. Films like this help us never to forget and never to repeat this awful moment in human history. Classroom viewings are mandatory. Not to mention, a world class performance by Adrian Brody. He is immersed in this role. To see him wandering through the rubble of Warsaw, looking for any last morsel of food to eat is a stroke of acting and cinema genius that you won't believe even when you see it.

"eddie_baggins","10","3","4","2 December 2014"," An incredibly touching tale of survival
","Divisive director Roman Polanski has had a polarizing career both behind camera and in a personnel sense yet whatever one may feel about the man or the filmmaker there is little doubt that his most effective and most profound movie is 2002's The Pianist. A true life war tale of incredible determination and bravery, Polanski's telling of accomplished Poland pianist and Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman ranks as one of cinemas greatest War set tales thanks to an incredibly realistic feel and a raft of award worthy acting turns.<br/><br/>Justifiably winning Polanski a Best Director Oscar, The Pianist sees the veteran director at his highest creative peak, an artist moulding with his material perfectly to create a vividly alive look into the atrocities that faced Warsaw's Jewish community and all others of similar creeds during Hitler's reign of terror. Polanski's Warsaw is brimming with stark images, from bodies strewn in the streets of the Jewish ""ghettos"", snow covered buildings in the harsh reality of a European winter and the strange comforts of an upmarket café as people go hungry outside, it's unquestionable that the setting of The Pianist is a character unto itself and part of the reason the movie works to the extent it does. It's interesting also to note how many a time Polanski films some of the movies most confronting scenes (wheelchair bound elders thrown from windows etc.) from a wide shot perspective, giving us the viewers a feeling of witnessing these events from far, powerless to stop what is happening yet not to the extent of being unaffected by it, much like our protagonist Wladyslaw Szpilman.<br/><br/>It would be remiss now with a decade hindsight of Adrien Brody to not remark on the power he displayed here as Szpilman. Brody inhabits Szpilman to an extent you quickly forget it is an actor you are watching, whether he is brave, scared or as time wears on dangerously gaunt, Brody delivers the Oscar winning turn that seemingly set him up for an illustrious career that so far has sadly failed to eventuate. It's impossible to say with full assurance that it's Brody's fault completely that he has failed to get close creatively to what he delivered here in Polanski's effort or if it is filmmakers that have failed him in their material. Whatever the case may be regarding Brody's disappointing post-Pianist career there is no taking away from his ageless performance here in an ensemble that all play their parts to perfection from Frank Finlay as Szpilman's aging father through to Thomas Kretschmann's small but pivotal role as German captain Wilm Hosenfeld.<br/><br/>A heartening tale of survival, an indictment of the horrors of war and the evil within humanity, The Pianist is not always an easy watch but it's an important one. A truly stunning tale of the will to survive and a tension filled 2 and a half hours thanks to Polanski's no fuss professional turn behind camera, this is true life based storytelling at its finest and a worthy film to sit alongside other revered War based film classics.<br/><br/>5 bits of caramel out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

"ElMaruecan82","10","4","6","1 June 2012"," Less 'cinematic' yet more affecting than ""Schindler's List"" ...
","To think that I avoided ""The Pianist"" for about 10 years because I expected a new ""Schindler's List""! And I don't even mean that negatively.<br/><br/>I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while ""Life is Beautiful"" was a tragicomic fable and ""Sophie's Choice"" more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew ""The Pianist"" would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, ""The Pianist"" was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.<br/><br/>Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by ""The Pianist"" and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in ""Life is Beautiful"". Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.<br/><br/>First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. ""Schindler's List"" is a better directed film but ""The Pianist"" is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, ""The Pianist"" is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.<br/><br/>The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.<br/><br/>Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.<br/><br/>And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. ""Schindler's List"" might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while ""The Pianist"" is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.<br/><br/>Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, ""The Pianist"" shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. ""The Pianist"" reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.<br/><br/>And this is why ""The Pianist"" is more affecting than ""Schindler's List"", and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp."
"Steffi_P","9","4","6","5 April 2012"," ""That's what we have to believe""
","The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.<br/><br/>This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.<br/><br/>Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.<br/><br/>But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance."
"victorling8","Null","4","6","4 August 2011"," The Pianist: A Cinematic Masterpiece about an Inspirational Man
","The Pianist is about the Polish Jewish musician Wlad Spielzman, who struggles to survive the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto in World War II. The Nazis began by stripping the most basic rights of Jews, and became more malicious as the movie progressed. The Jews were later put into the Warsaw ghetto, where powerful scenes depict Jews lying dead in the streets and stronger people stealing food from weaker people just to survive. The Nazis took away the Jews' humanity, and the Warsaw ghetto followed the law of the jungle, where only the strongest survive.<br/><br/>From the Nazi revolution, Wlad Spielzman's reputation as local hero was swiftly reduced to a prisoner of war. He only survived from the kindness of his friends and his strangers. He doesn't have the heroic characteristics of seeking revenge against the Nazis for possibly murdering his family. Rather, he's a simple civilian who merely struggles to survive in the difficult Holocaust.<br/><br/>He relies on the music playing in his mind and channelling into his fingers to keep his sanity everyday he spent in hiding. His musical gift saved his life at the end of the movie, where the Nazi soldier spared his life because of the beautiful piano music he played.<br/><br/>The plot line in The Pianist is riveting, and Wlad Spielzman's story is truly inspiring. The Pianist is definitely a cinematic masterpiece, and is more than worthy of a 10/10 rating."

","I left ""Schindler's List"" haunted. I left ""Life is Beautiful"" incredibly sad. I left ""The Pianist"" bored and very, very sleepy.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the Holocaust isn't a worthy movie subject, but it's all been done before, and much better. There's not much to care about in ""The Pianist"". As told here, Vladek Szpielman's story isn't especially compelling or interesting. He survives the deprivation of the Warsaw ghetto, goes into hiding, endures more deprivation, then plays piano again. The end.<br/><br/>Szpielman seems strangely unaffected by the horror unfolding around him. He witnesses various atrocities, sees his family get deported, and watches 2 executions and a cremation, yet his facial expression never changes. He goes from starving before liberation to playing the piano on the radio afterward, with no explanation of what happened in between. And why does a man in hiding pull aside the curtains to watch a shooting outside?<br/><br/>I'm not afraid of a film where most of the action is internal (like ""The Hours""), but this film has almost none of that. We get no clues about what Szpielman thinks or how he feels about anything. ""Schindler's List"" and ""Life is Beautiful"" convey the horrors of he Holocaust much more effectively, including their effect on the survivors. ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" tells a much better story about life in hiding.<br/><br/>To those who say Holocaust movies are needed as long as there are Holocause deniers, I can only say this; there literally hundreds of Holocaust movies out there. If a small number of people are still denying the existence of the Holocaust, making another 100 movies isn't going to convince them."
"paul_imseih","1","70","196","8 February 2003"," Bland and Obscene
","So this film has won the Palme D'Or? I didn't see any reason why...<br/><br/>The film is well executed in its use of the usual Hollywood visual clichés, rendered in a more ""European"" style. A fusion of the worst of Hollywood and the worst of Europe. The result unfortunately is even less than the sum of its parts. <br/><br/>I am extremely concerned by the lack of any real ideas beneath the thin veneer of story. I felt that the film rubbed my nose in one awful even after the other while presenting only caricatures (or often no characterisation at all) of the participants and victims - especially the German characters. So we have caricatures versus caricatures, without a caricaturist's sense of humour or insight.<br/><br/>I found these caricatures quite obscene - they obscured the fact that the Germans who committed such atrocities were ordinary men and women - not merely evil-laughing ""monsters"". That European Jews who survived this period went on to murder and torture Palestinians and reproduce the exact same ghettos imposed on them for every year since 1945 is testament to that. I wonder if I'd win the Palme D'Or by switching the roles and making a film about the Israeli organised Chatila massacres or atrocities by the Israeli Army in the West Bank? <br/><br/>The result is that the real power of the film was completely lost in the process of presenting the facts of Szpilman's experience of that period. I found no insights in this movie - either into art/music nor the Holocaust, and certainly nothing about Szpilman. <br/><br/>Is it true to fact in its unrelenting depiction of atrocities committed? I didn't care anymore after 30 minutes. I am no historical revisionist so after the 4th violent atrocity in the first section, not only these acts, but the whole film became silly and patronising. <br/><br/>A far more unsettling and profound film about evil, art, personal responsibility and racism from this period is definitely István Szabó's ""Taking Sides"". It leaves Polanski's film far behind in every filmic and intellectual aspect.<br/><br/>The Holocaust compels us to think and act, even if entirely beyond comprehension. In this regard, Polanski's movie is both bland and abhorrent.<br/><br/>
And no, I don't mean that to be a complement."
"wallplanner","Null","7","13","15 January 2004"," not really a polanski fan but...
","From the opening moments of this movie Polanski layers on the symbolism with a trowel. Gunshots and bombs disrupt Szpilman's piano playing, they have to hide their money in his father's violin, the nazis throw their neighbour out the window for no reason god oh god will it never end- and  that's just the beginning. Once the Szpilman's move into the ghetto Polanksi dispenses with the trowel, grabs us by the back of our necks and suffocates us face down into the bewildering grimy b-movie that was the Jewish experience of the second world war. His characters step over dead bodies on the sidewalk, and weave their way through crowds of parent-less children and distraught wives. There is always someone crying or wailing in the background. The nazis are brutal and grotesque with inane grins on their faces as they commit bizarre atrocities. The ghetto is a constant nightmarish gotham but, unlike Spielberg, Polanski refuses to couch this in artistic black and white, instead forcing us to view it all in the cold light of day. The colours are muted yes, but this has nothing to do with lens filters and everything to do with the layers of dirt that cover the city- a literal reminder of the s*** they have to live under everyday. Under Polanski's direction, every aspect of daily life is an exaggerated contribution to ghetto hell, the soundtrack is turned up way loud so that even chewing food and eating gruel is an interruption to intellgent thought. Polanksi is unashamedly symbolic and why not- he's got a point to get across and by god he's going to force it to its absolute limit. This is a movie deliberately directed at the west-- Polanski redefines the horrors of the ghetto by giving his characters the hearty english accents of childhood classics like The Railway Children. By doing this, he forces the viewer to frame Polish Jews inside the gentle 'civilised' culture we associate with the educated British accent, rather than a Polish or Jewish accent which most western movie makers portray as, at best, lower class and at worst, comical. And in the middle of this chaos is the relentlessly transcendent Szpilman. But this is no heroic champion of the people, he doesn't run guns, or operate an underground railway, he saves no one's life except his own, he doesn't fight the Germans he runs from them. This is a man who is persecuted by everybody: ghetto-ised by the nazis, starved and left to die by a man who is supposed to help him, and then, eventually, abandoned by the world. He wanders through the surreal ruins of the town like a man on an alien planet. Unable to find food or water, limping, thin as a rake a bearded Jesus-like figure. He is the ultimate victim - frustratingly passive, seemingly unaware of the political, always watching from behind a curtain, only ever active when its almost too late, if at all, operating on instinctual levels of self-preservation that have nothing to do with skill or bravery and is ultimately self-centred. He is a mundane every-man who is, literally, yellow- his cowardlyness physically manifested as he suffers from jaundice.<br/><br/>So what makes us accept his salvation against the millions of others we know who died during WWII? Largely it's his phenomenal talent on the piano that gives him an excuse to bow out of the fight. His obsession with music gives him a voice even when he can't use it, and a way of escaping the muck of war. He spends his time in hiding imagining piano pieces rather than plotting revenge. Intelligent audiences today understand that vengeance is never simple, that every act of violence has a consequence, even if you're the good guy fighting the bad guys, nobody is ever completely bad or completely good.. In the end, his final saviour is a nazi soldier. We would never have believed this soldier's grace possible if it hadn't been for Spzilman's lack of hatred in the movie. Some might call him a wimp for his inability to fight the Germans, but it's his refusal to sink to the level of mindless fighter that leads to his salvation.<br/><br/>This is the first movie of Polanski's  that has managed to thoroughly pull me in- usually he doesn't do it for me at all, maybe because he's so deliberately unsubtle? Whatever it was that he did differently it worked this time- I was so involved- longing for Spzilman to do something, fight someone, or at least for god's sake find some food.  That beautiful, delicate, completely expressive encounter with the piano and the nazi somehow encompasses the point of the whole movie in a way I can't explain and don't fully understand. Polanksi takes us on a journey that peaks at the moment where it is the most gentle- very unusual and something that doesn't always work. But somehow, here, it does."

","The problem with making a holocaust film is that it's a subject that's been done before . Everyone from Steven Spielberg to ( Amazingly and somewhat hypocritically I say ) Vanessa Redgrave has made a film centering around the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry . I have a problem with this because it denigrates history to an extent . If people have to make a film featuring man's inhumanity to man as a reminder what does this say for the rest of humanity ? Can't the rest of humanity watch a documentary like SHOA or the Genocide episode of THE WORLD AT WAR ( My first introduction to The Holocaust ) or read a book of the accounts of Nazi mass murder ? Would it be too cynical to point out how well rewarded Holocaust movies are ? It's also noticeable how formulaic these type of movies are . We start at the beginning of the war and follow the protagonist's survival until they're liberated by the allies in 1945 <br/><br/>That said THE PIANIST does have merits of its own even though it doesn't really bring much to the table originality wise . Actually the food allegory is appropriate though slightly confusing . Early in the film we see the terrible conditions in the Warsaw ghetto as its Jewish population are effectively walled up from the rest of the city and left to die . Cut to a restaurant interior as Wladyslaw Szpilman entertains the guests by playing the piano as the patrons grow fat by gorging themselves on food , fine wine and cigarettes as their fellow Jews fall dead in the streets . With a little editing you might find yourself thinking this part was directed by David Irving instead of Roman Polanski ! One thing THE PIANIST does do well is include the apocryphal tale of the Jews discussing their fate at the hands of the Nazis with no one wanting to believe for a second that the lone voice stating the Nazis are deporting them to be murdered may in fact be talking the truth no matter how unbelievable and horrific the truth may be <br/><br/>Like I AM LEGEND the story suffers from the fact that the protagonist has no one to speak to for large portions of the narrative but there's so much incident on screen such as the Warsaw uprising it's not a major problem . You could make the point that Szpliman then becomes a spectator to Polish history rather than a character in his own right and you'd possibly be correct but these scenes are very well choreographed and filmed that it shouldn't be made as a criticism . There's also the introduction of "" A good German "" that we've seen before in films such as MUTTER'S COURAGE but Hosenfeld is so well drawn and acted by Thomas Kretschmann it's very difficult not to feel sorry for his fate <br/><br/>In truth THE PIANIST follows the usual structure of holocaust movies but unlike some movies of this particular genre certainly deserved much of the critical acclaim hoisted upon it . As can be expected it's not a feel good movie but is definitely a well made and acted story of human suffering and endurance"

","The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.<br/><br/>For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long.

"dbdumonteil","10","5","10","29 December 2005"," Spilzman? What a beautiful name for a pianist...
","In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.<br/><br/>To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).<br/><br/>The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.<br/><br/>The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...<br/><br/>Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell..."

","This movie is too long for what it depicts, one Jew's struggle to survive Nazi-occupied Warsaw during the second world war. The movie doesn't cover any new ground, the audience doesn't learn anything new. However, being a personal project for the director may account for its length. I hadn't planned to see it, because if you've seen one holocaust film, you've seen them all. And that is not in any way intended to minimize the horror of the mistreatment of the Jews, but how many times does a person need to see it reinacted to grasp the message? It happened, it was bad, we all need to do our part to see that nothing like that happens again. But I saw it for Adrien Brody, the hawkish actor who won the best actor Oscar for his performance. And, after seeing it, I believe it was deserved. The first hour of the movie established the setting and danger, the middle hour spends too much time showing the protagonist trying to survive, hiding in bombed-out buildings, scratching for food. We know it all happened, but if you show everything, the movie is 6 years long!!  <br/><br/>The movie starts with actual black and white film footage of 1939 Warsaw, and we see its residents leading normal lives for that period. Then, cut to the movie, the pianist is playing for a live radio broadcast when bombs or artillery shells begin to explode and all Jewish families begin their fights for survival. Forced to wear identifying arm bands, eventually they were banished to their own ghetto, then the trains came. <br/><br/>SPOILERS are contained in the rest of my comments, for my own recollection, please read no further. The last half hour of the movie pulls everything together. The pianist is helped by a German soldier who discovers him, has him play piano for him, then secretly brings him food as the war winds down. When the Russians finally come to Warsaw, the few remaining Jews are out of danger, the Germans are imprisoned, and eventually the pianist is playing again for the radio, and the final scene is his playing a concert before a live audience. The pianist was a real person, this movie is a true story based on his book."

","Haunting adaptation based on the life of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by surprise Oscar-winner Adrien Brody), a somewhat sheltered young man who just takes life as it comes to him and of course has an uncanny knack for playing the piano. Timing is bad though for the titled character as the Nazi occupation of Poland is imminent and exile to death camps is a definite possibility. Brody and his family (parents Maureen Lipman and Frank Finley and siblings Ed Stoppard, Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) quickly realize that things are going from bad to worse as life starts to spin out of control. Instructions in the newspaper foreshadow future hardships as the Star of David patches are demanded of all Jewish peoples to wear and then the dreaded ghettos follow. The film then becomes heart-wrenching, but a change occurs that allows Brody to be spared from the death camps. Now he must try to avoid the Nazi Regime and find an unbending will to survive against all odds. Help does come from fellow Jews and non-Nazi Germans. Emilia Fox makes a lasting impression as a woman that Brody falls in love with early on and then shows up again later in an important part. Thomas Kretschmann also stands out as a Nazi officer who has a change of heart during the film's latter moments (he is also linked to Brody because of his love for the piano). ""The Pianist"" is a film that fashions itself after Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". This production is better in spots than the earlier movie, but as a whole it is not quite as impressive. ""The Pianist"" has a more exact focus and ends up being more of a one-man showcase for Brody in its second half. ""Cast Away"" meets the Holocaust would probably be the way to describe ""The Pianist"" when all is said and done. A brilliant adapted screenplay by Oscar-winner Ronald Harwood brings the novel to life. Roman Polanski finally struck Oscar gold for his unbelievable direction here (his work is on par with Scorsese's in ""Gangs of New York"" for the most part). He quietly became the oldest winner ever in the Academy's history in that particular category. All the supporters have well-calculated parts, but Brody's character is the most dominant of course. However, Brody never does reach the level of Liam Neeson in ""Schindler's List"" or even past Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". In fact his character is not near as complicated as the film would like. He is trying to survive and his motivation is life. A case can be made quite easily for either Daniel Day-Lewis in ""Gangs of New York"" or Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" to have taken home the Best Actor Oscar instead, but that is in the past now (it is better not to go into Brody's acceptance speech at all). Also Brody did very little playing of the piano himself (he had a double for the much more difficult pieces) which pales him to past Oscar winners like Holly Hunter (""The Piano"") and Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""). Overall I do think ""The Pianist"" is an excellent film. I do think it is one of the stronger screenplay- and direction-driven films of recent memory. Polanski ends up being the real star here and it is his vision, tone, ability and film-making skill that does make ""The Pianist"" one of the best movies of 2002. 5 stars out of 5."

","Heavy subject matter frightens people. Few dared say an unkind word about Philadelphia (AIDS!) when it first came out, regardless of the fact that it was dreadful. Folks seem similarly reluctant to find fault with The Pianist (The Holocaust!), though it's a far superior film.<br/><br/>Being a survivor himself, Polanski is to be applauded for his clear-eyed depiction of life and death in the Jewish ghetto, but his matter-of-factness had a curiously distancing effect on me. I felt uninvolved. It was also a brave move to omit subtitles from the German dialogue, but getting the gist of what is being said is not the same as understanding and once more I felt left out.<br/><br/>Further, many of the events leading to changes in Szpilman's situation remain unclear. On other occasions, Polanski labours his point and I just wanted him to move on to the next episode. He's a very good director, but he won the Oscar amidst a very weak field (and I include Scorsese's work on Gangs Of New York) - remember that this is the same body of people that anointed Ron Howard 'best director' a year previously.<br/><br/>Impressive at times, but uneven and occasionally sluggish and frustrating."

","Hollywood will never know what a favor it has done to Polanski by making him persona non grata. The Pianist can best be commented on by what it is not---it is not a Hollywood movie, that is, it does not have starving people having romantic box office sex. It does not, in spite of horrifying atrocities, portray all Nazis or Poles as evil, it does not portray all Jews as heylik. The Americans don't come in at the end handing out chewing gum and chocolates. It doesn't give a damn about the irrelevancy of someone having sex with a 13 year old. That's because it is not a Hollywood movie. It is right up there with Eisenstein and Bondarchuk and Kurosawa and Wajda."
"bigrab65","3","13","37","23 June 2003"," Vastly over-rated and highly simplistic
","With a rating of 95 percent at Rotten Tomatoes and a place in the top 50 at IMDB I was expecting this to be a challenging film about the Holocaust. This however was not it.  All this film says about the Holocaust was that life was tough then, little else.  This is a rather obvious truth for everyone except Holocaust deniers, so why spend two hours telling us this. The film has story that is much too conventional and one that unfortunately lacks any great meaning.<br/><br/>The depiction of the Germans is perhaps the most straightforward you are likely to see.  All you get is a bunch of stereotypical cinematic Nazis without any subtlety, until the final twenty minutes, when, SPOILER, Spillman runs into perhaps the only good German in all of Poland, if you go by the depiction of the Germans up to this point, who allows Spillman to escape.<br/><br/>This film simply alludes to some major questions instead of going into any depth.  It shows a Jewish character who was from a certain point of view helping the Nazis, yet we do not see why this character is doing what he is doing.  At least not in any depth.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable things about this film is that it is about a Pianist, someone you would expect would have a soul.  However, Spillman is simply a non-character which makes him being a pianist seem rather superfluous.  This, however like the rather brief reference to the Merchant of Venice seems to be Polanski's main tool in this film: to allude to things that are deep and worthwhile, while saying nothing of the sort himself.<br/><br/>A brief glimpse through some of the reviews will find that a lot of critics have a rather simplistic view of the Third Reich, which may explain why they liked this rather simplistic film.  One critic wrote that the Nazis were for barbarism and challenged everything that was beautiful and pure.  This in turn would lead them to oppose Spillman and his profession: the professional pianist.  This, however is not a rather simplistic view of the Nazi regime. The music that the Nazis opposed most strongly was modern music, in particularly the atonalism of the sort written by the great composer Schoenberg.  This music was viewed by the Nazis as being crude.  Hitler, himself was Wagner fanatic.  However, the issue of Wagner opens up a lot of major historical issues that I can't go into.  If, as some film critics are implying that this film is saying these things about the Third Reich, then I think this is a sad reflection of the intellectual state of modern critics. Although we may find The Third Reich totally repulsive we must not take the simplistic that it was a place where all great music was neglected, with the same being true for the Soviet Union.  These regimes had a particular view of what was great in music, and a lot of these composers, the German composers admired by the Nazis and the Russian composers who worked within the Soviet regime are greats in music.  The important thing to realise is that these regimes idealised music and other works of art and that is where the problem lies.  The thinking behind this was quite often quite complex, with thinkers such as Hegel leading the way. Personally, I thought that the film made no such comment on the Third Reich, but if it did I find little validity in it."
"CinemaClown","Null","4","8","1 May 2011"," Cinema is his Passion. The Pianist is his Masterpiece.
","Helmed by a Holocaust survivor himself yet presenting an objective take on the disturbing subject matter, The Pianist is the most personal film renowned director Roman Polanski has made in his decades-spanning career for it is crafted with meticulous care n attention, told with immaculate simplicity & also happens to feature one of cinema's most extraordinary performances.<br/><br/>Based on the memoir of the same name & set in Warsaw during the Second World War, The Pianist tells the story of Władysław Szpilman; a Polish-Jewish musician who after avoiding deportation to Nazi labour camps tries to elude capture by living in the ruins of his city. The plot details his miraculous survival against all odds which wouldn't have happened without the kindness of few compassionate humans.<br/><br/>Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist does bring back the horrors of the Holocaust and never shies away from depicting the barbaric treatment millions of Jews underwent during Nazi occupation. But it's not a tale about someone who caused an uprising or put his life on the line to save others but through one person, it tries to capture what most people under same circumstances were trying to do: survive, no matter what it takes.<br/><br/>Polanski does manage to infuse his own history into the story but never lets that distract his own vision for the picture at hand, and there in lies the true beauty of this survival story. It's arguably the finest film that he's made & certainly the most artistic. Adding more strength to the feature is the brilliantly-written screenplay that keeps the focus on our protagonist at all times & resonates the brutality that millions underwent through his own life story.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, every single element only ends up enhancing the entire experience. Production Design team does a superb job in recreating the war-torn city & set pieces are refined to smallest of details. Cinematography makes impeccable use of camera in capturing every frame plus the cold colour temperature encapsulates the whole film with a bleak mood. Editing paces its 149 minutes of runtime with precision. And classical music is beautifully incorporated into the narrative.<br/><br/>Another thing that seals the destiny of The Pianist is the exceptional performance by Adrien Brody in the role of Władysław Szpilman that simply exceeded every expectation. Perfectly capturing not just the feeling of hopelessness, loneliness, grief & living under constant fear but also the desperation, survival instinct & passion for music, what Brody delivers here is one of cinema's most memorable performances that still ranks as his best and his Academy Award win for this role was deserving in every manner.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Pianist marks the career high moment for Roman Polanski & Adrien Brody, is an emotionally devastating & powerfully moving cinema that's worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far, and is amongst the finest examples of historical drama in existence. It certainly isn't going to be an easy sit for most but you'll be a better person for having done because some films, no matter how difficult, deserve to be viewed, and Roman Polanski's magnum opus is definitely one of those cinematic treasures. Strongly recommended."
"diane-34","10","4","8","12 March 2005"," I feel dumb that I did not watch this brilliant film earlier.
","Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.<br/><br/>Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen. <br/><br/>Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received."
"zetes","8","4","8","6 July 2003"," Good, but imdb voters are overrating it
","The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.<br/><br/>I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10."
"ml8878","8","6","14","21 May 2005"," ""...10 minutes into the film, I was captivated.""
","""Crap, I rented the History Channel."" That was my initial reaction when I was met with a 20 second long, low-detailed, roll-footage type introduction to The Pianist. I knew I didn't need another lecture on the ""horrific Nazi death camps"" and one more dull lesson on World War II weaved into what Hollywood puts out as a ""movie."" However, about 10 minutes into the film, I was captivated. As the story began to unfold the life of a large and happy Jewish family living in Warsaw at the beginning of World War II, I started to see traces of genius in Polanski's newest creation.<br/><br/>For one, each character had a personality so tangible that the viewers can point out resemblances in their own personal lives. This had a stunning impact on me. It just isn't the same when a story is always about that ""someone else."" However, Polanski did an awesome job in making that ""someone else"" personal. One of my own favorite characters was Henryk (played by Ed Stoppard), the brother of the ""pianist"" (Wladek Szpilman-played by Adrien Brody), who had a stubborn, intellectual, street-smart whim to him that I can identify in a few of my own friends. Of course, Brody was a great actor as well. His passive, stoic response flowed from a seemingly natural-born personality that was so fitting to his character. His personality was never out of place or awkward but well-blended into the climate set by Polanski.<br/><br/>Secondly, the director had an excellent charm with the mood of the cinematic. It's interesting to point out that the sky had nearly always been dark and dreary. The clouds and the overall attitude of the film were grey and overcast. They resembled harbingers of a coming storm. It was symbolic, and also foreshadows the coming doom that few people expected and even fewer had hoped to avoid. Polanski, himself a Pole who escaped the grips of death in the camps, spared few shades of darkness in painting the Nazis. Next, it must be noted that Polanski was a master at contrasting mood. A tragically horrifying scene could be followed by a scene with Wladek playing the piano beautifully in a bustling restaurant. By doing this, Polanski noticeably heightens the blow of the calamity and as a result, made the movie so much more spectacular.<br/><br/>Also helping to set the sinister mood was the music, which was stunningly beautiful yet overwhelmingly poignant. From Chopin's ""Nocturne for Piano in C Sharp Minor"" at the very beginning to Chopin's ""Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise for Piano, Op. 22"" at the very end, the bittersweet sweet aura of the movie cannot exist without the music. One of the best classical soundtracks of the past years may be from this very movie. The piano genius, Szpilman, represented all the talents wasted away by Nazi rule. Lawyers, writers, politicians, and musicians alike were the subjects of those mass graves and human ovens, and the trills of the keys made it so real, so heartfelt. It was something one needs to experience to know the truth of.<br/><br/>I encountered only a few moments of discontent when watching this movie. One of them was that some of the characters seemed quite random and generally impromptu. Itzak Heller for example, the Jewish Police recruiter, seemed to appear out of nowhere, yet the family speaks of him as if he was an old friend. Other parts of the story I felt needed a little bit more elaboration as well. What annoyed me the most was that the director seemed to part with the rest of the family in the middle of the film without ever mentioning them again. However, since this is not a spoiler, I have no need to go into the details.<br/><br/>No, I have yet to see a movie that is perfect in every aspect. Though in this human world of flaws and opinions differing from mine, I forfeit my dissatisfaction at the beginning of this film to admit that this has been one awesome experience. It has not only changed my view on Polanski as a director, but also the entire period of the Holocaust in general."

I'm not sure if Brody is a piano player, if he's not, then he may be the best actor I've ever seen. The viewer becomes invested in the characters of this film, but Brody is our guide through it all, and his character is the most developed of them all in this film. Others were scant where they could have been more full, maybe. The production quality, the settings, dismal depressing & terrifying scenes, all seemed nearly too real, one can easily lose themselves in this movie, immersing so fully it is nearly a shock when the ending comes & one is thrust back into the modern time and body. I had no idea this movie existed until today, nearly 10 years after its release. I watched it on a lark, not expecting anything of this level certainly.

From The Solid Direction Of Roman Polanski to the Flawless acting of Adrien Brody This Movie without a doubt can be called a Masterpiece. The Movie is based on The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who in the 1930s was considered one of the most accomplished Pianist. But the movie is not about his fame, Nor his Glory as a pianist. It's About A Polish Jew, who fought against all odds, Faced situations that he never even imagined and Finally Survived by losing almost everything and everyone he loved. It shows not only a tale of horrific surviving, but also the emotions that many people had to face and fight in order to live. It makes you wonder how people who really faced and Fought against those odd and lived, makes you ask yourself what would i do in that situation? The Cast is great, Whether it is a important character like Fox as Dorota or Minor character such as Ronan Vibert as Janina's Husband. But Adrian Broody Truly proved his worth as an actor in this film, i mean he was so into the character that he will make you believe that he really is Szpilman, He lost over 14 kilograms and developed a unusual body language for some scenes, and an actor of his level deserve much more recognition, but it's a fact that people nowadays prefer flash and looks over true art, however if you are one of those who can appreciate a true masterpiece you must have a look at ""The Pianist"""

","It takes a lot of guts to make a film about arguably the most tragic event in human history. The director must put the film together with care and respect towards those depicted in the film. The writer must pay attention to the details of the events and bring them across in the most respectful nature without exploiting the events for cinematic gain. The actors must have the utmost care for the characters they portray in order to properly tell such a tragic story. Roman Polanski's The Pianist hits all these marks. The film is adapted from the memoirs of a famed Polish Jewish pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. It chronicles the events of the Jewish exile into the Polish ghettos and their eventual relocation to the concentration camps. Szpilman, however, was not taken to a concentration camp and had to spend months hiding out from the Germans as they destroyed Warsaw, Poland. It is a very difficult story to portray, as well as watch, making it a harrowing yet memorable piece of art.<br/><br/>I would never have known you could make such a despicable event such as this into such a glorious work of art. But Roman Polanski does it. He directs this film with such gracious beauty that shocks and mystifies the viewer. It is a film you can't take your eyes off of, no matter how much you want to. It is strange to call this such a beautiful film, but it is. It isn't beautiful in the sense that we often associate beauty with. It is beautiful in its portrayal of such tragic events through such a subtle and meticulous lens. Polanski directs every bit of this film with the utmost respect towards the subject matter. He stays so far away from making this an exploitation film and instead makes into into a work of art where the tragedy we witness on screen is almost hypnotic in its depiction.<br/><br/>And to add to the emotional brilliance of this film, Adrien Brody does a fantastic job as Szpilman. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award for best actor and it's not difficult to realize why. He goes through such an dramatic transformation throughout this film, both physical and mental. He begins as an esteemed Polish pianist who is very likable and very homely. He has a loving family and a great career. But as the destruction of Warsaw caves in around him, so does his whole life. When he is separated from his family he must look after nobody but himself. It is very difficult to watch his tragic physical and mental deterioration. You think he's lost it all until the end of the film when you realize just how much he retains. Szpilman is not a pianist just to add a different kind of aspect to the film. He is a pianist because this supports the entire idea of the film. He shows just how important music and art is to the world, even in such tragic times. His ability to play the piano so well saves his life, as well as renews it. It is a fascinating thing to think about, even though it is something very subtle in the film.<br/><br/>All this being said, The Pianist didn't strike as many emotional chords with me as I thought it would. I'm not sure why, but I was more mystified with the quality of the film, rather than emotionally moved by the events. They are undoubtedly tragic and still difficult to watch, but I didn't feel a lot of emotion boiling up inside of me while watching this film. I only felt a sincere amazement by how well the film was put together and how great Adrien Brody was. I am in no way saying this isn't an emotional film, but it just wasn't as striking to me as it would be to other people. I feel like more could have been done with this film, but at the same time I feel like there was just enough in this film to give it its consistent subtle beauty. I wasn't quite as drawn in by this film as I thought I would be, but it is undoubtedly excellent.<br/><br/>The Pianist is a beautiful film. I wasn't moved by it enough for it to earn a spot in one of my all time favorite films, but it is a film experience I will never forget. I will always remember just how well constructed this story was and how successfully beautiful of a film it was. This is an unforgettable film that shows what dramatic historical filmmaking is all about."

A Jewish pianist in Poland caught up in the horrors of World War II. The Nazis invade Poland, confine the Jews to ghettos then ship them off to concentration camps.<br/><br/>This an excellent look at the Holocaust through a Jewish man's eyes, but I can see how the violence could be upsetting to some viewers. The violence is heartbreaking and graphic with showing the widespread killing, beating and burning of Jews and others, which can unbearable to watch at times. It's still a very touching and poignant movie and a film that should be seen by everyone."
"colebt33-780-179547","9","2","3","25 September 2010"," The best of it's kind, and the best of Roman Polanski
","They say that the best story you can tell is a true story, and considering World War 2 is one of the greatest historic devastations of man kind, you can understand why there have been so many instalments about this tragic, dark time in human society. Until now, I always thought 'Schindler's List' (by Steven Spielberg) to be the best of the WWII films, but then I came across 'The Pianist', directed by the highly acclaimed Roman Polanksi. The creator of 'Chinatown' and 'Rosemary's Baby' has truly out done himself with this incredibly powerful, visually compelling piece about the Jewish ghetto in Warshaw.<br/><br/>The Pianist follows the story of piano player Wlad Spielzman and his constant struggle for survival in the German occupied city of Warshaw, which I have already mentioned. What started out as few new rules (the wearing of arm bands, the saluting of passing German officers on the sidewalk), became a vast series of evacuation orders, transporting, herding, and holding Jewish people as if they were animals. After managing to escape the latest ship out, Spielzman flees to the dead, empty roads and streets of Warshaw, living off only the kindness of strangers.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie is that the main lead is neither a hero, or a blood thirsty rebel our for revenge, he's an ordinary man who's just trying to stay alive. This I think allows the viewers to really relate to him in some way, making them really care about what happens to him as he wanders the streets of Warshaw desperately look for means of support, food and shelter. It also adds a sense of realism, because when I think about it, if I was in that same position, which I'm very thankful that I wasn't, I wouldn't speak out, or stand up against those who clearly have the power over my life. I would remain silent and still, because under these conditions, being brave is just another word for being stupid.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody's portrayal of a man who had his freedom, his livelihood, almost his whole life stolen away from him is so heart- breaking to watch, I'm very glad that he received an Academy Award for that performance (I was a little surprised when I found out that Adrien was the youngest person ever to receive an Academy Award, I mean 27 isn't that young is it?) Roman Polanksi's images of war do not focus as much on the spilling of blood as you may see in other modern war movies, however there were a few scenes of grittiness that added some dramatic effect. I personally enjoyed the pointless shooting of Jewish randoms, where they line up every marching Jew and take a bullet to the heads of a selection of those unlucky bunch. Steven Spielberg showed the same thing in ""Schindler's List"" and it had a considerably powerful essence to it. But back to my earlier point. ""The Pianist"" does not focus on bloody, visually enhanced images of war, but rather on the depriving treatment of the Jewish community. The insulting of not being able to sit on public benches, the demeaning humiliation forced by German soldiers for amusement, all add to the heartbreaking sense of helplessness which also creates more dramatic effect.<br/><br/>One of my most favourite parts of the movie is the end, or close to it anyway. The scene when the German soldier finds Spielzman in an abandoned house trying to open a can of pickles. After explaining his story and finding out that he is a pianist the soldier asks him to play something, just at top of his head. After a considerably long silence and a beautiful piano solo, the soldier spares his life and hides him in the attic, secretly supplying bread and jam to him. The most enjoyable thing about this scene is that it really reflects the symbolism of the pianist's extraordinary musical gift, because in a dark time such as this, music is the only pure thing that still remains, and in the end it is the thing that saves the pianist's life.<br/><br/>This is arguably the greatest of the WWII films. It's intelligent direction and efficiently powerful images are very hard to match and Adrien Brody made history with his wonderful portrayal of the deeply effecting piano player, Wlad Spielzman."

","Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.<br/><br/>There's a scene in ""The Pianist"" in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and ""clean out"" its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"lastliberal","9","2","3","28 May 2010"," It's an official decree, no Jews allowed in the parks.
","I have watched a lot of WWII films, but this is at the top of the list.<br/><br/>Don't take my word for it, it won three Oscars, and should have won Best Picture; it did win Best Picture at the BAFTA awards, along with a Best Director for Roman Polanski (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby). This is Polanski's finest film by far.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.<br/><br/>It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question. A man was so hungry that when his attempt to steal a woman's soup resulted in it falling to the ground, he fell to the ground and lapped it up.<br/><br/>Amidst all the carnage and deprivation, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) managed to survive until the end. An amazing story."
"Joyceva-1","9","2","3","23 June 2009"," Very disturbed
","I give this movie a 9. Now, perhaps it is because TP zoomed in on the struggles of one man instead of a nation, I found myself so disturbed I could not sleep. I have watched ""Shindlers List""5-6 times, but never was so shaken up emotionally or physically as I was when I watched The Pianist. Oh I saw it once, and that was enough for me. A wonderful movie, so sad, yet exhilarating at the end watching him play the piano with the sympthomy. A wonderful movie of the help of a few for one man, his dark hellish life during this time, yet living through it, a changed man, with raised scars that I am sure criss-crossed in and on his heart. Once was enough for me.. but am glad I finally saw the movie."
"johnnyboyz","8","2","3","5 May 2008"," Stupendous story told through an equally impressive film.
","That first scene where Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) plays in the recording suite, in Warsaw, for the Polish radio station sums up not only the entire film but Szpilman's dedication and attitude towards his music and his ability to play music. He is sitting there, live on air, as bombs rain down on the city before one hits the building he is in. People are starting to panic behind a soundproof window but it is a suspenseful panic because whilst we in the studio can see the panic and stress the disc jockey is going through, we are tantalisingly put on hold in terms of the horror of the attack. Then a bomb hits the studio room we're in and we wake up to what's happening, as does Szpilman. He must stop playing after previously continuing.<br/><br/>The next time Szpilman plays the piano in a war zone where his life is threatened will be the crescendo for not only the Second World Wartime journey of horror Szpilman must endure, but also for the last time danger is that close to him as is a piano. There are scenes in the film where he is so close to a piano and yet playing it would result in his quick demise; but he is strong enough and powerful enough to be able to remember the music and play on through his mind  that adds extra importance to that near-the-end wartime scene when he must play with 'danger' watching on.<br/><br/>The film begins and ends in Poland, during the Second World War and we are taken through the various stages of horror imposed by the invading Nazi Germans during their assault on most of mainland Europe. The film's opening third acts not too much like a documentary that might shovel the message: ""The Germans were evil people"" down our throats and not too much like an over the top experimental art film. I read that the film is European produced which should come as no surprise because its aesthetic is very much that of realism, the dominant European aesthetic. So we learn of one family's struggle through the days of the Nazi rule and the film presents us with a hierarchy of Nazi invoked violence. There are the initial scenes of humiliation as a man must walk in the gutter for the crime of being Jewish but there is also the equally awkward to watch as I'm sure it was to shoot scene at a cross roads when Jewish strangers must dance together. From here, the levels are cranked up further and further and it's not long before stone cold violence is being presented to us.<br/><br/>But The Pianist is much more than a realistic take on Polish struggles at this time with a few scenes inter-cut to show some atrocity. The film is a breath of fresh air and suggest to me that Roman Polanski has viewed previous Second World War film efforts and corrected them where he thinks corrections should be made. Not a fan of Saving Private Ryan for its lack of mentioning other Allies? Well, Polanski takes time out here for his characters to mention the British and the French over the radio they listen to. Squeamish enough to look away from heavy violence in Second World War films but maintain an interest in the subject anyway? Well here, Polanski shoots his action and his violence in such a way that just these scenes alone go a long way in helping label him an 'auteur'.<br/><br/>These scenes and shots are littered throughout the film and contain a certain point of view thinking behind them. For instance, when later on in the film there is guerrilla fighting between Germans and ghetto inhabitants, we always see the action from Szpilman's perspective that is to say the camera never cuts to ground level to show the violence or to try and sell it as entertainment. All we know is that one side is over there, one is over here and they fight; another touch being that for most of the time we do not see the rebels or where they shoot from but we do hear the gunfire. Likewise, when a German soldier is hit the camera never cuts to that level to confirm us the kill  everything is done in point of view format from the window and is kept that way. This gives a scene when Szpilman is actually on the ground level and close to a corpse of a woman he saw get shot a few days ago an extra bite because now we are closer to the kill, it is our first proper look at the result of a gunfight that has been and gone  our conscience and awareness catches up with us.<br/><br/>And this tactic is used by Polanski more than once. When a crippled Jew is thrown from his balcony, we see it from the Szpilman's window but when Jews are executed by way of the gun, we are helplessly trapped on that ground level and must witness the atrocity, partly because Szpilman is not there watching from afar in his home or from a window. The added disturbance for these kills is that the cripple cannot defend himself and the fact the officer must reload his gun  also notice how each Jew lying down has their own way of dealing with the inevitable: some keep their face down on the floor but others look ahead giving everything added tragedy. The Pianist works on many levels of storytelling and informs as well as shocks without relying on neatly plotted stories  it is a war fought between superpowers told from the point of view of someone who is not a superpower, and the result is brilliant."
"vladymirror","Null","2","3","29 August 2003"," powerful
","This is going to be a difficult review as difficult and disturbing the movie ""The Pianist"" was. Even though our world is saturated with crime and violence I still had close my eyes for some of the scenes in this movie. At one point I thought that it was too much. I have seen many, many movies about the WW2, but a have never seen violence in such a blunt way. One has to be in a lot of pain to be able to make such a movie, which is pretty much the case with Mr. Polanski.<br/><br/>The movie tells the true story of a man who survives the holocaust by pure chance, luck, stoicism, and the good will of few good people. Or maybe everything was just a fate. Don't expect to see a hero or fighter kind of story. No, he is just a man fighting for his own survival. This is not a thriller. <br/><br/>I knew that there would be a scene where the pianist is supposed to play for a German solder so I was looking forward to seeing it. I wanted to see the direction of the scene, the acting of them both (the pianist and the officer), and of course, hear the music. Well, it was a breathtaking experience. See it for yourself <br/><br/>P.S. At the end I think that the Russians a very much in debt to that genre-movies dealing with the WW2. They used to make such a great movies about the war, but not anymore. I think it is about time to see a high budget Russian WW2 movie, a film about those who carried out the entire war on their shoulders."
"kimba21","7","2","3","19 April 2003"," Excellent effects, authentic display of Nazi-violence, but lacks otherwise
","(no spoilers) This movie displays very detailed the cruelty and inhumane treatment particularly of Jews in Poland during the Nazi regime.  The special effects in the movie are as brilliant as you would expect them to be after having seen movies like Saving Private Ryan, for example.<br/><br/>However, when it comes to a logical and interesting story-line the movie really would not have suffered from improvements. I mean, displaying Nazi cruelties has been previously well shown in other WWII movies (Schindler's list for example) and alone it doesn't represent anything original and neither does it add up nicely to an interesting plot. Although it might have been very important to Polanski to stress the war crimes committed, a pure listing of horrifying events does surely not make a good movie, it rather fills you with disgust.<br/><br/>The pianist's love towards music, the emotions during the loss of beloved ones and during separation in addition to those horrifying scenes of cruelty and in general more plausible acting rather than a mere run-and-hide movie would have made this movie less boring (if you can describe horrifying scenes as boring).<br/><br/>During the first 45 minutes I wondered if I actually wanted to watch this movie at all.  Later in the movie I felt better, though.  In general, the movie shouldn't need to be that long."

","This is arguably the best Holocaust film ever made, second only to Schindler's List in my opinion - however they are quite different films, so I can see this being debatable as to which is the best. The Pianist follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew hiding from apartment to apartment within the heart of Germany. This is rather unique for Holocaust films since most Holocaust films take place within the concentration camps, but this film doesn't have a single scene in one.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody's performance is genuinely one of the best I've ever seen, seeing his body deteriorate on screen is difficult to watch as he struggles to survive, but makes it all the more immersive. The production design and sets are perfect in my opinion and also play a huge role in immersing the audience, I really felt as if I was in the heart of Nazi Germany watching this film. The direction and cinematography might be boring for some but I really loved Polanski's use of perspective in this film, many shots are set up from the perspective of Szpilman looking out his apartment window as gunfights occur down on the streets which I thought was a great artistic choice.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film enough, it's a must watch."

Some moments were so heavy that I was not even able to cry, I just simply suffered wathing the main character's misery. Another thing I noticed, and liked, in the film is that some Nazis (specially Captain Hosenfeld) were presented in a positive way that I have not seen in any movie about the WW2 before, it just proves that some of them contained humanity. Also, needless to say but I will say it anyway, the acting game was at a spectacular level.

","THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.<br/><br/>This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next. Things build to a suitably touching and poignant climax that doesn't disappoint."
"panchodh_12","8","1","1","20 July 2015"," Never again
","Soundtrack for this review: El pianista del gueto de Varsovia by Jorge Drexler<br/><br/>It is hard to review this movie. It is not easy to evaluate this movie in terms of its acting, its quality, its directing, with an armchair attitude that ignores the crudeness and harshness of real life. It is hard to say phrases like ""Roman Polanski, perhaps due to its own experience, captures perfectly the feeling of everyday life of Polish Jews during the Second World War, its sadness and despair but also the tiny moments of hope"", however true that might be.<br/><br/>It is very hard to rate this just as a movie, and not as a reminder for the human race of what are we capable of. I'm often reluctant to watch Holocaust movies because I know beforehand that they will have very hard to digest moments, and they are almost an act of masochism, two hours of intense suffering. But they are necessary, they are real stories that urge to be told, and need to be heard so that they don't happen again.<br/><br/>In a world where islamophobic parties are winning votes in Europe, where Americans proudly wave a flag that is the symbol of slavery in front of their president, these movies are indispensable. We cannot allow ourselves to fall into the collective madness that Germany fell into between 1933 and 1945. We should have learnt by now that technology has allowed the State to mobilize way too many resources, and the extermination of an entire group of people is only a button away. Not to mention the fact that these things still happen in more remote corners of the world, where they don't destabilize global geopolitics. <br/><br/>So it would be too frivolous from my side to evaluate Polanski's direction or Brody's acting, as if this was fiction. The feeling I have after having watched The Pianist is not the one of a film critic that passively observes reality from behind his desk, but an active one, the imperative of making sure that nothing like this ever happens again."

Suddenly, a great shot from tank try to break the whole building and hurt the main character of the movie. Just, what a great opening for such a reality-based-movie.<br/><br/>The overcoming story just a very real experience from Wladyslaw Szpilman himself, and some from Roman Polanski, the director. Every detail of each screen is from an actual event, and the movie is not exaggerating the fact. Like action movie that will expose one or two climax scenes, but this movie consistent with the fact. Some people may think this movie little bit boring, but actually that is the beauty of a realist movie, a realist movie. It is not a beauty of comedy or action, just the history way.<br/><br/>With a personal approach, this movie is nothing but a great deal of cinema experience. A war-view from an innocent and humble man, who try to survive in the era of crisis. The view, however, is like ""Grave of the Fireflies"", but the core of the movie is very different. There are sort of soul-power that will make Szpilman keep living, even in the starvation. And this kind of power make Szpilman keep playing his passion as a pianist.<br/><br/>But, overall this is a superb movie, not complicated, and enjoyable.

","Yes that may be an overstatement and I haven't seen Schindler's List yet. But still this is my favorite WWII even after seeing Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job of portraying the very talented Jewish piano player, Wladyslaw Szpilman. He starts out as a nice and honorable piano player for the local radio. But as the Nazis invade Poland his live gets more and more difficult. After numerous changes including armbands declaring their Jewish, confining them to a very small area, basically starving them.<br/><br/>He does what he can to survive and eventually get's taken away from his family which brings out this whole spree of bad luck for him. He works hard labor building a wall and gets beaten there. He gets outside of the dreaded wall and gets moved into an apartment. Complications eventually force him to move to a different one. Then the uprising of the Jews begins and he is forced to live in an abandoned hospital then in a destroyed town. He there meets a kind Nazi General who helps him. Until the Russians come in.<br/><br/>I think it's important to note Wladysaw's evolution in the movie. He starts out as, like I said before, an honorable guy. Then he starts becoming, as the Nazi's start cracking down, instead of a nice guy he becomes this food scrounging guy who has a limp and is desperate for anything. It's kind of comical and very sad at the end he has this can of vegetables that he carries around because its his only source of food. He holds it in a way which makes it seem like it's his baby.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the directing, acting, lighting, visuals, everything about this movie is great it explores the struggle to survive and the cruelty of man towards a certain race all because of a scapegoat. It is currently my favorite WWII and goes up there with the great WWII movies like, Saving Private Ryan."

","Perhaps my ""Summary"" is a joke because I have only seen 3 of Polanski's movies. Chinatown (9 out of 10) and Rosemary's Baby (7 out of 10) But The Pianist might as well be my favorite whether I have seen many of his films are not, for The Pianist is truly excellent. Sad but never boring or pretentious. Polanski seems to be a fan of bad (upsetting)endings so that left me worried to watch the end. I will not spoil it but watch every minute of this movie.

","I want to say the pianist, Spillman, forces commiseration and pathos throughout the whole movie. I don't think you can really finish this movie and not feel sorry for him. The last scenes with his family are so poignant, with just a few lines of dialogue, the director touched on the essence of saying good bye. His love of music, and not being able to play personally touches the audience. As music is his life and passion, not exercising that talent only drives sorrow to the extreme-degree. The look throughout all the scenes of the film express the dread of his character so clearly: the look of holding back tears and not giving up. This only adds to his dignity as someone trying to survive and bring the humanity out of others."

"RedRidz","9","1","1","28 August 2012"," Amazing, vivid and unforgettable Movie!
","What a fabulous movie! Very very touching and realistic. One of Adolf Hitler's first major foreign policy initiatives after coming to power was to sign a nonaggression pact with Poland in January 1934. Poland had received the former German provinces of West Prussia, Poznan, and Upper Silesia under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Britain and France deployed their force in poland. However, neither Britain nor France in 1938 was militarily prepared to fight a war against Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>During that time, people were in exigency and crisis. This film shows that exact situation. People were inconsequential. I saw how people endured the situation, how they were killed by Nazies . <br/><br/>Certainly I'm going to give this credit to Roman Polanski and Ronald Harwood for making this film so realistic. Haven't seen such a worst situation before this. What is crisis? You will come to know after watching this film. This film shows exactly how it was in real. <br/><br/>A poor hungry old man threw a bowl of food from being eaten by a poor woman. The poor old man licked the road in order to eat the food that came out of the bowl. The man was deranged though. This one is my best part of this movie. Another best part is, a young boy was selling caramel for 20 zlotys. A caramel for 20 zlotys! Can you believe this? Situation materialized it. Wladyslaw's father intended to buy a caramel. However, he had only 10 zlotys. So he collected other 10 from others around him. Worse part is, he divided the caramel into 6 pieces and distributed to other members of his family. Very very pathetic and regretful. There are so many tremendous moments that touched my heart but I can't mention them all simultaneously.I'm impressed seeing the survive of Wladyslaw.<br/><br/>Every film doesn't have a great ending, nevertheless this film has a great ending! Of course the Nazies were vanquished in the end."
"paintingariver","Null","1","1","14 August 2012"," Dark, epic and moving
","In this dark, epic and moving film, the suffering of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto is brought to life. Brody's performance, for which he won an Oscar, is breathtaking. With understated and fine-tuned acting, he portrays Władysław Szpilman, a talented Polish Jewish pianist who struggles to survive during the German occupation of Poland. The characters were very realistic, because they were not just good or bad--the Jews had mixed reactions toward the violence in the ghettos, the Poles helping the Jews escape had varying motives (some slightly dubious), a Nazi officer aided Szpilman near the end of the movie. The slow infiltration of anti-Semitism is portrayed realistically--first, Szpilman's family must wear stars of David on their arms, a seemingly harmless requirement. However, the Nazis' demands quickly escalate and soon the family is forced into the Warsaw ghetto. What began with a star on a coat sleeve culminates in Szpilman's family being taken to the ghetto, and then later to a concentration camp. My favorite scene is when Szpilman is confined to an empty apartment with a piano. Unable to make any noise, he sits down and runs his fingers along the keys as if playing. We hear the music, but see only his fingers making patterns across the keys. This scene is brilliantly directed and in a way symbolizes the Poland that Szpilman once knew, now forever changed by the Holocaust.<br/><br/>http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/"

","Had to be top achievement of Adrien Brody, and I never doubt the pinnacle of his performance for this. Set again the old ages of the 20th century this film made me recall Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" ringing in my head. It was as heartrending, fearful, expressive and disastrous as the characters of Spielberg's film experienced, though in a different view of course. This film again showed us the misery of innocent people experienced in the hands of vile Germany. But then it left me a room to think in my head that not everything of Germany is as vile as the mainstream thinks. It's the same lesson I picked when watching Schindler's List. And the suffering of the protagonist opened once more parts of life you never thought would happen to anyone. And there are so many things you would never thought of letting go or letting it happen before your eyes and conscience. Such burden and misfortune one has to carry just to survive, Adrien's character lived up to that. We saw it, the struggle and transformation. It was the beauty this film carried, no wonder that for me an Oscar is not ample enough to appreciate the brilliance of human experience excellently told to the mass.<br/><br/>Funny it is when my brother's girlfriend recommended me this film and after watching it, I can't get over it. I was even impressed to myself when I shared it to my officemate that she told me how vivid my recollections where. I can't explain it, but probably because of my craving for a beautiful story made me grasp the film in just one go. Just like ""Joyeux Noel"" an opposite of this film, though with same worldly issues and situations, strengthened my attachment to them.<br/><br/>There so much to tell about this film and I'm really looking forward for the book the film is based. There so much of the detail probably I've missed but the film is brilliant enough to compress those in my opinion."
"Desertman84","10","1","1","25 February 2012"," Polanski's Best Work In Years
","The Pianist is a 2002 biographical war film directed by Roman Polanski, starring Adrien Brody. It is an adaptation of the autobiography of the same name by Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman. <br/><br/>This downbeat drama based on the true story of a privileged musician who spent five years struggling against the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy Jewish family in Poland. The Szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in Warsaw which Wladyslaw shares with his mother and father, his sisters Halina and Regina, and his brother, Henryk. While Wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of German forces and Hitler's designs on Poland, they're convinced that the Nazis are a menace which will pass, and that England and France will step forward to aid Poland in the event of a real crisis. Wladyslaw's naïveté is shattered when a German bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. During the early stages of the Nazi occupation, as a respected artist, he still imagines himself above the danger, using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. But as the German grip tightens upon Poland, Wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. Refusing to face a certain death, Wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. However, when his benefactor goes missing, Wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another, desperate to avoid capture by German occupation troops. <br/><br/>It's Roman Polanski's strongest and most personally felt movie.It is the director's finest achievement, and elevates Adrien Brody (Oscar win for Best Actor 2002) to eminence in his representation of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.Well- acted and dramatically moving, The Pianist is Polanski's best work in years."

And it is a Polanski in which Adrien Brody is brilliant. For the art to discover each color of silent fight. For the strange occasions in which death is expected answer.

"Andrew30-225-545253","Null","1","1","1 December 2011"," How courage and hope prevails in the face of adversity
","Unfortunately, my review contains a spoiler. The Pianist took place when people were being killed because of their nationality, and it tells the story of how Germany carried out the hatred felt toward the Jews almost like Hiltler did in The Holocaust. It is amazing to think of how Roman Polanski must have felt as he produced this film due to the fact that he actually experienced some of the same horrors that are seen in this film. While viewing The Pianist, I got to feel the emotional pain and turmoil that Wladyslaw Szpilman played by Adrien Brody felt as he experienced the worst time of his life. The look of total despair, anguish and pain that grips the face of Wladyslaw throughout the movie makes it hard not to have empathy for his character. The film depicts the life of a man who has a passion for playing the piano watches his life unravel before him. Even though Wladyslaw was faced with various obstacles and life changing experiences he never lost his love for playing the piano. As Wladyslaw faces life's uncertainties, he can never forget his days of playing the piano. It is only through courage, endurance and tenacity that Wladyslaw Szpilman is able to become victorious against all odds. The heroic gestures of people willing to risk their own lives in hopes of saving someone else are the backbone of this gruesome film that takes place in Poland during a period when wars were on the rise. Some of the same social injustices that were prevalent back in the early 1900's still take place in various cultures around the world today which makes The Pianist such a magnificent film. People can relate to the different aspects of the film because of the humanness it portrays. The angle in which Adrien Brody's face was shot as he faced the worst years of his life when everyone and everything around him was becoming a figment of his imagination allowed me to sympathize and connect with the desolation and anguish he must have felt in the later part of his life. The lighting used to display Wladyslaw's fingers as he played his beloved piano allowed me to focus on how passionately he felt about what he does as he delicately strokes each key of the piano with such grace and poise. The piano that Wladyslaw loved so much helped his life gain new meaning as he triumphed over the agony and despair he endured in his life with great courage."
"MovieGuy109","10","1","1","25 November 2011"," Polanski's most rewarding masterpiece.
","After declining to direct Schindler's List due to personal reasons, Polanski set out direct a WWII survival story of his own. The Pianist lacks the narrative sweep of Schindler's List but has strong acting and personal direction. The film is beautifully crafted and original from other similar motion pictures. It distinguishes itself from Polanski's other masterpieces because it has the heart his films usually do not possess. It's just as haunting as his other movies but the beauty and sickness of humanity are contrasted in a way that not even Polanski has ever successfully done before. By far Adrien Brody's finest performance and probably Polanski's best film."

","Thanks to Roman Polanski for such a great movie. There are certain films where words not enough to describe how great they are. Certainly this one is one of those. The Pianist is one of the moving films I have ever seen recently. One can find almost anything in this movie. Love, death, torture, hope, faith, misery, passion and more. I am not yet sure what my true feelings are for this movie. It is not that kind of film where you can say you enjoyed watching it. But, definitely gives you a kind of shiver that touches the very deep part of your heart. Imagine having a rough journey of four years during the WWII where you experience both emotional and psychological tension.This is the part where the main character, Szpilman, becomes to shine. His true love of music is the only passion that keeps him alive. I admired him greatly. Such a hero with a profound human spirit. 10 out of 10."
"jkochoa4966","Null","1","1","26 July 2011"," Adrian Brody's Terrfic in this wartime Biopic
","This is an excellent movie/biography of a famed Jewish and Polish pianist during the occupation of Poland (specifically Warsaw) from 1939-45. Over the course of the filming Adrian Brody lost an astonishing amount of weight while he realistically portrayed a Jewish man that suffers horrific indignities while imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto. Roman Polanski the director spliced some incidents of his own childhood (as he lived in Krackau during the Nazi occupation) and those of the real Pianist, along with some other experiences of Poles and Jews in the Polish Ghettos at that same time. This picture was filmed in Poland in some of the oldest existing apartment blocks to provide some realism, and the movie relies very little on special effects during the German invasion or that of the Soviet/German fighting and destruction while the city was nearly destroyed. It was very interested to see real (although brief) footage and faces of Warsaw peacetime before the Sept 1 1939 invasion. No doubt many of those people did not survive the years of occupation, genocide and war and were the real people that this movie tries to portray. Thomas Kretchsmann is memorable as the real life German officer who has some interaction with Brody's character and was celebrated later in life for helping some Jews survive Nazi occupation."

I could not help but compare ThePianist to Schindler'sList, which i think is slightly better, as it has a more complete plot. ThePianist's plot is a bit thin; we get to see how the Jewish Pianist experiences the war years in Poland, chronologically. There's only a very thin connection between the things that happen and the fact that he's a pianist, which imho is not so satisfactory.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; it's a good, sad, movie: see it if you can."
"fred-287","Null","1","1","9 February 2003"," Polanski's Triumph
","Before this movie, the top two that I'd seen about World War II and specifically the Holocaust were Lina Wertmueller's ""Seven Beauties"" and the original ""Jacob the Liar"" from the former East Germany.  (I haven't seen ""Schindler's List."")  Now there's a third.  ""Pianist"" shares some traits with the others.  One is that the German characters are not purely evil, although they do many evil things.  Another is that the non-German characters are not purely saintly.  (In ""Jacob,"" the least sentimental and in my view the best of the three, there's a scene with some young kids being brats, as young kids often are in real life.  This makes their impending death that much more compelling, knowing they'll never get the chance to grow out of their brattiness.)  In addition, all three films focus on guys who are not soldiers or war heroes, in fact the protagonist of ""Beauties"" was a Mafioso.  They're just trying to survive, even in a world that's gone nuts, because ultimately, that's all there is: the next breath, and then the one after it.<br/><br/>The title character of the pianist has a comfortable life in prewar Warsaw and is so devoted to his musical career that when bombs start going off outside his recording studio, he's reluctant to quit playing.  We meet his family in their tastefully furnished home and see that they have as yet a dim notion of the realities of war, as they contemplate what to pack on the way to becoming refugees.  (One suspects Roman Polanski drew on his own background as well as that of the book by the real-life pianist.)  When they hear on the radio that Britain and France have declared war, they decide to stay put, naively assuming the foreign cavalry will come riding to the rescue.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the early part of the film is the gradualness of the hardships imposed upon this family.  First it's one thing and then another, over a period of time.  This lets us see how it's human nature to keep adjusting to new and deteriorating conditions, always hoping things will improve or at least not get any worse.  An example is when they learn they will have to wear Jewish armbands in public.  A few protest they won't do it.  Later we see the father out in public with his armband.  Later still, they all have one. It never gets referred to again.  It just becomes another unpleasant fact of life.  So by the time all the Jews in the city are ordered into a walled-off section, we see how they've been ""eased into"" it; had the Nazis decreed a ghetto from day one, that probably would've spurred an uprising.<br/><br/>Once in the ghetto, we see what anthropologists call a ""behavioral sink"" developing.  I found this the hardest part of the movie to take, even more so than the later battles and carnage.  It's not pleasant to watch kids dying in the street as adults walk past them, or to see a starving old man grab a bowl of gruel away from a starving old woman, then eat the spilled gruel off the street.  But these are realities that we don't usually get to see, even on CNN these days.  I don't know if Polanski has been accused of ""anti-Semitism"" but if he has been, it's probably due to these ghetto scenes, with some of the Jews living luxuriously (one guy in a cafe even orders the pianist to stop playing while he counts his money) while others starve, and some Jews working as police for the Nazis, and one character blaming their plight on American Jewish bankers not doing enough to get America into the war, etc.  But Polanski's point is that the Warsaw ghetto was a microcosm of human society in extreme conditions.  Sure they were oppressed because they were Jews but they suffered because they were human beings.  Polanski underlines this with a scene of a guy reading the famous Shylock speech in ""The Merchant of Venice.""  Fortunately such editorializing is kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>By the time the Jews are rounded up to be put on board the cattle car trains, they're so beaten down we see why they don't rise up and storm the guards (as one character suggests).  It would be pointless anyway, and there's still that next breath to take, and the next one. At the last minute the pianist gets yanked out of line by a semi-friendly Jewish cop; his family members get shoved into the train and he never sees them again, there's no time for tearful farewells.  For the remainder of the movie we see the pianist mostly hiding out.<br/><br/>The brilliance in this part is how rigidly Polanski sticks to the protagonist's point of view.  Whatever horrible things are occurring, we only see what he sees.  Some may be disappointed we don't see more of the armed uprising in the ghetto, for instance, which the pianist watches through the window of the hidden apartment he's occupying.  But it's crucial that this remain HIS story.  As we watch people getting killed at a distance, we even feel some relief we're not closer to it, which is how he must have felt.  Guilt, maybe, but definitely relief too.  There's still the next breath, and the one after that.<br/><br/>
POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS<br/><br/><br/><br/>
The narrative became a little disjointed in the movie's latter part; it wasn't always clear when things were occurring, or why, or who were all these various people in the pianist's life, but probably that was also deliberate, illustrating his state of mind as he became ever more detached from the events unfolding around him.  The pianist focusses on the essentials: food, and breathing.  His existence becomes almost purely reactive: if there's food, eat it; if there's danger, flee from it. Only the memory of his music reminds him of his personhood.  In a scene where he's secreted with a piano and advised to remain silent, I actually thought for a moment he was going to play it, but of course, the survival instict wins out.  Instead he plays a kind of ""air piano.""<br/><br/>Eventually the war comes right into his face in the form of a tank; there's great use of sound after a shell tears through a wall near him, I could actually feel my ears ringing.  He's back in the street, seemingly the only living person in an endless cityscape of blasted buildings.  In an abandoned hospital he finds a can of vegetables which he carries religiously for most of the rest of the movie.  Finally he finds an empty house that even has a piano in it---and lo and behold, a German officer regarding him quizzically. This was also a real-life character who helped the pianist survive.  In the movie it's not clear why, although we see a photo of the officer's family on his desk and he refers to God at one point; the actor is very good and subtle and I had no problem accepting what was occurring, but this was the only part of the movie with elements that reminded me of other movies, such as the ""good"" German in ""The Keep,"" or the scene in Ralph Bakshi's animated ""American Pop"" with the American playing piano for the dying German.  (I half expected the pianist in this movie to play ""Lilli Marlene"" or something for the officer.)  Another minor problem is that the introduction of this ""good German"" at the end draws our focus away from the pianist.  We start wondering what happened to the German after the war, and there are some onscreen words to tell us.  But I think it would have been better if the German had just come and gone, like everyone else over the course of the film.  It should have been another ""brick in the wall"" of the pianist's story of survival.<br/><br/>Many individual scenes stick in the memory; if I had to single one out, it would be when a German officer randomly pulls guys out of a group, has them lie down and then calmly walks along shooting each one in the head.  When he gets to the last guy, he has to reload.  While watching the doomed guy's face in his last few seconds I thought ""What the hell would I be thinking in his place?  Would I try a last desperate lunge, or just wait for the inevitable?""<br/><br/>Adrien Brody has to carry the movie and does an admirable job, especially in the early scenes when he has to grapple with an increasingly untenable situation.  Later on, the physicality of the role takes over somewhat, as he becomes gaunt, shaggy, shivering and dazed.  But at the end when he's back to a ""normal"" postwar life (or is it?) there's a residual sadness in his face as he plays.  Fine acting all around (the woman seeking her missing husband was just a little on the hokey side) but I wish a decision had been made about the accents, viz. ""Okay, in this movie English is actually Polish but we're going to use English accents.""   Fastidiously realistic sets and locations.  The black and white footage at the beginning included a statue then seen periodically throughout,  a nice anchoring touch.<br/><br/>
Definitely not a popcorn flick, no emotional surge at the end a la ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Should it matter to anyone that Mr. Szpilman survived the war and lived to a ripe old age?  (Would it matter if any one of us did?) One may even wonder what the point of it all was .... a question worth pondering as we seem to be on the way to another war ....<br/><br/>""Szpilman"" means ""player,"" for those wondering about the German officer's remark that it's a good name for a pianist."
"phiggins","Null","1","1","5 February 2003"," Wonderful and Terrible. SPOILER WARNING
","Roman Polanski's new movie, ""The Pianist"" is a truly gripping, devastating, heart-felt, unsentimental piece of work.  I urge you, if you have not seen it already, to do so before you read anything more about it (including this review).  You need to come to the film cold, as it were, knowing as little as possible in advance, so that its effect will be as powerful as possible. This is what I did.  I sat in the cinema, chatting quietly during the ads and trailers, preparing myself mentally for what I expected to be a reasonably harrowing but ultimately uplifting experience.  The film began. My initial reaction upon seeing Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay was a slight smirk and a minor panic: Oh God, brit thesps over-doing it.  Nothing is more horrifying than the sight of Brit thesps over-doing it.  Or so I thought. Because shortly after this panic there was more to concern me.  Firstly, the Brit thesps were not over-doing it at all.  They were instead giving subtle, measured, moving performances.  How bizarre. Secondly, about ten minutes into the film, a gang of  nazis stroll into an apartment and casually drop a man from his wheelchair out over the balcony and onto the street below. This is all shown from the point of view of our heroes in the apartment opposite.  It all takes place in one long, agonising, heart-stopping take. The entire cinema gasps in horror.  All of a sudden we realise just how grim and unflinching this film is going to be.  From then on, things get worse (if that is at all possible) with horror piled upon horror in the most matter-of-fact way.  Bodies lie in the street.  Citizens of the ghetto bicker with each other over scraps of food, spill the food and then lick it up off the floor in desperation.  Nazi thugs (as opposed to all the nazi non-thugs...) force Jews to dance, shoot them in the head whenever they feel like it, drive over their dead bodies, etc. etc.  Then, as The Pianist's family is locked into the train carriage never to be seen again (the door slamming shut  on their screams) he is alone in this insane world, suddenly forced to survive.  He is not a good or bad person.  He is certainly not a hero.  If anything he is rather selfish and introverted.  Which only makes this film more realistic and moving.  We find ourselves imagining what it would be like to be in his situation.  What would we do? There is no point mourning the loss of loved ones.  That won't help anyone.  Nor is there any point fighting.  The Warsaw uprising begins (the fight scenes here are startlingly believable) and then ends in a rout by the nazis.  The Pianist watches from his hiding place several storeys above the city.  He is a detached observer rather than a participant.  He is, perhaps, even a coward, running away from, rather than confronting the enemy.  While working on the building gang he does get involved in helping the resistance, but escapes before the fighting begins.  All the time we think: what would I do?  We would probably do the same: Hide, run, survive. Defiantly avoiding sentimentality at all points, Polanski is in full command of his material here. Adrien Brody as our ""hero"" is superb.  His transformation from elegant, attractive man about town to shivering, starving, desperate wreck is an amazing performance.  Towards the end, as he hangs on to his tin of what? Some sort of fruit? with pathetic determination, he is a terrible vision of a man reduced to almost nothing. But still there is the spark in his eyes, and of course, as luck would have it, there is a piano.  Which is what saves him. And there is a coat, which almost gets him killed.  ""Why the fucking coat?""  ""Because I'm cold."" Note, by the way, that the line is not, ""Because I'm f***ing cold"" which would have been a nice gag, but fake.  ""Because I'm cold"" is achingly sad and small and true.  Like I said, Polanski and his screen-writer (the inestimable Ronald Harwood) are in full command of their material.  There is not a single false move, not a single mistake.  The film is beautiful and cold and terrible and sad and genuinely great.  Unlike that other holocaust movie to which it will no doubt be compared, ""Schindler's List"", this is not at Oscar-Machine, but a moving and honest portrayal of human cruelty and desperation.

","The Pianist is a beautiful film in spite of the obvious bleak subject: the survival of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew during WWII in Warsaw. The film has much warmth - human spirit a-kindled behind it all. Adrien Brody is simply superb (almost surreal) in his true to life portrayal of Szpilman - tenacity and courage personified beyond reproach. We get to see a quieter side of Brody (Eric the war photo-journalist in Elie Chouraqui's ""Harrison's Flowers"" 2000, Sam the union organizer in Ken Loach's ""Bread and Roses"" 2000, Ritchie in Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" 1999) - an impressive, subdued performance all the way. Of course, director Roman Polanski is the sustaining unrelenting force throughout the entire 2 hrs. 28 mins. filmic journey. (In his interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, Brody mentioned that he was expected to lose 30 lbs. in weight to inhabit the lead role's emaciating period, besides prompted to diligently play Chopin on the piano for 6 months, 6 days a week.)<br/><br/>This is much more than just another Holocaust movie (neither ""Schindler's List"" or ""Sophie's Choice""). It's Polanski's own: he gave the film quite an emotionally restrained treatment, almost felt like a documentary with doses of stark photography, not without hints of poetry at times. Have patience, there is action, suspense, and you shall be rewarded towards last part of the film, with teardrops for sure. Actually, occasional smiles and a chuckle were afforded. It is taut human drama complete - even though we know of the outcome, we still worry and startle, relieve and sigh along with Brody's character at his brush with danger throughout the film. The audience is very much in the first person alone and lonely with Szpilman on the screen. And when joy arrives, it's truly touching.<br/><br/>The story is based on Szpilman's book (written 4 years after the war) with screenplay by Ronald Harwood (Cry the Beloved Country 1995, Mandela - TV 1987, The Dresser 1983.) The soundtrack included many Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) piano pieces: Nocturne, Ballade, Prelude, Waltz, Polonaise and Mazurka. Wojciech Kilar provided additional music, and Hervé de Luze on film editing - both have collaborated on Polanski's ""Ninth Gate, The"" 1999, and ""Death and the Maiden"" 1994. Cinematography by Pawel Edelman, who was in many film projects by Polish writer-director Andrzej Wajda. Production designer Allan Starski and costume designer Anna Sheppard were involved in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" 1993. It's worthwhile to visit the official Web site:  Kudos to everyone involved on this project - such integrity and strength, and to R.P. Productions, Focus Features (also distributed Todd Hayne's ""Far From Heaven"" 2002), and Studio Canal.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" truly deserved the Cannes Film Festival 2002 Palme d'Or award for the Best Feature film."

","Contains Spoilers.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski committed one of the cardinal sins of the film and entertainment industry: never revisit a topic if the ultimate contribution has already been made.<br/><br/>The ultimate holocaust movie is `Schindler's List'. Polanski's `The Pianist' falls way short of it in every respect.<br/><br/>The only way `The Pianist' could have made a difference (and covered new ground) is in explaining how the main characters, Szpilman, could life with the fact that while he was hiding, people died on his behalf.<br/><br/>He hid during the Nazi destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto. From his room, he could see his fellow Jews fight and die.<br/><br/>He hid during the Polish uprising just before the Red Army arrived. Polish resistance fighters died in front of his eyes.<br/><br/>People who hid him, died on his behalf. His helpers were caught, handed over to the Gestapo (WWII Secret German Police), tortured and killed.<br/><br/>So, how did Szpilman cope with this during and especially after the WWII?<br/><br/>Not even an attempt of an explanation is made by Polanski. In failing to do so, he has (in my opinion) completely missed the point of his own movie.<br/><br/>The result is an undistinguished Holocaust movie with all the usual trappings. Sorry, Mr. Polanski, but Mr. Spielberg has been there before and has done a lot better.<br/><br/>My advice - safe the movie ticket and borrow `Schindler's List' on video/DVD instead. If you feel like a depressing genocide movie in the first place, that is.<br/><br/>My rating 3 out of 10."

"erikgloor","3","12","36","29 January 2003"," I prefer GOOD films about the holocaust
","It's not that this is yet another film about the holocaust. Hard though they may be to watch, when you have one of the most horrific real-life nightmares perpetrated on a completely innocent community as you had in the Warsaw Ghetto situation, films will be made and should be made about it. This happened just 60 years ago, but it's right out of some dark ages tale of Vlad the Impaler or something -- innocents rounded up and slaughtered wholesale for no reason whatsoever -- just because they could be. Just to satisfy some twisted despot's profane sense of reality. If anything, more films should be made about the holocaust.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when films are made about this most sad episode of the 20th century, the tendency to celebrate each film equally understandably arises. No one wants to accidentally align themselves with the few warped minds who suggest it never happened or that it should have happened by saying anything bad about a film about the holocaust. But, in the hope of encouraging good films about the horror the Nazis inflicted, I will now attempt to do just that.<br/><br/>What I loathed about this film was that the Nazis were the most interesting part of it. Our hero is a nice man who plays the piano very well. There are some other nice people who help him. His family is nice. But even the most interesting act of benevolence in the picture is performed by a Nazi officer.<br/><br/>What was Polanski thinking? Story! Story! Story!<br/><br/>Beware, the following paragraph is a total *** SPOILER ***<br/><br/>Honest to God, here is the plot that unravels over two and a half mind-numbing hours: A Jewish piano player narrowly escapes when the Nazis take over Poland and evacuate all the Jews to death camps. He waits around doing very little in particular until the Russians come and ""liberate"" Poland. That's it. That's the entire plot. True though it may be, truth is not always stranger than fiction. Sometimes, it's downright boring. The truth, for example, is that I got out of bed this morning and came to work. True, yes. But dull, definitely.<br/><br/>This film is a total snoozerama! I kept waiting for our piano player to join the resistance and take out a few Nazis; or have an interesting relationship with one of his benefactors; or carve a piano into a hang-glider and fly to Allied territory. Something. Anything! Instead we are treated to long, long scenes of our hero fiddling about in empty apartments or sifting through rubble for a bite to eat or having rather ordinary conversations with his family or those who help him.<br/><br/>I mean, on some level, I get it -- he's the penultimate victim and survivor and artist; somehow immune to the violence because of the sublime expression in his fingers. But THAT is a half-hour short subject film AND NOT a two-and-a-half hour feature film. It just isn't. It's just damned rude to suggest otherwise.<br/><br/>Damned rude.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor"
"hopkins-9","1","21","72","13 March 2005"," Deceptive Title & Damaging to Jews' Psyche
","I went to see this movie expecting to see a film about music - that's what the name implies and what the posters promised. But it was not about music... it was about the Holocaust. I stayed and watched but only because one of my long-time friend's grandmother was clubbed to death on the streets of the Warsaw Ghetto (site of the movie) so there was a personal and painful connection.<br/><br/>I asked another friend, a young American Jew who lives in California, if the movie made him feel confident, outgoing and positive, or wary, uncertain, fearful, and negative. No surprise - it was the latter and how could it be otherwise? I would be hard pressed to think up a more effective means to screw up Jews' psyche than to produce a movie just like this one. I wonder if Roman Polanski was secretly and unknowingly financed by SDOPOAJ (Syrian Department of Psychological Operations Against Jews)<br/><br/>The problem with making people fearful, and that is what this movie does quite successfully, it that they become diminished. As Lord D'Abernon (1857-1941) said: ""The worst atrocities are probably committed by those who are most afraid"". I think that the Jews' oppression of the Palestinians may be rooted in the fear that Jews feel in their very souls... and this is being fanned, constantly it seems, by films like this one. <br/><br/>The world would be a better and kinder place if the Jews would stop wallowing in their victimization and move on to positive things where they are so well equipped to make big and positive contributions."

","Quite well-done, though it had nothing new to say. Same old, evil germans and the frightened innocent jews. What can I say? Yet another germans-killing-jews movie ... the only movie in this category that stood up somewhat lately was 'Amen'. There are quite a few slip-ups in this movie and given the extreme attitude of the germans I wonder how come the main character doesn't get killed (the only reason I can think for him staying alive is that HE IS If you haven't seen Schindler's List or La Vita E Bella or you're not familiar with history , The Pianist might pull a few tears from your eyes otherwise ... not.

","Some irony: every time a director attempts to be visually daring, the public doesn't accept it.  Scott tried in 'Blade Runner', Cameron in 'Abyss', Spielberg in 'Empire of the Sun', and Kubrick in 'Barry Lyndon'.  Why? Maybe because the scripts aren't accepted...<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>Here Polanski is visual in a different sense than these.  Spielberg is an emotion-control freak determined to manipulate our every reaction in order to make us accept his vision.  'Schindler' especially relied on this tactic; weaving images, emotions, and especially music together.<br/><br/>Polanski survived the Holocaust, so most detail stems from his memory and not imagination.  So, while Spielberg is a Hollywood Jew reminiscing on the Holocaust, Polanski is the real deal.  His impersonal method is intentional since reality doesn't have background musical cues to warn us about upcoming suspense.  Polanski's focus is also different from his Western brethren. Compare his visualization of the ghetto wall to what Spielberg did with the 'Jurassic Park' fence.  The emphasis is not on people, it's circumstance. Brody is keen to surviving in these circumstances after 'Thin Red Line'. The last time Spielberg tried this was 'Raiders'.<br/><br/>Here Polanski is darker than Spielberg.  Optimism is beat to death despite the loops the script takes into ""made-for-TV"" Land.  Compare the ""girl in the red dress"" in 'Schindler' to the ghetto-runner boy.  It's about comparing imagination to memory.'Training Day' had the same problems, but less insight into getting around them.<br/><br/>Film is music though the two art forms are different creatures.  Both rely on pacing, measure, and beat, but film has three dimensions to sort through. This is distant and impersonal, yet understanding.  Thus, Polanski shows he is more human than his Hollywood counterparts that want to amaze. On that note, this sorely deserved an Oscar for Best Sound.  Even if the music is ersatz, the sound design isn't.<br/><br/>Spielberg tried this movie earlier to lesser effect: it was called ""Empire of the Sun"".<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Learn from this..."

","Seeing the Pianist movie really bothered me, partly because 10 years after Schindler's List, it seems like so much less of a movie.  It's not groundbreaking.  The production quality isn't better.  The leading man acts with a deer-in-headlights expression.<br/><br/>But I was mostly bothered by the anti-hero Szpilman.  He's a selfish person, concerned only with his own survival.  Other people give him a lot of assistance, not because he deserves it, but because he's talented.  Is this good?  I don't know.  It seems good that the people of Poland risked and sacrificed much to protect a gifted musician through the Holocaust.  But I don't find Szpilman likable.  Especially after reading ""1952"" at the close of the movie -- I just wanted to bop him in the nose what a jerk.<br/><br/>It also bothers me that Hollywood -- or rather, the Academy -- seems to overreward piano playing characters.  Look at the movies the pianist, the piano, shine.  You want to win an oscar...play the piano!"

","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS<br/><br/>Why this movie was made ? What's so interesting in Szpilman's story ? Nothing . I really mean nothing . They could make this movie with original character and it wouldn't change a thing . <br/><br/>What's the point of the movie ? What's this movie is all about ? This is a story of one guy who survived war . That's it. The main hero is hardly a hero in any sense of that world . He's hardly a character. He's more like an object . Instrument that goes from one hands to another hands . This must be the most inactive hero in the history of the cinema . There isn't a single moment when he did something for others ( his family doesn't count). He's got no personality at all . The Oscar for Adrien Brody is a scandal . FOR WHAT ?! For one sad face through whole movie ?! He did convince me that he's a pianist . There's one good scene here when Szpilman ""plays"" on piano. It doesn't change the fact that ANYONE could play what Brody plays here . Even a guy from street like me. One of the most undeserved Oscars ever. The nomination for Oscar would be too much for his ""performance"".<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" wastes time to show us scenes of Nazi's killing Jews and destroying Warsaw . I'm sorry , but it takes much more to touch my heart than showing simply bad people doing bad things to good people . Also , since our hero is an empty character , then why should I care if he's struggling to survive ? I didn't care for him for a moment. In the end the entire movie seems pointless and empty.<br/><br/>There is a great Russian movie "" Sudba cheloveka"" from 1959 . It tells a story about a guy that lost everything during a war. Yet , he never give up . He kept helping other people when he could , even if it could cost him his life . It's a hunting movie about man that survived psychically and emotionally a nightmare of war . It's touching and strangely uplifting . Watch it and then watch Polanski's ""masterpiece"" and you should notice how empty and lacking heart ""The Pianist"" really is. <br/><br/>One more thing . Some people in Warsaw were against Szpilman , some were neutral , some helped him . It's sad that in the end the movie seems to tell us that a German officer was the person responsible for Szpilman's survival. Really ?! Another ""Good Nazi "" cliché in Hollywood movie ?! In the ending credits there is only note about what happened to that German officer after the war. There is no information about the Polish people who helped Szpilman . Why ? If there is no information about their post war life , the movie should inform us about it. In the end it seems that Szpilman didn't give a f*** about people who saved him . Talk about disrespect. The German officer didn't risk anything at all . The war was already over . The Polish people who helped Szpilman risked their lives and lives of their families. They should be mentioned here.<br/><br/>We shouldn't make movies about people like Szpilman . It's not a bad thing that he wanted to survive. Everybody wants to life . Still , there is no lesson for us – the audience from Szpilman's story. We should make movies about Irena Sendlerowa – true humans , true heroes.<br/><br/>I give ""The Pianist"" 2/10 , because of beautiful music (Chopin)."
"jon-1679","3","7","19","10 March 2008"," Mixed emotions...
","I have to say that I was left with very mixed emotions after watching this film. On the one hand, we have a supremely talented pianist, forced to endure what the vast majority of us will never have the misfortune to experience, surviving all the horrors of the Nazi regime; and on the other hand we have a man who is prepared to let his family go off to die while he runs away, leave his fellow Jews to fight with the Germans (while he runs away again) and allows everyone else to risk their lives in order to help him. <br/><br/>This man did nothing heroic to help himself, and certainly nothing heroic to help anyone else. His indifference to everyone apart from himself was almost unbearable. The only tears we ever saw were for himself towards the very end. No tears for his family, his friends, his people. The only emotion he ever showed was for Dorota, and let's not forget that her character was actually made up for this film, she was never in the book of his life. When you have to invent characters to try and help an audience to sympathise with someone then it speaks volumes.<br/><br/>Now, war does terrible things to people, so who am I to judge this man, but surely there are better stories from better people to tell than this one. Does this story justify a film being made, just because he was a good piano player? Is this a man that we can all look up to? I just don't get it.<br/><br/>I was left feeling that this man was something of a coward who only cared for himself. What exactly were they were trying to say with this film?"

","Sadly, The Pianist disappointed me in more ways than one. Adrian Brody did nothing worthwhile, other than save his own skin—and there's nothing wrong with that, I'm sure thousands of Jews did the same. The problem is, I don't care about them either. The Holocaust was a horrible, atrocious, sickening series of events which left millions dead, wounded and mentally scarred. We know this, and I don't mean to brush off anything or downplay the gravity of what occurred, but I've seen it all before.<br/><br/>There was some senseless killing of Jews, more senseless killing of Jews, liquidation and a salvation. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm sadly reminded that if an event is horrible enough, people will continue to laud and applaud movies made about it even if they have nothing new to say.<br/><br/>Call Brody's acting whatever lovely adjectives you want (minimalist, subdued, etc) but to me, it was bland and forgettable. Don't get me wrong, I think Brody is a tremendous actor, but in THIS movie, I didn't see a man who was scared, nor determined to fight for his life or to see things through, instead, I saw a man who was just going through the motions, ""whatever happens, happens"" in a way. He was neither brave nor memorable and certainly not relatable.<br/><br/>I didn't care about him, his family and in the end, none of the characters. And I didn't feel even the slightest hint of emotion. The only time I was even remotely roused was when Halina (I think her name was Halina) was reunited with the family after the second liquidation of the ghetto.<br/><br/>In the end, Pianist gives little more than a tired rehash of the same old same old. Things were badI know! But if you're going to make yet another Holocaust film, at least do it right, make it interesting, make it meaningful, make it SAY something. This said nothing more than, ""Look how bad things were."" In the end, his ability to play the piano saved his life, in a way, or it was merely a weary Nazi officer who showed him mercy.<br/><br/>If you want to see a real holocaust movie, one need only turn to Schindler's List. I felt, I mean *really* felt, the characters pain and emotional conflict. The book was incredible as well. It was well made and had an actual plot. Not just a broad story arc where nothing other than the ""usual"" happened.<br/><br/>-Just because it's a Holocaust film, doesn't automatically make it good."
"LydiaOLydia","4","4","9","25 August 2006"," A decent, but unspectacular Holocaust movie
","The Pianist is a by the numbers movie about the life and times of a pianist trying to live through the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. A beautiful musical score predictably results. The pianist himself is an altogether unsympathetic character - we want him to live because we don't want to be cruel, but otherwise we wouldn't have any particular attraction to this man. The movie itself is strictly, for the most part, paint by numbers. Nazis are bad, Jews are innocent yet determined survivors. Well, more to the point, Nazis are bad, though deep down inside they appreciate fine culture and some of them have good hearts. The Soviets, on the other hand, are uniformly bad and stupid, it seems.<br/><br/>The lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. However, the pivotal lessons of the Holocaust are not ""Nazis are bad Jews are innocent yet determined survivors."" Those sort of lessons are historical details along the lines of ""The Magna Carta was signed in 1066."" The real lessons of the Holocaust center around what happens when we stop looking at each other as human beings and start looking at each other as cartoons or stereotypes. This is a by the numbers movie specifically because it does what most movies do - it starts with existing cartoon/stereotype views and builds characters around them to tell a story. A better movie would have begun in that place, but then used the power and magic of film to challenge our preconceptions and our stereotypes to truly convey and reinforce a message of hope for humanity.<br/><br/>Your life will not be any poorer if you never see this movie, but you won't feel that you wasted your time, either, if you do. Certainly doesn't belong in the IMDb Top 250."

"Pedro_H","8","4","9","1 February 2005"," Important and fascinating piece of work that I was made for all the right reasons.
","Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.<br/><br/>Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a ""fat"" film. It has one main theme: ""self preservation"" in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.<br/><br/>The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.<br/><br/>The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series ""The World at War"" (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.<br/><br/>The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography."

","Having read a fair amount about the Warsaw Ghetto, this movie seemed to trivialize it to me. I know that I am not stating a popular opinion, but I found that this film, which put so little into character development and so much into plot, was a failure. *We already know the plot*. So what is the point of the film? Nothing, in my opinion, it adds nothing to what has already been established, and pales in comparison to reading memoirs from the people who were there. Even in terms of plot, there are jagged edges in this film and it is generally an unsmooth and uninteresting ride through material that has been covered ad infinitum by better writers. Rarely have I been this bored in a movie. The violence, I felt, was extremely Hollywood--it was meant to portray the evil Germans against the good Jews. Not that I am a Nazi, but such a ridiculous simplification annoys me. More interesting is how an entire nation (Germany) could allow this to happen--a point which goes entirely unaddressed as we watch three hours of another Jew in another awful situation. A member of the Einsatzgruppen who was killing the Jews was as much a person as Szpilman, with emotions and responses just like his.  The fact that they are destroying other humans does not mean that they themselves are not human, although this fact is ignored in this movie and others by portraying them as monsters.  Isn't there some psychological (and as a result, cinematic) ground to break here?  I feel that most people are familiar with the experience of the Jews--if we must revisit this part of history again, why not try it in a different way?  I hope I don't offend anyone with these comments, because I don't mean to marginalize the suffering that happened, but I feel that with distance we get clarity about a situation. Since no large group (to my limited knowledge of the world) still misunderstands the holocaust, this type of emotional drivel is pointless and gets the public riled up over something long dead, without adding anything new whatsoever."

","I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.<br/><br/>Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience. <br/><br/>The ""powerful"" elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery. <br/><br/>While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10"

In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust (of which there are many all-consuming portrayals of only a fraction of the stories which occurred). Brody puts in a marvellous and utterly touching performance as Szpilman. The story is abound with terribly moving vignettes which depict the emotional and cultural breakdown of Warsaw's persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them; the overall inability of the community to stand-up to the systematic destruction of their neighbours; the acceptance to wear the Star of David armband (the scene where his father is hit by Nazis and forced to walk in the gutter rather than on the pavement); the arrogant survivalist attitudes of the Jewish Sonderkomando-police force; the young Jewish boy profiteering from petty food-stocks in the ghetto holding area; and then the opportunists, like Szalas, who manipulate Jewish fugitives in hiding outside of the ghetto. <br/><br/>The relationship between Szpilman and Hosenfeld may seem to come into the story far later than expected – about three quarters of the way through – but it is nevertheless the right moment, arriving at the most vulnerable time for both characters – and Polanski creates nothing short of a masterful 'forbidden fruit' by way of coupling the pair, united in their passion for the piano, but whereby the discovery of their friendship would spell immediate death. Superb. It is both touching and a reality check when Hosenfeld offers Szpilman his great-coat, adding afterwards that he has another, warmer one for himself in a slight, yet perhaps ashamed, departure from his humane self and a return to his Nazi persona. The dark humour which later follows up this parting-scene – (Russian soldier: ""What's with the f*****g coat"", Szpilman : ""I'm cold"") – was a welcome piece of comic relief however bleak the subtext. The film's ending is with both deep sadness for the lives lost and destruction wrought, and, with a staunch optimism for the future. <br/><br/>In my opinion ""The Pianist"" is one of the greatest Holocaust films made. The horrors are not forced upon us in the face, but they are presented using the eyes of one man, hidden away from it, seeing it only as an escapee and we get an understanding of its emotional scale to a far greater extent as we are forced to think and hide with him."
"fred-houpt","10","3","6","27 June 2007"," Relentless, harrowing tale of survival
","There is a certain hallmark in a Polanski film and I have used the words ""relentless"" and ""harrowing"" out of respect and observation. Polanski often wields his art in challenging, aggressive and disturbing ways. Some have complained that his predilection to violence and blood are sometimes a bit much. However, though this film has all of that and then some, the sum of the parts is equal to the incredible story of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Having not heard of him before, the first time I saw this film I was shocked on many levels. As a Jew, of course, I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the screen as the details of Nazi brutality were presented like a hard slap on the face. As a pianist myself, I was stunned at how I had missed this mans story and amazed at how good he was as an artist.<br/><br/>There will always be comparisons made by critics when a so-called holocaust movie is made. People draw lines, in this case, to Schindler's List and other fine films. It is odd, isn't it, that Schindler's story took place in Crackow and this film in Warsaw and in each case we feel that humanity had reached the nadir point of misery. Of course that is not true: the death camps, where so many ended up, were the bottom of the pit. ""The Pianist"" shows us the story of the great Warsaw Jewish population and how it was rounded up, put to work, then obliterated or shipped to death camps. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising was one of the few occasions during the war when Jews rose up against the Nazi war machine. But let me return to the movie as such.<br/><br/>I have no doubts in my mind that the hand of fate came to protect Szpilman. The obvious philosophical question then becomes: why him and not his whole family? It's an impossible question when we ask it but the whole film begs the question. It is an imponderable conundrum but for me the hand of fate was as plain to see as anything. His survival comes in many flavors. He is aided by the hated ""capos"", the Jewish police in the ghetto. He is helped by artists in the Christian community who knew of his own fame and took enormous risks to help him as best they could. He was assisted by the Polish underground. Finally, in the most moving part of the film, he is aided in the most unexpected manner, by a high ranking German officer, who, upon discovering him hiding in a totally bombed out quarter of the city (we never know why the officer was there, seeing that the blocks and blocks of city were reduced to total rubble)....asks him to play the piano for him; incredibly he plays and to break your heart. The officer inexplicably has sympathy for him and provides him with food and in the end his own winter coat. Our emotions by this time are so overwrought with seeing what Szpilman had suffered that to see him saved yet again by a German soldier.....leaves us raw.<br/><br/>This film has the look and feel of what it must have been like, Polanski having taken pains to hold little back in terms of the brutality, random murder and deprivation of such huge numbers of people. Adrien Brody, what can you say of this performance? He is one of those rare number of actors who can say everything with their eyes. Giancarlo Gianini always does that. Brody often reduces his thoughts and feelings into wordless cries that pour out of his eyes; if you cannot feel moved to tears when he says nothing then you just don't have the receptors to pick it up. To say that his evocation of Szpilman was sensational is too weak a summary. Would that more actors could reach into their souls to pull together such depth, cinema would be graced with more masterpieces. This film is so powerful I doubt we have the ability to drink it all in in one go. So richly deserving of the 3 Oscars. Brodie's performance is so staggering, he will probably not eclipse it again. A monumental story of survival amidst mountains of death, destruction and heart break. A rare cinema event indeed."

","JAHM (Just Another Holocaust Movie).  It shows nothing new, it is no more realistic in its portrayal than many other movies (and nothing like as good as Schindler's list).  It shed no new light on the subject and compared to Schindler's list is dull, tedious, mediocre and plain boring.<br/><br/>It's redeeming features?  Good acting, reasonable characterization and a few snatches of beautiful music.  If you have never seen a holocaust movie then it will probably appear quite powerful and moving, but set against the best of them, it offers little.<br/><br/>One of the most overrated movies of 2002 and I am quite peeved I wasted my money on it."

","I found The Pianist to be terribly boring and tedious, and Adrien Brody's acting dull and uninspired. There was no character development at all, and Brody seemed to drift through the movie - though I think that was due to the direction, rather than his own acting capabilities. The settings were very nicely done though.<br/><br/>It was definitely far too long - you could have clipped an hour (from anywhere) and it would have made no difference to the story. Clipping 3 hours would have made for a much better movie. I strongly suspect that the awards it garnered were more for politically correct reasons than anything else."
"stephan-9","10","3","6","13 January 2003"," Honest Portrayal Of Szpilman's Complex and Horrible Situation
","Danger: Spoilers Ahead<br/><br/>
I had an opportunity to see The Pianist this weekend, and I must say, I thought it was excellent - more so than I had expected, and I generally appreciate both Adrien Brody (who plays Wladyslaw Szpilman) and Roman Polanski.<br/><br/>I've seen pretty much every WWII and Holocaust film ever made or subtitled in English, and The Pianist is quite possibly the best (in my mind better than my previous 3 favorites of this genre: Europa Europa, Life is Beautiful, and Schindler's List).  Have read pretty much every book on the subject I can find, also, I can say that The Pianist also strikes me as the most balanced and realistic portrayal of the situation - and indeed this may be a problem for some people.  (Like Schindler's List and Europa Europa, The Pianist is based on a true story - and I think it conveys this story more convincingly than either of those films).<br/><br/>What I think makes the Pianist such an excellent film is that it accepts the moral ambiguity of people on both sides, and makes obvious the fact that opportunism as much as ideology played a part in the actions of individuals on both sides.  One ""villian"" in the form of the Jewish Police officer also plays a beneficial part in the life of Szpilman.  The unexpected hero in the form of the sympathetic German Hosenfeld does not reap any reward for his good deeds.  Szpilman himself feels that perhaps he should have stood by his comrades more directly in various actions such as the Ghetto Uprising, and while everyone who has read about it thinks they understand ""survivor guilt"" Polanski and Brody do an excellent job of making you believe that Szpilman really feels it.<br/><br/>Some reviewers seem to have missed the point of the moral ambiguity, which I find disheartening.  They say that the good Jews help Szpilman out of sympathy, ideology, and comraderie, and the Gentiles out of opportunism, guilt, and only because he is a great pianist.  I felt that the film showed that both groups who helped Szpilman had reasons ranging through all of the above, and part of the truthfulness of the portrayal was that the ""moral divide"" was not so clear.<br/><br/>The scene with Hosenfeld, in particular, struck me as being indicative of the filmmakers' perspective on this. While many may believe that Hosenfeld doesn't kill Szpilman because he is a great pianist, the beginning of the scene, in which Hosenfeld questions Szpilman with no weapons drawn, calling none of his subordinates to him, and in a civil, human tone is indicative of the filmmakers' belief that this person's core beliefs have eaten through his indoctrination.  Hosenfeld has no reason, within the context of the Nazi system, to bother to find out anything about Szpilman, yet he does.  When Hosenfeld attempts to get out of the prison camp by saying he helped Szpilman, it seems a desperate attempt rather than one calculated during the time in which the tables were turned.  It becomes the undeserved punishment of someone who, for no reason other than his own character, performed good deeds in a terrible situation (which he helped to create, but which others of equal anonymity who went unpunished did more to create and less to counter).<br/><br/>Similarly, the moral ambiguity is amplified by the pragmatics of the situation.  When Szpilman's brother and sister choose to be with their family in ""relocation"", their actions read as ""morally correct"" but pragmatically quite stupid (as Szpilman himself comments).  It calls into question whether or not it is equally morally correct to save yourself in order to carry-on the struggle to save not just yourself, but what is left of the community, perhaps even to join with Partisans in a direct attempt to change the situation.  Szpilman recognizes the value of carrying on, but feels tremendous guilt about both abandoning his family and not joining in the Ghetto Uprising.<br/><br/>It is this moral complexity which makes The Pianist so compelling. It does not attempt to paint the picture in terms of ""Good Jews"" and ""Bad Germans"", but rather that both sides had their heroes, villians, and confused people who could be seen as both, and that not every good deed was rewarded or bad deed punished - which from my readings, and from the stories my grandmother has told me (such as my Grandfather's life being saved by a Ukranian SS officer), is much more honest and plays on-screen as more compelling and realistic. The film does this without overstating its point and falling into the trap wherein it tries to make Jews ""equally culpable"" for the Holocaust. Rather, it makes clear the morally complex situation into which people were thrown, and that each responded to it according to their own character.<br/><br/>
I think Szpilman would find this film an appropriate interpretation of his writing, and I recommend both the film and the book to anyone who is interested in such topics."

"bob the moo","Null","4","10","2 April 2006"," Far from cheerful viewing but an impacting and engaging film that helps keep history relevant
","Wladyslaw Szpilman is a musician living with his family in 1930's Warsaw. The rise of anti-Semitism starts to erode their civil liberties, making them have permits to work, requiring them to wear armbands that identify them as Jewish and generally treating them like second-class citizens and lesser people. This gradual slide becomes increasingly serious as all Jews are ordered into one small area of the city, where whole families are given flats with one or two small rooms to be shared among six or seven people. As the murders and control of the Jews continue, Szpilman is left to try and survive while the war rages across Europe.<br/><br/>I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema despite the Oscars and rave reviews simply because I could never get my head in the right space to spend my time on a subject that was never going to be an easy watch. With it coming onto television recently though I decided it was worth a look and easily got into it, which the emotional power of the story doing enough to carry it along for the duration. At times it does feel like watching war porn, as Polanski wheels out one more shocking atrocity after another and occasionally feels like he is involved in a game of one-upmanship with other Holocaust movies (so we don't just have a man thrown out a window, but a disabled old man thrown out a window). This was a bit of a problem for me because I wanted more to the film that just the horror shown to me. However the film does do more than that and generally does enough to be as impacting in the study of Szpilman as it is in just yet again reminding us of the terrible things done in Europe barely 60 years ago.<br/><br/>On both levels the film works while never being something you should try and watch expecting it to be a fun night in. Staying away from the front line of the war, the film focuses on the effects on the innocent, specifically Szpilman, who struggles to just stay alive. Up till this point the film had been a bit obvious, with bad things happening while the Szpilman's argue over what to do etc, with the film relying heavily on the shock and horror of what was happening. The rest of the film is more about him being left alone and hidden within Warsaw, which although slow is still impacting and engaging. At this point Brody also steps up and becomes much better than before, showing so much with just a horrified look but still containing enough of a character to be more than just our eyes. The rest of the cast are all good but generally it is Brody that carries the majority of the film. Polanski directs with a very good eye for the breakdown of this world and it looks totally of period and convincing.<br/><br/>Overall then, not a film to come to if you are hoping for a cheerful night in but one to watch to gain a wider appreciation of the atrocities that can so easily be allowed to take place. Ethnic cleansing and wars continue even as I sit writing these words so those that think this film is just an unnecessary wallow in past horrors would do well to take a minute and think. At times it could have been better but it is impossible to ignore the power of the story and the impact of the delivery."

","""The Pianist"" is one of the best movies i've ever seen.

The movie has it's gentle parts in which the main character Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) plays Chopin. But it also shows the horrors of the second world war. While Szpilman tries to save himself people around him are being killed and starved to death in the Warsaw ghetto, including his family. Adrien Brody, by the way, performs absolutely brilliant. Polanski confronts war, suffering, despair, hope and the choices of Wladyslaw Szpilman, which are based on the book and life of Szpilman, in this movie."
"tuningcourse","10","3","7","11 January 2005"," absolutely stunning
","Polanski, unlike any other filmmaker, has a way of getting into your very core and evoking unconcsious emotions that seem to manifest themselves for days after. The Pianist is the type of film that initially strikes one as powerful, but perhaps so much so that its core essence requires time to settle and be processed. As several days have passed, I find my focus of attention ever more on the film and the ingenious manner in which it was designed. Really, few words will do the film justice but if I may say visually stunning and existentially powerful, perhaps that may be a meager start. The film is less a story of the main character's nightmarish struggle for survival during the unspeakable occupation of the Nazis in Warsaw; it is a pure visual study of hell observed primarily through the character. My God, how Polanski orchestrates this feat of cinematic power is hard to discern but his consistency in doing so is nothing less than pure genius. From the character's hideaway in an abandoned flat and the brutality of German soldiers always occurring at a distance as a panoramic backdrop to the character is an element I've never really seen done on this type of scale. If I may say Polanski has succeeded in creating a new cinematic dynamic, that wouldn't be an exaggeration. In the present climate of Hollywood silliness and superficiality, The Pianist is a rare achievement that rates it among the best films of all time, if not for its incredible usage of technique, but for its utter message of human evil and the struggle for survival against that evil which we, as the present generation, must always remember and never forget. Go see it."
"philip_vanderveken","10","3","7","20 October 2004"," What's not to like about this movie?
","The marketing departments of the different production houses always know how to make a huge hype about a movie. That's why I always try not to see a movie immediately after it gets many international prizes. I don't want to be disappointed because my expectations were just too high.<br/><br/>For 'The Pianist' I didn't make an exception and I'm glad I didn't. I just saw it for the first time on DVD and I can only say that this is a true masterpiece. No, not because it got so many awards, neither because Roman Polanski directed it and certainly not because this is a movie about the Jews. I think this is a modern classic and a true masterpiece simply because I was blown away by the story! It shows how the Jews had to live in the ghetto with so many people on so little space, how the Nazi's randomly shot people and humiliated them, but also that not all Germans were such horrible pigs.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski made an authentic movie about what happened in the Jewish ghettos and he did an excellent job if you ask me. He didn't portray the war and the Jews the way Spielberg did with Schindler's list. He shows us what happened by following Wvadyslav Szpilman - a young and famous pianist - from the last days before the beginning of the war until the war is over. Don't expect any images from the concentration camps like you saw in Spielberg's movie. The complete story is situated in Warsaw - in the Jewish Ghetto and never leaves it. <br/><br/>Roman Polanski did not only create a great visual experience with this movie, it's the music that gives this film an extra and subtle, even poetical touch. There are many scenes of war and destruction, the special effects are very realistic and were never intended to glamorize the movie. Every scene is frightening and realistic, but it is the beautiful classical music that makes all the depicted horrors a little less hard to chew...<br/><br/>I can recommend this film to everybody and I'm convinced that every one should see this movie at least once. But I think that the people who are interested in the history of the Jews during the second world war will love this movie the most. I guess that everybody who saw Schindler's list and loved it will love this one as well and I just can't say which one of the two was the best. I rewarded this movie with a 10/10. Don't hesitate to watch it."

"DeeNine-2","10","3","7","8 January 2004"," Brilliant and ultimately redemptive
","It's hard to watch this film and not think of the situation in the Middle East today. What is worse, being stuffed into cattle cars and sent to death camps or being blown up by suicide bombers (or bulldozed by machines of steel)? For me the answer to this strangely relevant question is the former. I know that the old Jewish Defense League that I recall from my college days, whose slogan was something like, ""Never Again,"" would agree and so would most of the population of Israel. I think the terrorist Islamic groups ought to be required to view this film and/or some others like it on what happened to the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis so that they might have a better appreciation of why they will never be able to overrun Israel and why the United States continues to support Israel even while questioning some of Sharon's policies.<br/><br/>Director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. (The screenplay by Ronald Hardwood is based on Szpilman's memoir). Polanski spares us none of the brutality or the sadomasochism that is an inevitable interpretation of the events. He has the Jews meekly acquiesce to the increasingly horrific Nazi demands, and then has them just lie down when told to and accept a bullet through the skull.<br/><br/>(Actually the vast majority of the Jews were not shot, of course, since the bullets were too costly and needed elsewhere. Indeed, as long as I am doing an aside, the stupidity of the Nazis in wasting their resources in genocide contributed to their losing the war. Small irony. But of course that was a war they could not win anyway. If by some magic they could have gotten the Jews--especially Jewish physicists--to work for them, that would have been their only chance, which once again demonstrates the self-destructive nature of Hitler and his followers.)<br/><br/>Polanski shows us the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis and he even has a Jewish boy in the compound as they await the cattle cars selling candy at inflated prices, and then later a Nazi who talks to his Jewish workers about trading goods and says, rubbing his fingers together, ""That's what you're good at, isn't it?""<br/><br/>It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971), an entirely different sort of film, but one with a similar theme and some similar scenes as the Jews, this time Italian Jews, are loaded into the cattle cars. The experience in these films is always the same for me in at least one respect. I want so much to shout: ""Do something! Don't let it happen! Charge them with the sheer mass of your bodies, if nothing else. Better to die fighting than to die like cattle."" But of course I was not there. We think we know what we would do, but unless we are confronted with the actual situation, we don't know. And of course we have hindsight.<br/><br/>At one point, Szpilman and his brother are talking as they eat their thin soup and their bread. The brother tells him that the cattle cars are going to Treblinka but they return empty and that there are no cars containing food that go that way. He concludes, ""They are exterminating us.""<br/><br/>Polanski's point is that the Nazis were able to actually commit their ghastly mass murders (and the German populace to excuse them) because they had come to believe that Jews were not human and that they were only killing vermin. The Jews had been demonized, which is the first step toward genocide. We declare that our enemies are not human, and that allows us to kill them with moral impunity. I had a new thought while I watched this time, thinking: a respect for animals and a belief in animal rights might serve as a moral buffer so that when one group of people hate each other and begin to turn the other into animals, they will still have a step to go before they can begin the mass murders.<br/><br/>It is in the second half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself. Here the focus is entirely on Szpilman and his need to survive. The cinematography of the Warsaw streets, the apartments he lives in, the snow, the gray buildings, the people below in the streets, the hunger, the music that he hears in his mind but cannot play, the burned-out buildings, and then the scene in which the German officer says, ""Play something"" and he does. It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans. Note that the pianist has become in his beard and his persecution a Christ-like figure who never raised a hand against anyone. He is the Christ who turned the other cheek. And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him. This is Polanski's message and the reason he made the film. The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.<br/><br/>See this for Adrien Brody, who gave it everything he had, and then some. His performance will haunt you. Polanski's clear, Hollywood-like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly. See this because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"valy1111","5","4","11","8 June 2003"," A very lousy movie.(some spoilers)
","There are so many things that I don't know with what to start. I think I will begin with main character though. OK, Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a somewhat known pianist that was working at Warsaw radio station. But the war starts and everybody's life is about to change. Then the whole movie watches closely the main character during WW2. I have to say that the plot is practically inexistent in this movie. Szpilman never does something interesting, he doesn't try to help anyone, people are dying everywhere around him and he shows almost no emotion(he just watches). Fortunately there are several people who help him, otherwise he would have died too. You can't sympathize much with the character and there is no romance involved, no love story in this movie(though I think it's more real this way). Near the end Szpilman almost gets shot by russians that confused him with a german(because of the coat he was wearing). If they would have killed him that time that would have been really hilarious(but I guess he was lucky - those russians probably were not too good shooters since they missed in close range like that; perhaps if they were germans. :D).<br/><br/>Considering the times I can say that people were actually eating food almost all the time. In fact I have never seen before a movie that presented so many people eating. I remember what one of the characters said: `Food is more important then time.'. Well who can argue with that anyway ? The effect that it had on me is that I got hungry too. I'm not sure that this was was the intention, but that's what happened(the movie was quite lenghty too).<br/><br/>Is this movie is good at something then that is without question to present the atrocities of war. It shows people being humiliated, shot without reason, burned alive, beaten to death(even children !), run over with a truck, thrown out the window, blown to bits by a tank's cannon etc. If this is your thing you might need some kind of medical treatment.<br/><br/>Since most of the reviews end with a recommendation, I will make one too. I would like to recommend it but frankly I don't have for what. Weak interpretation of the main actor, boring script, though it has some very good piano music towards the end. My mark is 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>I apologize for any grammar/spelling mistakes made. English is not my native language.(IMDb spelling check is very good and helped me a lot to correct some of the mistakes). Ah, and one more thing in case you are confused: War is definitively not good."

I know, I shouldn't let my personal feelings about actors, directors, or Hollywood in general effect how I view a film, but it does sometimes. That didn't happen here.<br/><br/>Not only is the acting amazing, but the cinematography, the realistic sets, the physical appearance of Brody, the cruelty and disregard by the Nazis--it all made me feel like I was actually there. I was especially impressed with the technique of allowing us to see through the eyes of Szpilman. At times, I felt like I could feel his heartbeat and fear. It was so palpable that my wife couldn't watch the entire film. She had to leave because of the overwhelming emotions she was feeling.<br/><br/>It is so engaging. I highly recommend it."
"coldwaterpdh","10","2","4","21 October 2008"," Wow.
","""The Pianist"" was a breath of fresh air for me. It has been a long time since I've seen a film this refreshing. I regret not seeing it sooner and if you haven't seen it, I recommend doing so.<br/><br/>Painting a ultra-realistic portrait of one man's life during the darkest period in the 20th century, Polanski masterfully and easily shows what he can do with the right kind of brush I have always enjoyed his films; ""Rosemary's Baby"" being one of my all time favorite movies. But ""The Pianist"" is very different. It is quite serious and disturbing while not being gratuitous. The violence shown here is very sickening but it is never overly graphic. It is not exploitative, as it well shouldn't be. It is heart wrenching to say the least. Adrien Brody confidently commands the respect of the viewer in what has to be the role of his career. He definitely deserved the Oscar he got for this one.<br/><br/>In short, every human being alive should see this film. It is unbiased, extremely effective and completely genuine. I never doubted for a moment that Roman's heart wasn't in it. Totally timeless and classic. See it!!! <br/><br/>10 out of 10, kids."

","A realistic phenomenon through the eyes of a pianist to show how tough the world can be? Jew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman is the best pianist in whole of Poland and goes on to see unimaginable atrocities on him and his family by Germans. The scenes are realistic and the pace of movie is pretty steady but fluent and the whole effect does get upon the viewer. The end part was specially touching. It depicted that we remain the same old good and bad humans and Germans were no different. Probably, it's an excellent way to let the society feel the pain that humans can bring to one another. Adrien Brody has been on his lifetime best and let's all thank Roman Polanski for this creation. The spirit calls for introspections and resolve. We remain humans as long as humanity exists. Let's live up to it. Thanks for all."

","'The Pianist' is a very much a European film of the Holocaust: shot on location in Poland by a Polish director, French producers from a screenplay by an English writer, the film uses American (Adrian Brody), German (Thomas Kretchsmann) and English (Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emelia Fox)actors in the principal roles. These polyglot productions productions rarely work, yet 'The Pianist' is a rare exception. However, it never achieve the levels of cinematic tour de force that 'Schindler's List'did. Polanski's direction is restrained and often rather plain.<br/><br/>'The Pianist' of the title is Szpilsman (Brody), a middle class Polish Jew who plays concert music on Polish radio before the German invasion. The film is told through Szpilsman's eyes as his family are moved from their home into the Warsaw ghetto, then are deported to certain death at a concentration camp. Through the last minute actions of a friend - one of the Jewish police - Szpilsman is yanked from the row of people being herded onto the train and flees back into the Ghetto.<br/><br/>Later, he escapes the ghetto and lives, variously, in empty flats and an abandoned hospital, becoming a bearded, rather bizarre and solitary figure - like the last man alive in a post-holocaust world.<br/><br/>The budget restraints are evident in the film. The uprising in the Warswaw ghetto is seen entirely through the window of Szpilsman's flat and is represented by a handful of Germans firing at buildings and what looks like a few CGI shots of the burning ghetto. This is perhaps one of the flaws of Polanski's direction - it has no moment equally to the stunning clearing of the Cracow ghetto scene in 'Schindler's List'.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Brody is excellent in a demanding role as the increasingly isolated Szpilsman. Much of his role in the second half of the movie is wordless, and in one scene, he actually conveys an emotional release by miming playing the piano (later, he does it for real in the prescene of a sympathetic German officer - it is the first time in years he has played for real). There's no false 'watch-me' mannerisms of the method school here, and no sentimentality - so Brody's character seems all the more believable.<br/><br/>The other strength is Ronald Harwood's screenplay. Harwood underplays the Nazi barbarism - there are a few random executions and Szpilsman Senior is beaten up for walking on a pavement - to good effect. He also conveys the idea that music remains a civilizing influence even when around it looks like the world is ending. It keeps Szpilsman human when everything suggests he should be dehumanized by his experiences."

"Krome","8","2","4","8 August 2003"," A mirror to our own conscience
","Generally, I skim through the user comments on IMDB taking great pleasure in seeing what others have to say about the film I've just seen. Today, though, I feel astonished and disappointed by some of the things I've read.<br/><br/>
The holocaust occurred for many reasons; social, economic and political. However, what fuelled it was a colossal failure of the basic human qualities of compassion, empathy and understanding. It's a nauseating paradox, repeated throughout human history, that when people are regarded as fit only for slavery and destruction it is their persecutors who are made truly subhuman by their actions.<br/><br/>I'm not attempting to label the authors of some of the posts here as Nazis or fascists but I am deeply concerned that a film dealing with this issue can provoke such truly thoughtless comments. Of course, it's possible to accuse The Pianist of failing in its ambitions if it cannot convey to every viewer at least a fleeting sympathy with the characters. Perhaps, though, it succeeds by highlighting the lack of comprehension that makes obscenities like the Holocaust possible even today.<br/><br/>Maybe some people viewed the film as simply entertainment, in which case I can see why the plot or characterisation might not be to their liking. The Nazis just keep on behaving like thugs, the Jews sit there and take it and the central character doesn't finally go on a revenge killing-spree, liberating Warsaw single-handed. And getting the girl, of course. If you want formulaic movies with sympathetic heroes and a nice, untaxing storyline there are plenty to choose from. I just don't see how anyone could watch this film without understanding that it's about as close to the truth as it could be without passing into the realm of dramatised documentary. Yes, it is based on a true story and sorry - real life has a habit of occasionally deviating from the popcorn norm.<br/><br/>So, sorry to pick on the following. Genuinely, it's not personal - your comments are simply the most recent.<br/><br/>musidora - If you found it hard to relate to the selfishness of Szpilman perhaps you might consider that many, many Holocaust survivors report an ineradicable guilt, even in the face of all they endured, because they owed their own survival to putting themselves first. For example theft of food in concentration camps was common. What do you think you would do in the same situation if the price of your life, or your child's, were a crust of stolen bread?<br/><br/><br/><br/>kylan-1 - You wrote: `He just stands there with a dumb look on his face and fumbles around'   `So whats the big survival story here?'<br/><br/>
Seriously, if you were malnourished, cold and being used for slave labour do you think you'd be feeling chipper enough to be a modern-day Spartacus?<br/><br/><br/><br/>jmrex - You wrote: `How can anybody enjoy watching a chronicle of how lacking in spirit these people were? It sickens me.'<br/><br/>It really is hard to understand how a whole people can sometimes kneel before its oppressor, seemingly without putting up a fight. How can people be so passive in such extreme circumstances? How can they just stand by while their neighbour is murdered and quietly wait their turn? Well, the same thing happens every time the human race decides to turn on itself. From Poland to Cambodia to Rwanda you can see it repeated. Plainly, it's something that happens when a society is reduced to its component individuals and the moment of rebellion seems to each an impossibility. If anything is sickening here, it's your comment, jmrex. If you truly find the concept of human despair something inferior to you in some way then let's put another point on the scoreboard for the Nazis. If all you want to do is simply enjoy a film and leave it feeling better than when you entered the cinema then look for something different next time. The audience leaving the screening I saw were subdued and said their goodbyes to one another with choked voices. That doesn't make any of them better people than you but I think it shows a maturity that you haven't yet reached. I wish you well on your journey there - you'll find the view much better.<br/><br/>
Bhagwan Thadani  - You wrote: `The entire movie was so ""outre"" that I actually laughed when a German officer pulled out his Luger and shot a Jewess to death for asking ""Where are we going?"" How ridiculous can this myth of the Jew suffering at the hands of persecutors become?'<br/><br/>
Please tell me you're not serious. That you know this really went on. I simply cannot understand how anyone with even a passing knowledge of the Holocaust could really think this an exaggeration or regard it as a `myth.' Perhaps you should find the time to talk to some of the people whose families were reduced to a handful of individuals or even just a sole survivor. Maybe if you heard from someone who was there, still carrying the tattoo on their arm used to mark them like cattle, how their mothers, fathers, siblings and children were murdered you might begin to understand how woundingly misinformed you are. The Jews, gypsies, gays, dissidents and other victims of the Nazis were slaughtered both systematically and capriciously. If your life is worthless to someone with power over you then it is a matter of no consequence all to them to end it for the slightest reason.<br/><br/>While blindness to the suffering of others, whoever and wherever they may be, remains a part of the human condition the subjects of movies like The Pianist will be not only moving but a salutary warning. It could happen to any of us unless we appreciate the lessons history offers."

","""The Pianist"" is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional. The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict. ""The Pianist"" will play best with those who have not yet had their fill of Warsaw ghetto films. (B)"

"aritrabose-77061","Null","0","0","11 May 2020"," The Movie protrays the post WW2 scene so clearly
","The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.<br/><br/>The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.<br/><br/>There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later.<br/><br/>What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.<br/><br/>Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.<br/><br/>In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell."

"GranHotellover","7","0","0","6 May 2020"," The film serves a very simple purpose
","The film serves a very simple purpose, to show you that if you were a Jew in occupied Poland, every day you were grasping for survival. That the Nazi's took away the dignity of people gradually and got more brazen with killing them as time went on. Because of this very simple narrative some have given the film 1 star which I think is unfair. I have watched some unwatchable films with shaky cam, poor acting, editing etc. This was a pretty decent production with some great Direction not a 1 star film.<br/><br/>However I do have to wonder whether we have moved past this type of simple film. As someone interested in history I occasionally enjoy watching films around the war to see it from another perspective or to get further details that I did not know. The minute I saw Emila Fox's character look wide eyed and shocked at some restrictions, I looked up a timeline of antisemitism in Poland. Turns out like much of Europe antisemitism had been prominent in Poland way before the occupation. It can be dated back atleast a decade just from legal restrictions. From then on I doubted how much care had been put into accuracy. I am sure there is much to be learned from a first hand account that Wladyslaw Szpilman was able to provide in his autobiography but I can't help but think you would get more from reading his book in his words rather than this romanticised version.<br/><br/>It does tell a very simple story of Nazis were bad, Jews were victims and people that helped the Jews were good. However I do believe that this film would be a good introduction for some people to see the war in a more personal , emotive way as I think over time the young have distanced themselves from the atrocities to the point they easily joke about it. I could picture older children watching clips of this film to facilitate their engagement with the subject matter.<br/><br/>However for anyone interested in a beautifully shot epic, their are films on the war that are more visually interesting. For anyone who already knows details around the holocaust their are films that are more informative. Since the millennium I have seen a number of films that look at the war from less well known angles, they look at the Nanjing Massacre, Soviet atrocities while attention was on the Nazis and so on."

","Follows a Jewish pianist (Brody) trying to survive in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2.<br/><br/>A film broadly of 2 parts, the first covering the arrival of the nazis and its impact on the Jewish community most particularly Brody and his family. This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.<br/><br/>The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people.

How humans can be such animals to kill with no remorses, kill all those people with no any regrets, inhuman and devastating acts from nazi, the shame of the world!"

","I feel like I would've liked this more if I'd never seen a WWII movie or didn't understand before going into how horrible the period was for those involved. I did like it but I think I could've liked it more. It does a fantastic job of portraying how horrid the main character and other's descent into destitution was. It doesn't pull any punches. It treats the audience with respect. Brody's performance is great, mostly because of how much he is able to change throughout the film. I liked how (comparatively) lucky Brody's character kept getting throughout the movie because I thought it served as a commentary on how nearly-impossible it was for someone to survive in his shoes. I did feel as thought the film, as a whole, was missing something though I don't know how to say it without calling it boring, which it wasn't."

It's almost impossible and inhuman the way these Nazi's treated the Jewish people, almost as if they we're animals. That dancing scene was degrading. I love the way Polanski tackles this topic. It's almost like when you become used to the chaos like the dead body on the side of the pavement and everyone just kind of weaves around without thinking too much about the fact that it's a dead body since they're so used to it. He does an amazing job at painting it like a living nightmare. One in which everyone has learned to live in. As brutal and bleak as this movie is, Polanski always finds ways to sneak in a laugh or two and I love it. His approach is pretty cynical to the whole thing.

The film is based on the true story. They're were horrible events that actually happened in the Warsaw Ghetto. Warsaw today was built upon the ruins of World War II. Adrien Brody was well honored with an Academy Award. The supporting cast was excellent with Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman as his parents. Roman Polanski is the best person to direct a film about the Holocaust and even from his own experiences. This film is perhaps Polanski's best film and most personal of all."

","Roman Polanski's Holocaust film about the Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, is always going to draw comparisons to Schindler's List. And even though I believe that Spielberg's masterpiece is slightly better, these two pictures are actually quite different. They both depict the atrocities of the Holocaust but do it through the radically different experience of the each films protagonist. Getting back to the film at hand. The Pianist is raw, gripping, brutal and inspiring. Polanski holds nothing back, in showing the barbarity of the Nazi occupation and one man's astonishing tale of survival. Szpilman stayed alive through sheer luck, the kindness of others and determination. Adrien Brody's understated performance is matched by Polanski's expert direction and Ronald Harwood's poignant script. An important piece of work. Not to be missed."

"schroederagustavo","9","0","0","1 June 2019"," Powerful Story, Could Have Been Longer
","I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the film, in a sad, depressing kind of way. It's one of the best movies about the holocaust and although different than for example Schindler's List, The Pianist shifts the focus entirely to the lives of the Jews during WW2, instead of a say, the more broader scope that Schindler's List encompasses. Specifically, we follow Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous Jewish pianist played wonderfully by Adrien Brody. I think this movie does two things best: 1. Presenting the common stages of the holocaust victim: Denial, acceptance, survival. And 2. I think this movie did a great job in making the rhythm of the story feel natural, even though the time jumps are sometimes pretty large. Like, for example, there will be a scene of Wlad and his family being notified that they must all move to this area where all of the Jews in Krakow are going to live from now on, and how they must now wear a star of david (that they have to make themselves) to be branded. We are shown the family interactions and the emotions, then we move on to the next situation, perhaps a few weeks, months, or maybe even years later. It worked great in this film.<br/><br/>This movie also does a fantastic job at presenting the absurdity of the Holocaust and how the people that were closely involved, were often baffled by what has happening and it's an important reminder to always have, so this never happens again in the modern world.<br/><br/>Finally, I guess it's a weird complaint in a two and a half hour movie, but I really do think this movie could have benefited from another 30 minutes or so. Here's my case: One of my favorite books of all time (and arguably one of the most important books ever written) is Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, who was a Jewish psychiatrist who survived a couple of concentration camps. The book is divided into three main parts: Shock (before the camp), The Camp Experience and then Life After the Camps. For me, the book would not have as much impact if the third part of the story was missing. So, although in The Pianist, the initial shock before the camp and the Holocaust experience were brilliant, sad, shocking, depressing, disgusting all at the same time, throughout the film I found myself contemplating: ""Man, I wonder how Wlad's life will be after these experiences? I wonder how his personality will have been affected by this event."" Unfortunately, we only get a shot of him playing the piano and yes, you can tell by Brody's terrific acting, that we're not looking at the same individual that we saw at the start of the film. It is kind of poetic, I guess, but I really wanted to see more, like his interactions with other people that he met before the war, after the war, his personality and I wish there was more time for that. Personally, felt much shorter than two and a half hours long to me, which I guess is another indicator that maybe it would have benefited from a little extra time.<br/><br/>Overall, the Pianist is not my favorite Roman Polanski film (Rosemary's Baby, then Chinatown probably), but it's a really good movie, with some good performances, a good message that doesn't feel like forced or muddled. I really enjoyed it."

"ironhorse_iv","9","0","0","7 February 2019"," The Pianist plays the right keys. It's more A Minor than a B Flat. It's a cinematic masterpiece.
","The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Those whom lived through it, are forever scarred by its horrors. Even today, few can muster the courage to bring themselves to discuss the subject. However, one person did, and his name was Wladyslaw Szpilman. Based off his memoirs of the same name, 'The Pianist' tells the story of how he was able to survive the war, while living in fear, under Nazi Control, Warsaw, Poland. Without spoiling this 2002 film, too much, I have to say director, Roman Polanski and screenwriter, Ronald Harwood tried to keep the motion picture as historically accurate as possible. Why? It's because Polanski's inspiration for the film, came from the fact that he himself, had been a prisoner of a polish ghetto during the war. He wanted to make sure, common folks see the harsh heart breaking realistic truths about the events similar to what Steven Spielberg did with his 1993 masterpiece's 'Schindler's List'; rather than viewing something that is semi-safe, sugar coated & crowd-pleasing like the fictional movies, 1997's 'Life is Beautiful' & 1999's film 'Jacob the Liar'. Plus, he wanted to make sure, that there was no stone left unturned for Holocaust deniers to say that the events, feature in the film, did not happen. While, the movie does have some scenes inserted just to express the horror of the Holocaust, they far from legends. They come from Polanski's own accounts. Nevertheless, there was a few minor inaccuracy, I found, that didn't happen at all. One such thing was the relationship between Wladyslaw (Adrian Brody) and Dorota (Emilia Fox). Not only, was Dorota appears to be a made up character for the movie, but there was no apparent love connection between Wladyslaw and any woman, during the war. While, I do understand, that this character was probably created, in order to give a look at Szpilman's life before the occupation and to evoke audience sympathy for all that he lost during the war, but it wasn't really needed. The chocolate dinner scene with his family was really strong. If that wasn't enough, just rewatch the part where the titular character walk, through the empty ghetto. You see the pain, through Adrian Brody's eyes & body language. No able of dialogue, can vivid depict, how haunting & powerful, the actor's facial reactions are, throughout this movie. It reach me on a deeper level. Much in the same way, how the actor lost weight, in order to look more exhausted & weary & Brody learning how to really play the piano, very well. It's no wonder, why Adrien Brody became the youngest person to date to win an Academy Award for Best Actor at the age of 29. He did a good job, here. He deserve winning that prize in 2003. Honestly, to tell you, the truth, Polanski & his crew has cast this movie nearly perfectly. However, due to the huge amount of supporting performers and the lack of screen time focus on them. They don't really stand out, much as I wish, even though, their acting was great. Despite that, nearly every performer look and felt authentic with the little amount of time, they had. However, some of the literary references calls outs like the works of William Shakespeare & Fyodor Dostoevsky from Wladyslaw's brother, Henryk (Ed Stoppard) felt a little bit jarring. I doubt, he quotes those works in real-life. Despite that, I did like how the film shows that there is good & bad people, within both sides of the fence through the actions of German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) & Szalas (Andrew Tiernan). Nice to see national groups so complex, than lopsided 100% demonic & angelic. The only real nitpick, I had on the historical value of them, were the fact that some of the army uniforms of the German soldiers, were a bit off. Nevertheless, the rest of wardrobe seem fitting with what people wore during that era. Another inaccuracy that, I notice in the film, was the idea that there was running water in abandoned bomb out buildings. In truth, water within the city, run out, way before the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. As for action, the film focused on the terrible treatment and unjust punishment that the Jewish & Polish people really had to go through. The violence are really graphic and somewhat hard to watch, at times. According to the bonus features of the DVD, many such acts of cruelty in the film were recreated from actual photographs and archival film footage shot by the Nazis. Nevertheless, the way, the movie was shot, was also amazing. A good example is the opening sequence, where we see a statue with its arm pointing to the left, and people & the city in the background. Every so often throughout the movie, we see the same figure, only this time, the background is more & more ruin by war, until nothing is left, but rubble. That is highly great use of props and scenery. Despite, the loss of his wife and her friends at the hands of Manson's family, and his infamous involvement with an 13 year old girl which forced him to flee the United States. Polanski in the midst of this controversies, has always been a great director, which to be reckoned with. Through the help of real-life locations in Europe, cinematic CGI effects and camera techniques, Polanski & his crew was able to immerse the audience in the determination and will for survival that was displayed by Szpilman. It's no wonder, why he won Best Director at the Academy Award. It's one of his best works. This motion picture is able to offer a voice to the millions of Jews who lost their lives to the Holocaust. Overall: It's a film that needs to be seen, both a history lesson and morality tale. A must watch for sure."

","""The Pianist"" is biographical war drama film, based on the the perils faced and evaded by a Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist in Poland, amidst the Nazi conquest and rule over Poland during WW 2.
There are but very few movies which have been able to depict the atrocities faced by the Jewish community under the Nazi rule with a realistic portrayal of those times. ""The Pianist"" is certainly one among those. Even though this movie focuses on Szpilman's evasion from a otherwise certain holocaust with some luck and good helpful acquaintances, it skillfully shows some of the most moving scenes depicting human hunger, helplessness and hardships faced by the Polish Jews.
The acting performance is top-notch by the cast, especially Adrien Brody as Szpilman. The focus on the main story theme, without getting didactic and a gripping screenplay makes this movie a master-piece of the genre. The movie is sure to leave the viewer disturbed by the acts of human insanity but also in awe of the craft of skillful film-making."

","Traditional World War II-era films focus on the battlefields, whether in Europe or the Pacific. In 2002's 'The Pianist,' we instead see what it's like to live as a civilian under German occupation, focusing specifically on the story of a Polish Jew who must do everything he can to survive over the course of the later years during the war.<br/><br/>'Pianist' is really made what it is by Adrien Brody, whose Oscar-winning performance earned much praise from critics and audiences alike. Brody portrays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist who plays on Poland's national radio broadcast. Close with his family, Szpilman eventually must learn to survive in the ghettos of Warsaw and beyond as he fights for his life against the Nazi forces. The story is a real one, which makes it that much more remarkable, but as powerful as it is on paper, it's a tough task to bring it to life onscreen. Fortunately, Brody is able to breathe life into the role, bringing the emotion and rawness needed to make it a respectful telling of the story.<br/><br/>As a film itself, 'Pianist' doesn't feel lofty or overproduced. Instead, it accurately depicts the grittiness and horror of war, but still feels somewhat simple. The use of ambient sound over dialogue in long stretches of the film heightens the emotion and forces audiences to really pay attention to what they're seeing unfold on the screen. This is likely what helped Roman Polanski take home the Oscar for best director, despite his high profile personal issues. But the most powerful scene comes near the film's climax - a moment when Szpilman almost literally play for his life. This scene is by far the defining one in the film and will be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>'The Pianist' is a serious account of a dark part of history, but it tells a story that showcases how music can transcend parties, nationalities and allegiances."

","A great movie on a powerful, essential subject -- the Holocaust years in Poland -- directed with such artistry and skill that, as we watch, the barriers of the screen seem to melt away. The closing scenes of the movie involve Szpilman's confrontation with a German captain named Wilm Hosenfeld -- Polanski's direction of this scene, his use of pause and nuance, is masterful. Szpilman takes to performing sonatas in thin air, eyes closed, those jittery fingers stroking nothing but air. It's a wonderful moment in a wonderful, ghastly film, and one of the most moving arguments for the redemptive powers of art ever made. Crafted without a whiff of melodrama, this motion picture takes a steady, unflinching look at the plight of Jews in Warsaw. Polanski, who was a Jewish child in Krakow when the Germans arrived in September 1939, presents Szpilman's story with bleak, acid humor and with a ruthless objectivity that encompasses both cynicism and compassion.<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""High-Quality Stuff"" - This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theater to see or own on DVD.

The movie is long, and detailed, it depicts everything, it makes you feel everything. <br/><br/>And man, the ending, I had goosebumps, it was wonderful, I love how they cut the ""Chopin's Ballade No.1"" piece, they removed the happy parts, and kept only the relieving-then-intense parts.

","I usually don't cry when I watch movies. This movie left me in tears, I sobbed and I could relate to the main character - not exactly in the same way, but how it feels to not being seen as a part of society (apartheid and other issues of today). I didn't pause for one minute. I felt a lot of mixed emotions. This movie is so beautifully made, one part of it - when the SS soldier saves the main character - shows that there is hope for humanity, and that people have the ability to avoid their racial views and save each other when they truly feel sorry for one another. I truly recommend The Pianist, you won't be disappointed."

","This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is. The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European. And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans)."

","This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. <br/><br/>Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.<br/><br/>The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.<br/><br/>I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

It gives me quite an idea of how things weren't so great for him or for anybody during those dark times. I'm forever grateful even though it burns in my fiery soul.

","There are very few films of the Holocaust that aren't huge in scope, and often cover the tragedies of that time. ""The Pianist"" isn't as bloody or deathly as ""Schindler's List"" but it definitely shows that survivors came out of it due to pure luck, and that life is very fragile. Adrien Brody as the pianist, Szpilman, lives in the Warsaw Ghetto and after his family is taken to concentration camps, he must survive on luck and his own willpower. He works manual labor and hides at every opportunity. The film is very tense, because his fate is often uncertain, and his allies are often thwarted for their immeasurable help in hiding him. Brody gives an impeccable and heart wrenching performance, starting out with his family and trying to remain light about the situation, but eventually he becomes frail and hollow inside. The film is a shocking depiction of the war, as it should be, and comes from the uncommon perspective of a direct survivor. Haunting and absolutely horrifying, ""The Pianist"" broaches its subject with thoughtfulness and care."

","Roman Polanski's The Pianist"" is a film that will either haunt you, make you feel sad, angry, overwhelmed, deeply touched or disturbed, but it will definitely not leave you feeling indifferent. It will play with your emotions and it will smartly and slowly pull you into the ruins of the 1940's Warsaw, Poland. <br/><br/>Although it touches the global theme of the Holokaust, it actually tells a story of an individual, named Vladislaw Szpilman. The director brilliantly displayed simple scenes in front of the viewers. He showed everyday situations and the acts of torture one after another and gradually exhibited the true nature of merciless and cruel Nazis. Once the story has finished, the viewers are left with a magnificent portrayal of the most brutal, darkest and deranged era in human history. And all that through the point of view of the leading character.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* When Poland was invaded by the Nazi Germany in 1939, Szpilman's family knew that there would be some trouble and they could sense danger. However, nothing could prepare them for the events that were about to happen. Nazi soldiers striped the once-prosperous and affluent Jewish population of their properties, homes, money, jobs and finally, they destroyed and took their lives. As Rose said for Jack Dawson in Titanic: He saved me in every way a person can be saved.; something in that style, but with the totally opposite meaning, could be said for the Nazis: They destroyed them in every way people can be destroyed.<br/><br/>The Nazis not only took their lives, but also, before the killings, mocked at everything that meant something to them. Jews were forced to wear David's stars so that they could be recognized at any point. They were not allowed to gather at public places, to go to cafe bars, to walk on sidewalks... Many of them were annihilated just because they were picked on, for no real reason. <br/><br/>Adrien Brody's acting was superb. He walked through the city streets, witnessed horror, executions, starved children and dying old people, and there was nothing he could do. He just walked, day after day, hoping that we would survive for one more day. <br/><br/>And he did survive, but not because he did something extraordinary. He was just lucky and he managed to find himself at a right place at a right time. Brody showed his gradual physical and physical decline: he lost weight, he was barely possible to run away and hide, he got ill and was very close to death. He transformed from an elegant and sleek piano player into a human wreckage. He was full of life while courting a young music player at the beginning of the film and later, he became a lost, hungry, desperate griever who lost his entire family. He was a walking skeleton looking for shelter where he would wither in peace - survival was just a dream in the end. The wonderful flow of events and gradation at its best, once again! <br/><br/>A turning point in the film happens when Szpilman was hiding in an abandoned villa. He was looking for a can opener when he was approached by a German officer. To our and Szpilman's surprise, the officer showed understanding, compassion and his love for music! This wonderfully-played character made a point: that humanity lives within human beings regardless of their nationality and position. The relationship between these two men should be a guide to all human relationships. The officer Hosenfeld was not compassionate because he wanted something in return (although he needed Szpilman's help later in the film) but he was moral, just and humanity was part of him. <br/><br/>If I had to describe this film in only one word, it would be ""masterpiece'!!!!"

","I watched this film for the first time yesterday. I knew it was about World war 2 but I didn't realize specifically which parts. Adrian Brody is amazing in this film playing the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman. It reminded me very much like Schindlers List not only because it covers the same themes and time period but also because it really made me appreciate the time in which I live. The way people got treated during that time was horrific and heartbreaking. This movie in my opinion had some very confronting scenes such as Adrian Brody's character getting brutally whipped by a German soldier and also a man getting thrown off the balcony from his wheelchair. These scenes for me were quite hard to watch. Overall though this film was good to watch. I can't imagine it would be easy to act those parts and put yourself into those situations but it was acted very well and very genuine.

"JamesHitchcock","9","0","0","20 January 2017"," One of the most moving films about the war that I know
","There have been innumerable films about World War II, but relatively few about the Holocaust, a subject which, at least for the first few decades after the war, seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Since the 1980s, however, there have been some fine attempts to come to terms with the most notorious crime of the twentieth century, including Pakula's ""Sophie's Choice"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is another to add to this list.<br/><br/>The film is based on the autobiography of Władysław Szpilman, a Jewish pianist, who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland. (As one character points out, Szpilman's surname is an appropriate one; it is a Polonised form of ""Spielmann"", the German for ""musician""). In September 1939 the Szpilman family are living in relative middle-class comfort in Warsaw when they learn that the country has been invaded by Germany. The film then traces the way in which the situation of Poland, and especially of its Jewish community, deteriorates throughout the course of the war- the passing of anti-Jewish laws, the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and finally the deportations to the concentration camps beginning in 1942. By a stroke of chance Szpilman is separated from his family when they are deported to Treblinka extermination camp. For a time he becomes a slave labourer, but manages to escape and is sheltered by non-Jewish friends linked to the Polish resistance, surviving while thousands are dying around him and while his city is gradually turned into a wasteland of rubble.<br/><br/>A key scene comes towards the end of the film. Much of the city, including the building in which Szpilman was sheltering, has been destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, and Szpilman is desperately trying to hide in a ruined building when he is discovered by a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld. Hosenfeld guesses that Szpilman is Jewish, but takes pity on him and spares his life, even bringing him food and giving him a coat to help him survive.<br/><br/>Szpilman's story had a deep personal significance for Polanski, himself a Polish Jew who managed to survive the war in hiding, although other members of his family, including his mother, died. It is therefore unsurprising that it has a greater emotional resonance than many of Polanski's earlier films, which can often be rather emotionally cool. Szpilman is a gifted musician, but his survival has very little to do with his talent and a great deal to do with the kindness of others and with sheer luck. It is a role which called for a superb actor, and Polanski was fortunate enough to find one in the shape of Adrien Brody, who won a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar. (Strangely enough, Brody was not the director's first choice for the role- that was Joseph Fiennes, who was unavailable). Brody's Szpilman becomes a sort of Everyman figure, a tragic version of Chaplin's Little Tramp, stumbling his way through a city which has been reduced to a vision of Hell on Earth. As Roger Ebert put it, he is not a fighter or a hero but a survivor.<br/><br/>Polanski himself won the ""Best Director"" award. The film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to ""Chicago"". ""The Pianist"" is a harrowing record of man's inhumanity to man, but it is also a film with a message of hope in that it shows how even unspeakable barbarity like that of the Nazis cannot altogether extinguish man's better instincts, shown by the kindness and bravery of Szpilman's friends and his defiant rendition of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante at the end. It is one of the most moving films about the war that I know, comparable in this respect to either Pakula's or Spielberg's. 9/10"

"SnoopyStyle","7","0","0","19 September 2016"," non-heroism
","It's 1939 Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jew and a pianist on the radio. He falls for Polish girl Dorota. The Germans invade and the Szpilman family expects to live through another war. However, their lives slowly deteriorate as government decrees force them into the Jewish ghetto. Itzak Heller tries to recruit Wlad and his brother Henryk into the Jewish police but they refuse. As his family is put on trains, Wlad is pulled out by Itzak. Wlad joins the resistance and smuggles in material. He sneaks out and finds friends who help to hide him. He witnesses the Germans battling their way into the ghetto from his hiding place. He finds help from Dorota who is now married and pregnant. From his hiding place, he witnesses the start of the Warsaw uprising.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski delivers a depiction of a survivor of the Holocaust. He is more or less passive for too long until pushed. He survives due to kindness of others. He does not fight not due some moral stand but rather a lack of proactive heroism. It's a rather disengaging trait although I can see Polanski's point of view. The other annoying aspect is his surprise and constant reaction to the shocking inhumanity. None of this makes him less realistic. In many ways, he's a very human character and flawed not in any evil ways. It doesn't make him an easy, or appealing character. The world is well constructed. The most compelling scene is actually when the family is stuck waiting out in the sun for the train. The train has been done every time but to wait in a holding pen is more unusual. This is a great Holocaust movie but the leading character is unusually not so appealing."

","""Thank God not me. He wants us to survive. Well, that's what we have to believe."" <br/><br/>The challenge of bringing Wladyslaw Szpilman's story to the screen could find no better conduit than Roman Polanski, whose own wartime experiences bear such tragic similarity. Aged just nine years old, Polanski was thrown by his doomed mother from a transport bound for Auschwitz concentration camp. He then had to learn how to survive the harsh realities of the Krakow ghetto, by any means available, before being rescued by the courageousness of a Polish family preventing him sharing the fate of others when the ghetto was liquidated. Polanski thus brings all his undoubted directorial talent to provide artistic expression to this barbaric period of human history, much in the same vein as the literary brilliance of another Holocaust survivor, Primo Levi. As such, he can lay bare not just the evils perpetrated, but also the stark reality that when faced with such inhumane treatment, as Levi expressed it: 'man is bound to pursue his own ends by all possible means'. In the Oscar- winning adapted screenplay by successful playwright Ronald Harwood, Szpilman is portrayed in no heroic terms, but rather as an individual with the desperation, guile, and simple fortune to survive. Harwood has stated in no uncertain terms how aspects of the screenplay were made easier to transfer to the big screen by Polanski's own contributions. In interview, Polanski has himself explained: 'I could use my own experiences in the script without making it an autobiography'. Adrian Brody, a master of the understated performance, is able to capture this individual's gradual descent into a simple mechanical pursuit of survival at any cost, and general torpor in the face of the horrors which Szpilman witnessed. Thus, the lead character, who earlier displays a sense of finely- tuned compassion for others, is transformed into the dispassionate observer of the bloody reprisals outside the windows of his refuge. Deserving of his Oscar for best performance in a leading role, and losing a fifth of his body-weight in preparation for the part, Brody became the youngest recipient ever to receive this award at the age of 29. Brody is ably supported by a largely British cast, more familiar for their work within television drama, and thus, relatively unknown to wider cinema audiences. Special mention should be made of the performances by Ed Stoppard as Szpilman's feisty brother, Henryk, and Frank Finlay as his browbeaten father. In addition, Roy Smiles is memorable as the turncoat recruit to the Jewish police, Itzak Heller, who plucks Szpilman from the line waiting to board the transport to Auschwitz, thereby saving him from sharing his family's fate. Polanski expertly explores the psychological and emotional impact upon Szpilman's family as they attempt to come to terms with increasing persecution at the hands of their oppressors. The film contains many haunting scenes depicting the Nazi regime's barbarity, but two which resonate with this reviewer are the cursory execution of a young woman for merely asking 'where are you taking us?', and the desperate wailing of a woman who had suffocated her baby in a futile attempt to avoid detection. Although this film obviously has an emotive impact on the audience, at times it can appear more removed from its subject than other feature films covering the genocide. There is obvious contrast in this treatment to Spielberg's more obvious attempts to tug at his audience's emotional heart- strings. Though Polanski deserves credit for such gritty realism, this film suffers slightly as a cinematic experience due to the fact that Szpilman's cool detachment can distance the character from the audience. However, Szpilman's amazing story allows for the introduction of ill-fated Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, whose compassion and love of music not only saves the eponymous musician from starvation or capture and execution, but also enables a re-emergence of common humanity into this bleak narrative. Sensitively portrayed by regularly cast as Nazi officer, Thomas Kretschmann, the former Nazi devotee, Hosenfeld, appalled at the brutality shown to Poles and Jews during his military service in the East, would risk reprisal to harbour several individuals from Nazi repression, Szpilman among them. So unjust that upon being captured by Red Army forces, he would be imprisoned for seven long years and tortured to death in a Soviet concentration camp in 1952, despite all efforts of Szpikman to track him down and have him released. This unforgettable encounter between Szpilman and his saviour raises this to a movie worthy of receiving the Palm D'Or. Moreover, this work marked Polanski's return to critical recognition, winning his first Academy award for direction at the fourth attempt, and his first award in the States since winning the Golden Globe for 'Chinatown' in 1975."

""The Pianist"" is a tale of horrors and and unexpected miracles through the life of Wladek, played flawlessly by Adrien Brody set in Warsaw during and after the WWII. When the protagonist's life changes inevitably throughout the course of few months, so drastically, one may wonder if he makes it alive at all. Depraved of family, brutal treatment by Germans and Poles alike, Wladek's courage continues to surprise us. Saved by a few good Poles and at the end by the German officer (played by Thomas Kretchman) he makes it. Broken, emaciated, speechless, but he makes it. With the soul filled with his only one true friend, Chopin, he plays throughout the movie, he manages to come to life again.Its a wonderful story of survival in the times when no one could have been trusted, one could have only wished for a miracle or a quick end. Wladyslaw Szpilman's story continues to inspire. It's a true tale of miracles set in the darkest history of time."

","The pianist was a classic , have-to-see movie. Its one of those movie that will go down in history. Its undoubtedly a touching movie for every being and very sad and tear jerking for some. Its based on a true story of a man trying to survive the holocaust and the general destruction in the ghetto of Warsaw during WWII. He used his music almost as a savior for himself. He was just a pianist. He didn't want any trouble. <br/><br/>This film shows how a middle class , Jewish family turned into five individuals struggling to survive or escape the ghetto. It shows what a terrible time Jews had to go through , without showing the worst of it , by not showing any scenes of the concentration camps. This film educates us how the Jews did not only die during those times , but they were tortured and killed and intimidated publicly.<br/><br/>This film expresses love, torture, tragedy, death, violence, ignorance, sympathy and much more. The magnificent acting in this film expresses all these factors brilliantly. many think this film is depressing , but all it is, is the ugly truth. People think this is depressing , but they haven't seen the worst of it."

","In September 1939, Władysław Szpilman (Adrien Brody), a Polish-Jewish pianist, is playing live on the radio in Warsaw when the station is bombed during Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland. Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with his family at home when learning that Britain and France have declared war on Germany. But the promised aid does not come. Fighting lasts for just over a month, with both the German and Soviet armies invading Poland at the same time on different fronts. Warsaw becomes part of the Nazi-controlled General Government.

","A film so traumatic, I don't think I could ever summon the courage to watch it again. The Pianist is a brutal but painfully realistic portrayal of the atrocities caused towards Jewish people during the Holocaust. It forces the viewer to come to terms with the absolute worst that humanity has to offer. The Pianist is poignant, powerful and unrelenting. It doesn't just make you see what these people were subjected to, but makes you feel it as well. It portrays the happiness and desperation that Holocaust victims felt.

","As a Polish descendant I take pride in most movies regarding our storied heritage, yet most films lack a correct historical context and often times are so off of the intended story line that the film is ruined, Polanski is brilliant with this film in its ability to evoke emotion from any viewer, although morbid the film is an accurate and sad reality of millions of people and is one of few films that can depict the holocaust in a somewhat realistic manner. Adrien Brody is stellar in his Academy Award winning performance playing a passive Polish Jew who survives and avoids Nazi rule. Polanski himself uses his past and applies it to the film as he himself was a survivor of the war and of course of his dark and sad past of the murder of his wife Sharon Tate, you can see his emotion through his films and although perhaps morbid this film is brilliant and any avid movie goer would love and appreciate The Pianist.

","Devastating adaptation of Wladyslaw Szpilman's WWII memoirs as a Polish Jew and classically trained pianist in 1939 Warsaw who continually escaped the clutches of the invading Nazis over a 5-year period. Saved from the concentration camps by the Jewish police, he relied on the Underground--as well as on one remarkable German soldier--to stay alive and eventually tell his story. Adrien Brody's sadly quizzical, sensitive face takes the screen like a beacon of light; he obviously put himself through hell to get this role just right, and his Oscar-winning performance is both physically demanding and emotionally rich. Not so some of the overacting supporting players, and Szpilman's close-knit family members come off too soft (however, the scene where the father splits a piece of caramel five ways is a heartbreaker). Roman Polanski won the Oscar as Best Director, however some of his bigger scenes (such as the Russian Liberation) don't pack the wallop expected. The filmmaker does catch the numbing brutality and violence of the time with an unerring eye, and the film is arguably a more lasting statement of Nazi-atrocity than Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Lengthy, but hypnotic; an unsettling, intense dramatic achievement. *** from ****"

","This film moved me. I have been a sucker for films based around Nazi Germany and World War II, but this was the only film that truly devastated me to the brink of tears. Perhaps I was in the right mood for it. This is the kind of movie you watch curled up in a heavy winter night with a warm cup of coffee and absolute silence. It is a treat for the soul.<br/><br/>The most admirable aspect of the film is The Pianist's will to live on. His courage and refusal to give up reminds us of the common courage in everyday people. In the film, the Pianist himself is not the victim of most brutalities, he is more of a witness to what goes on around him. More than a fighter, he is a survivor. He never truly wishes to die, he wants to live on. I will never forget the scene in which he he sits in an empty hospital, playing the piano in the air, trying to drown out the horrors of the shooting around him. Striped Pajamas, Schindler's list, Book Thief... none of them come close to the utter majesty of this film's cinematography. 10/10 for this movie. Such brilliant characterization, such amazing motion. What a film! This is the stuff legends are made of."

Also if you like Schidler's List, you will like this one too.<br/><br/>I usually don't like movies without good dialogue. This is an exception. I was so fascinated by this one that I sat still for 2,5 hours.I didn't have subtitles, but luckily I understand a bit of German, so I could follow these discussions as well. I think anyone could watch the movie without understanding German, so I hope no one has passed the movie because of that.<br/><br/>There were many scenes without any dialogue. Still these scenes could tell the story and were meaningful, but also interesting. The viewer is able to feel the grief that Szpilman feels during the movie - all the humiliation, starve, thirst, loosing family and so on. I found it very interesting to see how Szpilman's confidence changes during the years - how he gets kind of weaker and surviving by using his primitive instincts.<br/><br/>I wasn't familiar with Brody's act, but I was so impressed by it. No wonder he won the Oscar. How he changes his physical performance was amazing. He makes the viewer feel Szpilman's sorrow. Like I said before I don't usually like movies without talking, but Brody made the movie so interesting. He really can act and speak by using body language and facial impressions. <br/><br/>Things that made me so sad were to see how the Jews seemed to be very submissive to the changes and how they were treated, and also the destiny of the good person in the end."

","The Pianist is a story about the World War II, in particular about the pianist Wladislav Szpilman, based on his autobiography, and played by Adrien Brody. It's directed by Roman Polanski. After being separated from his family and everyone he know (almost everyone is taken away with trains for which we know now where they went), he is left to take care for himself in a Warsaw ghetto, to fight for food and cover. He is simply trying to get out of German sight.<br/><br/>The movie is often compared to a Schindler's list because it describes the oppression of Jews during WW2, but it has a completely different dimension. While in Schindlers List we have a very realistic image of situation Jewish people found themselves, in Pianist we follow and individual, and that gives a completely different perspective. We are in a way more involved, we are drawn deeper into the character."

","A very engaging and fantastically shot WW2 film which is one of Polanski's best films in years.<br/><br/>This movie retells the events of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous Polish pianist as he attempts to survive during WW2 and narrowly escapes death multiple times.<br/><br/>This movie may not be as brutal as ""Schindler's List"" was but it still contains several dark scenes which can be hard to watch. It showed to us that surviving the Holocaust was based on luck and it was easy to get killed. If you were weaker and unable to work, you'd be in danger of getting shot. ""The Pianist"" captures this element very well and that was what I really liked about it.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty tense because his fate is uncertain throughout the movie. He often hides in Nazi infested areas and his allies have to try their hardest to hide him. Often when his cover is blown, he only narrowly escapes death. Also, one scene in the film (which I won't give away because of spoilers) is so tense that it is guaranteed to make everyone who is not familiar with the true story tense up unlike anything else.<br/><br/>Also, I really love the cinematography. It really captures the sense of barrenness very well. Some of its scenes are so jaw-dropping, it's surprising that any movie could be able to film them. This movie is definitely a visual treat unlike anything else.<br/><br/>Adrien Body gave a great performance. In the beginning, he seems somewhat calm. As the movie continues on, however, his performance gets better as the tension gets higher. In my opinion, he gave the best performance in the movie. He stole the whole show. He is the actor we see most in this movie and he carries the movie expertly by himself.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is by far a masterpiece. It contains everything I think is necessary is Holocaust films. It captures the brutality of the Holocaust very well, it has incredible cinematography, a consistent level of suspense, and it has a great lead acting performance. It fulfilled and went far beyond all of my expectations and it is a must-see film for these reasons."

","Released in 2002, ""The Pianist"" is Roman Polanski's account of the real-life Hebrew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) whose family was banished to the Warsaw ghetto with thousands of other Jews after the German invasion. Szpilman is separated from his family members when they're carted off to be slaughtered and does whatever he must to survive until the Allies defeat Germany. He's dependent on others while hiding out and, like they say, sometimes help comes from the most unexpected sources.<br/><br/>Like 1993's ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Pianist"" is a thoroughly realistic WWII drama that addresses the Holocaust with flashes of violence and atrocities, only marred by the stereotypical boorish depiction of practically every member of the Wehrmacht. Needless to say, you have to be in the right mode for a movie like this and you have to be willing to invest a solid hour before things get interesting; by the final hour you'll be hooked until the end; that is, unless you have ADHD and consume only cartoony ""blockbusters.""<br/><br/>Some have complained that Szpilman's a lousy protagonist for this type of movie because he never does anything heroic and essentially waits it out. Answer: That's why it's called ""The Pianist"" and not ""The Warrior Jew"" or ""Rambo 5: Kraut Killer."" He was a simple musician who did what he could to survive, but that's not all he does; he also smuggles weapons into the ghetto, which are used later in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. When he eventually hides out in various apartments he doesn't have a weapon. What's he supposed to do, run into the streets and take on German soldiers by himself with a club or a kitchen knife? Even going out with a machine gun would've been foolish and suicidal. Szpilman's a survivor who does some minor heroic things. For those who demand a more standout hero, look no further than Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann); he's the hero of the story. <br/><br/>The movie effectively shows the pianist's view of the war, which is the window through which the viewer observes the historical events. ""Schindler's List"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Gentile who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the top and views both Nazis and Jews from a position of safety. Oskar Schindler naturally had a more panoramic, birds-eye view of the Holocaust whereas ""The Pianist"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Jew who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the bottom and sees both Nazis and Jews from a position of danger. The former is a better film for understanding the machinery of the Holocaust while ""The Pianist"" is a better film to watch if you want to know what it was like to experience the Holocaust first hand as an ordinary Jew.<br/><br/>The movie runs 2½ hours and was shot in Poland (including Warsaw where the events in the movie take place) and Germany. <br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","Roman Polanski's The Pianist has earned recognition as one of the best films about Holocaust ever made. And for a good reason. Based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, it tells the story of him and his family trying to survive through the World War while at first harassed and then outright hunted by the Nazi government. It is the tale of Holocaust seen through one human fate. And while Szpilman's experiences were not the worst ones imaginable – if such things should even be measured – they are among the more unbelievable, showcasing his resilience, will to survive, and at times sheer dumb luck.<br/><br/>Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, and this is by far the best performance he has ever given. The role fits him like a glove, or perhaps it would be better to say that he fits the role like a glove, it's hard to say. Nevertheless, it's him that pulls you into the movie, into the journey through years filled with naught else but hardship, destruction, smoke and sorrow, with only brief moments of elusive hope. One of the more well-earned Academy Awards, I must say.<br/><br/>Polanki's Academy Award for Directing was also well-earned in my opinion. Polanski's films have always had certain flair to them, an unmistakable style, but in this he has left out all of his usual lightheartedness and channeled all of his talent into making you see what it was really like to live through it all. And he succeeded. The pacing is iron tight and professional, the whole film looks amazing, all the scenes are poignant and interesting, all the dialogues work magnificently, all the characters are identifiable and memorable. Easily the best film from him I've seen.<br/><br/>All in all The Pianist is the only film I've encountered that can stand as an equal next to Schindler's List as a film about the Holocaust. A modern classic."

","Review: I know that I'm a bit late with this movie, 13 years to be exact but now that I've watched it, I must admit, it is a powerful masterpiece. The movie is about a talented, Jewish pianist who uses all of his resources to escape from German soldiers during World War II. After splitting up from his family, he is left to fend for himself in a Warsaw ghetto, whilst fighting for food and cover. The acting from Adrien Brody was superb, especially when times were extremely hard for his character and the storyline was put together very well by Roman Polanski. I was a bit skeptical about the length of the film before watching it but it really didn't seem that long because of the detailed content and amazing cinematography. The ironic ending was shocking and surprising, which added to his amazing journey were he really hit rock bottom. I still find it hard to believe that it was a true story and it was one of those films were it takes some time to get out of that mode after watching it. Anyway, I'm not going to praise it anymore because I think you can tell that I really enjoyed it. Its hard to find a fault with the film so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I don't think that Adrien Brody, 42, has put in such a perfect performance since making this movie. I liked him in the Grand Budapest Hotel, Detachment, the Darjeeling Limited and Cadillac Records but his performance in this movie was excellent and he deserved the Oscar for a leading role. Personally, I like his acting style and he can comfortably switch genres with ease but the lack of good scripts are holding him back. He as proved that he can take on any challenge that is put in front of him but he hasn't hit the peak that he reached in 2002. Anyway, the movie was made by the acclaimed director, Roman Polanski, 82, who has been surrounded by controversy after being convicted of statutory rape on a 13 year old girl. Polanski then fled the USA to avoid prison so his movie making career was put on hold for some time. He's famous for making Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, Frantic, Bitter Moon, the Ninth Gate and Oliver Twist but his real comeback movie had to be this one. He also won a best director Oscar for this movie but he lost out to Chicago for the best picture. Polanski had his own personal experience with Nazis during World War II were he sadly lost his mother and was separated from his father for some time so this movie came from the bottom of his heart and you really can see it on screen. <br/><br/>Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $120million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their war/drama movies about a talented Jewish pianist who is on the run from German soldiers. 8/10"

","Truth can be and often is stranger than fiction and so it is with the true story of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who through sheer nerve and luck managed to escape the clutches of the uber-efficient Nazi death machine. <br/><br/>Szpilman before the war was a nationally renowned musician. At the start of the film, he's playing Chopin on Polish radio just as World War II begins and bombs drop all around the radio studio, knocking it off the air, and knocking Szpilman's life into a downward spiral. Little by little, Szpilman and his family are subjected to the Nazi process of separating the Jewish population of Warsaw from the rest of the inhabitants. Starting with restaurants and parks being closed to them, they are forced from upper middle-class security into life in the arm-banded ghetto to their final journey on the train where they herded as less compromising compatriots into the rolling pens of death. Just when the audience is on the verge of becoming numbed by the grim life in the ghetto, the pianist, through quirks of fate, is spared the death camps, only to go into hiding in abandoned apartments, trusting sympathetic Poles to protect him in a world where an act of kindness can be a death sentence. Szpilman becomes a voyeur to the horror he witnesses through windows and half-closed doors that lead to a world that has become a death trap. Battles rage, Nazis march, and civilians are mowed down as he watches helplessly. Just when the Nazi brutality against the Jews seems unbearable, a music-loving German soldier treats the pianist kindly while Jewish victims prey on each other.<br/><br/>The Pianist is rendered with a melancholy poetry by Roman Polanski. His depiction of life in the Warsaw Ghetto is a series of disturbing images framed with a sense of urgency. However, these images don't need any melodramatic embellishment. And in this way, Polanski ensures he is not cheapening the story by appealing to our pity. What he has this film ask of us is to bear witness that such things happened in a civilized place, to never forget that they can and do happen still. And yet amid the usual roster of sadism, there are notes of unexpected poignancy that tug at your heart strings. The scene where Szpilman climbs over the wall and is walking through a veritable waste land of destroyed buildings is a powerfully quiet, cold image of death.<br/><br/>The muted heroism of Szpilman's survival flashes as a fragile and determined pulse in Adrien Brody's magnificently understated performance. As Szpilman, he brilliantly echoes the film's tone of stunned disbelief, as a series of events transforms him from an elegantly dressed, highly cultured musician to a scavenging, debased shell of a human being. His performance is a marvel of wary tenacity and unquenchable humanity.<br/><br/>The Pianist is an emotionally devastating film that will linger in the minds of all who experience it; the notion that war is the absence of art in our dealings with one another will remain as timeless as a well-written phrase."

","I love films that glorify the power of music or even the power of movies, and what they can do for people because it's something that I have been directly impacted with. Movies and music have both gotten me through the hardest of times no matter the genre. A film has the ability to give the audience an escape route from their normal life. Now The Pianist shows this on a much different scale and exemplifies it in a different way, but I love the idea of the power of music or film so it's safe to say I really liked The Pianist.<br/><br/>It tells the true story of a Jewish man from Warsaw Germany in the midst of World War II and the numerous life threatening struggles he went through along the countless amount of helpful and hurtful people he ran into. Adrien Brody stars as Wladyslaw Szpilman and plays him beautifully. I use that word because the film deals with the touchy subject of World War II, and in particular, the Holocaust. But there is a certain beauty to the way the film presents the subject. I especially like the way the Germans are represented, in that not all of them were as brutal as Hitler. In fact there are several generous Germans throughout that give Szpilman a hand. With that being said, it is devastating to see the hundreds of bodies you say laying in the streets of Warsaw, and without being paid really any attention. It still shocks me just how inhumane people can be to other people, and what the human race is capable of. A film like this can serve as a reminder to that, and is one of the better war films I have seen.<br/><br/>It was also fascinating to watch the piano side of this character's story. For most of the film, he had to hold all of his emotions in while playing for people during this enduring time. The piano served as such a great juxtaposition for the terrible and beautiful side of the war. The film also looks fantastic in terms of the set pieces and the way Germany is represented. Polanski really nailed that aspect of it. It's also worth mentioning just how good Thomas Kretschmann is in his small but pivotal role. Overall, I thought The Pianist was a heartbreaking but beautiful film.<br/><br/>+Piano juxtaposition <br/><br/>+Set pieces <br/><br/>+Germany is represented realistically<br/><br/>8.5/10"

In symbolic terms it regards our condition under huge duress as when Adrien Brody moves his fingers through the air and the audiences hears the beautiful sounds of the piano that are only evident in his tarnished mind. His family was separated from him and we can sense his loneliness as he walks a street littered with bodies and fallen structures. He is forced to help rebuild a separation wall as well as endure brutal treatment from the Nazis. Directed by Roman Polanski who himself is a survivor of such conditions, and his passion for the material is evident. His previous films contain such classics as Chinatown and Repulsion. He creates the nightmarish atmosphere of the period and succeeds with great results. Flawless acting by Brody whose grief is only subsided by the sounds of piano. Strong supporting work by Thomas Kretschmann as a German soldier who happens upon him and the interesting situation that transpires as a result.

","The Pianist shares its themes with another movie depicting the holocaust, that is, Schindler's List. If a movie is compared to one of the greatest movies of all time then it must be quite spectacular. The Pianist does not cut any corners in depicting the brutality of the Nazis and the pathetic living conditions of the Jews who were subjected to a very low standard of living. The performances are completely natural and no one goes overboard in portraying a particular role. Adrien Brody gives a subdued performance as a man whose only purpose is to survive against massive odds. His hope of playing the piano for the radio station is the sole motivation that keeps him alive. The director shows incredible attention to detail in capturing the brutal assaults by the Gestapo officers and the bombing of the Jews. The protagonist in this movie is not a hero but a survivor.

","The Pianist is a very personal story for two men: Wladyslaw Szpilman, the eponymous subject of the film and author of the book on which it was based, and director Roman Polanski, whose own horrific war time experiences paralleled Szpilman's. As an artistic Jewish youngster growing up in Poland during the holocaust, Polanski was able to identify closely with Szpilman and use his traumatic tale to convey his own feelings about life in Poland under Nazi rule. <br/><br/>Although personal, it is also a universal story of endeavour, triumph, fate and resilience. The emotionally charged subject in the hands of such an impassioned and gifted director has resulted in a film of heart-wrenching tragedy and chilling horror, and one fully deserving of the honors bestowed upon it - including the coveted Palme D'or at Cannes - and Adrien Brody in the title role. <br/><br/>While The Pianist focuses on one person's extraordinary story, it also emphasises that almost every holocaust survivor possesses an equally terrifying account. Almost without exception, each would make a worthy subject to film, but with so many already existing, it becomes increasingly hard to do so in an original and effective way. Even during the course of The Pianist, the brutality of the Nazis, exemplified by the many scenes depicting arbitrary and callous executions, becomes all too familiar. That doesn't diminish its impact, but it does make one yearn for a fresh perspective. <br/><br/>What The Pianist is able to offer in this regard is the true story of a gifted young Jewish musician whose world was his family and his music, until he was deprived of both when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. Szpilman was an intense young man, living in an upscale neighbourhood of Warsaw with his extensive family, including his mother (Maureen Lipman), father (Frank Finlay), brother Henryk (Ed Stoppard) and sisters. The film begins with him playing Chopin for Polish radio when the first bombs are dropped. As he flees the studio, he meets a pretty blonde cellist Dorota (Emilia Fox), but their subsequent attempts at dating are thwarted by their different faiths and the Nazi imposed edicts prohibiting Jews from many sectors of the city. With providence playing such a prominent part in Szpilman's life, so it would with Dorota as their paths cross again many years later. <br/><br/>With the establishment of the Jewish ghettos, Szpilman's family are relocated before being shipped off to concentration camps. His fortune and musical renown intervene and he is plucked from the line boarding the trains by an influential friend in the Jewish police. Over the following years, as he endures unimaginable hardship and depravity, both elements play significant roles in his survival. For all his bravery and fortitude, it is luck above all else that divides him from his family and friends who perish. <br/><br/>Adrien Brody is eloquently understated in his portrayal of the dignified Szpilman, relying less on the sparse dialogue than the manner in which he expresses his unrelenting suffering. The bleakness of the situation is masterfully captured by the muted palette of Pawel Edelman's cinematography. Only when the Nazi stranglehold finally begins to loosen under the allies' ascendancy, and liberation nears, does the first glimmer of sunlight fall on Warsaw's decimated streets. <br/><br/>Polanski uses this symbolism again when a shaft of light cuts across Szpilman's gaunt features as he plays for a Nazi officer whose compassion and musical appreciation result in friendship and salvation rather than assassination. ""Thank God, not me,"" says the officer. That such an intervention spared Szpilman so that his playing would be heard and his story would be told, may be difficult to accept, but based on The Pianist, it's one to be grateful for."

Both wonderful films, this one you get to see everything from the other point of view which I much prefer.

","Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"", brings home the horror of the Holocaust through one man's struggle to survive the evil that relentlessly mounts around him.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Władysław Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jewish pianist who plays live music on the radio in Warsaw at the outbreak of WW2. A talented man he eventually discovers that his greatest talent may be for survival. He is not inordinately heroic, but he does take chances such as helping smuggle weapons into the Warsaw Ghetto. However, he is a witness to heroes. After being saved almost by accident from deportation to Treblinka as the Nazis clear the Warsaw Ghetto, he sees the uprising of the surviving Jews who refuse to go without a fight.<br/><br/>Later while sick with Jaundice, he witnesses another uprising as the Poles of Warsaw battle the Nazis for the city. Polanski handles the action scenes in a masterful manner. It is as though we are viewing events out of the window over Szpilman's shoulder.<br/><br/>Polanski has always been able to get feeling from his actors, but here he shows he can also handle a big canvas with epic scenes that can stand comparison with the work of David Lean or Steven Spielberg. It would be hard to find scenes more harrowing than the ones Polanski has recreated of the Warsaw Ghetto.<br/><br/>It may have been tempting to have a narrator fill us in on the complex historical events as the story unfolds, but Polanski tells this story without resorting to narration; the film has more immediacy without it. Although a fair amount of exposition is delivered through the character's conversations, it is seamless and allows Polanski to incorporate touches of wit often tinged with irony into a story that is anything but light.<br/><br/>Szpilman and his family soon discover that what at first appear to be ridiculous edicts about race segregation by the Nazis are in fact deadly serious with dire consequences for them all. Although much of this background has been covered in documentaries, movies and mini-series, it is presented here with fresh insight by Polanski.<br/><br/>In an inspired performance, Adrien Brody's Szpilman is buffeted by fate and is almost helpless to change the course of events. However he receives help from two women who knew him from his days playing the piano on the radio: a singer, Janina, and a Cellist, Dorata, played by Ruth Platt and Emelia Fox, who confusingly look a lot like each other. In another encounter, he is helped by a German officer (Thomas Kretschmann), who admires his playing.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" rivals ""The Pawnbroker"" in telling the story of how a decent man's life is torn apart by the Holocaust, while at the same time giving a sense of the enormity of one of the most horrific episodes in human history."

Simplicity is best.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. I think this was the first film where I noticed Brody, and his performance is top-notch. I heard he had to lose a lot of weight for the movie, and it really showed on screen. The surrounding cast also did well in showing the emotions of their characters.<br/><br/>However it does seem to drag along at some parts. Though it was still engaging, they could have probably shortened it just a bit to make it more rounded. Or maybe it felt a bit draggy because he was hiding and so to that effect, the audience had to wait in hiding with him. In that sense, then the 'pauses' in the movie was a good addition.<br/><br/>Also a good addition, though I have no liking for, were the gruesome scenes of violence. They were really vivid and was made even more prominent with the plain view of bodies everywhere.

","The Pianist. Much like any other movie on time of Hitler and his hatred towards Jews, The Pianist is a painful watch of torture and inhumanity. <br/><br/>Unlike Schindler's List which was a movie on the German Saviour, The Pianist is a movie of the Jew victim, a piano player played perfectly by Adrien Brody who survives the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto of World War II. The Pianist's strength is authentic portrayal of the war time, the plight of the Jews in Poland and how our pianist keeps surviving the odds of the highly difficult times. Apart from that, the whole destruction scenes in second half are perfectly haunting and leave you with pain and sorrow. <br/><br/>I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Pianist. It is no Schindler's List but in its own world, it is the haunting tale of war times."

But, I think that's what makes this movie GREAT!<br/><br/>That must be the purpose of this movie, to make people like me know and understand what the Jewish suffered in that time, and not to forget it and help to make sure it won't ever ever ever happen again in the future in any possible ways a mere civilian like me can do. Well, at least maybe by telling people to not feel like they are superior to anyone else! Or by recommending people to watch this? Which I'll of course do.<br/><br/>I've watched some other holocaust-themed movies but haven't this much personally deeply affected until this one. It's so 'not' dramatic it feels so real, I kept thinking about each of the people on the screen, what their lives felt like, what were they feeling, how they survived both physically and mentally. It's a really great portrayal of the worst human tragedy ever known in world war history.<br/><br/>So, yeah... this movie is so great it made me feel sick in my heart.

","Roman Polanski can lay claim to having helmed one of the greatest films of all time with 1974's densely layered ""Chinatown"" but a Best Director Oscar eluded him until 2002's ""The Pianist"". It is the true story of a Jewish Polish pianist struggling to survive under Nazi rule in WWII-era Warsaw. The story has personal meaning for Polanski, who is himself a Holocaust survivor.<br/><br/>For those familiar with Polanski's work behind the camera it should come as no surprise that the film is impeccably directed. There is a real sense of 'living' this experience through covert glances out of windows and half-shut doors.<br/><br/>The Oscar-winning script may be leisurely paced but it does inject some action into the proceedings at opportune moments. The horrors of Nazi occupation are unflinchingly shown, making the movie not exactly pleasant to watch at times. However, despite this, the film is ultimately distinguished by its portrayals of courage, hope & compassion.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly good with Adrian Brody warranting special attention for his performance, which deservedly won him a Best Actor Oscar. Notably, Brody also performed some of the piano pieces himself. I must add that whoever handled the more virtuosic material is also deserving of praise.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Pianist"" successfully blends all of its components into a compelling tale of survival. The film's three Oscars and four additional nominations were each richly deserved. As I see it, this is the best movie of 2002 and, furthermore, worthy of comparison with the pinnacle of Holocaust films, ""Schindler's List""."
"solussemper","10","0","0","6 August 2014"," The Pianist is a great Movie.
","The 2002 film the Pianist was an amazing story of Wladyslaw Szpilman a World War two holocaust survivor. This film was directed by Roman Polanski who himself was a Holocaust survivor. This combination created a film that brings the Holocaust to the big screen in a way never before realized. Szpilman is played in the film by Adrien Brody, who does an exceptional job at portraying the stoic Szpilman. This film represents in many ways the any of the Holocaust survivors, and the seeming randomness of the means by which they survived, as many did not. The director did not choose to make this a thriller for a purpose while there were certainly parts of this story that were thrilling to the survivor, Polanski's direction places emphasis on the mundane things, that at any moment could have gotten Szpilman caught. It was this chance, this randomness that Polanski wanted to bring to the viewer. The cinematography in this helps add to the grittiness and the realism of the film. In the final scenes when Hosenfeld, played by Thomas Kretschmann, discoveres Szpilmans hiding place Polanski uses pause in a very masterful way. In fact Polanski's use of pause throughout the movie brings it to life. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, I had never seen it before but as a World War Two film fan, I really enjoyed the story from a personal perspective. The fact that Polanski himself was a Holocaust survivor just adds to my interest, and love of the film. This film is a fantastic example of the stories of the Holocaust survivors."

"accelerius","9","0","0","21 July 2014"," One of the best holocaust films made
","The Pianist stars Adrien Brody as the titular character Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist living in Warsaw, Poland, during the second world war. While it has standard holocaust fare about the Jews being mistreated, you can't help but feel anger and sorrow at the sights of children being shot and piled up in the streets. The story revolves around how Wladyslaw tried to survive in the war torn city by hiding behind cupboards, living in the ruins of bombed houses or in apartments in which he was not allowed to make a single noise for fear of giving himself away.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski is in another world in this film. He himself was a victim of the German Nazi mistreatment and harassment as he lived during the war and he makes us feel as if we are too. He deserved the Academy Award which he received for this film. Only he could convey all the intense feelings of fear and depression of the Jews. The scenes were stark and violent at times and at others would bring a smile to your face. There is a marvelous scene in which Wladyslaw is in an apartment secretly and cannot make a single sound as the Germans will then hear him. He sees a piano in the same room and sits down to play it. We see his shoulders and head moving to music and hands moving as if he was playing and we even hear the music in the air. As we start to think that they will surely hear and start to fear, the camera shows that his hands are merely moving above the piano keys and we realize with relief and regret that he is not in reality making any sound, as the music is all in his head. <br/><br/>Adrien Brody is simply superb in this true story, playing a man who spends most of his screen time being quiet and not making a sound. His body language and facial expressions convey enough emotions to carry the entire film. He rightfully deserved the Academy Award, which he won at the age of 29 making him the youngest actor till date to win the award. He touches your heart and stays there. His role is definitely one i wouldn't be able to forget for a long time. <br/><br/>While the film is about the atrocities on the Jews, and for most of the part shows the inhumane and degrading conditions in which the Nazis make the Jews live in, the film doesn't make one want to run home and turn on Inglorious Basterds while throwing darts at a dartboard with a Hitler portrait on it. This effect was deliberate as it shows that not all who serve under the devil are demons. Roman Polanksi must be lauded for this open minded view considering that he himself was treated deplorably by the Nazis. <br/><br/>The story is simple yet will capture you and is one of the most classic true stories and the cinematography is memorable. Its the score that really stands out, especially the parts of the piano. The music is haunting and expertly performed. The acting of the rest of the cast, while it doesn't really stand out, is acceptable. The film is high on emotions and if you haven't seen any holocaust film before then is the right place to start. Watch it for one of the most legendary roles in the form of the pianist and for the unforgettable piece of world war 2 history."

","The Holocaust was one of the most degrading and upsetting times in world history, causing millions of deaths, war, and grueling survival. Adrien Brody stars as the Wladyslaw Szpilman, a true-life gifted Piano player in the 1940's who's life is drastically changed when the Nazi's invade his town in Poland, causing him to become separated from his family and his passion for music to be unable to fulfill. Szpilman goes through many terrifying situations with the Germans, and has many miraculous survival events that allow him to keep striving for a better life. Many powerful Holocaust images and scenes involving cruelty and violence are portrayed brilliantly to give the film a powerful nature that can be a lead up to the beautiful and cheerful later results. Roman Polanski directs ""The Pianist"" spectacularly, allowing history to be brought to life in a way that's wrapped around a compelling story with talented film making. Roman Polanski guides every member of this film to achieve success and works terrifically with his gifted actors. Adrien Brody not only looks and sounds the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman, but allows his true story to be honored and not forgotten after the hardship he faced. Brody's facial expressions and meek looking figure allow him to portray Szpillman perfectly. Hardship is a terrible road to go down through, and stories that take place during huge events such as the holocaust can be hard to make aware to the public. ""The Pianist"" is a story about one man trapped into a large nightmare, and the fact that it is a major motion picture allows that brave Pianist to allow his life-long legacy and brilliant survival skills to be honored and respected."

"barracuda377","9","0","0","4 May 2014"," A sad yet beautiful accounting of the life of a Jewish Pianist
","The Pianist directed by Roman Polanski is based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, played by Adrien Brody. The film takes into account the adversity that he and other Jews faced during the time that Nazis occupied the city of Warsaw, Poland. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the film we see Szpilman, an accomplished pianist in the studio recording his piano playing. As he plays there is a panic beginning to ensue as explosions are occurring throughout the city. During one of the explosions Szpilman suffers a minor injury to his head. When Szpilman arrives home he finds his family packing as if to flee Warsaw, and in the end like many other Jewish families they choose to remain in their homes. <br/><br/>Polanski incorporates a series of montages to show provide information that is prevalent to the circumstances. An example is when Szpilman's father, played by Frank Inlay is sitting at the table counting money as they discuss what to do with the extra they have been forbidden to have. A heated discussion ensues between Henryk, Szpilman's brother played by Ed Stoppard, his sister Regina, played by Julia Rayner and his other sister Halina, played by Jessica Kate Meyer. He then takes us into a walk that Szpilman takes with Dorita, played by Emilia Fox where they want to go to a local business establishment and they find themselves unable to enter as they do not serve Jews. By incorporating a montage like this the audience can see the transgression of the liberties that Jews were stripped of without having to relive the whole amount of time, and the audience is able to envision the strength that it took for the Jews to survive such treatment. <br/><br/>Szpilman and his family, like all Jews that chose to remain in Warsaw were moved to the Warsaw Ghetto, where they were to live and work. Polanski ensures we understand the struggles that the families went thru, the deaths they witnessed, and how in many cases they would chose to leave a blind eye to another being mistreated just to ensure that they survived. Szpilman during this time in the Ghetto attempted to save a young boy who had snuck under the wall and on his return was caught and being beaten as he attempted to crawl back through. As families were brutally murdered in the streets Szpliman's family sees others close their curtains and turn off their lights as if not seeing it means it did not happen. It is an example of surviving the onslaught of abuse to other humans as a means of keeping their own sanity. <br/><br/>As time continues on the families are yet again moved and even appear to be separated from each other. Those selected would be sent to a large courtyard where they sat for hours if not days prior to being put in to cargo cars and sent to Concentration Camps. Szpilman's family was one of the many Jewish families in this courtyard, in which a mother is beside herself for killing her baby, a young Jewish boy is selling caramels for a high price of which he will not be able to keep or use the money. They can only imagine what awaits them as they sit there together and the scene where they are loaded into the cargo cars is beyond disgusting. <br/><br/>Szpilman survives being placed in the cars and finds himself working at tearing down the walls that had been built around the Jewish Ghetto, now that they were almost all gone (other than those working). He continues on and ultimately finds a way to get in contact with someone he knows on the other side and is kept in hiding for quite some time. While it was not death, it was not a great situation for him as he was not allowed to go out and often times starved and taken advantage of. As his time of isolation continues he turns to his music, which seems to be a means of keeping his sanity. <br/><br/>When all those that had attempted to help him were no longer alive or able to continue assisting him, Szpilman finds himself doing all he could to survive on his own. In the end it is his return to the Jewish Ghetto that brings him face to face with a German soldier, Captain William Holsenfeld, played by Thomas Kretschmann. The fear in Szpilman's eyes as he is confronted for being somewhere he shouldn't, then the gratitude when Captain Holsenfeld not only spares his life, he also brings him food and provides him a jacket for extra warmth.<br/><br/>Overall this film was met with tears of sadness as I watched the abuse and persecution of those that practice the Jewish faith. It is disheartening to know that in the history of the world we continue to treat those that have different beliefs or values with such disregard. A couple days after watching this film I watched The Book Thief with my mother and husband, and while it was more about the German families and the impact the war had on them it was just as disheartening as it clearly showed that many of them did not believe in the mistreatment though many still averted their eyes. <br/><br/>I would definitely watch this movie again, and if you have not I would strongly suggest it. It is not for the faint at heart, though I think it is important that we realize that no person should have to struggle so against adversity to survive."

","As stories about vast sufferings such as genocide, holocaust, ethnic cleansing etc. are mostly revealed by sufferers-survivors, then they tend to be subjective and individualistic, full of hatred and grief, without so-called big picture, ""we"" are always good/right and ""they"" are always bad/wrong. Both the author of the autobiographical book (Władysław Szpilman) and its screenwriter (Ronald Harwood) have avoided the above and created a warmhearted, yet realistic and reasoned story about a Jewish family's fate around the events related to Warsaw Ghetto. The narration runs smoothly, we see people with different attitudes and characters among the Jews also, and not all Nazis were humiliators or ruthless killers... True, intellectuals such as musicians perceive the world in a different manner, they have more compassion and eagerness to understand rather than condemn, but still... The atmosphere is realistic, provides additional historical knowledge, and great choice of music plus talented aggregate direction makes The Pianist enjoyable to watch even if you the Szpilman's story (as I did not, the twists were additional value to me).<br/><br/>The cast consists mostly of European actors (apart from Adrien Brody, but his father is of Polish Jewish descent), and Nazis were played by Germans. Of course, Brody is the greatest of them, besides, he spends most time on screen. I think he fully deserved his multiple awards, including Academy Award for Best Actor. But also the rest of the cast fitted into the atmosphere well - both by looks-wise and performance-wise.<br/><br/>Altogether, The Pianist is a masterful panoramic narration and I liked it even more than Schindler's List."

Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero. Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.

This is through one man's view -- it isn't a Holocaust museum -- so the movie is not organized to drop one horror after another on the viewer.

","Basically, this movie features a pianist who survives the Nazi holocaust in Poland and somehow survives that long ordeal to become a great pianist again.<br/><br/>It starts off at a radio station in Warsaw, where the vintage concert pianist, Wladislaw Szpilman, was playing the Nocturne in C-sharp minor (opus posthumous) by Chopin, in a professional radio recording session. Suddenly, the first bomb in the Nazi blitzkrieg against Warsaw makes a near miss at the studio in the middle of the piece. Wladislaw decides to hang tough and continue playing until a second bomb shortly afterwards makes a direct hit at the recording studio, knocking out their session for good.<br/><br/>Wladislaw survives and runs back to his family and realizes that extremely drastic changes are coming for them. The first part is that Poland lets the Nazis take over Warsaw unchallenged after the first bombs fell. Then, immediate restrictions on Warsaw's Jewish families by the Nazis in Warsaw affect Wladislaw's family as well, forcing them to do things like wear the star of David on their wrists.<br/><br/>Then, the ultimate restriction takes place as the Nazis' close off Warsaw, build a new wall and make what is called The Warsaw Ghetto, forcing Wladislaw and his family to move inside the ghetto. <br/><br/>Their family tries to survive that but after a Nazi raid on an apartment across the street from their flat that led to every family member being executed, they know that the continued Nazi crackdowns are not over. <br/><br/>Then, most of Wladislaw's family is forced into a new flat, and eventually, hoarded off to the Treblinka death camp, but Wladislaw is spared from going to Treblinka with a help of a Jewish ghetto police officer who was his friend. <br/><br/>The surviving Wladislaw families then become slave laborers, including Wladislaw himself, but then, a few of Wladislaw's friends make plans to fight back against the Nazis. Wladislaw then finally makes a ruse to get out of the ghetto undetected, which he does. His helpers then let him move to a new flat by one of his friends...outside the ghetto. <br/><br/>Suddenly, Wladislaw witnesses the first uprising and he realizes now that the Polish can fight against tyranny. The first uprising fails, but this leads to other stronger anti-Nazi uprisings later on. When Wladislaw had to flee his temporary flat to a flat just near the temporary German police headquarters, everything went well until new Polish uprising skirmishes cause the Nazis to fight back and eventually destroy part of the flat by a Panzer tank, forcing Wladislaw out again and end up in hiding. <br/><br/>He does find a abandoned house that he squatters, but then confronts a German officer who would have killed Wladislaw but he said to him that he was a pianist. That officer then allows Wladislaw to stay in the attic as the house turns into a temporary SS logistics post as the Russian Red Army advances towards Poland with distant artillery fire that Wladislaw hears. <br/><br/>The firing eventually stops, and the Germans in that post then have to pull out, as well the officer, and he gives to Wladislaw his raincoat and leaves. As Warsaw is liberated on V-E day, Wladislaw makes the mistake of wearing that Nazi coat as he goes out, and almost gets shot dead by a Polish army platoon but he counters that he is Polish, getting his life spared.<br/><br/>We then see the Treblinka death camp being liberated, and the German officer who helped him now is detained with hundreds of Wehrmacht soldiers at a temporary area just near the camp. One of the Wladislaw family members who survived the camp then rails at that officer.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie ends with him performing the ""Grande Polonaise"" over an orchestra, an example of his resilience."

","This is a film that I had been meaning to watch for quite some time, but have only recently got around to it. Potential viewers should be aware that this film is quite harrowing, and is difficult to watch, as indeed any realistic portrayal of this bleak time for humanity will necessarily be.<br/><br/>A very normal and vibrant Jewish family are initially relatively nonplussed by the advance of the Germans into Poland. This is a powerful way to setup what is to come, and allows the viewer the unique chance to remember that this is likely how it actually was. This family had no way of knowing the true horror of what was coming their way, and the opening scenes get this across effectively with an interesting and diverse range of personalities portrayed in a normal family.<br/><br/>As the narrative progresses we see the family initially remain strong in testing circumstances, and they slowly begin to break as the creeping inhumanity of their surroundings and circumstances takes its toll.<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes of this film are a powerful reminder of the lead up to the Holocaust itself and how Jews were systematically de-humanised by the Nazis. The remainder of the film follows the pianist in his attempts to survive the remains of the Nazi occupation.<br/><br/>This film doesn't have the emotional hook of Schindler's List despite tackling similar subject matter - although there is a similar Schindler moment towards the end. However, it is difficult to find fault. It is a gritty, depressing and effectively claustrophobic story of a man who managed to survive where few others did. It touches on a variety of themes, such as the question of Jewish resistance and the extent to which such a thing was even possible. It always seems to be obvious to the retrospective observer that resistance had to happen, but we regularly forget that these people did not see what was coming. It is an interesting theme that is touched upon throughout, but I won't comment further as my knowledge of the subject is too limited to comment with any authority.<br/><br/>The screenplay, script and acting are superb throughout, and this is a film that any student of history must watch. It is not however to be recommended to someone looking for an evening's light entertainment."

And I know it was, and so should you.<br/><br/>I think that this is best Holocaust film ever made. Its a sad and moving film and at times rather disturbing. And I can't forget Brody's performance. This is the best performance of his career.

","Roman Polanski's take on the infamous Nazi Torture on the Jews is fascinating and enthralling. It is based on the autobiography of the same name by Wladyslaw Szpilman. The movie is based on the survival journey of a Jew Pianist, Szpilman, during the horrible times of World War-II.<br/><br/>Credit has to be given to the director for portraying the brutality of the Nazi Germans with impeccable perfection. If anyone requires any justification of the Basterds' cruel works against Nazis in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' , then this is the movie which provides it. Basically this movie is shown from the eyes of a common Jew whose life drastically changed due to the Germans' invasion in Poland.<br/><br/>Though there are many side-characters, but there is only main character; and that is Szpilman. Adrien Brody does full justification to my expectation from him in this movie. I expected him to be better than Daniel-Day-Lewis in 'Gangs of New-York' and Jack Nicholson in 'About Schmidt' as he have beaten both of them to win the Oscar of best actor. So if I say he fulfills my expectation - that says a lot.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's direction is brilliant, so is the musical notes of the piano used in the movie.

"Eternality","9","0","0","22 May 2011"," The Pianist is a realistic account of one of the darkest periods of humanity through the melancholic eyes of Adrien Brody's Szpilman
","Winning three Oscars including Best Director and the top prize at Cannes, The Pianist is Roman Polanski's lifelong dream come true. Polanski shot to international stardom with Knife In The Water in 1962, a film about sexual rivalry. He would revisit the theme of sex in his next few films such as Repulsion and Cul-De-Sac. His best known work remains to be the incomparable Chinatown, one of the few truly defining films of 70s American cinema. <br/><br/>The Pianist somehow feels like an anomaly in Polanski's body of work. It is a historical drama about Nazi persecution in WWII Poland. Yet it is undoubtedly his most personal film to date. A Jew himself, Polanski is born of Polish parents who were sent to concentration camp. His maturity in handling a tough subject matter like the Holocaust can be observed by the manner in which he directed the film. <br/><br/>Unlike Spielberg's Schindler's List, Polanski has shot The Pianist in full color. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Pawel Edelman (Ray, Oliver Twist) is stunning. The elegant architecture of Warsaw radiates in many scenes, and the texture of every frame is so smooth that the film seems like a seamless storyboard of expertly-directed and edited sequences one after another, though there are some pacing problems that mar the viewing experience. <br/><br/>There is one hauntingly exquisite scene towards the end of the film showing Adrien Brody's character, Szpilman, climbing over a wall. As he makes it to the other side, the camera elevates slowly from behind the wall to reveal a desolate piece of snow-covered land with rows of wrecked houses either side of a wide, gaping path. This scene represents the culmination of the impressive cinematographic vision of both Polanski and Edelman for The Pianist. <br/><br/>Adrien Brody who wins the Oscar cuts a display of sympathy. One of the most apt casting decisions in recent years, Brody embodies not so much the physicality of the Jews, but rather a figure of restrained calmness that typifies Jews of that time. Knowing the fate of his race under the brutal stranglehold of Hitler, Szpilman somewhat escapes certain death, riding on luck most of the time, and the support of close 'underground' allies. <br/><br/>Unlike Schindler's List, The Pianist only elicits muted emotional responses from the audience. While harrowing at times, Polanski's film lacks the power and emotional depth that made Spielberg's black-and- white masterpiece one of the greatest films of all-time. Another flaw of The Pianist lies in the second half during scenes of Szpilman hiding out alone in one apartment after another in a German-occupied region. During this time, the film moves the slowest, appearing lackluster and flat, somewhat bereft of hope that the remainder of the film might return to its compelling first half. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, The Pianist is a realistic account of one of the darkest periods of humanity through the melancholic eyes of Adrien Brody's Szpilman, one of Poland's most well-known musicians. The film signifies a return to form for Polanski whom faded away in the late 80s. He is past his prime, but once in a while, he is still capable of jolting fans of cinema awake with beautiful motion pictures like this.

But also how he found both cruelty and kindness were least expected. At the same time it is a good testament of how Jews in common around him were treated. How many were killed or deported, fates that Szpilman only narrowly escaped.<br/><br/>Well acted with Adrien Brody in the lead, and directed by Roman Polanski, the story is handled delicately. Both grand schemes and details are told. Most notably Szpilman's musicality is used to enhance feelings and memories in a few scenes. It's told and acted in a fashion, mostly low key, that augments the important statement it is. It also makes the movie, and the characters, easy to connect with and feel for.

","In the movie ""The Pianist"", Władysław Szpilman is a famous Polish Jewish pianist working for Warsaw Radio.

He was hiding from bunker to bunker, looking desperately for bread crumbs or even a drop of water to help him survive for the next day. Szpilman survived with the help of his friend, and luck.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie ""The Pianist"", the director Roman Polanski focused on the sadistic of the SS officers, especially when they throw out the handicap old man from the balcony because he could not salute them! Besides, the director illustrates another aspect of the movie, when he presents the passionate of the pianist, describing Szpilman playing piano.<br/><br/>The horrible scenes of the annihilated buildings, streets, and houses associated with the style of dressing of the 1940, gave the movie a sense of reality. The idea of the movie focused on how a human can survive using his brain, and luck is a good example of what the movie addressed. We can see that through the chances Szpilman had; he was arrested, sent to a ghetto, he escaped and got shot, and finally a German officer discovered that he was hiding, instead of killing him, he gave him food and looked after him."

"TheUnknown837-1","9","0","0","27 September 2009"," a powerful, harrowing film depicting one of the darkest eras in history composed of the memories of two men who experienced it first-hand
","""The Pianist"" is a movie of the most appropriate kind. It tells a dark, harrowing true story, coming from the minds and memories of two people who experienced it first-hand. The movie is based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Spzilman and was directed by Roman Polanski, who both escaped from the Jewish ghettos in Poland and went into hiding until the Second World War had ended. ""The Pianist"" is a composition composed of their memories and experiences and what results is a truly terrific, highly-detailed depiction of one of the darkest moments in human history.<br/><br/>The movie depicts the life of Wladyslaw Spzilman (Adrien Brody), a Polish pianist who like all other Jews in Nazi-controlled Europe was forced into a ghetto during World War Two. After being separated from his family, Spzilman climbed over the wall and went into hiding with and sometimes without help from German sympathizers.<br/><br/>Director Polanski, who lost his mother to the Holocaust, obviously not only used his own memories of the ghetto and the war, but collected enormous research in preparation for filming, because ""The Pianist"" depicts some truly harrowing situations such as this moment where a German officer, out of boredom, orders about twenty Jewish prisoners to line up. At random, he selects about half of them, orders them to lie flat on their stomachs, and then one by one walks by, shooting them in the head along the way and then letting the others go on. Like in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, ""Schindler's List"" (1933), ""The Pianist"" does a tremendously great job at depicting the evil of the Nazis and the joy of their murders and torture.<br/><br/>But also like ""Schindler's List"", Polanski does not simply display all of Nazi-controlled Europe as evil and prejudiced and murderous. Because like in real life, there were a great many people who did not look upon the Jewish people as less than human and delved into danger, risking their own lives and security to help them. The basic message is that prejudice and hatred exists, but it must be controlled and not be allowed to take over.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody, who is seldom off-camera won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Spzilman and that's an absolutely commendable reward. Brody maintains the illusion that he's the real Wladyslaw Spzilman, never succumbing to the tendencies to go over the top with his performance or underplay his hand. He does not become too heroic or too somber. Brody personifies the terrible feeling of loss, but also the dwindling flame of hope and the will to keep going.<br/><br/>Now there are some flaws to the movie. Roman Polanski does sometime go a little over the edge with his directing. Sometimes his montages of the ghetto and the city go on for a little too long and there is one sequence in particular where Spzilman plays Frederic Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in its almost full form. And while the music is beautiful, we must remember, this is a film we're watching, not a concert. And the movie does run for about twenty minutes too long, but other than that, this is a more than recommendable Holocaust movie. And again, its true power comes from the fact that it composed of the memories of two men who went through similar experiences and were fortunate enough just to survive the war, although the real Spzilman had to live out the rest of his life without what he'd lost and Polanski continues to do so today. And that is true not just of them, but of millions."

","The Pianist is a dramatic Holocaust film about Wladyslaw Szpilman's experiences during World War II. A brilliant Jewish pianist played by Adrien Brody, he quickly gains the audience's sympathy after being a victim of the horrific, methodic actions of the Third Reich. It appears that the film never strays far from the truth, which in turn makes the it all the more emotional.<br/><br/>There are some very chilling moments, but I think the most powerful parts of the film are where kindness is shown by people who you don't expect it from. Szpilman's life is saved several times by strangers that provide shelter and food, and even by a couple individuals employed by the Nazis. I felt that those things give the film an optimistic tone.<br/><br/>Brody's acting is great and he deserved his Oscar. Since the entire film revolves around his performance, this was an important aspect for its success. Other performances are effective as well. The directing by Roman Polansky is solid and shows no considerable error.<br/><br/>I would not find The Pianist to be an overly disturbing film at all, despite the fact that several characters close to Szpilman are killed. The full scale of the Holocaust is hidden from the scope of the film, which is due to Szpilman's luck at escaping. A wide range of emotions are displayed throughout the film, but what you are left with is an admiration of Szpilman's life."

","""Music was his passion. Survival was his masterpiece.""<br/><br/>Filmmaker Roman Polanski, who as a boy growing up in Poland watched while the Nazis devastated his country during World War II, directed this downbeat drama based on the true story of a privileged musician who spent five years struggling against the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy Jewish family in Poland. The Szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in Warsaw which Wladyslaw shares with his mother and father (Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay), his sisters Halina and Regina (Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner), and his brother, Henryk (Ed Stoppard). While Wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of German forces and Hitler's designs on Poland, they're convinced that the Nazis are a menace which will pass, and that England and France will step forward to aid Poland in the event of a real crisis. Wladyslaw's naïveté is shattered when a German bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. During the early stages of the Nazi occupation, as a respected artist, he still imagines himself above the danger, using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. But as the German grip tightens upon Poland, Wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. Refusing to face a certain death, Wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. However, when his benefactor goes missing, Wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another, desperate to avoid capture by German occupation troops. The Pianist was based on the memoir of the same name by the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman; the book was first published in 1946 as Death of a City, but was banned by Polish Communist officials and went out of print until 1998, when a new edition was issued as The Pianist. <br/><br/>Review The Pianist is a stunning masterpiece directed by Roman Polanski and starring Adrien Brody in quite possibly the best role he's ever done. He basically carried the film whole throughout and I'm glad to say he carried it real good. Some scenes required no dialogue, only the body movement and the raw emotion of Adrien Brody, it was just a spectacle. I can see why he won the Oscars, he really deserved it. He gave his all in this masterpiece of a film and he reaped the golden fruits of his labor. Roman Polanski on the other hand, excellently handled the camera, he showed exactly what needs to be shown, no BS. <br/><br/>The film tackles very sensitive topics and Polanski didn't even flinch, he wants us to see the grimness of those dark days. Example, there's this one scene where this lady asked an SS Officer where they're taking them and the SS Officer without remorse, shot the lady point blank in the head. Just so dark and grim and he wanted us to see it all.<br/><br/>A tip of the hat to the cast and crew of The Pianist for making such a masterpiece. This is a fine film that you wouldn't want to miss."

","I was reluctant to see this movie at first because I thought it was going to be a copycat off of Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Since he was among the first to depict the inhumanity and horrors of the Holocaust, I thought ""The Pianist"" would be weak in comparison. After more than five years of its release, I finally decided to sit down and watch ""The Pianist"".<br/><br/>Since seeing Polanski's ""Chinatown"" (earlier this summer), never have I been so captivated by a movie. There is no comparison between this and ""Schindler's List"". Both are two totally different movies. After saying that, ""The Pianist"" is about the life of musician Wladyslaw Szpilman, who works at a radio station during WWII.<br/><br/>Adrian Brody is subtle and marvelous as Szpilman. I've only seen him in a couple of movies, and this is his best work. The uniqueness of his character is that he's an ordinary man thrown into hellish circumstances. He gets separated from his family; he survives the termination of the Warsaw Ghetto, and the many battles that erupt in Poland. Everything is shown from his viewpoint. It is very disturbing and shocking, reminding me and audiences everywhere what had happened only sixty years ago.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski captures these scenes unusually. He doesn't just throw them in your face, but keeps them in Szpilman's point of view. For instance, in the Warsaw Ghetto, there's a scene where a family is massacred because they're awake during curfew. Rather than showing it up-close, it keeps it is at a distance in the apartment of where Szpilman is hiding. This adds to the fear you feel for his character and safety. <br/><br/>The works of the score and cinematography adds to the film's mood and plot. Of all the scenes in this film, the one that moved me the most is when Szpilman is forced to play the piano by Captain Hosenfeld. As he plays the piano, the expressions Brody reveals are tear-jerking. He's sad for what he has witnessed and the losses he had suffered, yet also he is happy because he's playing the piano, his one true love. As those emotions collide, they reflect not only how passionately he plays the piano, but also on his character's demons and struggles that he shows through indescribable facial expressions. I personally feel this is why he got his Oscar, which is very fair.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" is a movie that should not be forgotten nor overlooked by audiences everywhere. The only disappointment I have toward this movie is that it did not get Best Picture for the year 2002. 10/10"

","""The Pianist"" is among the most regarded and praised movies about the Holocaust. It's a powerful, realistic and shocking movie, like ""Schindler's List"". However, it is shot in colors and it isn't 3 hours long, unlike that one. Besides, it was directed by Roman Polanski.<br/><br/>Although this is a war movie (a type of film which I don't appreciate), there are two things that I liked very much about this: the soft, relaxing and beautiful sound of piano and Adrien Brody's performance (which is incredible and absolutely amazing) as the Jewish polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.<br/><br/>It's not wrong to say that this is just another Holocaust film. That is one way to see things. But we can see things in a different way instead. Each war movie deals with the same basic subject, but each one has its own characteristics. For example, ""La Vitta è Bella"" focus on a character with great humor and colorful imagination. ""Empire of the Sun"" is about a boy fascinated by planes and the war in China and Japan (Pearl Harbor). ""Schindler's List"" is about a German who saves thousands of lives. ""The Pianist"" is about a genial musician. ""Edges of the Lord"" is about a Jewish little boy who is a fugitive to escape from a fatal destiny. And I could go on forever...<br/><br/>Overall, a reasonable film, but not very recommendable for those who are not into this subject."

","More than a masterpiece on the poetry of wartime, Roman Polanski uses the eyes of an artist in his tribute to the suffering of Jews in Warsaw. Less concrete than that of a soldier, yet more resistant, the experience of Wvadyslav Szpilman expresses his negligence of the gravity of the wartime situation to an unfortunate sudden change of fate. <br/><br/>Polanski's picture of WW2 Warsaw is a very deep one, revealing details which characterized the Jewish suffering with an outstanding touche of proximity; a fight over a pan of soup which ends with a man licking up spilt porridge on the ground, a woman gone mad after the disappearance of her husband, another one having herself caused her baby to suffocate as she tried to conceal its cries...<br/><br/>This movie goes beyond the details of the ongoing of the war itself to reveal the sad and frustrating consequences on its victims. How can Wadek survive without his family, without food but even more with his ever growing urge to satisfy his wish to play a piano. He follows the sound of playing as often as he is lucky to. In this a perfect repertoire is mounted, involving Beethoven, Bach, etc.<br/><br/>Wadek's pure and sympathetic nature seems to call for tolerance in wartime. Funny  and creative, he could eventually be considered a spectator to these events. One could attribute the luck he has and the intermittent support he receives to some providence.

","This film wasn't nearly as good as I expected.  It tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, Poland's most accomplished pianist, who escaped the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.  This is not the assault on your emotions that ""Schindler's List"" was.  Rather, it's pretty much a tale of survival, how one man plumbs the depths of humanity and survives to play his beloved music again.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody plays Szpilman, and he does it well.  He has to because one of my complaints is that there's little character development other than Szpilman.  We're introduced to his family in Warsaw and get to know them, but they're carted off to the death camps before the halfway point of the movie.  <br/><br/>One of the best lines in the film occurs here.  Szpilman tells his sister as she's about to be loaded into a freight car, ""I know this is an awkward time to say this, but I wish I knew you better.""  She smiles back warmly at him. Very real and very touching.<br/><br/>But after Szpilman is pulled out of the line by a friend and spared, it's basically just him for the second half of the movie.  We meet people on his work crew where he's found refuge and the people in the underground who help him hide from the Nazis, but they're only on screen briefly and are never really developed as characters in the film.  <br/><br/>The closest we get to seeing into the soul of another person is when a Nazi officer finds him hiding in the attic of a bombed-out building and gives him food and a coat to wear.  But even here, the Nazi captain, played by Thomas Kletschmann, is only in the film for a few minutes and then reappears briefly in the end where he's about to be shipped off to his death in a Russian prison camp.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody plays his part well, but he's not an expressive actor, at least not in this role.  He looks dignified and a bit aloof at first, then develops the mournful gaze of someone who's seen too many bad things, but it's all in the eyes.  There isn't a whole lot of dialogue other than what's needed to advance the story.<br/><br/>Not a bad film, but not a classic.  An interesting tale of one man's determination to survive, but it could just as easily been about someone trapped on a deserted island as it was about someone in wartime Poland."

"relias","Null","0","0","8 May 2003"," The Holocaust without tears
","Director Roman Polanski's The Pianist  is based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's account of his survival during the Nazi Holocaust in Poland. A Jew, Szpilman was a noted pianist for Warsaw radio in 1939 when Hitler's troops occupied his country. We watch Szpilman's family wear Star of David armbands identifying them as Jews, then suffer starvation and brutality in the Warsaw ghetto. His parents and sisters climb into boxcars to take them to the Treblinka death camp. He escapes; they don't. Whether his survival means anything is a question this powerful and austere film is too intelligent to answer.<br/><br/>	The Pianist is a personal film for Polanski, whose mother was killed in a death camp, and is the first film shot in his native Poland since his breakout international hit Knife in the Water in 1962. That success led to Hollywood triumphs with Rosemary's Baby (1968) and Chinatown (1974), films darkened by a sense of evil that, after watching The Pianist, seems like the shadow of childhood experience. (Personal tragedy further darkened his vision. His wife, actress Sharon Tate, was slain by Charles Manson's `family' in 1969. Eight years later Polanski was convicted on a sex charge and fled to Europe to escape prison.)<br/><br/>	Unlike recent Holocaust films, The Pianist never shows what happened in the death camps. Polanski almost ruthlessly limits his camera to what Szpilman saw, relying on the viewer's knowledge for historical context. Brick walls rise around the ghetto, German soldiers randomly shoot Jews in the street, and a few ghetto activists argue for armed resistance against their captors.<br/><br/>	But one mark of genius is that Polanski's camera is not entirely subjective. His theme is the mystery and meaning of survival amid genocide. Polanski and writer Ronald Harwood embody this theme in a character that evokes empathy but not sympathy. Szpilman's artistic aloofness, imaged in the first scene when he continues to play Chopin in a radio studio while German shells explode outside, suggests Polanski chose this story because Szpilman witnessed events without participating in them. The meaning of his survival when millions died is thus as inexplicable to Polanski as it is for us.<br/><br/>	The Pianist offers few moments of personal drama and no character arc. Szpilman's escape from the ghetto is abetted by a Jewish policeman whose earlier offer to join the goon squad of the Judenrat Szpilman had turned down. Outside the ghetto walls, sympathizers and friends who remember his talent leave him to starve in Warsaw apartments, like everyone else in that embattled city. Long stretches without dialogue follow efforts to find food in broken buildings, culminating in an encounter with a Nazi officer (Thomas Kretschmann) in a scene that is surprising, moving, and ultimately as enigmatic as Szpilman's earlier attempts to escape extermination.<br/><br/>	In one scene, a singer he knew in happier days looks out the window of his hiding place at the ruined ghetto, pounded to rubble after the 1943 uprising. When Szpilman hints he should have remained inside, she says the Jewish resistance `died with dignity.' Yes, they did, and the pianist understands this, but  false heroics are not a choice in the face of the Nazi killing machine. The Pianist gains power in scenes that reduce words to impossible gestures.<br/><br/>	Adrien Brody's lean frame and ethnic face limited him in previous movies to strong character roles. The Pianist calls on his real talent. He keeps the movie moving through long sequences when his character is doing nothing except enduring in silence. In one he uncovers a piano and moves his fingers above the keyboard in a mime of a Chopin nocturne while the music plays in his head. Art can be an escape from horror, but that is not Polanski's point; the horror is always just outside the window or in the next apartment if he is overheard by the Polish woman who, later, shrieks `Jew!' when Szpilman is forced to flee.<br/><br/>	His performance helps measure the distance between our engagement with Szpilman and Polanski's assessment of the significance of his main character's survival. Entirely believable in the role and aided by careful casting in minor roles (Maureen Lipman, who plays the mother, looks like she could be Brody's mother), the actor becomes an Everyman who depends on luck, pure and simple, to stay alive until the Russian army triumphs in 1945.<br/><br/>        Character is not fate in a world gone mad. Polanski's film escapes the sentimentality of Holocaust films such Schindler's List or Life is Beautiful.  Its harsh realism and closely-observed period feel turn us instead to enigmas pondered by the late Italian writer Primo Levi: millions died, some survived, those bear witness, let others extract the meaning if they can."

","Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>The Pianist is the powerful true story of holocaust survivor and talented piano player Wladislaw Szpilman, who escaped certain death in the extermination camps and outlasted the war hiding out from the Nazi's in Warsaw, Poland. A story that is obviously very personal to controversial filmmaker Roman Polanski and is handled with great thought and care. Adrien Brody is very good as the title character, a member of the upper-class living in Poland with his family which include his mother and father, his brother and two sisters. He makes a living and a name for himself playing the piano for a radio station until the beginning of World War II when Germany invaded Poland and stormed into its capital city. As a Jew, Wladislaw and his family are rounded up like dogs with some 500,000 other Polish Jews and ushered into a concentrated part of the city until they are sent off to ""labor"" camps. This film is about what people do to survive and what lengths people are willing to go to make sure of that survival. People are completely stripped of their dignity and pride and are forced to turn on each other. I thought the first hour of this film was great, with its often shocking brutality of the German's, the utter despair of the Jews and the togetherness of Szpilman's family. After he gets separated from his family(rather by a little luck I might add) and forced to survive on his own I felt the film lost a lot of where its heart lie. The rest of the film is Szpilman moving from hiding place to burnt out hiding place avoiding detection by the Nazi's and Non-Polish Jews always scrounging for food and water. It does become very redundant and tiresome and some could consider it boring. Even as his fellow Jews do try and fight back Szpilman still hides in the shadows. As somebody mentioned earlier it does come off as very cowardly and I have no problem in pointing that out. As I said this is a film about what people do to survive, but still Szpilman's unwillingness to take any real action makes us feel less sympathy for him...and this is a character that we should care about. Overall, The Pianist is a good film about Holocaust survivor Wladislaw Szpilman but not a great one. A good, thoughtful story by director Roman Polanski featuring a good performance by Adrien Brody but ultimately really doesn't deliver the power and lasting impression a story like this should."

","What an incredibly performance! I can't believe Daniel Day Lewis is beating Jack Nicholson and Adrien Brody in the race for the oscar. He is great, but it's a flashy part compared to their achievements. After the first 45 minutes or so of this movie, Adrien Brody hardly speaks. He acts through facial expressions, the way he walks, the way he moves. Even when he does speak, it takes him long moments to do so, as a person who had not spoken for a while would speak. He is never less than totally engrossing. Both he and Nicholson play their parts understatedly, not relying on the showy grandeur of Daniel Day Lewis' part, but on their realism. This relies far more on the intelligence of the audience. Then again, given the Academy's prediliction for giving awards to people playing psycopaths or disabled people this isn't surprising."

","First let me make myself clear and say Roman Polanski is a disgusting pervert and I would love nothing more than to bring him back here and throw him in jail. Now, the film................................... As I watched this powerful film I had to be honest with myself on two levels. One, I feel its a notch or two below ""Schindler's List"" and we have seen this type of story filmed before. Two, a week after seeing this film I was still haunted by several scenes in the film and by the whole story itself. Very strong images that I just cannot forget. I guess thats the ultimate compliment. I just can't forget it. Adrien Brody is very strong in this film and his performance shows not just a character who survived but was so strong willed while everything began to unfold in his country and the atrocities started to rear its head and part of his strength shows as he helps hold his family together for as long as he can. The shots of the burnt out neighborhoods in Warsaw are very striking to look at. Brody climbs a wall and heads into what looks like miles of a demolished city.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** Towards the end of the film its very ironic that his greatest talent will ultimately save his life. He was lucky that the Nazi officer he plays the piano for obviously appreciates a true artist and was clearly awe struck by such beautiful playing. This is a special film and its story never ceases to be powerful and haunting no matter how many times you see it.

I am not yet sure what my true feelings are for this movie. It is not that kind of film where you can say you enjoyed watching it. But, definitely gives you a kind of shiver that touches the very deep part of your heart. Imagine having a rough journey of four years during the WWII where you experience both emotional and psychological tension. Then the world starts to seem in a different color where everything is grey. This is the part where the main character, Szpilman, becomes to shine.

","I've been a long time fan of Roman Polanski.  Since seeing his ""Tenant,"" many years ago I couldn't take my eyes off his movies, well with a few exceptions.  To me, even the director himself is enigmatic and complex like his creations.  However, I went in to see the ""Pianist"" expecting a non-Polanski film.  What I saw was certainly not a typical Polanski film, but nonetheless I enjoyed the film tremendously for many reasons. <br/><br/>
For one thing, I almost always don't like movies about the Holocaust, especially the overly serious ones made in Hollywood.  You know the ones about the triumph of human spirit, good Jews vs. the evil Germans as if people were born into one of these categories.  How is that any different from Hitler proclaiming that the Aryan race was inherently superior? Anyway, this movie is not without a measure of the afore mentioned.  After all this entire film is about one man's struggle to hold out til the war ended, and he does triumph at the end.  What makes this special is the way Polanski handled this man's struggle.  He does this without being overly sentimental.  Instead of people being heroes or villains in the traditional sense, the characters become human beings.  Being a human being means many different things.  Polanski shows the Jews in the ghetto engaging in the whole gamut of human affairs; being petty,being selfish,being cruel as well as being dignified,brave and most of all utterly human.  Although the Germans are still portrayed as ruddy faced evildoers (and yes they were, I'm not denying that), there were moments in this film that made me see that some of them were probably ordinary people caught in the extraordinarily evil regime of Hitler.  Perhaps they just didn't have the courage to take a stand, or see the truth.  In this kind of situation, being evil was painfully easy.  <br/><br/>Some have objected to the film for having no story.  I say what the F*** was Brody character doing the whole time?  For the most part we see him alone, but that doesn't mean that there is no story.  I thought it was refreshing to see what life was like for those who were in hiding during that time. We've seen plenty of concentration camps, but what about the survivors who spents years in solitude waiting for the war to end?  The terrifying loneliness and isolation are palpable in this movie.  Some of these scenes reminded me of the Polanski's character in ""Tenant.""  In a way, this film parallels Polanski's life.  As Szpilman was forced into isolation from his art, and forced into hiding, Polaski also spent the latter half of his career in a form of hiding.  Of course, the difference in these situations is glaring.  Szpilman's predicament was not caused by him whereas Polanski allegedly did commit statutory rape.  Regardless, when Szpilman is saved by the German captain who appreciates his art, and ultimately saves his life, I felt that somehow Polanki yearned for his own savior who would recognize his art.  <br/><br/>I didn't think this was his best movie for I truly treasure his unique sense of humor in his other movies.  I think this was his way of thumbing his nose at the world the way David Lynch did with ""Straight Story.""  For some odd reason, festivals almost always prefer serious dramas dealing with the afrementioned triumph of human spirit.  Polanski told the world, ""Hey if I want to I can play your game, and play it better than you.""  Now that he proved his point, I hope he'll return to his old ways..."

","The Pianist, directed by Roman Polanski, is the story of Polish-Jewish classical pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who lived in hiding for two and a half years during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Both Polanski and Szpilman shared a similar experience in the war and both survived to enrich the world with the power of their art. Adapted by the playwright Ronald Harwood (The Dresser) from Szpilman's memoirs, the film is a powerful indictment of the horrors of the Holocaust told through the perspective of a lone survivor, one of only 200 of Warsaw's 400,000 Jews. Working as a radio pianist in Warsaw, Poland at the time of the Nazi invasion in 1939, Szpilman and his family were rounded up and ""relocated"" to an area of Warsaw set aside for Jews. The step-by-step brutalization of Warsaw's Jews is devastatingly recorded by Polanski's camera --from having to wear identifying armbands to being banned from parks and public benches. As played by the brilliant Adrien Brody, Szpilman's demeanor slowly changes during the course of the film from cockiness to growing desperation.<br/><br/>When Szpilman's family is herded onto a train en route to certain death at Treblinka, he is pulled aside by a Polish policeman he knew and sent back to labor detail in the ghetto. After being promised assistance from the underground, he escapes and spends the rest of the war on the run, going from one safe house to another. When help is no longer forthcoming, he has to hide in the attic of a bombed out building, struggling to elude capture and to find scraps of food to survive. The Pianist is strongest in depicting the horrors of daily life in Warsaw during the war and there are truly shocking moments. Polanski does not flinch from showing us children shot in the streets, an elderly man thrown to his death in his wheelchair, and a young boy crawling under a stone wall, getting half way through, then grabbed from the other side and beaten to death.<br/><br/>This is a film whose images will remain etched in your memory. Thomas P. Muhl, who underwent a similar experience in Budapest, attests to the film's eerie authenticity in his memoir Retouching Stalin's Moustache, (Xlibris Publishing)*. He recalls ""the hiding in abandoned apartments and being spooked by objects the people had left behind like unfinished cups of coffee, scarfes, and toys. Looking out the windows of these places, feeling trapped and seeing the poor people being hauled away from across the street, wondering when my turn will come. Sneaking around at nights in other apartments during an air raid, looking for food and being afraid that one of the neighbors would rat on me. The sense of total devastation around me, ruins and corpses.""<br/><br/>The Pianist is an honest film that refuses to trade on sentimentality to achieve its power. Szpilman's reluctance to let us in on his thoughts about his family, friends, and the people who helped keep him alive make him appear aloof, but the reality is so far beyond normal comprehension that emotional numbness may be the only appropriate response. When Brody finds a kindred soul in the German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) who discovers his hiding place, however, we are finally drawn into the humanity of his character. It is here that the soulful music of Chopin's Nocturne in C played by Szpilman in a hollowed-out apartment in the midst of desolation lends a bizarre beauty to the unfathomable night."

We are spared nothing of the sheer brutality of those butchers and the reproduction of several aspects of everyday life in the occupied city is shown in a very realistic and convincing way. In the second part the protagonist (a renowned Jewish pianist) without ceasing to be a victim manages by hiding himself until the end of the occupation and thus becomes also a terrified witness of all the events which took place in Warsaw between 1942 and 1945 namely the ghetto and the city uprisings and finally its liberation by the Red Army. He owes his survival after all not only to good luck but also to the help of friends and foes with human feelings namely a member of the Jewish police created by the Nazis and a German officer who listens to him playing piano for the first time after the beginning of his ordeal. This is a climax scene which will make you swallow a lump in your throat out of emotion while watching it. It's a scene which will remain in the History of Cinema.

I've seen what I consider to be the epitome of World War II films, 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindler's List', and I've had enough.  The movies today pull no punches. Blood, death, war, cruelty.  It's why war is hell. Today's filmmakers can be as graphic and real as they wish.  And I suppose that's the problem I have. It's all so real, it hurts.  One-third of the way through, I considered getting up and leaving.  But like a rubbernecker, I stayed to see the rest of the carnage, and hopefully a glimmer of humanity.<br/><br/>I'm glad I stayed.  After behaving fairly 'normally' in the beginning, Adrien Brody as Szpilman gets to act his way to his Oscar nomination.  The camera is rarely off him; the movie must live or die with Brody's ability to move us.  By the end, you see the work that went into the part, the gauntness, the hunger, the pain.  After seeing the other films nominated with the 'Best Actor' category, I believe Brody deserves the Oscar.  It will probably be the role of his life.<br/><br/>What I liked best was the 'tunnelvision'.  We could often only see what Szpilman saw, like out of a small window, as if the rest of the world were this vast unknown.  All we knew what was in front of us-- death and more death.  All we knew was what Szpilman appeared to feel-- ""Stay alive"".  He does, by luck and opportunities taken.  <br/><br/>Szpilman is not a hero, nor is he portrayed as one.  His is but one story of the very few that survived the Warsaw Ghetto and the Holocaust. There are others, but what sets Szpilman's apart is his fame and notoriety as a pianist, and the amazing 'good fortune' that allowed him to live past the war.<br/><br/>Although I have seen enough movies involving the Holocaust, I felt more informed as to what the Warsaw Ghetto must have been like, day after day; its oppressiveness, its shrinking, its decay.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 only because of the plethora of scenes of Nazi and wartime cruelty.  Yes, I know that's how it was, and they were only being accurate. It's merely a reaction on my part to having seen ENOUGH of this horror.  Otherwise it would have been 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Kudos to Roman Polanski for bringing his vision to the film.  His childhood wartime memories obviously helped to shape 'The Pianist'.  It is powerfully directed, and the best work Polanski has done in many years.  Although he has tough competition, I can totally see him winning the Best Director Oscar (although not being there to receive it, of course). <br/><br/>I will probably never watch this movie again, but I'm glad I saw it.  And I'll be rooting for Brody March 30th."

","Roman Polanski has tackled the subject which stole his innocence and haunted the rest of his life. The nearly 70-year-old filmmaker (responsible for indelible classics ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"") has filmed the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman. And what a story it is. Szpilman was a middle-class Jewish pianist whose comfortable life in Warsaw was interrupted, and then changed forever, by the German occupation of the Polish city and the subsequent persecution and murder of the Jews. It is easy to forget how absurd the Final Solution must have seemed to people in 1939, and one can understand how the Szpilmans, well-educated and financially secure Jews could not realize just how much trouble they were in until it was too late. Polanski captures the brutal and spontaneous violence of the Germans with unblinking, horrifying honesty that chills in a different (and some would say, more genuine) manner than Spielberg's in-your-face hand-held camera approach in ""Schindler's List."" It is inevitable that any Holocaust film will draw comparisons to Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece which defined the genre (as crass as it might seem to refer to Holocaust films as a ""genre""). It must be said that ""The Pianist"" is a different type of film, one which is concerned with one man's struggle to survive. Like ""Schindler's List,"" this film deals with gentiles helping Jews (although that is not the primary focus of the movie) but unlike ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Pianist"" shows it from the Jewish perspective. Also unlike that earlier film, Polanski does not go for the black-and-white cinema verite realism of ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" is all the more affective for it; that style might not have suited this movie as well. With color cinematography, he is able to highlight the contrast between the ghetto and the outside world which, however miserable cannot compare to the suffering of the Jews. And because the camerawork is so subtle, we are slowly immersed in the film to the point where it takes on a spooky sense of surrealism and we are as shocked as the protagonist to see the grim, jagged skyline of Warsaw after bombing, the indescribable brutality visited on random Jews, and the unfolding of events outside the main character's window. The film diverges from most Holocaust films when (do not read if you don't want to know what happens in the second half of the film) Szpilman is pulled from the line of Jews entering the boxcars; instead of taking us to the death camps, the film pulls in the opposite direction, out of the ghetto and into hidden apartments where we see occupied Poland and the uprisings that challenge the occupiers. There is a fascinating bit at the end with a (seemingly) conscience-stricken German officer who listens to Szpilman's piano-playing and protects him in the last days before the Soviets capture the city. All in all, an absolutely stunning film, and one well worth your time. See it as soon as possible."

","One of the best picture nominees this year about the true life of a Jewish Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, who somehow in the madness of W.W.II managed to elude the death camps.  Yes it is a holocaust film, albeit it does not take place there, but in the ghettos of Warsaw where over 300,000 jews were rounded up and confined to live in a small segregated area of the city in absolute squalor.  I've always said that good films are never depressing, but this one does get there.  And how can it not sometimes. Towards the middle of the film when the audience is aware of the impending doom, the characters still cling on to hope of radio contacts that the allies are coming to save them (not knowing of course they will fail), and the idea that all the moving is temporary..  This is the only slow part of the film, and we're stuck in some powerful yet obligatory scenes,  soldiers whipping and torturing jews, starvation, plagues, death marches, random on the spot executions,  jews turning on each other in the ghetto just to survive, some pretty hellish stuff.  But Polanski manages to bring together a great cast (nazis and jews alike both good and bad) that bring the film to its peak as Szpilman at one point manages to escape and live with the resistance who will protect him.  But life is not easy, and a crushingly good scene involves Szpliman hiding out in an apartment by himself, running out of food and then we watch helplessly as he breaks several dishes accidentally while rummaging through the cupboards and gives himself away to his German neighbors.<br/><br/>Thinking of how it must have been to live in that era and not be found out, must have been just pure hell.  And it is when these moments when we know that just the slightest exposure of Szpilman's talents and presence will get him killed in an instant, that the film exceeds tremendously.  While the middle slows down, the last 1/2 hour is a cinematic triumph and for the most part turns the murderous German forces on its head (I won't give the scenes away).  Throw in a cinematographic great look at bombed out Warsaw, and you have some more to entertain you.<br/><br/>Remember... War is madness..<br/><br/>Pretty good film<br/><br/>Rating 7 out of 10"

","The first half hour or so of the Pianist really struggles.  It shows the same coming threat that we have seen in other movies, yet does not do as good of a job of making them as horrific or tragic.  Polanski tries his best, and certainly there are scenes that one would think would horrify. Yet knowing what would happen later, and having seen films such as Schindler's List, the early parts of the Pianist just don't have the same emotional impact that they might have in years past.<br/><br/>However, once the film becomes more about the individual struggles of the Protagonist, it starts to take off and captivate the audience.  I particularly enjoyed the way Polanski let us feel what Brody's character was feeling rather than have him overact in reaction to pleasant and unpleasant surprises.  This allows the audience to draw their own conclusions without trying to make them think they have even a remote clue what it would have actually felt like.<br/><br/>The sets in this film are really outstanding.  They bring to mind some great sets like those of Saving Private Ryan, The Third Man, and Ran.  It really felt like war came to a beautiful city and destroyed it.  I never felt like I was watching special effects or set engineering.  This for me was the best part of the film.<br/><br/>Second best would have to be the actual music.  While it does not approach the level of Amadeus in terms of integrating music with the plot and glorifying great music, doing so would not have felt right in this film. The music also felt more personal and prodigal."

It showed the German machinery at work and I could put myself into the movie, play my game of human chess in my mind and end up dead at every turn.<br/><br/>One scene, with the pianist playing his music, in a bombed-out building moved me to tears with its mixture of devastation and despair on the one hand and the incredible beauty of the music on the other.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film although it inevitably weighs heavily on the heart and soul. The images are very real and remind me of how fortunate I am not to have had to witness such sights in my own lifetime.

","First, let me state that this is my first review on IMDb - so the film touched me enough that I feel compelled to comment on it.<br/><br/>
Second, Adrien Brody was excellent.<br/><br/>However, films about the German horrors against European Jews are not a new thing.  There are very few people who will see this film that have not already seen others (i.e. Europa, Europa, Schindler's List).  Because this film is likely not a wide release it can't claim any role in being a ""learning tool"" for those ignorant of the horrors of WWII.  Therefore, I think Polanski did the story injustice by inserting too many blatant acts of brutality.<br/><br/>The film marginalizes itself with these obvious acts into a wartime horror film, instead of dealing more abstractly with the true impact of war on a single human or family.<br/><br/>The film does not pick up until the second half when the pianist is forced to escape on his own.  It doesn't deal enough with the problems encountered by those harboring Jews (only very briefly alluding to it) and could have done more with the German officer character who truely becomes this person's saviour.<br/><br/>In all, the film is well done. Unfortunately, my boyfriend was right about the trailer when he said it seemed like a ""Holocaust film"".  Nothing of such historical significance should ever be reduced to a formula."

I was none other than shocked by that scene, but knew that were the things that really happened there, and Polanski (Roman) was just doing it to tell the story very truthful, and exactly how it went down.

"Bobbyh-2","Null","0","0","31 January 2003"," Polanski's take on the Holocaust? No, Polanski's rumination on Szpilman
","What lifts this remarkable film out of what might be called the ""Holocaust genre""--and there have been exceptional films within that genre--is that the unimaginable horrors, grotesqueries, and heroism that must have been part of the fabric of that incomprehensible era are here a sort of backdrop to what I felt was Polanski's primary focus: the astonishingly hermetic isolation of Szpilman, the pianist so beautifully captured by Adrien Brody's performance. Certainly, Polanski's rendering of the daily mixture of ghoulishness, brutality, and bravery is breathtaking, owing in large part, I'm sure, to Mr. Polanski's personal experience of that time and place. The vividness with which Szpilman's world is captured makes all the more astonishing the man's isolation within it. He remains separated from the heroic Jews who rise up and fight the Nazis, nor is he one of the accommodating Jews who, for whatever motivation, assist the Nazis in their persecutions and slaughter. Nor is he one of the brave Poles who risk everything to help him. He is, in the end, always a target or a beneficiary, always an object, never a subject. His only stated goal: to survive and play music again. No wonder Polanski seems to have found the real-life Szpilman's memoir fascinating and worthy of his attentions. And he has certainly met the enormous challenge of turning the memoir into a film that should be seen by anyone who is not too upset by images of shocking violence and ugliness that, after a while, the viewer becomes desensitized to, much as the central character does. I do not think that Polanski intends us to particularly admire the title character, or for that matter, to deplore him, but only to meditate on him and his extraordinary response to the ghastly circumstances in which he found himself. This is certainly one of Polanski's great achievements, and his finest in many years."

","Actual footage from 1939 Warsaw opens director Roman Polanski's film The Pianist. The non-threatening footage hardly sets the mood of the film, but it immediately establishes the time and place and consequently alerts audience members to the specific part of an immense and painful history that will be told through the film. This is a story about German Nazis and Polish Jews. It is a story about raw and arbitrary brutality. It is a story about moments of selfless love, and it is a story about all of the other familiar anecdotes associated with the Jewish Holocaust. But it is also a unique story. It is unique because it tells the story of the Warsaw Ghetto and one of its inhabitants, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody).<br/><br/>Polanski begins with the new story as he promptly introduces Szpilman playing Chopin in a Warsaw radio recording studio, but he quickly retreats from the unfamiliar to the familiar. A man and a woman wrestle with a can of soup, and it spills into the filthy streets; the man falls to his stomach and slithers on the pavement as he devours the thick gruel. People are starving. Armed SS officers use people as puppets when they make awkward couples dance in the streets. People are being humiliated. SS officers interrupt a family dinner, pick up a crippled man in his wheelchair, and casually dump him off the top-story terrace; the family is herded downstairs, ordered to run, and gunned down in the streets. People are being killed. <br/><br/>Most people can anticipate what will happen when an angry SS officer randomly selects men from a line and orders them to lie face down on the cobblestone street. The quiet scene of strewn suitcases and dead bodies is haunting but expected. The wooden door of a railcar packed with scared and screaming Jewish people slams shut, but Polanski does not follow the train to its destination because 21st century audiences should know about the gas chambers, the shovels people used to dig their own graves, and the crematoriums waiting at the end of the tracks. People should know about these horrific treatments and events, and many might choose to glance away from the screen during the most graphic scenes. During these moments of elected relief, a person might begin to wonder what happened to Szpilman's story. Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood do well to stay in the Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding area to keep the narrative focused, but Szpilman gets lost in the general history.<br/><br/>The newness exists in the subtle subplot of resistance. When reports of mass killings at Treblinka leaked into the Warsaw ghetto, a surviving group of young men organized the Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, which translates to Jewish Fighting Organization. The members smuggled a small number of weapons into the ghetto through their burlap sacks of food. They urged Jewish people not to board the railcars. The April 19, 1943, uprising and revolt lasted over one month, a fact not entirely clear in The Pianist, but the German forces ultimately defeated the resistance movement. Still, the Jews had fought back, and their efforts were significant. So significant that one is justified half-way through the film to wonder if Polanski picked the wrong story. Szpilman's story, like every story of a Holocaust victim or survivor, is important and deserves to be told and heard, but the cinematic interest seemed to be occurring away from the camera's scope on the Jewish side of the brick ghetto wall lined with broken glass. By the time of the revolt, Szpilman had escaped and watches the action from a short distance in his hiding place. The audience member is confined to his temporarily protected space and separated from the historical events taking place inside the ghetto. Szpilman laments that he should have stayed with the men even though it would have meant his death, and again only for viewing sake, one might guiltily share his sentiments. Humans, after all, possess a curiosity and a desire to safely experience the most dramatic moments of history, and watching the ghetto crumble in fire from a distant window fails to places a person within the action.<br/><br/>But this is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, the masterful Jewish pianist who escaped his death because of his musical talent under tremendous circumstances, and one would be wise to trust Polanski's choices. There were at least 750 stories within the burning ghetto, but the one followed in The Pianist is equally compelling once the Warsaw ghetto is in ruins and Szpilman's life becomes the sole focal point of the film. Brody speaks as much with his body as he does with his mouth during the second half of the film, and he is equally if not more brilliant in his verbal silence. The circumstances are harsh and nearly unbelievable, and his acting prohibits audience members to blink in fear of missing one moment of the performance. One stops breathing as Szpilman plays dead in the street to avoid actual death. One feels Szpilman's internal emotion when his hands return to the piano keys after a long absence. One tastes the raspberry jam he licks off his boney fingers. Brody says nothing as Szpilman, but the audience understands everything.<br/><br/>The Pianist succeeds on every level for numerous reasons including its attention to detail. Polanski provides specific dates associated with movements and events. Three hundred and sixty thousand Jews in the Warsaw district were relocated to the small designated space in the ghetto. Majorek (Daniel Caltagirone) names Treblinka--it isn't just a concentration camp. Details, details, details. The film also succeeds in its ability to speak to current issues. Polanski does not include the story of the merciful Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) to create sympathy for the German perpetrators. He does not haphazardly highlight the parallels between how the Germans tortured the Jews and then how the Russians tortured the Germans. Violence only begets more violence. Hatred is an epidemic for which no cure exists."

Yet it didn't grab me by the balls and yank me in. There was one main thing amongst a couple that prevented that. The lead actor. If not for him, I believe that film could have been so much more gripping.<br/><br/>    He seemed so...'relaxed' with everything that was going on. Oblivious, non effected as he struts around town, in his manicured suit while enemy forces steal foot after foot of it. Everyone was effected in one way or another yet I felt and saw none from him.     While on the lamb, with each person that stuck their necks out on the line for him, he thanked only 'once' that I remember. The German officer pianist. Other then that, I didn't see despair, true fear, anxiety let alone horror. Where was his humility? Thankness in his eyes or even a gesture due these people risking life and limb for his safety.     The only time I saw some sort of connection to what was going on around him was toward the end when he was dirty, bearded, hungry and walking as if an old man. This is when I saw 'some' union with the character that should have been there progressively growing all along. And the sad thing about that was it was the time he hand the least bit of lines.<br/><br/>
    Roman Polanski did a good job with this film other then casting and directing the lead. Showed some detail of things we've seldom touched in other films of its subject. The progression to loss of rights not only as citizens yet human beings. Comes to mind is when the Father, walking in the street, was degraded by a slap to the face then forced to walk only in the gutter by that hate monger of a soldier.     Without showing the people dying in the gas chambers or starved to death, he showed the step by step process from the identifying arm bands, to the segregation into a small section only to be walled in. To the scene of herding them to a waiting point for the train to ultimately show the baggage left behind, leaving our memories to paint the gruesome picture of what became them. <br/><br/>    I liked the film, I was glad I experienced it yet, of all characters, the lead kept me on the outside preventing me to fall within."

The Pianist would have been much more powerful and a masterpiece if it portrayed someone who actively fought this fascist nightmare, and risked his own life for others. Yes, I understand that Polanski wanted the film to be a ""witness"" of what happened, but in doing so he ruined his potentially greatest film. Adrien Brody was quite miscast, and his hubris in trying to play the Chopin Nocturne No. 21 (Posth.) himself was laughable - he did not in any way sound like a concert pianist.

All films about the holocaust are relevant but few films such as this one overall have such a power that comes from such little dialogue.  Adrien Brody is a Polish pianist in 1939 when war breaks out in his country.  He is separated from his family and must survive in the most terrible ways.

Also, there's not much of a ""plot"" in the normal sense.  It doesn't need one.  It is a historically accurate and sumptuously detailed chronicle of a civilized European city's (Warsaw, Poland) descent into hell, and one man's experience of it.<br/><br/>The protagonist, a pianist name Szpilman (pronounced ""Shpeelman""), is a hero, but not in the classical Hollywood sense.  He tries to look after his family; he tries to pull a young boy to safety (but only because the men who are savagely kicking the boy are on the other side of a tall wall); he smuggles a few firearms for the planned uprising against the Nazis.  But when the uprising finally comes, he is watching from a distance--his fear and hunger having led him to seize an opportunity to escape the walled-off ""ghetto"" without second thoughts.<br/><br/>At first you're a little disappointed that he doesn't join in on the uprising.  You want him to lift up a piece of furniture from the apartment where he is hiding and heave it onto the heads of the Nazis who are shooting his former comrades.  But then you appreciate the honesty of the moment; you realize that this is a true story.  He does what you or I would probably do--he sits, and cowers, and watches.  He just wants to live.<br/><br/>After that, he does a lot of watching from windows, usually from quite a distance above street-level.  This becomes quite odd.  You wonder if the rest of the movie is going to be this guy watching the destruction of Warsaw from a window.  He might as well be watching a documentary on television. This removal from the action might be bothersome, but the things we are watching are fascinating nonetheless, and this odd perspective again reinforces the appreciation of the fact that this is a true story.  And, ultimately, it's not like television, because at any moment those bullets and flames and artillery shells can, and do, come flying through the window, and Szpilman is on the run again, in his hopeless quest for safety.<br/><br/>Fascinating and exhausting--you won't come away from this film feeling ennobled or enlightened or uplifted.  You'll feel like a survivor from a world you hope you never experience first-hand, but a world that is as real as Warsaw 1944, Cambodia 1977, Rwanda 1994, Grozny 2000, Israel/Palestine 2003.  (And the list could go on.)<br/><br/>One more thing: Plan on sticking around through the entirety of the closing credits.  It's just a pair of hands playing a piano, but it's nice music, and it will give you a welcome chance to decompress before returning to your world, and you won't be the only one sitting there."

","Don't let the narrative and the picture fool you. This is not another World War film, defending the Jews, or another `Hollywood' high budget combat movie. In fact Jews are symbolized here as innocent people and they can be anybody who has been discriminated in the world, throughout the history. The story is responsible in confronting you with Wladyslaw Szpilman's life style and persona. The point is not the war or the racial and religious issues, indeed it is the study of people. Pianist is a profound look at the man's psychological behavior within his society and himself. It challenges human emotions during the hardest times of life. After watching this film one may realize the hope, fear, sensation, egotism, and enterprise that every person has toward life. The protagonist is not a hero, rather a survivor. He sought to stay alive and he made it, by sacrificing everything that he had. He left his beloved family, and decided to run away instead of following the fate. His home town is destroyed and his people are being tortured and murdered in front of his eyes. Yet nothing stopped him in reaching his goal. The protagonist is in a war, but this war can be in the midst of anything, not only the enemy on the other side of the wall. The conflict can be within him and his soul, him and the society, culture, ideology or another individual.<br/><br/>Pianist is a must see film for all the people, regardless their gender, race, and nationality. This is a film that touches your heart and opens your eyes to a new state of being."

","Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST has all the hallmarks of serious, conservative storytelling that wins public support (and Oscars), and it's clearly a labor of love. Based on the true-life story of a Polish Jew who survived in Germany during  WWII, it's alternatingly harrowing and complex,<br/><br/>The early scenes will seem familiar to anyone informed about the Holocaust -- perhaps too much so. It's very much a part of Wladislaw Szpilman's story, but countless other dramas and documentaries have covered this material so thoroughly that its impact may be lost on some moviegoers. This certainly happened with me.<br/><br/>Szpilman's real story begins after his family has been packed onto a one-way train to Treblinka. Without resources in a half- abandoned city, he must depend on the decency of several good- hearted Germans who put their lives behind their conscience to save his life and many others'. The story is presented in a series of nearly unforgettable scenes -- some intimate, others covering breathtaking landscapes of increasing desolation and destruction. Polanski excels in showing the drama from Szpilman's point-of- view, drawing the audience into a journey that brings him in contact with Jewish collaborators, one or two sympathetic soldiers, a throng of doomed Poles (which includes his own family), and some monstrously cruel men whose summary judgment can mean life or death.<br/><br/>Like Schindler's List, THE PIANIST has English dialog (with British accents) for the Jews and German dialog for the army -- a choice which occasionally undercuts the film's spell of realism. Also lost is the musical nature of the Jewish tongue, which would have enriched the film enormously. <br/><br/>But perhaps this small critique won't be meaningful to many audiences. This dramatization of Szpilman's memoir becomes increasingly arresting and original as it progresses, and its attention to detail (even including occasional piano-playing mistakes to underline this survivor's human frailty) helps boost THE PIANIST far, far above the standard. it's that rare Holocaust drama that's not about the Holocaust at all."
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","0","8 January 2003"," A terrible and beautiful experience
","Roman Polanski's `The Pianist,' winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, has less in common with Spielberg's `Schindler's List' than with Kozinski's `The Painted Bird':  it's about a Jew who survived in the midst of the Holocaust and who, somewhat like Polanski himself, slipped by the Nazis throughout the war.  Instead of being a child like Kozinski's hero (or Polanski during the war) Wladyslaw Szpilman (Vladek) is an artist, but he has very much the same detachment as a wanton child.  Stripped of his whole family when he's snatched apart as they're herded off to the death camps, he becomes a solitary creature living on in Warsaw by his wits and with help from others. He's stripped down again and again, left with little more than a toothbrush and a piece of bread, but he keeps some other baggage no one can take away: he always remains also a musician with a mission in life, to play piano on Polish radio.  This we have seen Szpilman doing as the war breaks out and we see him doing again after it's over.  Polanski's task, achieved with impressive completeness mixed with superb restraint, is to show us all that happens in between.  <br/><br/>This is a singular tale about a man reduced to the commonest denominator of bare existence, but it's also a vision of the survival of the human spirit. That survival is vividly expressed when we see Szpilman play air piano hidden in a locked apartment overlooking the Warsaw ghetto, and when we hear him, starving, bearded and gaunt, playing a Chopin Nocturne for a German officer who finds him hiding and then chooses to protect him.  All through this surreal adventure, which is full of horrors and rather coldly inflicts enormous emotional pain upon any sensitive person who watches it, Szpilman, played with equal absorption and panache by Adrien Brody, seems to slide along like an elegant wraith, noble but also self effacing.  (This is the great role that Brody was destined for and has been robbed of up to now.) <br/><br/>
`After great pain a formal feeling comes,' as Emily Dickenson puts it, and `The Pianist' has a coolness and restraint other holocaust movies have lacked. This doesn't mean we're spared horror, fear, and terrible sorrow. It simply means we watch with a kind of hunger and awe.  And we respect what we see because it is without theatricality or schmaltz.<br/><br/>Brody carries the film, and it's the nature of the story that all other characters are in a sense cameos.  Though some secondary characters are strong ones, others are too little distinguished to keep them separate. Another flaw, inevitable perhaps, is that this is a movie where all the Poles speak English.  It helps a bit that the Germans all speak German, and it helps a lot that the Warsaw Forties war world is so faithfully recreated---sometimes unaccountably beautiful in its cold light and faded colors.  It's obvious that `The Pianist' works better than `Schindler's List' to recreate the Holocaust experience, simply because it focuses on one man.  And it helps that, though the experience was different, Polanski was there, in Krakow anyway, surviving and hiding through the war, escaped from the ghetto, as Szpilman did.<br/><br/>Now that he has produced something really splendid, people feel obliged to point out that Polanski is a sex offender, exiled from the US because he won't face charges for it.  Well, what can one say?  He appears before us in `The Pianist' not as a criminal but as an artist with authentic knowledge of profound suffering.  The experience this movie provides is a terrible and beautiful one, and there's not a wrong note in it."

","There is something I admire in movies: the ability to tell the truth and still be interesting and beautiful. This movie does nothing else than follow the life of a Jewish pianist during the German occupation of Warsaw in the second world war. He does not have a special role or fate except that of survival. Schindler's List tells the story of a man whose attitude changed something in the middle of the horror. Life is Beautiful is focused on the view of the world by a person instead of the world itself. This movie just makes you be there and see what happens, with no excuse for it, no obstacles and no intention to save you any pain.<br/><br/>Still, it is beautiful. Vladek wants to play the piano, and the thought of music in some moments of the movie, the idea of piano music and the undescribable atrocities of war together is something not easily forgotten. Human beings made both, and that is not easily believed.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that the worst acts that took place any time in the past seem less when we know that they won't be repeated. They happened once, life goes on, and they are forgotten. Whenever someone watches this movie, some of them happen again, and that stolen memory is not easy to bear. A friend told me something that can be translated as saying that ""this movie is the crudest, the strongest I have ever seen"". This person, believe me, watched many movies before. But she may be right."

","This film is very powerful, very harrowing and hard to watch at times - the evil that humans can afflict on one another is chilling. A true story - it is effective and dramatic and even uplifting. I thought the lead actor, Brody did afine job (I've been a fan of his since his sterling work in Steven Soderburgh's underrated gem, King Of The Hill). But the film is flawed - Polanski has never been very subtle as a director lately and there are times when he could have pulled back (the little girl with the empty bird cage, the freakish looking jews being forced to dance with each other, etc.) - and the script in the long run (maybe because of the scope of the whole thing) is a bit thin in places - I never felt like I knew that much about Brody's character so while I was certainly invested in his survival - I didnt really feel much dimension to him. Afterawhile the film takes on a one, two, three feeling: this happened, then this happened, then this happened, etc. But the music is amazing, some strong performances and the art direction is Oscar caliber. A sad, tough, gritty look at one man's attempt to survive at all costs."

"janyeap","Null","0","0","13 December 2002"," It's one man's soulful plight from the rein of terror...
","An incredibly touching film that keeps the audience embodied in the appalling ill-fate of Wladyslaw Szpilman and the ghetto Jews at Warsaw's Varsovia from 1939 to 1945.  And it's the cinematic portrayal of inhumane survival is simply astounding. It serves well in allowing the viewers to feel the eminent empathy of Szpilman. It's a film that seems to cry out for the audience to connect with the horror at a distance. Yet it leaves no room for superficiality but allows each frame of event glows with gradual transcendence.  <br/><br/>Roman Polanski's style of on screen narration is truly awesome and unique. He injects an enormous sensitivity of human feelings into this masterpiece through his principal character.  It's a Holocaust film,  solidly and powerfully approached with surrealism, realism, and cynicism. And its contents are without the overwhelming and overlapping necessity of injecting the visual GCI escapades of gore and hype, as used in many Hollywood Holocaust films to channel emotions. He uses GCI effects intelligently, recreating the scenes of structural bleakness. And call it courage, perhaps, Polanski does acknowledge that Varsovia has its good and evil residents, existing from all walks of life, and from varied creeds, cultures and classes. Based on Szpilman's 1946 novel, this movie is slapped with abundance of visual horrors associated with one man's emotions in his struggle to stay alive. Yep, this film does pound on one man's experience of the inescapable dehumanizing aspects shown to, or faced by people, within a war zone, as well as on the possibility of human kindness, associated with the terror of war. Eerie and absolutely haunting... almost as if Director Roman Polanski is filming a documentary of a man's survival plight from a petrifying insane asylum where no man survives without turning traitor, or without the fortune of helping hands! The gray landscapes and, oft times, the pure silence add to the effects of numbness to the scenes. They echo one fugitive's trauma within an ugly period of history. <br/><br/>Roman Polanski does not bombard his movie with the use of visual bloody gore and grime to cast the ghastliness of Szpilman's story. Instead, viewers are led to follow Szpilman's moves, feeling his alleviating fear and consternation, watching the happenings as he sees. This film captures, non-stop, the moods of desperation and struggle. We pause, we gape, in total silence and heaviness, while each scene flows.  We wonder how long before he too will be packed into a cattle truck to be sent off to Treblinka.  With every act that Szpilman makes, the viewers are inclined to feel they are in his shoes, searching, escaping, and feeling the cold sweat of numbness  at oft times void of emotions, almost parallel to the deserted and desiccated, eerie city portrayed without its signs of life. <br/><br/>The story deals with the creepy take on human dehumanization, bringing an uncanny composition of trodden despair on to the screen. All the dehumanizing events appear as if at a distant and only through his eye  without the usual coaxing of GCI effects of visual gore or slaughter. Everything appears through curtain-drawn windowpanes or window cracks, and through small openings of doors and walls. But it's how the Szpilman character reacts to what he sees that keeps me shaken and mesmerized throughout the film.  Those abstract onscreen emotions keep the movie alive just as Szpilman's music has kept him alive. In addition, the film's bleak surroundings and the tragedy of the tortured man's character render a thematically and artistically eerie outlook to the film's moods.<br/><br/>
Adrien Brody is truly deserving of an Oscar nomination for his performance. If one has seen a photo of the real youthful Szpilman, one can see some facial resemblance between the actor and the real individual. Szpilman, once a renowned and dignified musician has become sickly, intimidated, alone and very desperately hungry. The only strength left in him is for staying alive. The only belief he holds is his music. I was immensely captivated by Brody's facial and bodily expressions, both at the time of his character's fame, and thereafter by his portrayal of the character's fear, hunger and destitution. He brings out a credible Szpilman thrown into a downright appalling and inhuman situation where only miracles could save him. Brody plunges me right into the heart of his character's journey of fatigued mental sufferings, while witnessing with him the blanched and distantly terror of Varsovia.  My response: I felt ill and isolated, and completely in pain and fear till the finale.  That's how powerful Brody projects his acting talent.  That's how powerful this film is. Powerfully told with the powerful on screen images! Overall, the cast ensemble aptly supports Brody's role. The music of his Szpilman also establishes an amazing tone and feel of the surroundings. Chopin's Nocturne in C Sharp minor still plagues my ears. It comes through three most unforgettable moments: the first instance when the explosion of the German bomb hits the audience's eyes, and when Szpilman plays it to the German officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, and when it filters through the Polish Radio.  Truly exhilarating!<br/><br/>This is definitely a poignant and memorable movie to see  especially during our own contemporary times of terror."

","I have been lucky enough to catch this film while I was in Poland a couple of months ago. There was some major hype to it then, but that is understandable since Polanski is one of the most famous Polish directors along with Kieslowski and Wajda. I have watched several Polanski films over the last few months and I really appreciate what he has done over the years. The thing that I most like about him as a filmmaker is that he combines simple and intelligent storytelling with artistic craft that is easy to see. He always claims that he likes to make films that he would like to watch himself as a fan. Most of his films tell engaging stories that are accessible to anyone. At the same time, his techniques are very direct and provide additional enjoyment to those who have a deeper knowledge of film and its devices. I think his films would be good to study in an introductory film class. Enough about Polanski<br/><br/>THE PIANIST is a true story of a Polish Jew named Wladyslaw Szpilman and his survival during WWII. His name is rather appropriate since he is also a piano player. As the film opens, Nazi Germany has invaded Poland and quickly the Jews are separated from the rest of the Poles. At first Szpilman and his family live in the ghettos, but soon the Nazis begin transporting everyone out into concentration camps. During a hectic sequence where Jews are being led to the train wagons, Szpilman gets separated from the rest of his family. He returns to an empty ghetto where he is one of the few Jews who have not yet been transported. The rest of the film deals with his struggle for survival and his fear of being found by Nazis as he seeks new places to hide.<br/><br/>In the first half of the film I was not really getting into it. I wasn't sure where the story was going. It took some time before Szpilman found himself alone and that's when the movie started to become really good. The film is a little detached, which gives it a perfect sense of realism. There is no melodrama here that might be found in other films. Adrien Brody, who seemed rather unimpressive to me in the first half, really starts to embody the role as the film progresses. <br/><br/>I started seeing that this film was not about WWII or about the Holocaust. Those are the settings, but that is not what it is about. This was a realistic portrayal of a man who lived in hiding through those depressing times. It is from his point of view and you only get to see what he sees through windows, key holes, or door cracks and you only hear what he happens to hear from people he meets. He has no other way of learning anything about the war or when it will finally come to an end. The film becomes about one man, not Pole or Jew, but just one man and his uncertainties. It could have been anyone. What I liked most is that THE PIANIST illustrates the helplessness of witnessing horrible acts that happen right in front of you as you try to hide. You are afraid to come out and you are afraid to keep hiding. In many ways Mr. Szpilman is lucky because he does not live through the suffering that millions of other people lived through, but his experiences were not necessarily any easier. His loneliness is clearly conveyed in many beautiful and symbolic images. One high angle shot I remember well shows his silhouette as he walks in the middle of an empty street surrounded by destroyed buildings.<br/><br/>THE PIANIST has a great story to tell and Polanski's direction tells it well. Since it is about a piano player, there is lots of beautiful music throughout. The main theme is very memorable. This is a subtle, patient, and thoughtful film that does not create excessive melodrama, but rather focuses on realism. The toned down, bittersweet ending is especially strong. I have a feeling that THE PIANIST will come and go from the movie theaters in the US rather quietly and as a result will not be a major contender at the Oscars (This also depends on many other movies that are still to be released soon). I don't think that this is an exceptional film, but I hope that audiences will not overlook it. As I watched it, my enjoyment was at about an 8, but as the film progressed I became more absorbed by it and my appreciation level was at about a 9 by the time it was over. I guess my overall rating would be somewhere between an 8 and a 9, but I would like to watch it again. Another strong Polanski film."

The images in the ghetto are already seen but never were enoughly metobolized as in this film.<br/><br/>No ""Schindler's List"" nor The Holocaust -the TV serie- had such a deep impact as this one. Touchful scenes of People treated as flesh in a slaughter, senseless faces without identity and future are flashed in the screen, walking as robots or zombies. Child screams and weeping heard as backnoise that penetrates in your head as well as the bombs that are exploding outside; pricking and cruel images that will not be easily forgotten. Some scenes are particularly touchful as the one of the father that shares for the whole family in six small pieces a sugar tablet and the one where Adrien is hiding himself, seeking desperately for food and water; rarely in a film thirst and hunger were described so perfectly. Also the way how Wladislaw plays piano in front of a general nazi after longer days of fasting is supreme, initially seems to be rather static but then comes music and Wladislaw starts to dream again with it. Also the locations of a destroyed Warsaw give desolation and a strange peaceful message like peace after the battle.

Music surpasses nationalities, war and fear. The film is narrating a story of a man -not a hero- and is a simple and honest picture of human emotions that emerge on extreme situations - situations caused by man himself.

","What do you normally expect from a biographical movie about a musician during the World War II and the persecution of Jews? Probably a character who is either likable or non-stereotypical hence interesting, lots of good music, some historical hints for dummies and varied social background. Apparently ""The Pianist"" doesn't give you too much of any of these.<br/><br/>First of all, there is no plot strictly speaking, but a sequence of events in which the main character is involved. The war starts, people get killed, the uprisings break out, the Russians come, the war ends and all the time Szpilman is barely an observer, apart from the threat of being shot or sent to a death camp the history doesn't shape our ""hero"", nor does he change anything in it. He doesn't fight nor support the fighting civilians, he doesn't save anyone, he barely helps his fellows. His proceedings through the war times are likely to be less interesting than those of any randomly picked war survivor.<br/><br/>I cannot judge the real Szpilman and his life, but I could imagine him being less dull and passive than the character in the movie. Szpilman created by Brody doesn't seem to be a musical genius, but rather a self-centered average person. He is awkward and naive in a non-charming way. There is no depth to the character and he doesn't form any relationships with others apart from expecting help. With this help he moves from one apartment to another and stares blankly at the cupboards. I realize that food shortage was a big issue during the war, but how many cupboard examinations can you put in one movie?<br/><br/>It's not like I dislike cupboards. In fact I find the decorations and choice of items to be the strongest point of the movie, some very realistic and nicely designed reconstructions. Although interiors and costumes often look too clean and too smart, it is nevertheless a good job done.<br/><br/>The reconstruction of the society doesn't work that well. All the Poles plus one Nazi soldier are nice and helpful, all the Nazis plus one Polish neighbor are mean, Soviets are the victorious heroes who bring peace to Poles and Jews. It's a very simple division more typical of a movie from the '60s than a modern one. Besides, even though the main focus is on the Jews, the movie doesn't seem to have any really Jewish elements. Where is the Jewish religion and spirituality, Jewish music and Jewish wit? Of course living in a ghetto makes people lose heart but it doesn't mean there is no need for some characteristics to be shown in the movie.<br/><br/>There's absolutely nothing said about the reasons of the war actions. The war is like an unstoppable natural disaster from which you can only hide, but not an international conflict in which the orders come from and are executed by real people. The Nazis simply came to kill both Poles and Jews though the latter with more monstrous pleasure. The scenes are explicit, not suitable for children and sensitive adults. Death doesn't seem to have any meaning in this movie. If so, then without any disrespect to the real Szpilman, why would we want him in particular to survive, while so many others were starved to death, shot in the head or thrown out of a window?<br/><br/>I can only recommend this movie to people who cannot tell apart the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising from the Warsaw Uprising - there are dates on the screen to help you remember; and anyone who likes cupboards.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this movie to people who like action, multi-linear plot, well developed characters, dislike shallow good vs. evil division and showing more blood than necessary."

","Make no mistake this film is about the pianist Szpilmann, not about Roman Polanski. It is NOT Polanski's life, not his story. Others might forget that Polanski is a convicted child molester wanted by Federal authorities for statutory rape of a 13 year old girl. Polanski fled America to avoid prison. Some men might call statutory rape Getting Lucky but generally not when the girl is 13, definitely not if the girl is drugged-up by the assailant in order to assure her co-operation. I say it's reprehensible and Mr. Polanksi needs to return to face his crime.<br/><br/>THE PIANIST is the very personal story of Szpilmann and his ordeal in surviving the Warsaw Ghetto -- which 95% did not survive; the awful events of that time compellingly told in an on-the-level manner not seen before in any of the hundreds of films dealing with World War II with focus on the Jews.<br/><br/>That's the trouble, the focus is too often on the Jews. Young people today think the whole war was about the Jews. It wasn't. In Warsaw, while the Germans were killing Jews in the Ghetto, they were killing non-Jews not in the Ghetto in greater numbers. About 90% of the victims of Germany's invasion of Poland were Catholic. Where are the movies about Catholics? In Warsaw, one of the historic Catholic churches had been converted into a hospital. When the Germans arrived they at once massacred everybody in the hospital including the medical staff and buried everyone alive or dead by exploding the building. Nope, it wasn't just Jews.<br/><br/>Szpilman is certainly entitled to have his story told, but taken in the larger context of too many World War II films telling about the Jews (8 million dead) and ignoring the 80 million others, it plays like propaganda."

","Spoiler!!!!!!!!! There are plenty of movies set in eastern Europe during the second World War. And I'm sure that ""The Pianist"" is not among the best of them. Certainly it is important for such a movie to create an adequate atmosphere, to let the audience feel the dimension of the brutality and inhumanity of the nazi regime. Yet I think that Polansky focused too much on it and the rest of the movie suffered from it.<br/><br/>The movie was meant to be a portrait of Szpilman. Now, what have we learned about him? He survived the war, he lost his family and his possessions, he had to suffer... I didn't feel like I learned a lot about his nature. The same is to say about Szpilman's family. Polansky failed to show the uniqueness of his characters.<br/><br/>Instead he showed many scenes of violence and brutality, a lot more than necessary to create the adequate atmosphere. What for? To show ignorant people that nazis did horrible things? But I don't think that ""The pianist"" was meant to be a movie for ignorant people. To let you feel the brutality? Well, after the fifth scene of that kind I wasn't able to feel anything of that kind any longer. It was just needless and disgusting.<br/><br/>There are two scenes I want to point out. The first is the scene where the SS-officer finds Szpilman and forces him to play the piano. This is the most impressing scene of the whole movie. You feel the desperation in the music and the performance of both actors is great. Then the scene in which the same officer leaves his overcoat for Szpilman. Why did Polansky include this scene??? I can not find an answer. The outcome of it was so obvious that there could not be any suspense at all. Of course Szpilman runs out to meet the Russians in that coat, of course they think he is an SS-officer and shoot at him, of course he survives - 5 minutes of the movie completely lost.<br/><br/>For those who would like to see a movie treating the same topic absolutely differently I recommend ""Gloomy Sunday"".

Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him.

","The Pianist (2002) was Roman Polanski's most personal film to date and an acting tour de force for Adrian Brody. The movie takes place during World War II. A brilliant pianist is forced to live like an animal during the war. Since he's of Jewish heritage, his family and others that have been ""branded"" with the star of David are forced to life in concentration camps and ghettos. But this film is not about this topic, that has been beaten to death already. The PIanist is about surviving and keeping one's head together just so they could live another day. Adrian Brody was quite impressive as the Pianist. He conveyed emotion and acting on a level that I never thought he could have ever attained. Roman Polanski's direction was razor sharp and he creates an environment that felt so authentic and real.<br/><br/>In many ways the Pianist also reflects upon the life of Roman Polanski. He has been in the same situations before and has experienced life in the ghettos and camps. Just like the title character, Roman Polanski is a survivor and he can still make films with the best of them.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation possible."

That actually happened.<br/><br/>I love this film because they do not hold back on anything, however disturbing it may be, this makes the film real. It doesn't hold back on Adrien Brody struggling to escape from a building in the process of being bombed, it doesn't hold back on the feeling of ""Oh. My. God."" when you see the tin rolling towards the German Soldier's feet and it certainly doesn't hold back on the true horror of World War Two.<br/><br/>This film makes it clear that survival is possible. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) wasn't wiped out by the Holocaust. He wasn't forced into gas chambers in concentration camps.

For the first time, we see the everyday life as an everyday life and not as a drama for the drama necessary to a movie. The film serves these humans' story and not just the contrary.<br/><br/>Polanski's film does not want us to cry only. he wants us to wonder, explore and discover. It is dreadfully efficient. He shows that Art that is love is the one link that brings one back from barbary to humankind.

"ishq-anderson","Null","2","5","1 December 2004"," Survival may simply depend on little effort and the deeds of others.
","Surviving death when it seems inevitable is a great feat, especially when your survival depends largely on the kindness and deeds of others. No one could provide a greater testimony to this than Wladyslaw Szpilman, acclaimed pianist and Holocaust survivor. Wladyslaw and the members of his immediate family would find out first hand how racism and prejudice could destroy a seemingly simple existence. The Pianist is a film about a Holocaust survivor and all the good fortunes that took place in order for him to avoid the same fate as the members of his family - death. Roman Polanski, director of The Pianist, does an excellent job of providing his audience with a sense of being through his use of music and color in a number of scenes throughout this movie.<br/><br/>For Wladyslaw music was the means by which he would drift from the reality of his situation and return to some place of peace. When Wladyslaw serenades a German Officer, Wilm Hosenfeld, the emotion and the passion by which he plays implies that he believes this is his last performance. It may be argued that Polanski employs the audience to grasp the true gravity of the Holocaust and all that Szpilman survived when he uses deep focus technique to show the disaster in the foreground and in the distance (miles of death and destruction). I believe that Steven Spielberg uses some of the same filming techniques in his depiction of the Holocaust with his film Schindler's List.<br/><br/>As if to keep the audience at a comfortable distance from the characters and the tragedy, Polanski does very few extreme close shots. He tries to keep his audience and his characters at a comfortable distance once the attack on the Jews begins. The lighting is primarily low key to imply a grim existence and not until the end does Wladyslaw color become more vibrant and the lighting around him shift to high key (final scene). <br/><br/>The uncertainty, the humiliation, the hurt from losing family members, the resolve of being a survivor and finally the settling in to a new existence are all brought to the surface with Wladyslaw's musical piece at his safe haven for the German Officer, Hosenfeld."
"Ben_Cheshire","8","2","5","2 April 2004"," Incredible survival story, and incredible demonstration of the power of cinema.
","No other medium in the world has the power to illustrate for us what life would have been like in certain periods of the past but the cinema. One of the most important periods to not let go forgotton is the massacre and repression of Jews in Germany and occupied europe. If war and racism led to people to be killed like dogs and worse, simply for belonging to a certain group, then everyone should know about it, in my opinion, to keep history from repeating itself, and to make sure they didn't die for nothing. Don't turn your back on it - stare this movie in the face and look at what racism and intolerance can lead humans to do to other humans.<br/><br/>Scene after scene of such penetrating truth and honesty encapsulate in cinematic episodes the horrors committed by the Nazis, the state of desperation of the Jews and many other aspects of this horrible ordeal, based on the personal memoirs of the main character, famed Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.<br/><br/>It was based on the memoirs of Szpilman, which means we know he survives the war, and it was marketed with this in mind, as a survival story. And this, of course, is the main attraction to this movie: not to put oneself through experiencing the horrors of war, which i nevertheless believe is important, but of finding out how in heck a Jew living in Nazi occupied Poland could have survived, and as such it is a remarkable story of hope and courage against unbelievable odds. And not one calculated by a Hollywood studio to manipulate you - this stuff really happened, and to the character portrayed in this movie by Adrian Brody. Some of it also happened to Roman Polanski himself, which made this a very personal project for him.<br/><br/>As i mentioned at the beginning, this movie demonstrates the power of cinema, and one of its central themes is the power of the arts, particularly music, to affect people, to make them feel."
"Sennin","5","2","5","22 February 2004"," Manipulative the first hour, lineal during the rest
","In a general way, this movie can be divided into two parts, that differ in temporal terms, as well as in substance ones. The first part, shorter in time, seemed to me to be similar in content to those save the whales spots that Greenpeace makes you watch in school to generate environmental conscience. Not that I have a problem with Jewish folk, nor the whales, in fact I find extremely appalling both genocides, but the truth is that the victimist discourse that tries to bring the public into tears by making them feel impotent in front of the images is a very wasted one, particularly if the topic in discussion is the Jewish Holocaust (not to mention the whales). It would have been interesting to see Polanski driving the narration in a more objective way, showing the cause and the effect (in other words the reason why the Germans invaded Poland and persecuted the Jewish folk, as well as the persecution itself), and not only the effect, especially if proceeding that way the victimization of the Jewish is out of question (there's no way to be an apologist of the Holocaust, but there could have been a little sketch of the poor excuse for a twisted logic there was behind the invasion that would ""explain"" the behavior of the German soldiers in the movie), but would have avoided to fall into the coarse cliché it did. The second part, that entails a sudden twist in the narration, characterizes for being quite faster then the previous one (justifying its longer time), becoming a sort of adventure movie, well-driven most of the time, but that tended to be superfluous and implausible (fact that, by the way, has in this movie a wider tolerance rate: facts that in other movie would have tasted false or fictitious, in this movie were forgiven, due to the fat that it was ""based on a real story"") by times; in which the ups and downs of the pianist are told in a lineal way and without focusing that much on the external events, closing the public's perception: as opposite as in the first part, where one was witness of the ""pathos"" of the main character's family and the entire ghetto; in this one, one only gets to acknowledge only the facts concerning him. On the other hand, by the same time this perception is closing, one can feel a relief concerning the effectist discourse mentioned above. In deed, by this time they start to enter the scene the pro-Jewish characters, that seem to appear as life savers in this sea of anti-Semite people. But this relief comes a bit late into scene, as the public is already determinated by the previous scenes. From the technique aspect, we find the strong side of the movie: the photography is just splendid (keep an eye for the scene where the pianist finds himself before the destructed Warsaw); as well as the piano playing scenes, which are not only of a visual interest, but also provide us of an exquisite hearing pleasure (While many may complain about Chopin and say he is some sort of Gustavo Adolfo Béquer of the music, in the way that he didn't compose for art, but in order to get dates; they cannot deny that he is just more that a deployment of mere virtuosity à la Malmsteen, but that the music has a feeling and beauty that surround it). Regarding the acting, we must say it is well over the average but it isn't something out of this world, nor something like that. In the case of the secondary characters it's not that easy to tell, as there are so many and their performances are too little to define an opinion. Nevertheless, despite these last favorable points, I must continue to think that Polanski could have made a greater effort in this movie, since just by it self, or in comparison with his previous work, is quite unsatisfactory."
"tomlevi","5","2","5","26 December 2003"," Very controversial film - personally, I found it rather dry.
","Reading through the comments at IMDB.com, it seems that you will either love or hate this movie. Undoubtedly the content of the film lends itself to meaningful impact on the viewer. My personal preference lies, however, with Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". I found ""The Pianist"", surprisingly, to be rather lacking in characterisation, and found the soundtrack in Spielberg's work, as well as juxtaposition of colours (with black/white), and use of motif, to be much more powerful and moving than Polanski's. Truly, a matter of preference. This film is undoubtedly an artistic, yet believable, depiction of war, and the sad values it encompasses."
"Cheesedemon28","10","2","5","22 December 2003"," Amazing.
","Wow.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I despise Schindler's List. I loathe it. Spielberg basically turned the Holocaust into a theme park ride. I must also tell you that I don't like Spielberg.<br/><br/>Now I must inform you that I am slightly biased. I am a Jewish Polanski fanatic. So to see this film is like to see a masterpiece in play. The most interesting and arguably, the best facet of the film is when the Szpilman familly is discussing what is going on, basically a round table discussion. It shows the exact emotions of most Jews, and non-Jewish poles during the Holocaust with textbook accuracy. Especially considering that Polanksi was a Holocaust survivor, this gives perfect perspective of the Warsaw ghetto.<br/><br/>There are also some who say that the fact that Szpilman(sp?) was a pianist had very little to do with the film at all, but in fact, the piano was one of his few motives to survive throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Please, PLEASE, stop saying that there shouldn't be any more films like this. I think people should stop making Holocaust-related films when everyone believes that it actually happened. I personally know human beings that denied it even happened. Venal.<br/><br/>So here's the math: Great plot + great premise + wonderful director + great sets + Chopin The Pianist = one of the best films ever made. It's a real shame that it lost out to the tragedy of a film that is Chicago for the best picture oscar.<br/><br/>

"MF210","10","2","5","24 May 2003"," Great Film, Ok it is better than Chicago
","I will say it The Pianist should have won Best Picture. But I am not putting down Chicago, I think both movies are great films. The Pianist is a holocaust movie, which is different from the 1993 masterpiece about the Holocaust, noneother than Schindlers List. The Pianist differs from Schindlers List because it spends all of its time in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Schindlers List spent time in the Ghetto and Labor Camps. We get a different point of view what it was like for the Jews. The Jews that stayed behind were forced to do some labor work for Nazis but their were Jews who were hiding in the Ghetto that fought back against them, though they didnt succeed. You dont see any fighting back in Schindlers List at all.<br/><br/>
Adrien Brody delivers a great performance as a jewish pianist named Szpillman (not sure about spelling). Not Sure if its an award winning prformance but still a great performance. It maybe but I wanna watch the movie again. One thing I am sure about was that Roman Polanski (Director of the brilliant Chinatown) deserved his Oscar for Best Director, it was brilliant direction by a man who is close to 70 years old. The Pianist is a very well written movie but the screenplay is not award winning, I thought Adaptation should have won.<br/><br/>This is my overall paragraph and I have alot of overalls to say. Overall, As much as i loved Chicago, The Pianist should have won for its powerful message and portrayal of what one man went through in the Ghetto during World War II. Overall, I prefer Schindlers List but The Pianist is a great film and will be remembered for years to come. Its a great achievement for Polanski. 10 out of 10."
"Soysoy","10","2","5","23 May 2003"," Speechless
","This movie left me speechless, but I'll try to write some words down though. ;-)<br/><br/>I'm quite a picky person when it comes to cinema, and I -almost- always find something to criticize, except for a very little group of movies (this far, 8 movies out of 600+ that I've seen..) that I found flawless. ""The Pianist"" is among them. You don't say.<br/><br/>I knew that Polanski is a great filmmaker, for sure, but I'd never expected him to take the whole thing so seriously, putting SO MUCH dedication into creating such a fine piece of art.<br/><br/>Polanski has avoided all of the traps common to movies in its genre (the first one coming to one's mind being ""Schindler's list, though to me those are very different movies), and chose to make no compromise at all. No heroism, no cheap emotionally manipulative scenes, no off ""dramatic"" music, nothing to try to grasp the attention of the immature modern film viewer. He decided to make ART, and more than that, he decided to do that with such a heart, and such dignity, that even without the truly mind-blowing filming savoir-faire he used in ""The Pianist"", the movie would have been excellent. But he obviously wanted more, doing his best to serve the story told. I guess he's been preparing this movie with great care, and for a long time.<br/><br/>Polanski has set, with ""The Pianist"", a new standard in cinematic excellence. The use of the camera eye is the best I've seen so far since ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and goes even further than these movies in its ability to create a sense of ""being there"". Kubrick left this path for further movies, exploring different (and most of the time very interesting) possibilities. Cronenberg shows the same kind of ability sometimes, but he's focused on a very different aspect of the human's mind (that's the least to say).<br/><br/>The focus here is more timeless, it's difficult to put into words, I mean it's not possible to actually EXPLAIN what Polanski has achieved with ""The Pianist"" unless, maybe, someone very talented writes a whole book about it *LOL*. No, this is art, pure art, and relies on the honesty, humanity and total dedication of a *human being*, who just happens to be one of the best filmmakers around. What the film does, that ""2001"" did not, is telling a straight story. It had to, considering the humanist goal. But it also creates this beautiful cinematic poetry, powerfully evocative, that was the signature of ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and more recently of Lynch's -more ""arty""- ""Mullholland drive"". I'd say that ""The Pianist"" reconciles humanist storytelling with cinematic audiovisual poetry, in a way that will be very difficult to outmatch.<br/><br/>Maybe that the problem of the movie, which I don't consider as a flaw, is that in the context of modern cinema, ""The Pianist"" may seem weak and flat to the fast movies young addicts created by the movie industry. Those will find in ""Schindler's list"" a more familiar tone, where heroism and human values are portrayed in the Hollywood manipulative fashion that Spielberg masters oh so well. It's a pity, as ""The Pianist"" is a far more authentic and honest work than anything Spielberg will ever be able to achieve. Polanski doesn't want to manipulate us in any way in ""The Pianist"" (though he showed in the past that he's very good with cinematic manipulative tools, think about ""Rosemary's baby""!!), he wants - IMO - to offer us an opportunity to make our own journey through the events shown, leaving just the right amount of space needed for some meditation. He doesn't try to teach us a lesson, he wants us to consider what is being told and make our own opinion about it. This absence of manicheism (no good VS evil here) is one of the most beautiful demonstrations of moral integrity in the history of arts.<br/><br/>Oh, well, if your favorite movies ever are Aliens, The Matrix or Gladiator, don't even try ""The Pianist"", you'll be bored to death. Wait for some more years, until your taste adjusts, before meeting this masterpiece.<br/><br/>My personal award: on par with any masterpiece of the 7th art, including the very best of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Lynch or the Coen brothers (only to mention a few)."

"user-7630","4","2","6","7 June 2012"," This movie was an insult
","What was the motivation behind making this movie?<br/><br/>Was it to teach people about the crimes that the Nazis committed in WWII? Probably not, The Pianist came out in 2002, so there were already hundreds of movies out there that depicted the Holocaust.<br/><br/>In my opinion, if you want to do another Holocaust movie, it should be because of one of two reasons: 1.) You want to tell a really interesting story that happens to be set in this time and location. Or 2.) you want to do a character study. Maybe show both sides of the medal, and try to analyze what could make people do horrible things like this.<br/><br/>The Pianist was neither of those two. The plot is as simple as it gets, a Jewish musician tries not to get killed and to flee from the Nazis. That's pretty much it. So what we get is basically a loosely connected series of scenes, where 1-dimensional Nazis do terrible things to 1-dimensional Jews. It's very important to understand, that there are psychological mechanisms behind what the Germans did in WWII. If you just depict them as flat monsters who just love to do horrible crimes, the viewer just thinks ""Yeah well, I could never do stuff like that."" Guess what, under the right circumstances, you could. There are two German movies about that subject matter, called ""Das Experiment"" and ""Die Welle"". Watch them if you haven't seen them.<br/><br/>The characters being as flat as they are also makes it hard for me to get invested in their fate. Don't call me heartless, I'm just complaining about the way the movie was made, I'm not saying I don't care about the real people this happened to.<br/><br/>And this brings me back to my opening question of why this movie was made, and to what made it an insult for me instead of just a bad movie. The Holocaust is a sensitive issue for many people, so it's not hard to touch something in the viewer by just showing Nazi crimes. And the people who made this movie knew that. The Pianist had ""Oscar"" written all over it, and because it neither tells an unusual story, nor explores the characters, that's just what the movie is: A cheap way to win everyone involved an Oscar. And they use a horrible event where real people died to do that. That's what makes it insulting for me.<br/><br/>It's competently made, it's not ""terrible"" to watch or anything, but the circumstances make me hate The Pianist instead of just discarding it as another movie I didn't care for."
"lee_eisenberg","9","2","6","23 May 2006"," well done, even if it didn't quite equal ""Schindler's List""
","In what I assume was Roman Polanski's most personal movie ever, he tells the story of Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) doing everything possible to survive the Nazi occupation. As is the case with all of Polanski's movies, there are some very harrowing scenes, namely when the Nazi planes first start bombing the city, and when Szpilman has to hide. As Szpilman, Brody really brings out the most in the character (no doubt his sad face helps with that).<br/><br/>I will say that the movie doesn't quite equal the profundity achieved by ""Schindler's List"". But maybe that's not a fair comparison, since Polanski probably wasn't aiming for that. Either way, this is definitely a movie worth seeing, as a message of hope in the darkest of times."
"cobb_aja","5","2","6","7 June 2005"," No Schindler's List
","No one can deny the utter horrors of WWII against Europe's Jewish population and it is an important history lesson that should never be forgotten. Nevertheless, not all of the stories from this era translate very well into film and this is no exception. Polanski is so full on with the horrors that many of them fall into cliché and the result is that there is no emotional response left from the viewer for the rest of the film. For example, there's a woman who's had to kill her baby (how on Earth would they know?), there's a man who eagerly scoffs food of the filthy ground..and so on.. It seemed Polanski felt the need to cram in far too much. For heaven's sake he even crow-barred in Shylock's line from Merchant of Venice about being Jewish AND being human at the same time; how 'convenient' that the pianist's brother had the play on him! Nevertheless, there were some painfully wonderful moments such as when the pianist is in hiding in a room with a piano which he isn't allowed, for obvious reasons, to play. You have to see the moment to appreciate it. Unfortunately it is a moment which is all too rare. The part at the end, where he is made to play by a German officer would have been much more emotionally charged if we felt that this officer was a genuine threat. In summary, this film is too crammed with misdirected emotion to be as tear-jerking as Schindler's list."
"qodtorren","4","2","6","3 October 2003"," So over-rated...
","Simply put, I was NOT impressed by this movie.  For as much hype as it got, I expected a well done, bleak and depressing, nazi era film.  Well it wasn't.<br/><br/>The characters are cut outs of the traumatized people we are supposed to feel intimate with.  The storyline moves along too fast, and we get no chance to develop an attachment to anyone.  It's as if Polanski assumes we will automatically feel a sadness and connection to anyone persecuted by the Nazi's.  Well in real life, of course.  It's as if we are hurried along just so the director can get us to the point in the movie where we watch Adrian Brody's character suffer, starving and freezing.  None of the relationships felt authentic, but they had all the trappings to make them look that way.<br/><br/>By the end of the film I was left feeling like there could have been so much more.  I don't think I missed the point on this one.  So many people fell head over heels for this film, but personally I think it's a shallow love affair.  And yes, I probably sound angry.  That's because I was hoping this film would be all that it seemed.  You won't really be wasting your time seeing it, and you might like it, but it's not a gut-wrenching depiction of Nazi-era cruelty."

","If I'm being honest, I think Polanski winning the best director Oscar for this film is sort of like Scorsese winning his Oscar for ""The Departed""; both awards feel a bit like consolation Oscars. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't believe that this is the best film Polanski has put out; in fact, I wouldn't even put it in his top three. It is a good film, however, and with all the amazing movies that Polanski produced during his career I'm glad that he found a bit of recognition, even if it is for a film that isn't as polished as some of his others.<br/><br/>Polanski himself said that his was the most personal film he's ever made, and there's good reason for that. Polanski was in his preteens when WWII washed over Poland, and he, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, survived the ghettos while their families were less fortunate (Polanski's mother was killed in Auschwitz). ""The Pianist"" shows a side of the holocaust that we rarely see, for it's not from the perspective of the camps which we see most of the film, but from the perspective of one who has escaped the camps and is still forced to live in a prison of isolation and degradation.<br/><br/>As a whole, I think the story told in this movie is wonderful, and since it is based on a true story, it's hard to criticize it too much for structure, but at the same time, I do feel that this movie starts to drag in the second act. Most of the truly disturbing stuff happens in the first half of this film. The parts where Szpilman is separated from his family, the purging of the ghetto, the moving to concentration camps... all of that stuff happens within the first hour and fifteen minutes, and the last hour of this movie is mostly focused on Szpilman trying to stay quiet in apartments, trying to figure out what's gong on outside, and struggling to get over sickness. By no means does the story ever get boring- it's still fascinating, but the horrors of the first half of this movie are far more memorable than those in the second half."

Worse of all they wanted to lock him up for five years, he would serve sentence in the same jail where sentence is serving murderer of his pregnant wife, Manson. USA, helooooooo? What is it with you?

","The Pianist, the true story of the pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who must face the horrors and hardships of the Holocaust, is a powerful and emotional film. Roman Polanski, an already accomplished and renowned director, brings a whole new realism to the events of the Holocaust and makes the viewer feel as if they are actually witnessing these horrible events. <br/><br/>The movie begins with Szpilman playing the piano for a Warsaw radio station, amid the sounds of destruction in the background. The beautiful sounds of the piano against the sounds of horror and bloodshed creates a powerful contrast throughout the film, and injects more emotion into the events portrayed. The movie continues, with Szpilman and his family having to face monetary troubles, and then eventually being forced to move into the Warsaw ghetto. Within the ghetto the Polish Jews face terrible hardships, and are treated in a horrible way. One of the first examples of this terrible treatment is when several Polish Jews are forced to dance for the entertainment of the Nazi soldiers.<br/><br/>As the movie continues, the level of emotion continues to get stronger. One of the most saddening and powerful moments of the film occurs when an old man is thrown out of the window of his house by Nazi soldiers, and in turn is ran over by their car. It is horrible that events such as these occurred, and they are shown in violent detail.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb, as each actor portrays their role perfectly, and they make you feel for their characters. Adrien Brody, as Spzilman himself, features in all but two scenes of the film, and owns his role perfectly; this is Brody's film. It is hard enough a task to be on screen for must of a film, but to keep the viewer captivated, even in moments such as when Szpilman is searching for food, is an honorable achievement in itself. Brody fully deserved his Oscar, as his performance is both captivating and memorable.<br/><br/>Overall, The Pianist is a great achievement of filmmaking, as it is captivating, powerful, and important to watch. If you have not yet seen this film, I would advise that you do as soon as possible, as it is not one to miss.<br/><br/>Rating:<br/><br/>9/10"

","It doesn't come very often that we are bear to witness something incredible that doesn't happen very often that works so well like two peas in a pod. Not only are we engaged to the scintillating sounds of beautiful piano music, while view the misfortune horrors of the epicenter of World War II, Warsaw Poland.<br/><br/>Based on a true story of iconic musician Wladyslaw Szpilman, (Adrien Brody) you get this feeling of pity for the poor man and the horrors he faces throughout the movie and in hopes that nobody has to go through what he had to do to survive in this horrible war. But at the same time, it gives you that sense of gratitude that we (at least I hope) should never take life for granted and that we should love the life we live and to be lucky that we don't live in fear like Mr. Szpilman encountered in war-torn Nazi Poland. To be very blunt, Poland in WWII was no vacation spot, especially if you were of Jewish faith. Picture yourself in that era, your home is in rubble, your family and your friends all perished all the while trying to survive in one impossible situation after another. Left alone and the only food to eat was garbage and picking money off corpses is definitely no way to live. Mr. Szpilman faced this terror and to that it makes him a true war hero. Sure he bared no arms or was a soldier by any means, but his contribution to fighting the enemy was to sooth the savage beast, by way of ear-candy music.<br/><br/>Director Roman Polanski's direction was one of the very best as he captures all the details to near perfection as he recreates the graphic imagery as a ploy to keep it audience gasping in deep emotion.Even the colors depicted here are very dark and drab as it symbolizes an era where bright vibrant colours is nowhere in sight. The green grass will only be given to us if we can stay on towards the end without trying to reach out for tissue paper. We all have the dishonour to explore the cattle scenes, where thousands of Jewish people get carried away on freight trains where they are being put to death. The scene itself is detailed enough to just metaphorically rip your heart out in two, just the locking of the doors and screaming pleas from actual human inside will make even a grown man cry. We also have the displeasure of witnessing the brutal humiliation the Jewish people suffered during these painful times. It's the ultimate insult to injury that truly comes to life here. But the realism is what makes this film so captivating and for that alone I give all my respects to Roman Polanski.<br/><br/>Another reason ""The Pianist"" is so extraordinary is the performance by Adrien Brody. He practically brings Szpilman to life in all his defenceless struggles to survive and that is by far no simple task. His changes through the film is quite sublime as he goes from a classy and honoured musician to a long-suffering misfit who still feels he has to move on and love music as his only escape through life. His survival instincts really wears you in places you've only dream of before. as the film progresses we see the man's physical torture show as his legs become shattered and his body in constant quivers and his mouth is manifested with scurvy and his eyes lighting up with every minute he survives every deadly predicament. But his magic fingers still manages to stay in tack as he still has the stamina to strike beautiful notes on a dusty and dirty piano.<br/><br/>This movie is a movie no home should be without. The lingering effects will likely stay with you for days or even weeks. We can only hope that these terrible events don't come our way, but with the amount of hate that our world faces, let's not hold our breaths. So the next time you feel blue or manifested with lingering anger, keep this movie within you at all times. It may make us feel better of ourselves and that things can be a lot worse. And that in-spite of the awful events that occurred in this movie, beautiful music is around to sooth the wounds that come alive in ""The Pianist."""

"brimariex19","9","1","2","27 November 2011"," Comparing Director and Style to Szpilman and the Emotional Intensity of this film
","The Pianist is a true story full of grit, fate, and even a little bit of hope. Director, Roman Polanski, understands the horrors of this 1940 Nazi invasion due to his experiences of being a survivor himself. He, like the main character Wladyslaw Szpilman, has experienced the mortifying encounters of murder, separation, torment, torture, and even a conclusion of hope. Viewers can understand his experiences through the eyes of Szpilman. The Pianist is not a story of one holocaust survivor. Rather it's a story of two, portraying the director's emotional and intense experiences as well as Szpilman's in this realistically accurate film.<br/><br/>This film is truly honest in the depiction of what the Polish Jews saw and experienced during the Nazi invasion. Right at the start of the film, the viewer already experiences the hardship of the war with the bombing of Szpilman's radio station. From there, viewers continuously get hit with unbarring, cringing scenes. About thirty minutes in, we see the first true death of Jews by the Nazis. The Nazi Police take an elderly man in a wheel chair and throw him off a balcony. This scene is brutal as we hear the cries of Szpilman's mother, adding more emotions and intensity.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, a viewer can see Polanski's directorial style. He consistently portrays sad or emotional scenes through the eyes of the protagonist. In the ghetto, a Jewish man attacks a Jewish woman for food. The food falls on the floor, but the man does not cease. He lies down and eats it right off the muddy dirt. First, Polanski shows Szpilman and then the elements of this unfortunate occasion. These types of shots occur throughout the movie. Also, officers are mostly shown with low angle shots and Jews getting killed with high angle shots. This shows how the officers are superior and Jews are inferior all the time. <br/><br/>The Pianist reflects intense reality. The part that is one of the most realistic scenes is when a Nazi Officer stops the Jews and simply chooses certain people to lay down in the middle of the street to meet their fate of getting killed. The rest have to watch this painful action and continue on with their day as if nothing occurred. It shows the true character of the Nazi's and the torment and torture of the Polish Jews. <br/><br/>The film is extremely powerful. Every element, every scene, every shot is crafted to show the power of the Holocaust. It makes a viewer cry, feel the heartbreak, cringe at the sight of death, and feel sympathy for what the actual Jews had to go through. One of the best emotional scenes is when the Nazi Officer aided Szpilman and helped him in his hideout, giving him food and water. It shows how one life, good or bad, can make a difference. Szpilman did everything he needed to do to survive. He was not a ""hero"" or a fighter. He was just another man trying to make it through, just like Polanski. They both received an enormous amount of good luck. In the end, hope came through and leads them to freedom and a better life."
"andy-933-696608","10","1","2","30 January 2011"," The Pianist Review
","It is a film worthy of rivaling the legendary ""Chinatown"". Director Roman Polanski brings viewers a dark and almost painful to watch reminder of one man's struggle for survival in one of the world's darkest times. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody), a Polish Pianist who's love for the piano could not be further defined than in this remarkable tale of courage, misery, and determined survival. Adrian Brody gives a performance that is believable in every account. He doesn't go all dramatic. It is the very essence of his performance that is significant. Just by watching him, you'll think that he is Szpilman, and mastering the Polish accent, playing Chopin on the piano, as well simply showing a sense of confidence in his character. When I watched the film, I saw the very Pianist himself. The tale of this extraordinary musician begins with the end of his career in Polish radio, and it ends with his eventual return to it, as in over the course of 5 years, Spzilman's life is destroyed bit by bit. It all began with a shred of hope, as his family listened and celebrated Britain and France's declaration of war on Nazi Germany, only for it slowly form into the many forms of despair to come. Growing up in a Polish Jewish family, and in the times of the Holocaust, the Szpilman family faced many of the atrocities Jews were subjected to. It all started with the limited financial rights, up to the required cloth of The Star of David, and up to the moments when they moved into poverty infested Warsaw Ghetto. Desperation, humiliation, starvation, death, persecution, and even debt were the many challenges brought on the Szpilman family, losing more and more at the hands of the inhuman Nazi's. The very sight of Jews being forced to dance for their amusement, or even being beaten by their own kind can be very sickening, knowing that these people faced so many atrocities. One scene in particular shocked me, as the Szpilman's witness a brutal murder of Jewish cripple being tossed out his window, thus his own family following him to death's door at the hands of machine gun fire, and sadistic torture. Despite all this, Wladysaw pushed towards the chance for his family's survival, as his last effort to keep them from leaving the Ghetto becomes meaningless, as operation Reinhard came into play, sending many Jews to the camps were their very extermination was its main purpose. All alone, Szpilman survived, living in the Ghetto, as a laborer, secretly working for those who were willing to fight, while hoping for an eventual chance out. His wish is granted as he makes out the wall, and back into the very world that rejected his kind. His difficulties arise as he moves from one location to the next, hiding out wherever he can, avoiding discovery and capture. I have to say this out of a personal respect for Szpilman, he is a tough SOB. He suffered from Jaundice, Malnutrition, and even pure madness as he had to flee from the very war that was taking place right outside his apartment window. Near the film's conclusion, his long urge to play the piano is fulfilled in the presence of Wilm Hosenfeld, a man known today as one of the few members of the Nazi party to willingly hide out and assist Jews. His last words as he gives a farewell to the grateful pianist ""God wants us to survive"" are both strong and powerful, signifying the good few Nazi's had against the Third Reich's perverted vision of God's work. Szpilman's freedom and desire to find this man lead only to the discovery of his deportation, and thus later informed death in 1952 in imprisonment in a Soviet camp. Our film concludes with Szpilman's return to Polish radio, and a grand finale as he plays the grand Polonaise brillante. It is with the very focus of this 5 minute ending scene that the very beauty of his love for Piano is expressed by the very hands of a dedicated actor, moving his hands at the very rhythm of the music. As the credits have rolled, and we continue to watch Brody master Szpilman's masterpiece of musical art, we come to think this is truly a magnificent movie. The director is excellent, the actor not only portrays him on a professionally dramatic level, but also on a physical level, embodying both the weight loss and as well as the practice required to perfectly portray this damaged character. ""The Pianist"" can honest to God be called one of the greatest film's I've ever seen, as Mr. Brody brings the revelation of this renowned Pianist to life further and further as the film progresses, and as we viewers witness further and further what this man has gone thru. He lost his family, he went into hiding, and he even risked his life on multiple occasions in various situations. When you look at how much Polanski's dives us into the life of this man, we start to see that this film is more of personal tribute because as a matter of fact Polanski himself has lost his loved ones to the Holocaust. ""The Pianist"" is more than just a dedication to Szpilman, but it is also a dedication to all the Jews who became victims to the evil that was Adolf Hitler."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","1","2","17 December 2010"," A Harrowing Journey
","Roman Polanski's The Pianist demonstrates that there are many ways to film a Holocaust movie as the victims had so many different experiences. Wladyslaw Szpilman is a famous Jewish pianist in Warsaw, Poland, whose performances are frequently broadcast on the radio, but when the Nazis invade, he is reduced to playing in a restaurant. When his family is forced onto a train headed for a concentration camp, someone pulls Szpilman away from the line, and although he attempts to rejoin his family, the same man pulls him away again and says something to the effect: ""I just saved your life, now go."" These words convince Szpilman to save his own skin and he hides in the Warsaw Ghetto for the rest of the war. We never see Szpilman's family again.<br/><br/>I appreciated this film for depicting the various reactions to the Holocaust. Jews were not just helpless puppies who waited to be killed, they actively found ways to survive. There are the fighters who rise against the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto, an aspect of the Holocaust that is not portrayed in movies very often. They thought it was better to be killed while fighting rather than be shot randomly in the street.<br/><br/>Szpilman represents the survivor. He is not a great action hero, nor does he make any grand attempt to rescue his family or friends. Through his connections, he is able to find shelter, and he relies on the charity of others. His experience is truly harrowing. He faces starvation, illness, and some minor injuries. If he can't find food he steals it. A friend of mine told me he hated this film because he thought Szpilman was selfish for only helping himself, but I don't know what is selfish about saving one's life. Is this not what his family would have wanted for him? Can any of us say we would not have done the same thing in his situation? I don't think any of us are in the place to judge him.<br/><br/>The Pianist also depicts the non Jew's reaction to the Holocaust. There are the typical brutal Nazis who shoot Jews in the street, this is nothing new. But there is an active underground movement willing to help Szpilman, and in the end, a sympathetic German soldier gives him food. I liked this part of the film because Nazis are often depicted as one dimensional psychopaths, and at least this film made them a little more human.<br/><br/>Polanski was the right man to make this film as he had so much in common with Szpilman. Polanski escaped the Krakow ghetto after his mother was murdered. His own experience tells us something about why this story, based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's autobiography, appeals to him so much. As other critics have noted, I am sure Polanski and Szpilman asked themselves the same question every day: why me? The Pianist is about the various experiences of the Holocaust, and it reminds us that only a few were lucky. Rating: 4/5."
"Misterhustler","8","1","2","8 November 2010"," Another gem from Roman Polanski
","Polanski has always been a great director and his art and genius is unmatched. There are very few directors who can match him and he is a force to reckon with. In this movie, Polanski provides ample proof of the horrors of holocaust. Adrien Brody confirms that he is an actor with more than just good looks. The movie also won the Best Director Academy Award for Polanski which was long due. The biggest strength of this movie is that it does not try to take any sides. Only a great director like Polanski could have made such a heart touching and sensitive movie. The movie once again confirms why good cinema is so essential for our society and it needs to be treasured for the coming generations. Hollywood can say whatever it wants to say, they still do not have a film maker as good as Roman Polanski."
"lindahl-alex","10","1","2","24 October 2010"," Solemlny Beautiful
","The plight of this Polish pianist is one that could not be created. The feelings evoked by this film are backed up by the authenticity of the personal account it was based upon. Yet, as most Holocaust films/stories are emotionally powerful, this one was different. It was not based in any sort of concentration camp or labor camp. The man somewhat free in body, but tightly jailed in spirit.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire first part of the film, it may be gaged that Szpilman is a quite a reserved person. He, unlike his brother, does not lash out at the ongoings of the Nazis. This personal trait makes the emotion felt from the film that much more awing. Because of his reserved nature, the watchers are lead deep into Szpilman's being when we are able to sense his feelings.<br/><br/>Isolation is another huge piece in this film that takes it to the near limits of human capacity. As soon as he is split from his family, Szpilman never has any kind of deep interaction with another being. The account goes as far as to let him live alone for somewhere around a year. There is one scene specifically in which the isolation hits an unimaginable peak, due in part to the way the scene is set up.<br/><br/>As soon as Szpilman is split from his family, the entire movie takes the turn of complete bleak color. The luster of color had been toned down once the Nazis started to occupy Warsaw, but the color becomes much more toned down.<br/><br/>I can honestly say this is one of few films to touch in such a way. The guilt he feels for living, and his family dying leaves me speechless. Adrian Brody does an excellent job of portraying the solidarity of Szpilman's spirit during his time of hiding. The mood of the entire film is excellently presented, and perhaps much in part to personal relations of Polanski. The classical music played throughout the film doesn't do any damage either. And finally, the somewhat strange 'love story' between Szpilman and the music is as beautiful, if not more, than most love stories out there today.

","A talented pianist (Adrien Brody) flees the Warsaw ghetto after his family is rounded up, and attempts to stay out of the hands of the Nazis.<br/><br/>The Pianist is a vivid Holocaust film that shows up the 'directedness' of Schindler's List (1993) by sticking closely to Wladyslaw Szpilman's first-person perspective; no museum piece, it is instead a living, breathing, haunting experience, shot through with omissions, elisions, and nagging details which refuse to be tidied up easily and thus carry an inherent aura of truth about them. The film's Babelian mix of languages and accents is a minor weakness, but it's a film where the words spoken mean so much less than the sounds heard and the sights seen: what use have we for words when faced with such indescribable horror? It won the Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay."

","I wanted to write one, but just cannot think of anything to add after some great reviews already written. I have watched this movie a few times during the last years, and I am just sure this is one of the best movies ever made. The way you connect with polanski is just great. It hits you quite hard and makes you want to see the whole story.<br/><br/>The best part this movie does is making you realize this is all based on a true story. Some guy with a great talent has suffered like this and has seen the war how it's to be seen on the screen.<br/><br/>I must admit I can very much appreciate good ww2-movies, also movies as die fälscher make me think for what has happened over 60 years ago.

","An adaptation of the autobiography of the same name by Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman, Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist' is one of the finest biopics I've ever seen to date. A biopic that moves you, scares you and gives the you courage to survive in the world where bloodshed is a common thing.<br/><br/>'The Pianist' takes us to the legendary journey of the late Władysław Szpilman with predestine. Some people are legendary, some stories are legendary and some films are legendary. All of the three trump cards are available in this film! For me, it's a film that made me the character, I felt like Szpilman every moment, I was hungry when he was hungry, I was scared when he was scared. And I cried when he cried. What A Freaking Life, and What A Bloody Way To Show It!!! <br/><br/>Adrien Brody's performance as Szpilman is one of those performances that shine even in the darkest night. It's a performance that is haunted! Brody, you truly are a Hollywood Icon! <br/><br/>If you have a DVD player, then, 'The Pianist' should be your first choice for the moment. Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"christy_luvs_roxy","10","1","2","28 October 2009"," Brilliant
","The Pianist reduces the human being to its most basic instinct: to survive. Along the way, through excellent directing and acting, the audience is taken on a emotional roller-coaster ride. The joy of family and the love each shares. The cruelty of the dark side of human nature. The things one is willing to do and go through in order to survive. The fear of life and death. The fear within each of us that keeps us wanting to stay alive. Depressing but very real, a lot of emotion is expressed in The Pianist. At the end you will leave with a heavy heart because THIS is something like you've never witnessed before: we're too comfortable in this modern age, we have yet to experience the horrors of being war victims. But also, this movie will sharpen those humanistic qualities within us that has been washed away by the worries of money etc. in the contemporary life. This movie will make you look closely at the persons you love, tell them you love them before leaving for work each morning and this will be because you will realize that life is short and unpredictable and maybe in the next second, you will be gone so LIVE life while you can."
"SpongeBob5862","10","1","2","30 July 2009"," An amazing film; highly recommended
","Set during the time of the holocaust, The Pianist traces the life of Jewish-Polish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman. He faces many struggles such as being separated from his family and friends. He is also forced to hide with the help of non-Jews. One of the people that help Szpilman is Hosenfeld, a captain of the German Army.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves music. The soundtrack is simply superb, and it adds another layer of depth to Szpilman's profound life story. I think this movie also shows the real power of human compassion during times of struggle.<br/><br/>The Pianist also features the acting talent of Adrian Brody and the directing talent of Roman Polanski. Both of them did an excellent job in communicating Szpilman's story to the audience. This is probably one of the best movies made about the holocaust."
"georg-60","8","1","2","10 May 2009"," Masterpiece with one flaw
","""The pianist"" by Roman Polanski is a masterpiece that graphically depicts the horror of the Nazi time in occupied countries, especially, of course, for Jews, and gives you a better, for more vivid, idea of how it must have felt for the affected people in those days, more so than any history book. It does so without relishing in unnecessary gore - don't get me wrong, the scenes depicted in the film are harrowing enough, but there are certainly much more graphical accounts of the holocaust and you never feel that the film ""indulges"" in those pictures for the sake of it. But you get a real sense for how, little by little, the Nazi's pulled the rug under the feet of the Jews, making life a bit more difficult for them every day to the bitter end. <br/><br/>There are many other good things to say about the film, which are already said so I don't want to repeat this any more. My only problem with this film is like with some other biographies or epic narrative that stretch a period of time, especially if centred around one characters is that there is a certain lack of interpersonal drama here. Szpilman, the main protagonist is the cornerstone of the film but we get to know very little about anyone else in the movie and therefore, we feel that we don't even get to know Szpilman really well, for there is no better way of characterising a human being than through his interaction with others. He doesn't even seem to be close to anyone. He has some family and some admirers but always seems a bit aloof. To the people who save his life, he expresses gratitude but rarely concern, personal interest or asks if he could help. <br/><br/>Apart from that, it is a great movie that deserves much of the applause it gets."
"beat-attitudes","7","1","2","12 January 2009"," Absorbing, but overrated
","I was expecting a lot more from this film, and I don't think my impression of it was degraded by the high claims made of it. While it was an atmospheric, impious piece I didn't think it was as good as people are saying here. Brody's performance did what the role required, he displayed fear and so on quite effectively, but felt his character lacked any subtlety. One moment he's a panicked but handsome man, then he suddenly falls ill, grows a beard, and becomes a stumbling wreck. And then everything goes back to normal.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the portrayal of the brutality going on around Szpilman, I felt, was nothing special. Of course the wanton disregard for life, the lining of of people to be shot and so on are all very moving topics, and the camera angles through broken windows and so on worked very well, but I can't see how people think this film's portrayal is so superior.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth watching, but it's pretty straight-forward."
"insomniac_rod","10","1","2","17 November 2008"," Haunting and unforgettable.
","Only a master like Mr. Roman Polanski could create such a haunting, disturbing, and moving film.<br/><br/>The sole idea of a Post-War film (although it happens in the middle of WW II) is desolating and sets the mood entirely.<br/><br/>The settings and score is touching, haunting and it fits perfectly with the whole disaster settings and the moving performances.<br/><br/>But ""The Pianist"" is not only about atmosphere because it's a survival test for our main character that will have to do everything in order to get out of the nightmare he's living through.<br/><br/>Polanski creates a world of desolation, sad atmosphere that you won't forget. Never.<br/><br/>A classic for today's standards."

","Mesmirizing performance from Brody. Gorgeous camera-work from Polanski that perfectly captures the desolation and destruction of wartime Poland. Perfect pacing in terms of storytelling. On top of this, an achingly beautiful subplot that highlights the sorrow of a man who is stripped of his ability to express his innermost feelings through music, a craft which he has dedicated his entire life to. The soundtrack music that we do hear is rightfully tragic. Not only does this rank up there with Schindler's List as the most brilliant film depicting the events of the Holocaust, it is simply one of the greatest films ever made of any genre. Highly recommended."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","27 February 2008"," ""The Pianist"" is a brilliant composition with Polanski as the virtuoso composer
","""The Pianist"" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes ""Pianist"" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.<br/><br/>What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.<br/><br/>The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.<br/><br/>If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one."
"dj_xand325","9","1","2","26 November 2007"," Haunting and Harrowing Masterpiece...Stunning account of the holocaust
","""It's an official decree, no Jews allowed in the parks. "" <br/><br/>This is oneof the two stunning holocaust films brought to us by a director of big quality, Roman Polanski <br/><br/>We are presented with the true story of polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Its a powerful story of determination, hope, freedom and pride.<br/><br/>He loses his family, has his religion disgraced, but he survives This continuous film is a superb study in how the holocaust developed and how much it devastated the Jewish community of Poland in world war 2.<br/><br/>Although people may say that schindlers list is undoubtedly superior, they are very different films. One is a study a jew in the holocaust and the other is a study of a German in the holocaust. Schindlers List is stylistically superior but The Pianist manages to form a vision of how the holocaust developed and increasingly devastated an innocent Jewish family.<br/><br/>It also presents other elements of the holocaust such as the extermination of disabled people in which a group of Nazis is shown raiding a Jewish home, a person in a wheelchair is tipped over a balcony, the rest of the family are then murdered. This is one of the most depressing and dark scenes of cinema i have ever seen, the fact that Szpilman's family is watching the whole thing with horror, makes you be able to empathise with the situation they are in and therefore maximises mental devastation to the watcher.<br/><br/>Although i didn't cry in the film, it is still a harrowing masterpiece and any faint hearted person would be extremely moved by the film.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I had the DVD of this film for over 3 years and never watched it, because I never really had the time in between my hectic schedule to watch this film, but when I did read the reviews of the film on IMDb, it grabbed me so much that I finally decided to watch this film at mid-night (after my entire days schedule). I must say that it was WORTH every minute (late at night).<br/><br/>Every single actor in the film had a realism in their character which is very uncommon in many international films. It seems that the director 'made sure' that the film grabs you inside the TV/Screen and puts the viewer in the space and time of Warsaw massacre. Having said this, the props were well selected and felt real.<br/><br/>The story telling and the chronology was well synchronized along side the classical composition of Szpilman.<br/><br/>This film is not about the Holocaust but about one man and his will to survive the evil that prevailed during the times of Hitler. This film also goes to show 'why should an innocent Jew suffer from the higher level of political war that prevails on this earth'. He just want's to be left alone and continue with his normal life. He has nothing to do with the war, but with his survival and his life. ""Why should he die, if he is not guilty"".<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film conveys a message to all of us that we do not need to fight with opponent to win anything, but we need to find way's out of the trouble and war that has 'nothing to do with us'. This is a lesson we must all learn from this film.<br/><br/>I am proud of Szpilman and many more who followed his footsteps, because they are the real winners of the war.<br/><br/>MUST SEE THIS FILM.<br/><br/>My score: 8 out of 10<br/><br/>Regards, Neil Bhatia"

"ryuakamrvengeance","9","1","2","16 October 2007"," Surprisingly Good
","When I first watched this film, my mind was quick to compare the film to Spielbergs ""Schindlers List"" as many other viewers have probably done also, but then the film took an unexpected twist, which changed my perception and comparisons entirely. <br/><br/>As Szpilman and his family were walking to the train (taking them to certain death) I though to myself ""not another concentration camp movie, how predictable"" but how wrong I was. Just as Szpilman was saved, so was the movie, as it became an original, unique insight into the ""Ghetto"" that I had never seen before. <br/><br/>Rather then take an obvious route and show the depression of the ""Death"" Camps, Polanski takes a different path, a path of isolation, desperation, and a will to survive. One shot that sticks out in my mind, is after Szpilman is saved and walks through the deserted city, (a bit like Cilian Murphy in 28 days later).<br/><br/>Szpilman does all he can to remain alive, and sometimes you do worry for him, as when he drops the bricks, or is caught with the food sack, and throughout the film you are forever thinking about whether or not he will make it; he must come close to death about 10 times! The scene towards the end, as he plays piano for the German officer, was one of the most moving and powerful scenes I can think to remember, and it is worth watching the film just for that scene alone.<br/><br/>Overall, a very similar, but equally different experience to Schindlers list, but nevertheless, just as brilliant"

","I saw this film the other day on UK TV and, for some reason, never got around to buying the DVD. This was a film that, at the back of my mind, I always wanted to watch. It is based on real life and what actually happened during WW2 and, I am sure, to a large extent is accurate.<br/><br/>However, and to a certain extent, the timing is not quite accurate because The Pianist actually purloined an overcoat from a German Officer much earlier than was portrayed in the film. He must have done, otherwise he would have lost the will to live.<br/><br/>An extremely good film and I cannot imagine how anybody could better this portrayal of the Jewish plight during WW2."
"praveen1013","9","1","2","10 March 2007"," An Adrien Brody show
","After waiting for quite long after seeing its trailer, I finally saw the pianist. The movie was entirely different from what I thought. Set on the backdrop of the holocaust in Warsaw, 'The Pianist' tells the gripping story of how a Polish Jewish musician, Wladyslaw Szpilman, survives the pogrom. All the humiliating decrees that were issues right from the Nazi invasion of Poland are brought through different characters and the general sufferings of the Jewish families are brought through Szpilman's family. Szpilman's family is sent to extermination camps along with all other Jews. But Szpilman is saved by his piano lovers(5 of them on various occasions).<br/><br/>Adrien Brody with his desolate face has breathed life of a pianist in this movie. Some reviews here complain that just because he was a pianist doesn't make his life valuable over others. In my view,the pianist in him had made him a character one wouldn't allow to die. Born in the same family, while his brother is rebellious, the pianist is benign. As it is said here, musicians don't make good conspirators and the piano makes him a soft and lovable character. He never shows an outburst of emotion at any point in time. He doesn't participate in the uprising thought he helps it. The gentle way he talks to his lady love(supposedly) while moving to the ghetto or during their meeting on the road, the way he talks to anyone for that matter in a pleasant and soft voice speaks much about his demeanor. The scene where he asks for a loaf of bread in hunger after much hesitancy and the one where he plays the piano in air(unable to control his passion) are deeply moving.<br/><br/>Though Roman Polanski doesn't convey anything significant here as in Schindler's list,'The Pianist' shall send you to deep melancholy wherein you shall find your soul strike a resonant chord with his music combined with sadness and sufferings . The music is still ringing in my heart.."

","This film is totally amazing. I love it and it's got such fine details or everything in. O.K i don't like seeing people dead in the streets and stuff, but it really was like that and I think Polanski has done an amazing job of making the film of someones personal experiences. I cannot fault anything about this movie and the devotion Adam Brody must have put in to play Chopin is fantastic! Being a musician myself I cannot express how hard and stressful it would have been to learn to do that in such a short time. I think that Roman has made a perfect movie here and there is not one thing that he could do to better it. The quality of the acting from all the cast in particular Adam Brody is absolute perfection. It really makes you think you are there living the nightmare with them, and this is what good films are all about. They make you emotionally attached and I am so glad I was not living in the war. It really makes you look at what you have and feel grateful for what you have been given."

"imsandeep000","Null","1","2","27 July 2006"," I'm short of words for this film. A real Gem!
","My second review. The first being Chinatown it is evident that I'm an ardent fan of Roman Polanski. It is a textbook made film, but let's look at it this way. The Pianist is divided into three parts wherein the character development takes place in the end. The first part is when the pianist is in a highly impressive state and is made familiar with the happy tunes that he plays in that part. This is probably the best setup I've ever seen in any of the films. While the atrocities of World War 2 play in the film the character formation still takes place which is easily visible. The second part transits itself well with the first, when the pianist is separated from his family which is one of the best obstacles put by Roman Polanski. Here, the trauma and the hardships increase changing the piano tunes dramatically well. The sympathy with the character is felt every time there is a cruelty in a war happening. Typical Roman Polanski, isn't it? The third and the last stage of character formation is again the total sympathy with the protagonist, but here the development of character is his efforts to survive the war which is not evident in the first part. Brilliant Screenplay, classic piano pieces and their use in the film in the right context. Great acting by Adrian Broody. No wonder he received an Oscar for his brilliant role. Excellent footage editing and use of supers in the film. Unusual start with the black and white footage transforming to the first shot of the film where Adrian broody is playing a piano. Watch this film 2 times, that may really give justice to the film. A real gem! A salute to Roman Polanski! A 10/10."

"wantalla","7","1","2","29 June 2006"," A very violent movie!
","I thought that it was a very sad movie with a lot of violence like shooting and fighting. It really made me think back to how it was in Szpilman's day. The best bit was when Hosenfeld saved Szpilman. That shows that in every bad group there might be some good people. It was sad at the end when Szpilman couldn't save Hosenfeld, because, even if he is German, he had saved Szpilman shouldn't have been sent to the concentration camp. I rate this movie a 7 because it had both a part of fictional parts (which might not be that unreal) and both a bit of history in it. It was a shame to see the Nazis doing all those horrible things to the Jews but it was very inspiring and recommend this film to you even if it might be a bit gross in some parts. But that's just Polanski role, which is making it look real."

","I loved this film. I also was concerned it was going to be another ""Schindler's List"". I find it difficult to express in words why I disliked Schindlers list. Its not a bad film, in fact it is very well constructed and quite moving. But I guess I just could not escape the feeling that it was begging the audience for sorrow and feelings of guilt. Maybe even commercially trading on the murder of millions of Jews? I felt that it was a one sided political message. Anyway I was worried that the Pianist was going to be of the same ilk. How wrong I was. There are no political overtones, it is simply a stunningly crafted human story of one man's survival through the horrors of Jewish oppression and WW2. The film is tragically beautiful. The soundtrack is haunting, and the acting superb. The story is simple and well crafted and the cinematography is gorgeous.

This movie is an idol of outstanding performances, especially by Adrien Brody, who was more than up to the challenge.<br/><br/>The plot isn't the main focus here. As the demanding role of Sziplman is more than enough to tell the whole story.

We see him being forced by the German army to move from one place to another with his family, and the drama escalates as he gets separated from them later on, to find himself armed with only his wits, and a seemingly useless talent, which is of course, playing the piano.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, and forget all this nonsense about anti-Semitism for 150 min, and get yourself a copy of this movie.

","The Pianist is a great movie that deserves the credit.<br/><br/>The storyline was great, the cast (though most of them seem to be new faces) did a great job and the movie did not need any complicated special effects and its simplicity made it originally perfect.<br/><br/>The movie was set during the World War II beginning from the time of the German invasion of Poland and the movie ended after the Russians took over. The movie does not merely portray on military fighting or any serious battles but it focuses mainly on the life of Splitzman (played by Adrien Brody) who was known to be the most famous pianist in Poland at the time.<br/><br/>His life headed for the worse after his family was taken away and he was forced to work hard labor for the Nazis. Though later he escapes and was hidden by some generous Polish people, his life became a nightmare after everyone in town left due to the effects of the war and he was left all alone to face & hide from the Germans with whatever strength, leftover food and luck he had...till the Russians came.<br/><br/>The best war related kind of movie since Schlinder's List.

","When I watched the Oscar telecast in 2003, I was rooting for 'Chicago' to win the Best Picture nod. When it did I was elated, for I too was caught up in the 'Razzle Dazzle'. Then I watched 'The Pianist' and the movie just blew me away. I loved the subtle things, his day to day survival, even how the colour slowly drained from the screen until we were just left with muted grays. The scene in which the tank rolls down the street and matter-of-factly begins to shoot at passersby is delicately and simply executed. No blood, no special effects, no music, just a running lady stopped in mid-stride and slumped in the road. It really brought home to me that this was NOT just a movie, and it never sets out to be just a movie. It is truly a re-telling of the truth of Spilman's life. Brody truly shines in this role; he is neither too bland or too over-dramatic. It is truly difficult to carry a picture by oneself and remain compelling throughout. Polanski and the entire cast and crew truly deserved the Best Picture Oscar for 2003, and I am at least grateful that I had also rooted for Brody to take home the Best Actor statue."

The Pianist tells the story of how Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew pianist and composer, survived the Holocaust by hiding in Warsaw, with help from the Polish resistance. Although Szpilman does all he can to save himself, he is not a hero because he would have died without good luck and the kindness of a few non-Jews (Remember the unexpected assistance he receives from a German officer, a Nazi music lover, in the final days of the German occupation). So much of the film concerns this character alone, so it seems emotionally distanced. However, we are reminded of the war, the brutality of the Nazis and a lot of atrocities, and we also learn something new from the perspective of a unique survivor. The horrors of that experience contrasts with the delicacy of the music which performs the pianist.<br/><br/>I like realistic films, and I think The Pianist is an important one because it put us in the Warsaw Ghetto, presenting a devastating moment in history that we, fortunately, did not live in. This film makes you think about war and its consequences. The fact that Wladyslaw Szpilman survived is not a victory when all his loved ones died. Please, just think about the suffering, the impotence and the grief of this man. Everybody could be a pianist."

","I am posting this message to compliment Roman Polanski on bringing us a factual account of the plight of the Jewish people in World War II.  It was a time of sorrow and despair for these people and it was depicted so vividly because the cast of this film played their roles to perfection.<br/><br/>Adrian Brody, who played Wladyslaw Szpilman, is an extremely talented actor, and the only one who could have done so well in the title role.  I was so pleased when he won an Oscar for his performance as no one could have ever been more deserving.  The suffering Szpilman endured just trying to stay alive was beyond our imagination.<br/><br/>Darien Wawer, the little boy who died at the wall is a wonderful child actor.  His role portrayed the terrible tragedies that occurred daily to both young and old.  His acting ability is amazing and he played his part very convincingly.<br/><br/>So many people helped Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brody) through these difficult years, and one in particular won the hearts of many viewing this film.  That person was Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). Apparently a high ranking German officer, Hosenfeld found Szpilman just in time to save him from starvation.  He not only kept this secret, but he brought food enabling Szpilman to survive.  It was heart breaking to learn that Hosenfeld was captured after the war and died in a Soviet prison camp in 1952.  Szpilman was unable to find him and help him.  Thomas Kretschmann was very inspiring in this role.  He is a magnificent actor and I will watch for him in future films.<br/><br/>The piano solos performed by Janusz Olejniczak were so beautiful, and the music stays with you long after the film is through.  I have viewed this film many times, and I have come to the realization that throughout the coming years, no one will forget the names of Wladyslaw Szpilman and Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.  We will always feel sorrow for the ones who perished and thankfulness for the ones who survived."
"canadude","10","1","2","4 February 2004"," the best film about the Holocaust
","*contains some spoilers* Roman Polanski's The Pianist is an experience in taut restraint, both in acting and direction. It is also Polanski's most personal film and the only one based on a true story. The title refers to Wladyslaw Szpilman (upon whose memoirs the film is based), a young Polish Jew living in Warsaw at the time of the Nazi invasion in 1939. He is a pianist by profession and nature, which the film and book make abundantly clear. Polanski's film, primarily due to its cautious and intelligent restraint, achieves a haunting resonance and brutal realism, but most importantly, through the story of Szpilman, it captures the horrors of the Jewish experience during WWII. Indeed, Polanski tells Szpilman's story true to its source, without moralizing, histrionics, and glorifying certain characters while vilifying others.<br/><br/>The Pianist opens with images of Warsaw just months before the war, yet within a minute Szpilman is playing the piano on the Polish Radio, bombs exploding in the distant outside. However, a few seconds later the distant outside becomes the terrifying close inside and debris starts falling on Szpilman's piano. Soon, despite the hopes and self-assurances of his family the war does not stop with British or French support - the Nazis march inside the city and Warsaw Jews find themselves wearing distinguishing armbands with the Star of David on them. Szpilman and his family, with the notable exception of his brother, watch the institution of new rules and regulations unfold with curious hope and acceptance. In that sense, The Pianist resembles many of Polanski's other films. Like in Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, or Chinatown the main characters suddenly experience a change of reality within which they exist. They plunge into it since they are unable to counter it, or even understand it. Consequently, when Szpilman's family is sent to a concentration camp and he manages to escape, his experiences inside and outside the Warsaw ghetto are marked by a certain stoicism.<br/><br/> However, Polanski cannot be faulted for the emotional restraint of his main character, perfectly performed by Adrien Brody. Brody's bare performance sheds light on Szpilman's focus on the most basic survival, revealing to us the true horrors of the Holocaust. Szpilman's lack of sentiment, for which Polanski has been criticized, reflects the dehumanization under Nazi occupation. Human beings are reduced to simple hunter-gatherers, they are concerned with making it through the day without dying. Furthermore, whatever rationality, discussion and outrage exist in the movie, they occur in the beginning before the Nazi horrors actually begin. When violence, random shootings, and executions become part of the reality of Warsaw ghetto residents, no emotion seems strong enough a reaction.  There is a scene in the movie where a German commander stops a group of Jews going to work, Szpilman among them, and asks several at random to lie down. He shots them all in the head except for the last one - his magazine is empty. The scene is reminiscent of a scene in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, in which a German soldier attempts the same, but his gun locks on him. After several tries he gives up and lets the victim live. Polanski's soldier reloads the gun and shoots the man. The camera observes these terrifying events unflinchingly, detached from them. Yet this detachment is a virtue - it adds to the horrifying, merciless realism of Polanski's film. I admire this detachment precisely because it would have been very easy to introduce notions of vengeance into the movie, to stereotype, or surrender to sentimental and false heroism. Yet that would have undermined the portrayal of the Holocaust experience, where not all Germans were evil, not all Jews were good, and the moral rules by which we live were shattered.<br/><br/> The film's most crucial scene occurs when Szpilman encounters a Nazi officer who eventually saves him from death. Devoid of sentimentality, beautifully directed, it is simply a montage of shots of Szpilman playing Chopin on the piano and the officer watching. Yet it also a scene that makes explicit what is so attractive to Polanski about Szpilman's story. The German officer is not an enemy here, an amoral brute, but a human being, who, by circumstance, is in the position to save or kill Szpilman, who, by circumstance, is completely helpless. This element of fate is crucial to The Pianist - Polanski's Holocaust is an irrational, fated event. Polanski underlines that Szpilman survives by mere accident, just like others die by chance. In that accident lies the horror of the Holocaust - in fate's indiscriminate brutality.<br/><br/>Some critics have stated that Polanski's film tells a story atypical to the Jewish experience, precisely because Szpilman survives, whereas most Jews were exterminated. Though it may be atypical of him to survive, the randomness with which he does speaks of the arbitrariness (and consequently meaninglessness) of those who perished. The restraint with which Polanski approaches the adaptation of Szpilman's The Pianist pervades the entire film, resulting in a mercilessly terrifying, real and unsentimental picture of the Nazi horrors. The film is unflinching, honest and it does not settle for easy answers - rather, it shows us a true story without judging any of the characters or the situation within which they coexist. It simply unfolds and in its simplicity lies its impact."

You are taken on such a sad journey of bravery by not only the lead character but by everyone who suffered during the war.

","This movie was fabulous!  One of the top 10 for me.  History was never one of my strong subjects nor am I interested in making into one... so any if there are any inaccuracies I won't notice.<br/><br/>The imagery is powerful, moving and intense without being overly graphic, vulgar or gory.  The history of these crimes is a horror and there is no way to convey the true feeling of being there.  <br/><br/>I love the perspective of the movie through the pianists eyes'... he is part of so many circles; the artist... the family member... Polish... and just plain human!<br/><br/>I squirmed in my seat, felt uncomfortable and quietly reflected on the grotesque behaviour of the Germans.  <br/><br/>Today we get upset, whine, complain, and throw hissy fits while waiting in a line-up at the bank, or the movie theatre.  The Polish people lived through an atrocity...<br/><br/>movies like this give me something to ponder when I am feeling full of self-pity and lose my perspective!  There's nothing that can possibly be wrong in my life that won't work itself out and will not be anywhere as cataclysmal as to what someone like Wladyslaw Szpilman lived through!"
"Poseidon-3","Null","1","2","19 January 2004"," Beautifully tuned piece of cinema
","Far from the first motion picture to deal with the Holocaust and unlikely to be the last, this is nevertheless a stunning piece of film.  Brody portrays the title character (based on an actual person) who plays piano on Polish radio until the Nazi invasion of his country makes it impossible to continue.  Through his eyes, the audience witnesses the continual, seemingly-unstoppable dehumanization of Brody and his family and the virtual destruction of Poland.  The journey that this character takes, undoubtedly enhanced by director Polanski's own recollection of his early life, is almost incomprehensible.  Since so many films have been released on this subject, one can't help noticing the similarity to other movies and the familiarity of the situations depicted in the opening scenes.  However, the utter craftsmanship of this film and the casting (nothing short of perfection down the very last role) set this apart until the story's uniqueness kicks in.  Brody is nothing short of magnificent.  His face reflects (naturally and without mugging) the soulfulness, humiliation and deprivation of his character.  Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland.  Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity.  There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.)  What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times.  Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing.  That is not to say that the film is easy to watch.  Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody.  The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films. If there are any faults in the film, they are few.  Perhaps some of Brody's experiences seem repetitive at times and the depiction of Germans sometimes approaches caricature.  However, all is forgiven as the story reaches its heart-stopping moment when Brody is attempting to open an all-important can of food.  Here the film reaches brilliance.  Clearly, the film is not going to appeal to the shallow or the disinterested, but to those who have a fondness for striking, deeply-felt and lovingly-told stories, this one is hard to top."
"khatcher-2","8","1","2","10 December 2003"," Perhaps Polanski's masterpiece
","Every time I listen to Chopin or Paderewski, every time I read Gunther Grass or Grazyna Borkowska, or I see a film like `Schindler's List' (qv) or this one - `The Pianist' - I catch myself saying `poor Poland'.<br/><br/>A country that has been squashed uncomfortably between two erstwhile powerful nations, Germany and the then U.S.S.R., and that has even managed to disappear as a nation from the map, but has managed to maintain its national sense and feeling and identity, obviously imposes one's  respect. There can be, I feel, no denying that Poland was probably the nation which most suffered in the Second World War. And including the more than two million Jews who then lived there. All attempts at genocide are deplorable, whether it be the massacres of ex-Jugoslavija in Bosnia and Kersovo; whether it be the annihilations in Timur; whether it be the endless conflicts in Sierra Leone, Liberia or the Congo. <br/><br/>It should be fairly easy then to understand why I rate `Schindler's List' as one of the best U.S. films - though almost entirely made in Europe - very high on my list, and why Roman Polanski's film runs nicely alongside. The fact that there is but just one decimal point between these two films on IMDb's `Top 250' listing does not surprise me in the least, and in fact I might - I repeat - might - even reverse the two on my own list. Yes, both are great films; both scoring around 8,7 on my own personal rating.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski has, for me, always been a rather up-and-down director, such that `Rosemary's Baby' is a fine horror film; but his adaptation of Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte's novel for his film called `The Ninth Gate' (qv) was rather poor, not to say unacceptable. However, with `The Pianist' he has put together what must be his own personal masterpiece. Resorting to British, French, German, Russian and of course Polish commitment in the making of the film, and is thus a pan-European production, he managed to assemble some of the best possible means for making a tremendous film. And it is tremendous: from the scene setting to the interpretations of the the actors. It was all so terribly real; the Warsaw ghetto seizes your heart; the summary executions freeze your blood.<br/><br/>
Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, on whose autobiography the film is built, is most certainly excellent, not just for his acting of the character, but also for his piano playing: Brody himself descends from a Hungarian mother. Szpilman not only composed for the piano, but also composed numerous songs. He died only a few years ago, nearly 90 years of age. Maybe he was not the greatest perfectionist in interpretation - that kind of thing is for people like Dinu Lipatti, Vladimir Horowitz, the Russian Sviatoslav Richter, or even the great master Wilhelm Kempff. But he was another real person in the midst of the carnage of Warszawa (Warsaw). Brody's feeling for this part was really extraordinary; a highly commendable performance.<br/><br/>Fortunately the rest of the film's making was up to his standard, such that, without any doubt, Polanski's `The Pianist' is one of the great cinematographical classics of the last couple of decades.<br/><br/>Wojciech Kilar's music combines nicely with Nocturnes and Waltzes from Frydryk Chopin, the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven, and I think I caught a piece by Franz Liszt, though I am not sure.<br/><br/>Brilliant photography and scene-setting rounds off a well-produced film."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Some Are Born Great Some Achieve Greatness Some Have Greatness Thrust Upon Them. Szpilman, on the hand, stayed home.<br/><br/>In about the first half of this film Polanski manages to follow Ezra Pound's dictum--Make It New!--to powerful effect. Although the imposition of anti-Jewish laws in Poland and the herding of Jews into the ghetto have been done many times before, Polanski has somehow made them freshly frightening and has added new (to me) details that underline the terror. Excellent--so far.<br/><br/>But then we have to deal with the pianist himself, Mr. Szpilman. There's a real problem here: Szpilman is an utterly unworthy person. I'm not suggesting unworthy of life but unworthy of this film. A film is myth-making by nature and Szpilman is a shabby person indeed. As portrayed here he is singularly uninvolved in anything except his music--morally adrift, in fact. At one point he half-heartedly offers to help in printing/distributing anti-Nazi leaflets but is quickly told, essentially, ""you're an artist--not right for this job."" Possibly that's true but Szpilman accepts the judgment too easily--almost leaps for it. (Who amongst us wouldn't at least put up an argument if told ""Sorry, sonny--you're just a kid. Leave this stuff to us big boys""?<br/><br/>Szpilman does help a tiny bit as the ghetto Jews begin to arm themselves, but not much and not for long. He soon asks one of the leaders to help him escape and doesn't seem to notice that no one even tries to talk him into staying on to join in the uprising. Outside the ghetto Szpilman is--with the help of friends who risk their lives for him--stashed in a safe house as the ghetto erupts and then is destroyed. He knows he should be involved, even says so out loud to one of those friends--but again readily accepts the judgment that, well, he's an artist--fighting is for other people. Szpilman is happy to sit tight and read magazines until almost the very end, when he has to survive on his own. The ending is rather too pat for credibility. I was struck immediately by the fact that Szpilman never even asked the name of the German officer who let him live and showed almost no response to the news that he'd been captured. Then the war ends and he goes back to playing Chopin on the radio.<br/><br/>Under the same circumstances, I freely admit, I might have done exactly what Szpilman did. And I too would be unworthy. ---------<br/><br/>As an aternaive, I suggest Fania Fenelon's ""Playing for Time"" (book or movie)."

","I just saw ""The Pianist"" at my local theater. It is Saturday, and the British and American armies and air forces are in day four of their invasion of Iraq. I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the German invasion of Poland in the movie, and events just now unfolding. In 1939 the Germans had their own ""documented"" grievances against the ""aggressive"" Poles. Later it was revealed that the dead German bodies produced for the German newsreel footage justifying their invasion of Poland were just some corpses the Nazis rounded up, and dressed in German and Polish uniforms. Point to make is that 69% of the Germans--- otherwise law abiding, Christian, decent people, probably felt the same grim determination modern day American and British peoples feel toward Iraq. No one is cheering the deaths, but they are nonetheless sanctioning them, in the name of some political agenda. Saddam as Hitler? Yes--- but Bush and Blair as Hitlers, too? Sadly, it seems so. ""The Pianist"" gives a human face to the real victims--- and I am fearful that many innocent Iraqis may get a double dose of what this movie points out--- first from their own government, and now again from ours.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" portrays the fate of Polish Jews during world war two. The movie is a true masterpiece, surpassing most other movies that have undertaken the story. I attended the movie reluctantly--- I did not feel like sitting through another retread of the same old theme, and the same old victims and villains. Great reviews tempted me, however, and I am glad I went. Adrien Brody, the star of the movie, is amazing. His performance was breathtaking. Really. I hope he wins his Oscar Sunday night.

","I was in Brussels last week and my brother and I went to see the Pianist. Neither of us new anything about the movie or the subject matter - we simply wanted to see a different film than the one his children chose at the cinema. Imagine what your reaction would be to this film with no preconceived notion of the subject matter.<br/><br/>I am not Jewish, or Polish, or German. I was born 10 years after WW2 ended, and so one might think have no vested interest in being so deeply moved by the film. As most Canadians, I have grown up with the overpowering influence of the Americans and of their Hollywood versions of history. Perhaps because of this - or in spite of it - I found the film gripping. I thought Adrien Brody's performance mesmerizing. I felt Polanski served the subject with almost a dispassionate view of events unfolding - whose characters couldn't stop the madness from escalating and whose audience found ourselves forced to be spectators (again) 60 years after the fact.<br/><br/>The superlatives are already in place on this board - but there were 2 scenes which I find I revisit because of their poignancy and their precision: one is where the family is being rounded up from the ghetto, and he turns to his sister Halina and with a finality so powerful, says, ""I wish I knew you better."" The other is when he received the packet of bread and jam from Capt. Hosenfeld, and he tastes the jam. In an instant, with only a subtle change in his facial muscles, you sense all that Szpilman had been without. I will now purchase the book, and when the distributors in North America finally show this film, I will go to see it again and take every thinking person I know with me.<br/><br/>Sadly, when the film is made about September 11 (and knowing the way the Americans work, there are probably several versions being penned as we speak), I only hope that a man like Polanski can be relied upon to make a truthful, balanced account of yet another instance of man's capacity for committing atrocities."

Some friends said, they found the movie depressing, but I think it's quite the opposite.<br/><br/> Some remarks on the reception here in Germany: all the reviews were very good, the cinema I went to was sold out, and the audience obviously was very touched by the movie, staying in their seats until the very end of the closing credits.

","The longer the 2nd WW is behind us, the more films and books fill in our perception of that event. The most important aspect to The Pianist is: it blows away that Disney-Holocaust Spielberg epic. Polanski is very modest here, and that suits him and the film. The fact that the things we don't see, but only suggested with, are even more horrific than the horror we do get to see is a fantastic approach. It is seldom we can see a picture where one has to think, an fill in, instead of being fed. But there is a downsize: the story stays very close to the book, in fact, it adds nothing new to it, except for the stunning images. With the same imagination we use in the film, we can read the book and get the same result.<br/><br/>But then again, the longer ago the event is, the more important nowadays it is for people to go and see this very solid and integer picture.

In fact, it's entertaining enough as you watch it--those actors who look more like schoolboys from some prestigious English boarding school than starving Polish Jews, the mean Nazis, those duplicitous, red-cheeked Polacks. Among the many other stupid things about this movie that I've forgotten since I saw it is that everybody is always speaking in English. Now there must be hundreds of holocaust/evil-German movies out there and in most of them all the Germans and their victims speak English! Come on! It's just ridiculous.

","I'm just going to bite the bullet and say something that is potentially quite ugly and offensive, so I'll apologize in advance for how this makes me sound. I've seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity's history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I've seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn't muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle, and almost feel like I've become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can't continue to break every time I see it. In fact, I just watched a couple of similar films based on the true stories of Jews fleeing the Holocaust within the last month, so perhaps it was just bad timing.<br/><br/>I think the other reason that The Pianist didn't connect with me as well as any number of similar stories is the passive role that Szpilman plays in his own story. In many ways he is merely an observer of what happens. His story is about fleeing, watching, and others helping him. Once his family is removed from the equation, we don't form much of a bond with anyone else we see suffering. I'm not suggesting he did anything wrong, in fact his story is quite impressive. However, when I've seen films about people inside the concentration camps, or forced to endure heinous acts of cruelty, it's hard to be as impacted by a guy who is hiding. I hope this doesn't make me sound too much like a monster, and I certainly didn't hate The Pianist. In fact, I was looking forward to hearing him play more, because the actual music was marvelous. It's impossible to be bored by a movie like this, because there's always some new horrible thing around the corner. I guess my standards for movies in this genre have just been raised too much, and it will take something truly original or outstanding to hit me with the power of Holocaust movies that came before."

","There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see."

","It was since the time the movie was released and won Oscar I wanted to see this movie. At last I got the time and occasion to see it.<br/><br/>The story is about a famous young Polist Jew pianist in Warsaw, Germany during World war II (1939-1944) Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody). The Jews  including his family and he are subjected to atrocities by German army and subjected to move from their palatial upper class living to smaller quarters, and the journey continues till they are boarded to a train leading to gas chamber. Wladyslaw manages to escape the train journey and finds refuge at different places in most trying circumstances. Many a times nearing occasions of death and being caught; Wladysalw survives the War in the end, when he is rescued by the invading Polish army.<br/><br/>Director Roman Polaski, who himself is a Polish Jew, had suffered and experienced similar circumstances during WW II. This is one of the most grandeur scale movie the Roman has directed till date. The set are magninomious, and the details of War and its impact on Warsaw city is depicted with utmost reality. The ghetto of Jew neighborhood with a segregating wall in between is chilling, so are numerous scenes when innocent Jews are shown being killed without any reason.<br/><br/>Though this is a movie of a pianist, its main theme is to show the world (one more time) the atrocities Jews faced in Germany during WWII. This time  the master is at work. It just happens that the protagonist is a pianist, it could have had been anyone. It does not matter  because the purpose seems evidently clear  to show how Jews suffered during WWII.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody does a great job in bringing a real character and his fears, desires to life. He lives the role in body and skin. He acting is a treat to watch.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb. It is obvious the movie must be very well funded.<br/><br/>One question that intrigued me throughout the movie was  Why were Jews segregrated and killed by Germans? I tried to google it, and most of the blame goes to Hitler, who wanted to eliminate a few races. I also read that Jews are most arrogant, clever, intelligent and shrewd blood sucking money making machines, who are very mean in their business. I may need to read some what more on this before I can make my own conclusion.<br/><br/>There is nothing new or great about the theme, but a good movie by a master Roman Polaski. It surely had to won accolades in US, as Jews rule the business world  especially Hollywood.<br/><br/>(Stars 7.5 out of 10)"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","3","4 March 2008"," Humanity manages to survive in apocalyptic horror
","Polanski had to make a film about the tragic past of the country whose name he carries. He had to concentrate on the primal historical ""crime"" committed by cosmic time and the war in 1939-1945, the extermination of the Jews by the Germans with the vast complicity of the Poles. The film is brilliant in its dense darkness because Polanski does not concentrate his tale so much on the community but on one particular Jew and his family he will be the only survivor of (it is a true story). He does not choose a Jew that would represent money or work, but a pianist, an artist representing cultural, universal and human talent that has no ethnic color whatsoever. And yet he moves further. After showing the ghettoization of the Jews in Warsaw, then their enslavement and extermination, then the escape of this pianist and his clandestine survival in the hands of non-Jews, some honest resistant fighters who put themselves in danger because of their political action, some (at least one) making a personal profit out of their help, the pianist also sees the meaningful and significant upheaval of the Jews when the ghetto is nearly empty. Pathetic but too late. He sees the doomed upheaval of the liberal resistant fighters and this time too early so that the Germans can exterminate them. Note here the film never really concentrate on the SS as the evil doers and the others as submissive followers. All Germans are concerned. The sacrifice of these resistant fighters leads to nothing since it clears the way for the communists to be the only ones to profit from the arrival of the Russians. Polanski even pushes one step further and there the film becomes a gospel about the shiny side of humanity. That pianist will survive the last few weeks thanks to a Wehrmacht officer who will accept to hide his presence and to feed him through to the end , and even give him a coat  that could have been tragic when the Russians arrived  before leaving. The officer had been convinced to provide this help by some music played on a piano by the Jew in the middle of ruins and on the eve to the final defeat. Music as the universal humanistic language beyond barbarity. Beautiful. Inspiring. A real salvation and epiphany for us all. That is exactly where pathos is discarded and love comes into the picture. A love that can transcend hatred and reach cosmic time in the smallness of human historical if not purely existential time. And If the pianist survive up to 2000, the German officer died in captivity in the USSR in 1952. Irony of irony, it is nothing but irony.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"general-melchett","10","1","3","2 February 2007"," ""Schindler's List"" receives worthy competition!
","Being made by somebody who had to suffer the Holocaust, you probably understand that The Pianist will try to tell a different story to Schindler's List and focus a bit more on the horrors that were committed in Nazi Europe. And it serves both purposes well - did I say well? I meant... brilliantly. Whereas Schindler's List's settings were very authentic yet always very organised, The Pianist's settings are more run-down and actually look like they've been through something terrible. The acting is top-notch - Adrien Brody delivers the feelings and emotions of a Polish Jew in WWII separated from everything and everyone he loves in all aspects. And the harrowing heights of this film do reach Schindler's List's heights - perhaps even exceeding that when Polish Jews lay down on their faces and were shot in the head.. The piano tunes were beautiful and Adrien Brody really did make a good on-screen musician - even if his fake playing wasn't exactly brilliant in quality. The ending was emotional and nearly brought a tear to my eye (MAJOR SPOILERS COMING UP!) - I can't imagine how it would have felt if Szpilman had been killed after surviving and going through so much. But that is the true unfairness and unpredictability of war, and though The Pianist isn't quite as famous as Schindler's List, it sure is as good. I would have given this film a well-deserved 10 if the fake piano playing had been done a bit better. But it's so emotionally brilliant and harrowing in parts, I think I'll give it the 10 anyway. Spiffing. 10/10"
"gelman@attglobal.net","9","1","3","29 January 2007"," Different than what I expected: Spoilers
","Reviews of ""The Pianist"" had led me to expect that Adrien Brody's real life character, Wladyslav Szpilman, had survived the Holocaust because the Nazis valued him as an entertainer. Strictly speaking, that is true in the sense that one particular high-ranking Nazi hears him play near the very end of the film and does not betray him. However, the film is mainly about the Szpilman's survival within the Warsaw ghetto, his escape from the ghetto while the dispatch of Jews to the death camps is underway, his existence in hiding with the help of a Polish couple, the destruction of much of Warsaw by the Nazis during the uprising and, penultimately, his retreat back to the ghetto to hide until the Russians arrive. In short, 99 percent of the film has absolutely nothing to do with Nazi patronage and the 1 percent is the mercy extended to him because of his talent by a single Nazi commander. It is nonetheless a brilliant film, and Adrien Brody certainly deserves all the praise he received for his role as Szpilman. However, because of his unsavory reputation in the U.S., Roman Polanski received insufficient attention as the director of this film. Polanski's achievement is at least equal to Brody's and I believe that he would have received an Oscar if he weren't persona non grata in the U.S. and in Hollywood."

"jhaile1","10","1","3","1 October 2006"," The Pianist (observation and comment)
","What a film! <br/><br/>The character played by Adrien Brody was so magnificently and accurately projected. Compared to other films of the era, the actor projected the character with dignity. Even when it was so difficult to remain rational in an irrational time, the character was humble and focused. The characters played by the other cast members were just as smart and outstanding, some times challenging to understand as to why 'Henrick'would react in the way he does to some of the brutes the Germans inflict on ""Jewish prisoners."" Despite his reactions it was also refreshing to know that he would refuse to join the 'Zander Commanders', which he could but he declines to the offer. In times of such difficulties people would do anything to sustain their life even if it is for a second, yet 'Henrick' would refuse to abide by that nature of human traits. Some one said once, 'temptation is a true measure of character.' Even though by joining the 'Zander Commander' he could have benefited himself and his families' stay in the camp would have been improved for the remaining of their days before they were gassed should he join, but he was clear and firm that he wouldn't join'em. It was also comforting to learn that some people in the Polish civil society remained rational in such trying times, such as hiding Szpilman in their flats. Why would they take risk in hiding a Jewish man in their house? <br/><br/>I have seen many films projecting a certain time-frame in the history of mankind, this film by far outplays them all. Like 'The Diary of Anne Frank this too is based on true story that really took place in the last century. The Jewish people have suffered tremendously thru out history, especially in Europe. The story projected in this film tingles a normal human to a state of sadness to a point of making one question that such people (Germans/NAZIS) did exist at some point in contemporary Europe. Since I have seen this film I grew very interested in learning why people hate others to such a degree? I have yet to come to the understanding of the concept of hate, but I am learning. Some experts say that hate is a result of fear embraced by self doubt that the hate-monger espouse due to fear he/she may not be able to compete and win over the person/s they wish/intend to eradicate."
"sebrat","10","1","3","28 June 2005"," An eye-opener, a stunner and a breathtaking performance
","If ever a movie deserved all of the Oscars it received, this is it. Admittedly, reading the book makes it very dull to watch, but as I read the book after watching the movie, I was stunned, and even watching it again on DVD makes the reality of the book sink in. The soundtrack and the images give it a wonderfully haunting air that words can't possibly do.<br/><br/>The Pianist is a movie about the Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who finds himself and his family caught as Jews in World War Two. Although the whole war story is a bit clichéd (Anne Frank, La Vita e Bella etc.) I don't think I've ever seen a movie that captures world war two so perfectly. Once the Nazis have made a ghetto in Warsaw, Szpilman must fight to keep his family together at all costs, though after little more than a year has passed, his family are predictably taken away to a concentration camp, though Szpilman survives, being rescued by a Jewish policeman. After working in the ghetto dismantling the wall, Szpilman breaks free and begins his two year life in hiding while the city of Warsaw literally crumbles around him.<br/><br/>I think that this movie is driven by the true horror of world war two for the Jewish people. As I said in the introduction, it is haunting and sticks around with you for a few weeks. Also, the movie starts out very scary, but rather than building up to a climactic end, it gradually gets less and less 'in your face' and shocking. As it is a Polanski film, there is a lot of gore in the beginning and the true horror of WW2 is at its highest. I was more than pleased with the performances and thought that it gives us all an eye-opening account into what life was like sixty years ago. Performance - 9/10 (especially Adrien Brody as Szpilman). Writing: Book - 10/10, screenplay - 7/10. Costumes, makeup etc. - 9/10. Soundtrack - 9/10 (it was a great idea to dub Szpilman's own music)."
"sackleywhistle","8","1","3","13 October 2003"," And the award for best picture goes to...
","... Chicago. Oh dear. What a travesty. 2003 continued the trend for the politics to rule the Academy Awards, giving the most prestigious gong to the boring Chicago over this, possibly Polanski's last great masterpiece. Not that he won't make more films, but that this is his finest since Chinatown, a genuine return to form. And with the current stigma against him in the US, he had to seek out funding from four (count them) countries to ensure this worthy, important film got made. <br/><br/>It is the kind of story which has it all - heartbreak, loss, love, death, prejudice, malice, violence, hope, despair, humour and triumph. And that is because it is the story of a man, a real man. An acclaimed, well-known Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman is our guide to the ghettoisation and subsequent extermination of the Warsaw Jews in World War II, evading capture because of his connections, but watching his family go to die. He survives by joining the Jewish uprising, then hiding in apartments and then ruins in war-torn Warsaw, fleeing from conflict, an outsider watching the dehumanisation of his kin from the inside.<br/><br/>Comparisons between this and the earlier Schindler's List are obvious, particularly in the early evacuation scenes, but rather than one being better than the other, they are merely companion pieces, each approaching different aspects of similar material, shot through with restraint, respect and brilliance. However, while the facts of Schindler's life are open to question, this feels much more real. Szpilman's position is purposefully ambiguous - while he is a man stuck in a desperate situation, seemingly doomed if he does not act, he does not have the bravery others have to stand up and fight. Indeed, at times it seems he dismisses the brutality of others to pursue his own ends - such as when his brother is arrested - but this is merely because there is the sense that everyone is doomed, and if you stop to help someone less fortunate, you may forfeit your own life. His bravery comes instead from his sheer refusal to give up and become a number, another Jewish corpse. By the closing act of the film, you come to realise that he was a man who had respect and a career, even prominence, stripped of everything - his dignity, his clothes, his home, his family, even food - but finding a way to survive, until it blows over and he can once again play the piano. By the end, it seems that this is the only place where he succeeds as a person - he did not relate well to members of his family, he has no lover, he passes from person to person, in passing friendships. But when he plays the piano, people listen and he can express all those things that he otherwise could not in life.<br/><br/>This is by far the most handsome film Polanski has made, every shot filled with detail and beauty in one form or another. Sticking to his ideal of only putting the camera where best to view any given scene from, there is no visual baggage or fancy editing at work, simply old-fashioned, straightforward, immersive storytelling. By shooting from a detached point of view - many scenes looking down on action in the streets below, or through cracks in blasted windows and roofs - you not only get a sense of being a spectator to the events, but feel Szpilman's interaction or lack of in those events. This, along with the editing, gives the film a good sense of pace. The first hour goes by quite quickly, filled with anecdotal and historical information, as events in Warsaw go from bad to worse in a matter of days. Then as Szpilman becomes more alone, time begins to drag on, filling the emptiness of loneliness with readiness to move and hide if trouble comes calling. And then finally, the end is insight - the Russians are coming to free Warsaw from the Nazis - and you know it is just a matter of time until that release comes and normality returns. This is truly the work of an auteur, and it is testament to all involved that a film running at two and a half hours feels as though it could have been longer and you would not have minded.<br/><br/>All the actors acquit themselves well, but this is Adrien Brody's film. Delivering on the promise he showed in smaller roles in The Thin Red Line and then Summer of Sam, Brody does a wonderful job with Szpilman, conveying a range of emotions simply with his eyes. Special mention should also go to Emilia Fox stepping up from British TV and making a good job of it and Thomas Kretschmann, who, after all the horror of the film, makes a genuinely touching and human Nazi. His scenes with Brody are among the most affecting, though they share very sparse dialogue, conveying everything through silent actions. Top prize has to go to Kretschmann's face as Szpilman plays the Piano for the first time in nearly four years, followed by Brody's weeping relief, not only at having his life spared but at being able to play, for what he must have thought was for the last time in his life.<br/><br/>That Brody and Polanski won major awards for their work on this is highly deserved. That the rest of the crew were overlooked is shameful, particularly looking at the films that took their place. However, that is a minor note (no pun intended) and this is a major film (I'll stop now), well deserving of attention. It is thoroughly satisfying and thoroughly cinematic."

","I think this is a good movie but still I think there are much better ones about WW2 and the Holocaust. The movie is well made and the acting is very good but the subject is so worn out that it leaves you nothing. Why do they always have to see things black and white (good or bad) when war and life is not as simple as that. WW2 was awful, I agree, but give it a break and START living in the present! Some producers, IMHO, try to take advantage of WW2's ""success"" in Hollywood and the film's industry overall to build a name or to be liked by everyone. This sort of propaganda movies are the ones that brainwash people into thinking that some countries or people are evil and some are good without even thinking about the causes and consequences of the actions in the story (specially when is such a delicate subject as this one where the story is actually a part of history and something that affect us all). The film only drives you emotionally through it but it's just that and nothing else what makes it good. I agree the director did a great job with the movie but let us hope this is the last film about this topic or, at least, let us view some new ideas.

The other film was the Jack Nicholson Oscar nominated role and although I watched it yesterday, I have already forgotten it's name. Unlike many reviewers, I have seen many films dealing with the Holocaust. I have not become immune to the subject and frankly, Polanski does start to touch on the horror and the random acts of inhumanity. However, the pianist character left me cold. A man who is almost completely devoid of any character. Neither a hero or a villain, but just a dull, cold fish. He barely shows fear and certainly aside from two moments when he looks upset (family taken off and little boy beaten to death) is robotic. I saw no Oscar performance here, found the constant leaping from subject to subject disorienting and had no time to really get to know anyone in the story but the robot. I am not sure what Polanski's goal was in making this movie but it came off as neither drama nor documentary. Too little of everything except perhaps, historical accuracy."

","I liked this movie. It was good but, it could have been great (ie Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful) The reason it was not, I felt, was it was excessive. After seeing that many innocent jews executed, killed in battle, or beaten on the street, one just becomes desensitized to it. By the end of the film, I don't believe I felt, or was capable of feeling, anything. I guess the fault lies not entirely with the film. I suppose with the excess of violence this generation is exposed to everyday, Polanski probably felt he needed that much killing in plain sight to tap our emotions. Yet past movies depicting the holocaust have done a much finer job of imprinting how terrible a tragedy it was, and that's why they are great.<br/><br/>But maybe I am wrong - Maybe Polanski was not trying to make a great (in the sense I've been using the word) film, but a simpler story about one man's amazing survival. That is what he has done with The Pianist."

It will definitely frighten and shock you - shame on you if it doesn't - but the portrait of the persons involved does never manifest itself sufficiently to occupy your heart.<br/><br/>Holocaust must definitely never be forgotten and the tale can never be told too often.

"Pasafist","Null","1","3","17 July 2003"," Passafist Dissects The Pianist using Castaway
","Hollywood Sucks!  I have just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece, a film that is about characters and events, that's lyrical and beautiful and all I can think of after it is how much of a tool Tom Hanks is.  Why is it that after experiencing Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST I can only think of Robert Zemeckis's CAST AWAY?  It's a really an eerie feeling, but go with me for a little while.  Maybe my ranting will begin to make sense.<br/><br/>THE PIANIST is the powerful and lyrical life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brody, Summer of Sam), a Jew living in Poland during World War II. It follows him from a peaceful life as a piano player on polish radio, to the ghetto's of Warsaw, to hiding in empty apartments, and all the while dreaming of life as it once was.  CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks, The Money Pit) a FedEx employee that gets trapped on a deserted island and in the end talks to volleyball. <br/><br/>How are these two stories similar?  They're both about men trying to make through unbelievable circumstances and how they must do it alone.  One takes the Hollywood approach, where everything is ambiguously tied up at the end. The other takes a more lyrical approach, where a man returns to what he does best.  The Pianist takes the lyrical approach and in the end is more successful a story.<br/><br/>Brody is fantastic.  For much of the film he's teetering on that thin line between madness and sanity.  Nothing more telling than the scene, in which, Szpilman, whom hasn't eaten in days, finds an unopened jar of pickles.  In his attempt to open that jar he is confronted by his worst fear, a German guard standing before him.  In a Hollywood film, this scene would be about Szpilman breaking free and running away.  But in the PIANST it about him longing for that can of pickles.  When he picks it up off the floor he holds onto it for dear life.  If his life is not taken by the guard he's got to eat so he's not letting go.  It's a small moment that is really powerful.<br/><br/>I contrast that with Tom Hanks teetering on that thin line as well.  He has a friend, he talks to a volleyball.  But this relationship is far different. This relationship is about giving the actor something to talk to.  The most dramatic moment in this film is when he losses the Volleyball. Problem is the film suggests that the volleyball is a character and not a need, like food. This moment is so huge it spoils what should be a moment of discovery for the character. The moment when he can go on without his crutch, but all the audience cares about is a stupid volleyball.<br/><br/>The final moments in THE PIANIST are also small but have strong impact. Moments before the credits roll we see Szpilmann sitting in an open field, wondering what to do next.  It then cuts to him doing what he's always done. He's beaten those who have tried to keep him down.  It's encouraging but the music doesn't have to swell, and the violins don't have to play.  It's a small intimate moment.  The scene does not force emotion, but there is much there.  It plays with life the way life really is, when the battle is over, we may have changed but we still sometimes go back to what we are good at. He one tha battle and he can play again.<br/><br/>CASTAWAY puts the hero right in the middle of a literal crossroads.  What should he do next?  The camera circles around him, and he walks down a road. But while  Both moments are very similar, this moment is over sentimental.  It forces emotions and it fails to move you, you don't really care what road he choses.  It kind of diminishes his battle.  He has nowhere to go and I'm sure none of us want to follow.<br/><br/>In film sometimes plot is inconsequential.  I would have loved to have been trapped on an island with Wladyslaw Szpilman as much as I didn't care about Chuck Noland on an island, and well he'd probably wind up gassed in a polish concentration camp had he come up in that time.  That's what is great about Brody's performance, he is in every  scene of this movie, and fills the screen with a character of depth and strength.  Hanks fills the screen with a character of no depth and mostly surface strength.<br/><br/>It's amazing that I could compare two completely opposite films and explain how one fails and the other one works.  But I have found a new film I can call a favorite and another film I can never rent again.  One is powerful, the other dull and yet they have two characters that can be very similar.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and rent THE PIANST, you won't be disappointed."
"Claunius","Null","1","3","16 July 2003"," Polanski's best
","Roman Polanski's The Pianist, one of the best films of 2002, has a singular, almost claustrophobic view of the Holocaust in Poland.  Where Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List was notable for its scope, its expansiveness, The Pianist views every atrocity through the eyes of one man, the celebrated Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, whose memoir provided the material for the film.  What he sees, and what he becomes during the Nazi occupation of Poland, is at the heart of this inward-looking classic.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1939, while Szpilman is playing a polonaise -- the most Polish of musical compositions -- for Polish radio.  German bombs begin to explode outside the studio; a final one literally blows Szpilman off of his piano bench.  His primary reaction to the interruption of his playing is annoyance: like his fellow Jews in Warsaw, he has no idea of the horrors to come.<br/><br/>The horrors that do come, come slowly.  First, Jews are banished from upscale eating establishments and city parks; then they are required to wear an insignia of the Star of David, identifying them immediately.  For Szpilman, however, protected by his fame as a musician, these progressively demeaning acts have little significance: like the bombs near the radio station they are annoyances, indignities that can be tolerated.<br/><br/>It's difficult to imagine how they could be brushed aside so easily, but we are reminded that they are imposed over a period of time.  With time as a shield it's possible to live in denial, casting a blind eye to the growing dehumanizing of the Jews, as well as Gypsies and other ""undesirables.""<br/><br/>Finally, however, there can be no more possibility of denial.  The Warsaw ghetto is constructed, and it is gradually populated by all the Jews in the city, packed together in subhuman conditions.  Not long afterward, the undesirables begin to be taken to the trains leading to the death camps.<br/><br/>Up to this point, Szpilman has been hardly more than a casual onlooker, but it becomes clear that his celebrity will no longer protect him or his family.  Having disdained the offer to become a Jewish collaborator, he is pulled back from a train leading to Treblinka by a collaborator who admires his music.  The rest of his family go to the camp, where they all die.<br/><br/>From this time, Szpilman lives through the war in solitude, shuffled from safe house to safe house thanks to the desperate heroics of the Polish Underground: once again, his musical genius has saved him where so many perished.  The austerity of his life is heartbreaking.  He can only watch through a window as the vainglorious Warsaw ghetto uprising occurs and is brutally put down.  One of his safe houses is directly across the street from a Warsaw hospital that has been commandeered by the Germans; watching the hospital through a window, he learns that the war on the Russian front is going from bad to worse.<br/><br/>Although the physical aspects of his life hardly change from day to day, routinely tedious and necessarily silent, Szpilman's inner life undergoes a metamorphosis.  At the beginning of the movie we see him sporting the cool arrogance of his social stature.  As time passes, he is turned almost solipsistically inward, finally becoming little more than a passive observer, who allows the circumstances of his world to enter in, but has gradually lost the capability to project himself outward.  He has seen too much; he has heard far too little, especially of his beloved music.<br/><br/>Szpilman's transition requires the most deftly understated of acting performances, and Brody delivers an unbelievably touching portrait of a man regressing from an upper-crust social existence to a life parceled out in the tiniest of morsels -- not only of food, but of human companionship. Polanski's deliberately narrow vision is the perfect vehicle for viewing this life: there's no artifice, and there's nothing remotely hinting at melodrama.  The Germans go about their business of execution and capricious slaughter coldly and efficiently: in one scene a group of German soldiers make their Jewish prisoners dance to their bullets; in another, the soldiers drop a wheelchair-bound man from an upstairs balcony before marching the remaining Jews in the room downstairs to be shot.  Polanski depicts the horrors with a cold eye: a Holocaust survivor himself, he is painfully aware that the Holocaust had very few heroes, and most often survival was the best that could be hoped for.<br/><br/>The film's defining moment occurs with the Russians at the gates of Warsaw. Szpilman, foraging for food in a bombed-out town house, encounters a German captain (Thomas Kretschmann).  Fortuitously, there is a piano in the house. When the captain asks Szpilman what he is doing, he replies that he is a musician.  ""Play something,"" the captain orders.  Szpilman does, beautifully as ever.  The captain is moved, offers his overcoat, and returns more than once with food.<br/><br/>It's difficult to adequately explain the subtlety and the power of this scene.  It captures not only the arbitrariness of Szpilman's existence, but also the moral ambivalence of the Holocaust itself.  Once again, Szpilman's musical talent has saved him.  His survival is a matter of luck rather than heroism.  We see as he is playing that he is literally playing for his life, and it is only his good fortune to have been discovered by a music lover who appreciates his talent.<br/><br/>On a higher level, the concert is a morality play whose subject is how the sentimental, music-loving Germans could have perpetrated such horrors as Szpilman has witnessed during his years in hiding.  There is no excusing their evils, only wonderment at how it all could have happened in the first place.  To Polanski's credit he doesn't offer an answer to this vexing question.  Very likely, like almost all of us he has none.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean that he doesn't make the effort: this is a brutal film, whose imagery shows with a grim meticulousness how cruelly human beings can treat other human beings.  But it is also a film about hope, and about the almost-inexhaustible tenacity of the human spirit.  Wladyslaw Szpilman came as close to being broken as it is possible to be, yet he survived, not with flourishes or heroics, but with a simple, amazing resilience of will. This is certainly one lesson about the Holocaust that needs to be remembered."

","This movie has been made before (Shindler's List) and was a lot better that time. Polanski might never have seen a holocaust movie before because he treats every scene of Nazi brutality as if it's something new and shocking rather than something that's been filmed one hundred times already.<br/><br/>
His action sequences are some of the worst ever and his special effects laughable. Every ""uprising"" scene is obviously shot on the same section of street, every ""burning building"" is the obviously the same set, and every random death scene is just that--a random death scene. No reason to be there, has nothing to do with the story, it's just thrown in there for background, even though the background is totally obvious. Lots of people have talked about Polanski's ""personal touch"" but this movie is impersonal holocaust porn. When things get boring, Polanski tosses in a ""people getting shot/burnt/shipped off"" scene although they have no connection to the story.<br/><br/>Polanski has nothing to say. The Pianist is indistinguishable from a dozen other movies about the fate of the Warsaw Jews except by its relative technical ineptitude and overlong running time. Whatever ""power"" this film has is derived exclusively from its subject matter and not its artistic presentation.<br/><br/>There's a good 20min movie in here somewhere. The rest is pointless filler, done far better by a half dozen other directors.<br/><br/>RstJ"
"d1494","8","1","3","27 June 2003"," This film is not outstanding but..
","I have to agree with a number of comments about this film being somewhat standard and numbing. Indeed much of the film goes by and leaves one in that state. However, the beginning and end do transcend that, which is all to the good. Brody gives a fine performance; the music is beautiful as is the photography and the setting.Unfortunately, the other actors are given short shrift and they are one feels, also capable of giving fine performances,had their characters been more fleshed out. Having seen many of Polansky's films, I must say I don't recognize his artistic style here as I've come to know it over the  years. That in itself is not necessarily a negative, however he has made some gripping films and this one just doesn't quite live up to that standard. There are some fine things about this film and I do not dismiss it, and indeed would recommend it to others with some caveats. The film is rather too long for what it is and could have been 20 minutes shorter with no harm done. The thing that most impressed me about the experience of watching this was that I had just watched another holocaust film, albeit one about the holocaust of Cambodia, The Killing Fields. This film has all the emotional tension after repeated viewings that it had the first time, this is what I wanted from The Pianist but it wasn't there. 'The Killing Fields' conveys the nightmare scene of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and shows how it got there. It also shows very well the drama of people being caught up in the maw of evil beyond their ken. Having watched this extraordinary film first, I found myself  feeling a little detached from the plight of those in this film and it felt like nothing in the movie really reached out and grabbed me the way the subject normally would. I would also say that while I felt 'bludgeoned' by the impact of 'Schindler's List', it also did not reach out to me in the way that 'The Killing Fields' does. It seems that while some movies are greater than the sum of their parts, some are less. This one was less and thus somewhat disappointing, albeit still worthy of watching. I give this film 8/10."

","I don't use the word `masterpiece' very often, maybe only once or twice when writing my thoughts on a movie.  `The Pianist' was a masterpiece.  I have rarely been so taken into a movie, its atmosphere, its reality, as I was in this one.  It also brought to life a portion of history with which I thought I was familiar but whose horrors and day-to-day miseries have never been portrayed quite so clearly.  I was very glad the film was in color, as opposed to black and white, for the simple fact that I wanted to see what the people were going through as if I were seeing it myself.  I like black-and-white for artistic reasons, but color was a good choice for realism.  Adrien Brody's performance was very touching and real.  You could almost feel his fear, his suffering, and his physical pain, mainly from hunger.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that made me think about how blessed I am and how blessed I have been in my life because I have never had to experience anything nearly as hellish as the life that was portrayed in this movie. I can only imagine the feeling of desperation these people must have had day after day.  The brutality and sheer insanity of war was once again quite vividly portrayed; everyone should pay attention and learn what beasts human beings can really be.<br/><br/>There is a line in the movie that was very understated and not particularly necessary to the plot, but the scene where Szpilman tells his sister that he just wished he could have gotten to know here better and she simply replies `Thank You' with such emotion in her voice, brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Very rewarding and a must see.  Roman Polanski tops everything he has done, and that's something to behold."

","It was a fine movie that could have benefited from some tighter editing. Brody was brilliant in the lead role, and Polanski has easily made the most harrowing movie of his career.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but one thing that fascinated me about the first 1/3rd or so of the movie was that life in the ghetto was almost being told from a child's perspective. Certain things had an emphasis that I wonder if they came from the book or from Polanski's memories of being a child in the middle of the Holocaust. For example:<br/><br/>Szpilman keeps running into a somewhat deranged woman who <br/><br/>wanders the ghetto in a fur coat, looking for her husband.<br/><br/>There's an old man entertaining a group of children.<br/><br/>The way the adults dove for food that hit the ground.<br/><br/>Many shots of the ghetto seem to be taken from close to the ground looking up, not so much at Szpilman's eye level.<br/><br/>There was also good use of sound throughout the movie, but I note that it was not nominated for a Best Sound Oscar.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting in that, here and there, there's an attempt to humanize a Nazi, something pretty much unseen in Holocaust movies since the late '70s miniseries The Holocaust (the Michael Moriarty character, while he invents ways to more rapidly exterminate Jews, feels very guilty about it). The music-loving commander near the end of the movie, who sees the end and would rather not go out of his way to kill every Jew he stumbles over.<br/><br/>The main flaws in the movie were a tendency to let scenes drag a little (particularly towards the middle) and not really indicating what a celebrity Szpilman was pre-war (if that was the case). According to the movie, he seemed to be the last person to perform on Polish radio before the Germans took over. For nearly half of the movie, he's no where near a piano (for obvious reasons), but, when he is, he seems like he's a talented but fairly pedestrian classical pianist. Is surviving the war what made him great?"
"Alan Smithie","10","1","3","28 March 2003"," No Hollywood studio would ever have dared touched this one...
","A film usually is a great film because of the emotion it evokes from the audience. It is usually great because it shows us the 'reality' of life during troubled times. This film does both, and more. Yet, you almost never are moved to anything more than the verge of tears. You don't ever feel sorry for any of the characters including Szpilman. It is extremely existentialist, with a eerie Beckett-esque feel to it through out. The scene of the soup-snatcher and of the old Jew man being thrown off his wheelchair from his balcony high above the pavement couldn't have been written better by Beckett himself. The whole idea of the music playing in your head is so enchanting, yet you don't ever feel depressed but instead smile and hear the music in your own head. The scene of Szpilman playing the piano yet not playing it, is something that will continue to haunt me for a long time. Brody is Szpilman, every character is their own person, no one could have replaced them and none could have done another role. The music pieces are brilliantly chosen from a wide collection of the work that Szpilman played, so is the cinematography. This film would have been so easily about Szpilman's heroic life, instead it's about his music, and his survival to play that music, nothing more, nothing less. It's not about the Jewish cause, it's not about the life of his family members, it's not even about his love story. It's a very rare film. And by the end of the film, you're left with a sense of incompleteness which must have been Szpilman's life but his music seems to fill that void for him and for us as well. I wouldn't say it's a must see, because that would be a term you'd associate with a Hollywood blockbuster, this is a must know."
"rwint","Null","1","3","25 February 2003"," Excellent!
","At first one's impression of this film when reading about it's content, which is about a Jewish pianists real life accounts of the holocaust, is you've seen a lot about this so why see another.  Yet this film is really compelling and by having it focus meticulously on one individuals struggles, makes it even more gripping.  Sure one may have read all about the atrocities in their history books, but actually seeing a mass group of Jews herded into a windowless train car and then locked in is really shattering. <br/><br/>
     Director Polanski spreads this and other disturbing scenes throughout the film at unannounced intervals.  This is much more effective than just bunching them up into one section.  It truly gives you a very real taste of the daily tension and fear that the people must of felt.<br/><br/>     Some critics have already christened this as Polanski's best film. Before seeing it you would have to wonder if these people had really seen all of Polanski's pictures.  After all this man has done alot of great movies.  Yet after seeing it I would probably have to agree.  The lighting, pacing, editing, acting, music, camerawork, and set design come together in a flawless chemistry.  Not just a a particular point, but throughout.  It also has a couple of really amazing shots.  One is a long shot showing row upon row of bombed out buildings.  It is really breathtaking especially when you fathom in how they were actually able to do it.<br/><br/>     This is a very solid film that is well worth you time both as a educational and informative work.

"noralee","Null","1","3","2 February 2003"," A Very Polish Jewish Holocaust Story
","My husband demurred going to see ""The Pianist ""as he ""didn't want to see another Holocaust movie."" Besides that every survivor's story is unique, besides the beautiful cinematography where color looks like browning black-and-white photos, and the tremendous performance and physical transformations by New Yorker Adrien Brody (and it's nice to finally see a real Jewish nose on a Holocaust movie star), Roman Polanski does have a different perspective to give. <br/><br/>This is the first time I can recall a specifically Polish Jewish viewpoint, even though other films have also dealt with the Warsaw Ghetto's creation, uprising, and destruction. While Wladyslaw Szpilman's personal story is no way identical to Polanski's similarly accidental personal survival of the Holocaust, the film is suffused with what are clearly Polanski's vivid memories, particularly of pre-war Warsaw, the round-ups, and then the post-war city-wide devastation. <br/><br/>The Szpilman family's urbane integration into secular Polish society is made clear at the outset; Wladyslaw is flirting with a non-Jewish colleague and the Nazi restrictions mostly interfere with his dating routine at first. Strong family ties, even among adult children, are beautifully portrayed.<br/><br/>
But what is most startling throughout is the sympathetic view of Poles, unlike any similar movie. We hear frequently from Poles who are saddened by the restrictions, only see one glimpse of a Polish anti-Semite, and we frequently see Polish resistance fighters and their sympathizers, though they come out of the woodwork mostly due to Szpilman's fame. The infamous, compromised Jewish policemen in the Ghetto are given harsher treatment by the filmmaker. <br/><br/>My ignorance of classical music made me miss a key point in one scene as I didn't know what piece he was playing and wanted to know if he was playing a Polish or German composer, though I inferred from the closing credits that it was probably German. <br/><br/>But that was evidently a fictive scene. As I saw the film in Kew Gardens, Queens, settlement of many survivors, an elderly man on the line said, in a strong accent, when he was 15 in Warsaw after the war he'd met Szpilman, who recounted his story to him, and that the German who saved him did so for him as a human being, not a pianist.  Would that have been more moving?"
"Big Neil-2","Null","1","3","15 January 2003"," The kind of movie I thought they had forgotten how to make
","Connoisseurs of fine film, here is an epic for you. Be warned, the first half is exceptionally violent, although the mood shifts to one of suspense in the second half.  Although this site jointly recommends ""The Pianist"" along with Schindler's List, Spielberg's movie is more Middle American than Central European in flavor; Polanski has a much firmer hand on the material, he understands all the ramifications in a way that others cannot.  Superb ensemble acting, especially from Frank Finlay and Emilia Fox.  Fine pyrotechnics and stunt work (with one stunt in particular, I cannot figure out how they did it).  As a spectator, you really feel you are in the midst of the Warsaw Ghetto, among suffering people about to die.  Good to see Polanski back on form, any shortcomings are incidental (the pianist's friendship with the decent Nazi soldier at the end of the movie seems a little too good to be true, although is apparently based on fact).  This film is Polanski's gift not just to the Jewish people, but to the Polish people.  It is a movie for those, like me, who admire the Jewish people for all they have achieved and who take due note of all the unspeakable horrors they have endured through time, which must never be forgotten.  ""The Pianist"" is *THE* holocaust movie."
"jdesando","Null","1","3","10 January 2003"," I haven't recently seen a better depiction of the fatally flawed resistance against Germans.
","Jerzy Kosinski wrote of a boy escaping all over Europe from Nazi oppressors in his classic `Painted Bird,' an alleged autobiography influenced by Roman Polanski's flight as a boy.  Polanski's `The Pianist,' based on a true story in the Warsaw ghetto in 1939, is also said to be autobiographical if you substitute `film director' for the `pianist.""  Kosinski's dramatic situations, memorable right down to the lantern he carries everywhere, are tense and frenetic, even though he is frequently hiding.  Polanski's Polish Jew Szpilman, a concert pianist, just hides, leaving only the powerful first third for the drama and character delineation-the rest is hiding and grubbing for food.  Polanski's flight in Krakow and Warsaw helped Kosinski tell his story; Szpilman's autobiography helped Polanski tell `The Pianist' story.<br/><br/>In the first part of the film, Polanski expertly shows us the family of the pianist in a state of quiet decline and denial while the Germans overtake Warsaw and move Jews to the ghetto and eventually `work' camps.  Szpilman's brother is fiery and irresponsible but devoted to overthrowing the Nazis. By contrast, Szpilman passively allows others to save him, usually due to his acclaim as a classical pianist.  That he plays Chopin beautifully attests to why he should be revered and maybe saved.  Yet, Polanski may inadvertently show him to be self-centered when he lets others take great risks to save him, when he watches from his safe window fellow Jews of the resistance being slaughtered, and when he does not fully join the resistance.  Or Polanski may be expressing the anguish and self-loathing of one whose mother did not survive the gas chamber.<br/><br/>Except for `Charlotte Gray,' I haven't recently seen a better depiction of the fatally flawed resistance against Germans than in this film.  Polanski has done a credible job showing there was resistance at great peril and price.  He also creates a bombed-out, ruined Warsaw that looks real enough to make the audience catch their breath.<br/><br/>Polanski also includes a Platonic admiration between Szpilman and the lovely wife of a friend and supporter-here Polanski is at his `Chinatown' best showing the heartache and natural shocks fortune visits on lovers in war (Think also of Rick and Ilsa in `Casablanca').  <br/><br/>By the end, Szpilman is looking more like Tom Hanks in `Cast Away' than Arthur Rubenstein.  The hero is back where he started; I hope the world has progressed beyond that."

","THE PIANIST (2002) **** Adrien Brody gives the performance of his career as brilliant pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, who miraculously survived the aftermath of the Nazis' relentless takeover of the Warsaw ghetto, where he hid for years and ultimately the only surviving member of his doomed family, at the height of WWII in Europe.  Filmmaker Roman Polanski delivers his most intimate and compelling work in years (Polanski himself is a Holocaust survivor who experienced intense loss) filtering his own life experiences into his dogged protagonist with all-too painful and assertively unflinching portrait of an exceptionally gifted musician in an unending nightmare replete with graphic violence that comes without warning, hope in the least likely forms and ultimately triumph in the face of evil.

I would declare an Oscar nomination is in store for Adrien Brody. The transformation he undergoes is nothing short of brilliant!  He is subtle and natural.  At times there is literally no dialogue and in the silence there is greatness achieved.  Jessica Kate Meyer is also exceptional as is Ed Stoppard, Maureen Lipman, Frank Finlay and so many others right down to the extras that were cast.<br/><br/>This film is graphic.

","I was deeply touched by this film about a Polish pianist trying to escape the horrors of the Warsaw Ghetto.<br/><br/>Other than many Holocaust movies, this one has no humorous intermezzi to interrupt the gruesome reality displayed. I consider this to be an interesting directorial choice. In a way it makes it even harder to watch, but that's what makes it more realistic than other films about this subject. Reality in the Warsaw Ghetto was torture, period.<br/><br/>Film will always be an entertainment medium. Therefore the director needs to be extremely careful not to turn a serious topic like the Holocaust into something ""entertaining"", for example by bringing up a lighter subject every now and then, allowing the viewer to relax. Polanski did a fantastic job in using the medium without jeopardizing the contents of his film. No emotional scene was cheesy, no scene appears ""staged"", no over dramatized acting, no tearjerking violins. And the result: an even more emotionally moving piece. A message that doesn't seem forced, and yet there is one.<br/><br/>
On a side note: I venture to say not every Nazi was intentionally doing evil. Many jumped on the bandwagon not knowing what they got themselves into, unable to quit once they found out. Watch carefully, especially towards the ending, and you will discover an interesting character.<br/><br/>

There were few off-explanations, and there were no sentimental hollywoodish scenes. Further, I liked the cast not only of the major but also of the minor roles. The Germans really acted German, same with the Polish Jews and non-Jews - no glossing over anything.

","I don't have much to say on this movie, other than that it was very good. Adrien Brody is a fine actor and this is probably his finest role (though I'm partial to ""The Jacket"").<br/><br/>My only real concern with this film ,and it shouldn't be seen as a slight against it, is that it seems that making a film about the Holocaust makes a film automatically better. I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, ""Schindler's List"" and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films... World War II in general seems to do this, but the Holocaust even more so. It's an odd phenomenon."
"sp1s","8","1","4","3 October 2005"," But why is he a pianist?
","First, I have to give a disclaimer. I am not able to give full justice to this movie. It depicts events that exceed the horizon of my understandings. I've seen the Warshaw ghetto, and the concentration camps that are mentioned, and I can only say that I am not capable of understanding whether the cruelty shown does compare with the historical events. It is the discussion heard in the context of ""Schindler's list"", when Jewish critics said that the holocaust cannot be shown in adequate picture. I cannot comment this; but it should be mentioned.<br/><br/>The movie did lack, and I am still trying to understand if it lacks it deliberately, one thing that I can comment about: The joy of music. I spend considerable time listening to classical music, mostly piano concertos, and I find it pretty hard to believe that Brodys character is supposed to be a pianist - apart from his slim fingers. He is a pianist like some other man is a bank clerk, it is his job; but he neither seems to miss it, nor does it seem to influence his thinking or feeling. Maybe it is too romantic to believe that the joy of music would survive under the circumstances he experiences, but the topic is dropped without much ado. When he picks up playing piano again, he just plays like he has never missed it or never seen anything that might influence his way of playing.<br/><br/>Now, I was watching all that movie mostly to see his reunition with music, and I was surprised how little the scene did tell me. Why does he never play wrong notes? Why is there no different emotion mixed in the music, which is, after all, one of the most emotional piano music ever written? There are young polish pianists like Anderszewsky that could have provided such emotions, maybe only subtle; but I firmly believe it could have been done. For reference, see how Helene Grimaud played the Beethoven concerto on the eve of 9/11/2001. For me, Brody was playing a heartless man. Maybe this is how Polanski intended it to be.<br/><br/>For the remaining aspects of the film many good things have been said. It is, after all, only rarely depicted how much the polish people had to suffer. Warshaw was completely destroyed by the German army days before it was liberated, this is too often forgotten."

On the same token, it did not make the mistake of portraying the German people as an evil race. He received help from a kind family and a doctor who risked their lives to help him.

If you've ever seen The Legend of 1900 and enjoyed it, you should be happy to hear that this movie is similar in nature and scope. The strength of the story and plot line is admirable, especially considering that much of the movie is set with one character and little to no dialog. This movie really takes you into a war-torn place and makes you understand how it feels to be truly alone in the world - without even the comfort of music. Compared to other holocaust movies, I would still rank it near the top, even close to Schindler's List in it's mood. A great show for people who want more than just entertainment, it has a wonderful story, and is very well acted. A must-see for musicians and history buffs everywhere."

I don't think anybody would talk about the movie Schindler's List, instead they would talk about Schindler. <br/><br/>It is not the same with 'The Pianist'. It just pulls you into another world and you realize it only when the movie is over. Tremendous movie making!! The central character in the movie is of course the pianist Szpilman but the movie comes a full circle by portraying the life around the pianist. It is the movie making that is prominent here.

I cried several times during the film, and it was difficult to make it though the end of the movie. I can easily understand now, why Polanski received an Academy award for best director, and Adrian Brody for Best Actor. The role of Wladyslaw Szpilman would've taxed and challenged the talents of any elite male actor in Hollywood, and yet Adrien Brody accomplished the task better than anyone I can imagine. He translated the character's hopes, loves, and especially his horror and despair in such a genuine fashion, that it's amazing that it comes from a 20-something year old actor. Makes me wonder how & where he was able to draw those intense emotions to make it seem so real.

","A movie about the atrocities committed during WWII could not be more timely to watch than now, at a time when George Bush is comparing the ""War on Terrorism"" to WWII - odd since depending on what your politics are you might think that lately the US is acting more like the Nazis in this film than the rescuing Russians, with the common people of Afghanistan, Iraq and the US, like the Pianist, being caught in between as the inadvertent, non-politicized victims of the ideological/political war between the government of fascists and fundamentalists. Roman Polanski does a tremendous job of portraying the brutality and ugliness of war, and the beauty of human individuality when mercy, kindness, and love are demonstrated in the face of it.    If all the political leaders with their agendas today were forced to sit in a room and watch this together, I wonder what they would say afterwards about it. Polanski had made a movie that will haunt those who see it forever -- a cinematic revelation that wisely reminds us--""Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it."" It makes me hope that if perhaps if more love, kindness, mercy and understanding were demonstrated in politics today, we might be able to get further toward global peace.  Using words like ""Axis of Evil"" on our side, and the terms fanatical fundamentalists use to describe us, only fan the flames of hatred - it does not help to put them out."

The fact that this was based on a book, which was written by the real main character himself, is make this film even more interesting. No Hollywoodish script could compete with such a story in a million years.<br/><br/>Even beyond of the cinematic achievement, films such as The Pianist play a role of modern day history documents.

"RachelLone","10","1","4","28 March 2004"," One man's struggle for survival; one people's tragic history; one story about war and humanity- an all-time masterpiece
","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was a renowned Jewish pianist in Poland. As the Second World War broke out, Jews were forced to move to the Jewish ghetto. Later, Szpilman's family were sent to a concentration camp but he managed to escape, and his hiding began. He went through fear of being found, starvation, thirst and any horror you can imagine. He survived. He once again worked for Polish Radio and became a soloist, and regained his human dignity.<br/><br/>The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is intense and poignant, the film itself is outstandingly directed by the brilliant Roman Polanski (Chinatown) and he realised Adrien Brody's amazing potential. Brody's performance is simply stunning, just perfect. Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) as the surprisingly sympathetic Nazi officer who, not only did not arrest Szpilman, but was so overwhelmed when listening to him play the piano, as though Captain Hosenfeld at long last heard the most wonderful sound, not the sound of bombs and gunfire, and gave Szpilman food and his coat. This other side of one Nazi soldier was just astounding. It's all about humanity.<br/><br/>
Being a survivor of the Holocaust, Roman Polanski vividly depicted the era of mass destruction and genocide in the motion picture, the scenes are truly graphic and yet downright realistic, therefore shocking in every way. Adrien Brody also has Polish ancestry and he made Szpilman once again come to life. The movie itself is splendidly made, and words simply cannot describe the impact it has made upon me. Polanski and Brody are absolutely triumphant. This is even better than 'Schindler's List', in some people's opinions. I give this film 10/10. Do not miss it.<br/><br/>P.S. In the movie, we never know what happened to Szpilman's family."

","I have to say that my viewing of the Pianist was hampered somewhat by a visit to the Imperial War Museum in London where I saw images of the holocaust that were so disturbing I had to hold myself back from choking.<br/><br/>I was intrigued to see how Polanski (he raped a fourteen year old girl by the way-but thats not why I disagree slightly with the film) handled the horror, and I was confused.<br/><br/>Yes, this was about the Jewish repressionm torture, and eventual execution but the film felt like a general refugees story with some 'Look at the evil Nazis' set pieces.  In this respect I thought it was disrespectful to what I had seen actually happen in the stock footage from the war.<br/><br/>THe characters were only established as Jewish because the Nazis were killing them - where was evidence of culture and heritage?  This would have made the destruction of this hertiage all the more tragic, but no, we didnt see it, so they could have been anybodies - the tragedy lay in the Nazis illogical motivations to eradicate the Jewish people, did it not?<br/><br/>Choosing Brody was a mistake too- yes, his acting is brilliant, but if that wasn' a case of the casting director saying,  ""Look, he has a big nose, he's quite trendy at the moment too isn't he?, he looks Jewish (stereotype!), let's hire him"", then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>'Private Ryan' managed to personalise this entire issue in one character and was emotionally sucessful, with Schindler's list presenting the same events from this film much more emotionally.  We did not know the victims - but we weren't supposed to, the alienation made created helplessness in the audience: with 'The Pianist' we're meant to identify with the characters, but unfortunately we couldn't, because they were cardboard cut outs, and so their tradgedy becomes almost farce, and therefore innacurate and unworthy of acclaim.<br/><br/>I think it has become fasionable to praise this film, so make up your mind after you've seen it whether you like it or not.  Please.<br/><br/>The formal elements are excellent though, with the editing a big achievement, keeping the pace gradual and interest inducing.  The music was good, and the ending quite touching, I also enjoyed the subjective POV shots during the combat sequences - the sense of space created was sublime.<br/><br/>Narratively though, contrived and underplayed.  THe real thing was a whole different kettle of fish.  Believe it.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 from me people.  Spielberg has done it a whole lot better already.  Backlash nets primed."

It reminded me a little of Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", who also won.  They shared a quiet intensity, an understated dignity and do not chew on the scenery in an attempt for attention.  Brody's win might signify a maturity among voters, a willingness to honor an actual performance on the screen.  So many people had Jack or Daniel winning, and I congratulate the voters on seeing what Adrien Brody brought to the movie.  Let's face it, with Eminem, Pedro Almovodar and Polanski/Brody winning, it might have been just an atypical year, and next year they can get back to giving awards to non-actors like Julia Roberts and Helen Hunt..<br/><br/>I can't honestly say that I've seen another movie like it, even though there have been a slew of movies on the subject.

Much like the pianist of the title, he hits the right notes throughout; from the opening scene where Germans bomb the radio station where he is performing, through the tribulations of his Jewish family, to the 'Schindler's List'-esque Warsaw ghetto scenes and on to the final grim struggle for survival, this is a tour-de-force for the aging director.<br/><br/>The plot builds steadily to the final section of the film, where the pianist wanders, frightened and shaking, among the ruins of a bombed and burning Warsaw, still trying to dodge the few retreating Germans still in the city. He is finally caught by one, a general, in the ruins of a formerly grand house...a scene that is sure to go down as a classic.<br/><br/>I saw this film on the day it opened in Australia and the cinema was packed. There were the usual packed-cinema sounds; coughing, munching of chips, slurping of drinks, muted conversation. By the time the film had reached it's devastating conclusion, the cinema was silent...high praise for any film."

"valleyjohn","7","1","5","15 March 2011"," Brody is great - The film , not so great
","There have been may great films about the the terrible way the Jewish population were treated by the Germans during World War II . Some great , some not so great. The Pianist is a critically acclaimed movie from 2002 that i had been looking forward to seeing for a while but i couldn't help but be a little disappointed with it. The best thing about this film , without a doubt , is the performance of Adrien Brody . It is a film that lacks the fee of a feature film. It looks much more like a TV film and a long one at that. I'm not a big fan of Maureen Lipman and with actors like her that makes it look even more less like a big movie. There are other things that don't ring true in the film. In the Jewish Ghetto the people were just walking past dead children without even looking or moving them and i don't care how bad things are you wouldn't ignore a dead or dying child. Also there is a scene where Szpilman is shot at when he comes out of building in a German coat but it's blindingly obvious that he was a Jewish survivor and it wouldn't happen. The Piano may have touched a nerve with a lot of people but it didn't do a great deal for me - having said that, it's still a 7 out of 10 movie."
"jjeee4","Null","1","5","30 July 2006"," Accuracy
","There is a scene in the beginning of The Pianist when the Jewish father is walking down the street and passes two Nazis. They call him over and rough him up for not bowing as he passed them and walking in the gutter. I believe when they call him over though they use the polite or formal form of the word for ""you"" in German which is ""Zie."" I can't imagine Nazis using the formal form when addressing Jews. It seems like they more likely would have called him over by using the word ""Du""-which is the impolite or informal version of the word. While this might not seem like a big deal, the film was so overwhelmingly accurate with meticulous attention paid to detail, that I found this oversight incongruous with the rest of the film. I'm surprised Roman Polanski, the director, Holocasut survivor, and fluent in several languages didn't pick this up."

Number two, I was surprised little attention was brought to the fact that while he and his family were marched out to the ghetto, and were wailing that they had only 20 zlotny and a few suitcases-not enough to buy a potato-and what were they going to eat the rest of their lives and had no hope of supporting themselves-and have then entered there ""new"" digs in the ghetto-in the next view of said digs it is completely and genteely furnished as if my grandmother's pad after 50 years of collections from around the world. How did that happen? Scenes of Nazi horror will be paraded to the viewer scene after self-conscious scene-and the extras will be paraded as well as if they had been placed on a giant lazy susan. Too bad such a lovely story based on fact had been so poorly directed."

","As a lifelong fan of movies and of Roman Polanski, I approached this movie with high expectations. I have seen a number of Holocaust movies, of varying quality: the great Schindler's List, the very good Triumph of the Spirit, and the absolutely despicable Life is Beautiful to name a few. I would have to place The Pianist in the middle somewhere.<br/><br/>This beautifully shot and produced film unfortunately has no plot or story. The main character is a bland person in every way, with the exception of his musical abilities. And it is clearly due to these musical abilities that others are constantly helping him in the movie. Certainly not due to his personality or character, of which he has none. Adrien Brody stumbles through this picture like some carrot-beaked scarecrow, evoking no compassion from the audience for his fate, a fate that is considerably more fortunate than millions of other Jews in the period.<br/><br/>Polanski created a wonderfully visual and accurate portrait of the time and place, but Brody created a mere shadow of a human being as its central character."
"claudio_carvalho","7","1","6","18 January 2004"," Another Movie About the Massacre of Jews in the Second World War, With an Outstanding Performance of Adrien Brody
","Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Polish Jewish pianist very famous in Warsaw. When Germany invades Poland, his wealthy family and him are sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Them they are sent to Treblinka, but Szpilman escapes in the train station. He struggles to survive, hidden in the most different places and depending on friend's sympathy to stay alive. He survives the war and died in the year 2000. This movie is a super production, very well directed by Roman Polanski and having an outstanding performance of Adrien Brody. However, this sad story does not present anything that was not showed before, like, for example, `Schindler`s List' did some years ago. There is a good movie (`Uprising' (2001), TV), showing better the events of the Warsow Ghetto uprising, but the intention of `The Pianist' is to show the true saga of Szpilman. I can perfectly understand that Jewish persons, who are majority in the cinema industry, have a great interest in keeping alive the atrocities of the Second World War. But these movies are very repetitive, showing horrible dramas of the most different survivors, or persons who died. However, there are so many other massacres of races to be explored through the human history and unfortunately they are not showed in movies like the murder of Jewish in the WWII. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `O Pianista' (`The Pianist')"

","The main reason why I watched The Pianist was the fact that it is about a pianist. I myself play the piano. But after seeing it I realized that it has far more reasons to watch it.<br/><br/>The different thing from most other movies about war is that it is just about one single person. The struggle of one man. That's why you got more details about war and how people really felt. It allows you to be a witness of the fight of this very man, his feelings, his fears and his happy moments. Sometimes you feel happy for him because he got a new home and people that support him, and in the next minute you want to cry because of this terrible things that are happening to him.<br/><br/>You can say about Roman Polanski whatever you want. But he did a masterpiece with this movie. It also was so good because Polanski has been through this horror. He lost his family during World War IIand that gives the film even more deepness.<br/><br/>Maybe the title of the movie scares some people. They just thing it's about piano playing and music. But this is the worst reason you can have of this film. The main story is about a pianist, that's right, but it's about his survival because of music. His love and passion for music helped him to never stop hoping. And this is what this movie is about. It's about a person that lived through all that horror without stopping to believe.<br/><br/>Never judge a film because of the title. Watch the Pianist and I'm sure you'll will think about things in a different way."

","From Oscar BAFTA winning director Roman Polanski, and based on a true story, this is the great story of one man's struggle to survive, and also his passion of playing the piano. Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, an Oscar winning role, he has a passion for playing the piano. He and his family, including Father (Frank Finlay) and Mother (Maureen Lipman) are threatened and ordered about by the Nazi Germans to obey their commands, otherwise by shot. It is really disturbing to see the Germans killing Jewish people, and also the state of places after bombs and stuff. Also starring Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, Emilia Fox as Dorota, Ed Stoppard as Henryk, Julia Rayner as Regina, Jessica Kate Meyer as Halina and Michal Zebrowski. The best moments for me are while Wladyslaw has a beard, and is surviving amongst the wreckage of a town, and he plays the piano for a German commander. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Film and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Wojciech Kilar, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

","Holocaust films have always been morbidly fascinating to me. There's something so gripping about staring one of our worst atrocities in the face, whether it's portrayed in a stylized fashion like MAUS or slowly paced and cold like Schindler's List.<br/><br/>But upon re-watching, The Pianist stuck out to me as one of the best. It helps that it's a true story, for sure, but the directing and pacing bring it all together into an unflinching masterpiece.<br/><br/>The events of this film just happen. That's not to say there's no plot; it's there, as minimal as the connections between scenes can be, which is expected of a film based on real events. But there's never a moment where the characters are truly safe. There's no buildup to the atrocities shown on-screen, people are just alive one moment and then taken aside and shot unceremoniously in the next scene without a single word of protest. It never tries to force a reaction from the audience either, as some films like to hang on the details of a disturbing scene to evoke a reaction. It just presents the facts without buildup and leaves you stunned anyway.<br/><br/>Wouldn't be a review of The Pianist without mentioning Adrien Brody. He absolutely knocked it out of the park, both when he's delivering pages of dialogue in fluid long-take scenes and saying next to nothing for almost the entire third act but still managing to tell the audience everything they need to know through facial expression and skittish movements.<br/><br/>A film that, like its subject matter, shouldn't be forgotten for a long time."

","That the Second World War was cruel and barbaric is nothing new. A movie about this war with only battle scenes (how spectacular they might be) is therefore ""middle of the road"". To become a real classic war movie the film needs something special.<br/><br/>This something special can be an ""extra"", for example an unusual story line. Think of ""The best years of our lives"" (1946, William Wyler) about reintegration of the soldiers in civil society, or ""Der Untergang"" (2004, Oliver Hirschbiegel) about the last few days of Hitler sinking into (ever deeper) madness in his shelter in Berlin.<br/><br/>In ""The pianist"" the special element is the leaving out of all heroism. Pianist Szpilman (Adrien Brody) survives pure by accident. He is not a hero but a spectator. Polanski, who survived the Holocaust himself, knows what he is talking (filming) about. He refused to co-operate in ""Schindler's List"" (1993, Steven Spielberg), a film in which heroism is an essential element.<br/><br/>In ""The pianist"" (piano)music is a powerfull antidote to barbarism. In his performance over the First World War the Dutch comedian Diederik van Vleuten tells the story of the French composer Maurice Ravel who writes a piece of pianomusic that can be played with the left arm only for the German pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in the First World War. In both wars pianomusic therefore softened the damages that the war has done."

","If I'm being honest, that's probably my best experience with Roman Polanski's art. Speaking of how smoothly the story is told. And, how it challenges our limits, demonstrating everything a director can, murdering, humiliation, free labor/slavery, children starving.
Heavy elements in the movie. Hope and despair and survival.
Maybe more than anything else, I loved that it showed both good and bad actions of Jews and Nazis. Of course it's not even close to a competition when counted, but the fact that it was there cannot be denied. There were some people who abused their friends at some point, and there were people mistreating each other for a little bit more food, and a little bit more prosper in those desperate times.
On the contrary, as brutally displayed the Nazis' actions, I love to think that there is a little bit of humanity inside of everyone and this is shown more than one occasion.
On the same note, isn't wrath, greed, and genocide only observed in humans?
I mean, maybe it is human to kill other people, and it needs something more than that to stop it.
I loved the drama in this movie, many powerful phrases such ""Food is more important than time"" and the music. What a lucky life we have to experience the music in this movie.

","The movie opens up with the German attack, then there is some kind of love or whatever scene between the lead and some random girl (who appears next towards the end). Then it shows some family drama. Again here there is no much insight given to the lead so it becomes to rack what is being shown and why it is being shown. I was lost for most of the time during the first half. The events occur very quickly and the tension is slack. You would not fell any kind of tension during the first half because it just shows some random events occurring to their family members and some children. It seems more like a cliché. Well apart from this, the most irritating thing for me was the relation of the lead and his brother. The brother was not happy with the pianist , OK I accepted that fact but how did this contribute to the story. I felt these all scenes were just added for the sake of inclusion of drama in the movie. But it did not go well with the plot. <br/><br/>The second half shows the struggle of the pianist which was again badly written. The screenplay was too slack. There were numerous scenes of fading to black and they were noticeable because it was just a 30 seconds scene and then it fades to black. That thing gave me a very disgust feeling. <br/><br/>But the film redeems itself in the last few minutes but still all those things were expected.

","The Pianist edges Schindler's List by a very fine whisker as my 'favourite' holocaust themed film. Spielberg's rendition, although excellent, is slightly over-dramatic.<br/><br/>The Pianist revolves around the life of a humble man who doesn't stand up and fight, nor sacrifice his life for the cause, but uses his good nature and contacts to survive as best he can throughout the German occupation of Poland. His brother is the complete opposite of this frail character - a reckless, rebellious man who is having none of it and isn't prepared to compromise an inch, bucking against unjust oppression and paying the consequences. In contrast, our protagonist socially fits into every nook and cranny he can find, helped by his easy-going and placid nature, pausing while playing the piano so that customers can conduct menial tasks, resuming again at their leisure, just trying to be as nondescript as possible in order to survive.<br/><br/>In the latter part of the film we view life in the ghetto from afar while living outside of its walls, hidden away from German eyes, but witnessing a person gradually getting weaker, lonelier and less confident in finding a solution to life's complicated dilemmas.<br/><br/>One of my friends pointed out that his enjoyment of the film was reduced because of the lack of fight shown by our hero. Fair enough, it's not a very macho attitude, but how many Jews actually survived the war? It's our ability to understand and sympathise with Vladek Spiegelman's plight in trying to merely survive that's the key to appreciating this amazing film.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the acting throughout is wonderful. Adrien Brody depicts a man in turmoil, on the edge of lunacy and death. A flawless performance and a flawless film by Roman Polanski."

","i love this film. The Pianist is a 2002 ""biographical"" war drama film directed by Roman Polanski, scripted by Ronald Harwood and starring Adrien Brody. It is based on the ""autobiographical"" book The Pianist, a World War II memoir by the Polish-Jewish pianist and composer Władysław Szpilman.

","The Pianist is not a very spectacular movie. It is on a harrowing subject - the Holocaust - but lacks the depth, that makes you want to watch it further. The characters are not very developed. They just flash by one after another. On the other hand, this movie is based on a life of a real person. <br/><br/>What the film does make clear, is the miracle of how The Pianist survived against all odds. That is the one positive aspect of this movie. Other than that it is unlikely to be much of an experience, it probably scares faint-hearted people and likely isn't meant to be watched under 21. The movie depicts cruelty and hunger, but that's pretty much it. What it doesn't reflect, is how unnatural all of it is. It all seems too usual.<br/><br/>In a sense the film is realistic: shows death just picking people one after another."

","I think this is a good movie but still I think there are much better ones about WW2 and the Holocaust. The movie is well made and the acting is very good but the subject is so worn out that it leaves you nothing. Why do they always have to see things black and white (good or bad) when war and life is not as simple as that. WW2 was awful, I agree, but give it a break and START living in the present! Some producers, IMHO, try to take advantage of WW2's ""success"" in Hollywood and the film's industry overall to build a name or to be liked by everyone. This sort of propaganda movies are the ones that brainwash people into thinking that some countries or people are evil and some are good without even thinking about the causes and consequences of the actions in the story (specially when is such a delicate subject as this one where the story is actually a part of history and something that affect us all). The film only drives you emotionally through it but it's just that and nothing else what makes it good. I agree the director did a great job with the movie but let us hope this is the last film about this topic or, at least, let us view some new ideas. We are growing with a very flawed perception of the world because of the huge amount of films like this one."

","Polanski himself has had experiences with this event in history, so I'm just surprised he waited this long to have a film of an account. The film as a whole is intriguing from the start, with characters that I really identified with. The whole film is superbly-made, and the brutality is shocking and effective. I would be lying if I said that there weren't some moments that left me a bit bored, but the ending of the film makes up for a lot of that. Roman Polanski beautifully directs this with his own pace and tone that definitely helps this film. Now, to Adrienn Brody's ""infamous' Oscar win... very inspired, but personally I don't think his performance was anything incredible. Instead, it was subtly effective. It wasn't a transformation, but for this type of performance to be rewarded is pretty great, even though I myself don't think he was his that incredible or anything.

","Firstly I can say that this movie is incredibly impressive movie which was directed by Roman Polanski. It is not only kind of psychological film contains drama, war and history is included. In this movie Adrien Brody animates a pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. He is a polish and successful pianist in Warsaw. In 1939 his life is transformed because of the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. He is a man who had everything taken from him, his family his livelihood and himself. He lost everything and and all people are deported but he escapes and he is alone and mange to alive and a long time hides in ruins the back streets in Warsaw. He suffers to be hungry. During the war he hides among the ruins, a German officer finds him among the ruins and gives his coat and helps his hiding. After the war is rescued and goes back to his life and continues to play the piano at the Poland radio. This movie shows the genocide in clearly at that time. The musics used this movie are wonderful because there is a harmony from the beginning to end of the film. Brody's performance is perfect and realistic. After I watched the film and I asked this question: what can I do and if I were his situation.I wonder that I manage to be alive or not. Truly it seems to be impossible. When I compare this film to Rosemary's baby which directed the same director(Roman Polanski), this movie is a bit more effective and astonishing film. I'm certainly sure that when you watch 'The Pianist' you find yourself in some section. Especially I emotionally effected as most viewers even I cried and feared. Also the end of the film makes me curious, I wonder then what happens ? I recommend everyone watch this movie and it must be found your archives."
"RickHarvey","7","0","1","5 April 2011"," Daunting film.
","The pianist is like no other Holocaust film. Polanski doesn't hold back on the horrific accounts that the Jewish Poles were put through. The setting and the cinematography is breath taking. The scenes in which the main character strolls through the empty ruins of homes is nothing less that chilling.<br/><br/>the first half of the movie is what you would expect from a film that's telling tales from the holocaust era. Beginning with us watching and listening to the pianist, the Germans soon move in and the expected visual atrocities will be executed with defining accuracy. Some scenes are based solely on true events that Polanski was apart off as a child. Inevitably, The Pianist is going to be compared to Schindler's list and on terms off grittiness and nuance, The pianist wins by a faint margin.<br/><br/>One thing that bugged me were the false caricatures of the Nazi's. Yes there were some who were sadists but to label them all with that term is wrong. I say this because every Nazi you see either shoots someone cold blooded or obeys orders showing no sort of remorse. A little winch or a blinker of eye would be enough for me to rule out that this film is not trying to portray all Germans evil. Of course you have the one German towards the end but before that, the film fixated on a biased track.<br/><br/>Everything is told through the eyes of the Pianist and while will watch him struggle for survival through the Years, we never gather much personal characteristics of the man. All we know is that he loves the Piano and music is what keeps him going. So might argue that there a barley no story is focus on and there right. We watch him fight for his life and that enough fuel to keep this film rolling.<br/><br/>Brody put huge amount of effort and personal sacrifices to make sure he meticulously fulfils this role in a nobly manner. there's fewer lines than the average film but His appearance and his subtle expressions is enough to draw you in and feel for the guy.<br/><br/>This films ticks most of the right boxes to be rightly considered as a classic. Acting top notch and same said for the art direction and cinematography. Biased as it may be, it not a biography on the Nazi's crimes but a film that tells a true tale of a man who hid and fought for survival. Must see."

","The Pianist is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. It describes the life of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a meek, ordinary man living in Warsaw when World War II starts. His life up until then is a bed of roses: he's a young, attractive man, and he plays piano over the radio. People know him and admire him.<br/><br/>The war changes everything and all of a sudden Szpilman, a Jew, becomes one of the many victims of Nazi Germany. What the movie depicts is the complete breakdown of his ordinary life and his struggle to survive in the Warsaw Ghetto, hidden from the authorities.<br/><br/>Directed by Roman Polanski, the movie is evidently brutal in its depiction of cruelty, or rather the banality of cruelty. Polanski shows horrible acts in the most, non-dramatic fashion: wheelchair-bound people being thrown off windows; children being beaten to death; people being shot for asking questions. He shows Szpilman and his family breaking apart: they go to the camps, with the certainty of death; Szpilman manages to run and becomes a wanderer in the empty Ghetto, surviving thanks to the good will of people, and to his own resourcefulness. Hidden in an apartment, he witnesses the world from a window, waiting for the end. From here he witnesses the Uprising, a heroic but failed attempt by the Jews to fight back the Nazis.<br/><br/>Bleak as the movie is, The Pianist also has a lot of humor, even some comic relief, as well as an emphasis on the brighter side of human existence. It's quite easy to create misery and draw pity from a viewer. But Only great art knows that life is never simple or reducible to one view. Darkness and light, ugliness and beauty, despair and humor always exist hand-in-hand. No scene shows that more accurately than the ending, in which Szpilman is saved by the most unlikely of people.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody is magnificent in this movie. Although he's not an actor I like, because he seems to take a personal glee in choosing horrible movies to star in, he nevertheless gives life-defining performance here, as the embodiment of the human will to survive against all adversities. Thomas Kretschmann, in his short role, was unforgettable too.<br/><br/>After decades making masterworks, Roman Polanski was finally rewarded with an Oscar. Not only that but he was rewarded for one of his best movies. Ronald Harwood, who adapted Szpilman's autobiography, also deserved his Oscar, as well as Brody himself. On a final note, Pawel Edelman, the director of cinematography, contributed to making this movie the wonder it is, in his composition of every shot. His work in this movie should put him alongside great DPs like Roger Deakins and Robert Richardson. Great movies are a synthesis of many aspects, and few movies bring them together so seamlessly and perfectly as The Pianist."

","Without a doubt, Adrien Brody is one of the most underused actors of all time. Just watching this film shows it. No, it's not Schindler's List, but it isn't trying to be. Schindler's List is a study on the psychology of mankind, and how the human race needs to change to survive. The Pianist, however, is nothing more than a simple tale of survival. There are no heroes, no villains, or even antiheroes. Just a simple man trying to live through the chaos around him. And in the midst, Brody still seems to convey how much he misses the way things used to be; when he could just sit down, play the piano, and not worry about the trials in the world around him. So no, it still pales in comparison to Schindler's List, but in my opinion it is better than Sophie's Choice. An excellent film."

It's no second rate Schindler either, it's telling it's own story and the two are powerful on their own merits. Polanski even adds in his own personal experiences, thus making it more personal.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody is astonishing. I was upset he won he the Oscar, even though I didn't see the film at that time. Now after viewing it, I am satisfied.

","There is something about the piano instrument that is deeply dramatic itself. Something rooted within its very nature of high and low keys, and the way they sound when the pianist strikes its keys soft or hard. The sound that it creates reaches down your throat and in your heart. All in all, its delicate and hardcore sound makes it the perfect instrument to describe and represent all sorts of dramatic stories, including Polanski's the Pianist.<br/><br/>Many might not find its slow pacing too attractive. Indeed, the bit in between when he find himself living in the outside world in complete secrecy loses much of its suspance on repeated viewing. But the feeling of claustrophobia is the haunting one that Polanski wanted us to feel. This is not Schindler's List, a film about the hope to be helped. This is a film about the hopelessness of being helped, and the surprise and somewhat guilt of the times that help he is received. It is the story of Jewish Polish pianist Szpielman, played by a brilliant Adrian Brody, who captures all the desperation, all the fraility with his dramatic technique as much as with his physical outlook; his casting is perfect. And Polanski's ways of telling such a disturbing dark story is something he can do well, and since Chinatown, we know that he has the guts to end it badly. The whole ending sequence is almost shocking, when we see the Polish soldiers charge at him, we can almost believe that Polanski will end it in such a depressingly ironic way.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, as are a lot of things in this film, which is one that will haunt you the most based on the holocaust. And that is mostly thanks to Polanski because he is a filmmakers with balls. He is dangerously unpredictable, he knows what pain and sorrow is, and knows how to transfer it on screen. And it helps if you have an interpretive piece of piano that symbolises everything, and has such an energy to symbolise it.<br/><br/>WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When the Polish soldiers charge Brody.

","THE PIANIST is arguably Roman Polanski's best movie to date, perhaps even better than the excellent CHINATOWN. This account of the suffering of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis in Warsaw is as emotionally hard-hitting as any you will ever see. Polanski doesn't hold any punches or try to sugar-coat the story as the scenes of execution, violence, and torture are overwhelmingly strong, and may upset many weak-stomached viewers. What's more is that Polanski does not even focus on Auschwitz, as he chooses to document the suffering that took place in Warsaw, through our protagonist Wladislaw Szpilman (who is the only character to get significant screen-time).<br/><br/>Adrien Brody's performance as Szpilman is powerful and compelling and his transformation from a well-off, cultured, and respected musician to a weak and starving refugee fighting for survival is almost unwatchable; such is its realism. Brody deservedly picked up the Best Actor Oscar in the performance of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The screenplay is exceptional, adapted from the book written by the real Wladislaw Szpilman documenting his real-life experiences. The Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar was well-warranted. Viewers will not soon forget THE PIANIST, as some of the scenes are so powerful and moving that they stay with the viewer long after the end credits roll.<br/><br/>Polanski effectively hits the nail squarely on its head in this bleak and unflinching Motion Picture, not bothering to infuse his account with melodrama or pretentiousness, or insult the intelligence of the viewers by watering-down some of the more shocking scenes. In fact, the detached style is more similar to a documentary than a conventional Motion Picture.<br/><br/>This is simply a solid and sobering drama, the likes of which are rarely seen these days. The ending fits in well, and serves to offer a message of hope, while implying that the events of the past cannot, and must never be forgotten, as these events often shape and influence the present and the future.<br/><br/>4 stars (out of 4). 9/10.

It is only in this context that one must consider The Pianist.This film is just plain OK nothing great or spectacular as everything can be foretold beforehand such as atrocities,suffering and ultimately liberation.The choice of Adrien Brody as the pianist is a good one as he carries the film single handedly on his shoulders.There is no other good reason which can justify the goodness of this film."

After he gets bamboozled into writing(playing the piano) a movie for his friend, he is cast upon a ship writing(playing the piano) a movie as they approach the island(Germany) where they will shoot it. Naturally, he falls in love with the main woman in the movie who is also the main actor in the movie he is writing(playing the piano) a script for. When they get to the island(Germany), they are captured by the natives(Nazis) and the girl he falls in love with gets sacrificed to a gigantic gorilla(the German Army). For the rest of the movie, they run through the jungle(Germany) trying to find his girl that was taken by the gigantic gorilla(the German Army). Eventually, they manage to capture the giant gorilla(German Army) and take it back to New York(Poland) to show it to the people for money> Obviously, the gigantic gorilla(German Army) gets loose in New York(Poland). When the gigantic gorilla(German Army) gets to the top of the Empire State Building(some big building in Poland), A bunch of planes come and shoot it down. When the gigantic gorilla(German Army) dies, the movie ends. Thats it. All in all i recommend the Pianist to anyone."

","this is an absolutely brilliant movie set during World War 2.it stars Adrian Brody as Jewish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman,whose only escape from the wartime hell is playing the piano.the screenplay is written by Ronald Harwood,based on the book by the real life Wladyslaw Szpilman,and is directed by Roman Polanski.the movie is touching and heartwarming,and also heartbreaking at times.it can be depressing,but is is also an inspiration.one man survives hell through music.but more than that that,others too are uplifted and have hope,all because of one humble pianist.Brody is brilliant ,as always,inhabiting his character,as he always does.i don't think he's made a bad movie yet.or at least,he's always been great in every film,even if the film itself isn't.in this case,though,the film is brilliant. and say what you want about Polanski,he knows how to direct a movie(we won't count ""Rosemary's Baby"").if this film doesn't have an impact on you,i'd be surprised."

","Pandit Nehru,India's first Prime Minister,used to display pictures of former Colonial Governors in his palace.When questioned about this practise he said ""You can't change history by turning a few faces to the wall"".Roman Polanski is clearly an adherent of this school of thought.If you want to know why Europe will never become the Super - State so beloved of liberal politicians you have only to watch ""The Pianist"". Too much blood has been spilled on the streets and plains of that benighted continent for the sovereign nations within its boundaries ever to live in anything but wary suspicion of one another. From the Balkans to the Mediterranean tribal hatreds have reigned supreme for a thousand years. To the Polish people it made little difference whether the Germans or the Russians occupied their country.In implementing the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem, the Germans ethnically cleansed Warsaw. Later,fearing a resurgence of Polish militarism,the Russians took 20,000 army officers,intellectuals and aristocrats and shot them dead in the infamous Katyn Forest massacre.Not content with perpetrating this appalling atrocity,the Russians then did their best to make sure the Germans were blamed for it. Later still,rather than offend his ""good friend"" Stalin,Churchill declined to interfere with the Russian dictator's plans for thousands of Polish prisoners of war,thus condemning them to a lingering death in the Gulags. It would hardly be surprising then if Poland were to look at its E.U. colleagues in a rather jaundiced fashion. As well as demolishing for ever the pipe dream of Europeans living together in brotherly love,""The Pianist"" also looks at the idea of the role of the artist in a disintegrating society. Here he observes rather than participates, and survives. Of course many musicians and entertainers collaborated with the Nazis and lived well under their patronage.But this option was not available to a Jew from the Warsaw ghetto. Spiellman survives by becoming the Invisible Jew right up until the end of the German Occupation when his last hiding place is discovered by a Wermacht officer who,recognising his artistry,helps him to survive. Unfortunately he is not able to return the favour as the officer dies in a Russian p.o.w. camp a full seven years after the war actually ended. Mr Polanski's vision is a bleak one indeed. The brutalisation of an intelligent and sensitive man who gradually becomes a zombie - like figure totally unresponsive to the horrors around him,desiring only one thing - his personal survival. The contempt for human life shown by ""ordinary"" German soldiers,shooting Jews at random for no better reason other than that they could. Images linger;a man in a wheelchair being tipped over a balcony,a young woman shot in the head at point blank range for asking what was happening,ghetto police beating their fellow Jews enthusiastically to gain the approval of their masters,the Wermacht officer listening poker - faced to the ""untermenschen"" Jew playing Chopin on a grand piano and,most disturbing of all - and demonstrating the utter futility of hope - the look on the face of the man on the end of the row of workers being summarily executed when the killer's pistol runs out of ammunition.Thinking he has been spared he dares to look up for a second or two before the magazine is replaced and he shares the fate of his colleagues. Spiellman,""The Pianist"",untermenschen,invisible Jew,zombie,died at the age of 88 in 2000.I don't know whether he ever forgave;he certainly never forgot.If Polanski's movie helps to ensure that what happened to him and millions like him is never forgotten then not a single frame of it has been wasted."

","A lot of film critics say Roman Polanski makes cold movies.These critics say his movies have cold emotions.But,personally,the emotive and cold touch Polanski gives to his films is totally appropriate.For example,The tenant(one of my favorite films directed by Polanski)would have been absurd without that cold touch.And,if the spectacular film The pianist would not have that cold touch,it would have been extremely dramatic.The pianist is an excellent and spectacular film.The best thing about this movie is that the main character is not taken as a hero.The experiences he has are a torture.The theme of the Holocaust and the Nazis has been told on a lot of movies and it's not easy to present a new face of this villains.Polanski shows that theme on a very realistic way.The movie brings a lot of questions but it does not bring easy answers to them.It only shows everything with a lot of realism and the spectator has to take out conclusions.For Polanski,this story is totally personal because he lived the war's horrors when he was a kid.This thing makes The pianist very real because the story is told through the eyes of someone who lived that horrors.The pianist is an extraordinary film,real art."

","It's rare to see a film of such quality. Polanski has been directing marvelous films for decades, with effective editing and his seemingly unique cinematography. When a brilliant director goes to work on a very personal project, it is almost invariably a certainty that their heart and soul will be put into making it. When a film is made about a major historic event, in particular when countless films have been made regarding it already(and one would be quite hard pressed to find an event that has had more films made about it than World War 2), it needs to make a point or to offer something that we have yet to see. A new perspective, an idea that hasn't been explored before. Benigni gave us Life Is Beautiful(La Vita Ã© Bella), which had one such idea, a beautiful, sweetly naive one. Polanski offers another, one that is at least as heart-warming and life-affirming. He brings the history to life, and does so with such effective direction that the film holds you in an iron grip. You feel compelled to refrain from watching more, yet you cannot look away. Such pain, horror and despair is depicted without flinching, without holding back, without censoring the worst parts out. You see all the cruelty of the Nazis, the degeneration of the health, lives and dignity of the Jews, and the slow but inevitable destruction of Warsaw. All from Szpilman's point of view. That was part of what made this so strong and affecting; he was there. Every single one of these situations, countless of times that he could have been killed... he was there. And at the end of it all, when you hear this man's beautiful music being played, one can't help but think; if war, hate and the rest of the world's evils are a result of the flaws of human beings... then the fact that this man, this creative being, this artist, made it through seemingly impossible odds, and came out of so many potentially lethal situations alive, must surely be proof that in spite of aforementioned evils, in spite of how hopeless it all may seem at times... there is still hope and beauty. It may be beaten down, it may be injured, but it shall never truly perish. The plot is well-written, and develops nicely throughout. The pacing is perfect, there's not a boring or overly fast moment to be found. The effects and design are flawless, it's all extremely authentic and realistic, as are most of the scenes. The cinematography is amazing. As my father commented while we watched: ""You really feel like you are him(Wladyslaw)."" A beautiful film, that takes you through arguably the worst historic event of the latter half of the previous century. I recommend this very highly to anyone who believes that they are strong enough to sit through it. It's most definitely not pleasant. Not to be missed. 10/10"

"Robert_duder","10","0","2","25 June 2006"," Beautiful, horrifying, haunting and brilliantly made. Truly a masterpiece.
","The Pianist absolutely deserved all it's acclaim in 2002 including some Oscar Nominations. For every moment that it is so incredibly disturbing, and provocative there is a moment of heartfelt survival, a story of overcoming these disgusting, horrible moments in history. I thought even after the first half hour of the film that even though The Pianist was great, it was going to be stereotypical in it's story about the Holocaust and World War Two and I could not have been more wrong. This is not a film about the horror of those years but rather the story of one man's survival against unbelievable odds. It is truly an epic about one man. The first hour will literally bring you to tears, turn your stomach, it puts you right in the thick of this horrible historical war and the last part of the movie you struggle along with the main character in his own personal battle to survive. What an incredible journey!! <br/><br/>I often wondered before seeing this film if Adrien Brody deserved his Oscar win. Yes, Yes, YES!! This is practically a one man show for Brody who plays famous Polish Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Practically every scene Brody is in will bring tears to your eyes. He seems like such a shy, withdrawn man who won't survive any of the heavy moments of the war ahead but he does...against all odds. He loses literally everything, everyone, his entire existence and fights on and on. In the beginning he shies away from the conflict, does everything he can to not stick out but in the end he perseveres above everything. No other film about the Holocaust or World War 2 has captured the plight of a Jew more than this film. We see every angle of the horror they endured and the people that they were and the lives that they lost. Brody may go down in history as being known for his passionate, excitable kiss with Hale Berry when presented with his award but now that I've seen the film I will forever remember his powerful performance. Now when I said this was a one man show for Brody I don't mean to count out the supporting cast in this film because they were all very, very good. Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, and Ed Stoppard all do a terrific job as Brody's family. They are only a small part of the film, the first hour perhaps but they do a great job of making you feel for them before they are taken to really get an idea of how Brody's character feels. Everyone who helps Brody's character along the way all play a terrific role but they are all quite small roles especially in comparison to Brody. This is his absolutely his masterpiece!! <br/><br/>The incredibly controversial director Roman Polanski captures gritty, dark, human abomination like no one else. Even his more recent Oliver Twist was dark and disturbing appropriately but I think this particular project was close to home for him. He so brilliantly captured Warsaw and the Ghetto and the concentration camp and the war from the perspective of the civilians, especially the Jews, rather than the front lines. The film very gray scaled, a constant feeling of foreboding throughout the entire thing. Not a single frame feels light or happy and it shouldn't. There is silence before the deafening sound of gunfire, the crack of someone being murdered, or the bombs that could kill anyone in it's path. He really works at setting the horror of the situation in the first hour and accomplishes that hands down. I could feel my stomach turning watching these men torture these human beings in despicable horrifying ways. He then allows the last half of the film to be about Brody's character and survival. There is actually a happy ending to a horrific story. How rare to see something like this. It will haunt you, leave you thinking, remembering, praying, it's quite simply brilliant. Initially I had scored this a 9/10 and I don't know why because it is deeply powerful. Perhaps a little long but nonetheless captivating. I change it to a 10/10 because of the important message of remembrance and a time where a people, human beings were treated like less than garbage. May something like this never happen again!! Please watch this movie if you're a fan of history, or just want something powerful, intelligent, and moving. 10/10"

","As this is one of those movies which is part of an Oscars special here on the local TV in March this year, I so know I have to watch. Being once a former History student myself, WWII and the prejudice that the Jews faced since the time of Hitler are among the stuff being discussed in my History textbook.<br/><br/>Watching the movie which is based on a real life story is just so haunting. And with the WWII as the backdrop, it's even more heart-wrenching. It really made me so angry at how sometimes, there are those who have a prejudice against the Jews. Living in the modern times where we always talk about equality, maybe this is something I just cannot accept.<br/><br/>It's really amazing to see how Adrian Brody who plays the famous Polish Jew pianist to really portray the emotions of how a Jew survive the horrors of WWII. War stories and events through the papers and my past History classes are what I only know of WWII so far and so this is something which almost blew my mind away. I may have watched those few documentaries my former History teacher had picked in relating to my History lessons before, watching the accounts of the war through the eyes of ordinary people is even more humane.<br/><br/>And this is one of those movies. It's always very sad that in the end that a war only leaves nothing behind but innocent people who suffered or died from it. An amazing account from a Polish Jew who survived is just so...heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>At least I know why it's an Oscar-winning movie after it ended."

","I don't know how he does it, but once again Roman Polanski has somehow managed to create a visual experience which, without any overt use of blood and gore, parallels Saving Private Ryan in its ability to disturb.<br/><br/>Let me first begin with the basic plot. This is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (played by Adrien Brody), a brilliant, young, Jewish pianist living in Nazi-run Warsaw. Before the war, things get slowly more and more horrible for the Jews, eventually resulting in the setting up of the Death Camps and the beginnings of the Holocaust. <br/><br/>Wladyslaw gets away from the Death Camps, ending up instead within a Nazi labour camp. With the help of old friends, he escapes from the camp and hides in the ruins of Warsaw, with the aid of a sympathetic German officer.<br/><br/>This is possibly one of Polanski's most disturbing films, yet it has what many would regard as a 'happy ending', with Wladyslaw being rescued by Russian troops pushing the Germans out of Warsaw. The camera-work is particularly brilliant, alternating between light and dark, yet never with any cheerful vibes. The performances by Thomas Kretschman and Emilia Fox are very good, but as always in his movies it is Adrien Brody who steals the show.<br/><br/>This is a bleak and bitter view of the holocaust through the eyes of one who escaped it, and the fact that it is a true story only adds to the power of the film. I give it an 8.5."
"roghache","10","0","2","21 May 2006"," Wrenching but poetic portrait of one Polish musician's Holocaust
","This is for me the most poignant and powerful of all the movies depicting the Holocaust...the true life story of talented Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman. Normally I would scoff at descriptions of a film as poetic or artistic, but this one truly is both. The beautiful classical music adds passion to a tale that is already heart wrenching beyond words. The movie features magnificent cinematography, especially the winter street scenes and devastated, shell shocked buildings of Warsaw.<br/><br/>As the film begins, Szpilman is playing a polonaise for a Warsaw radio station when a bomb impacts his studio. After this, the story continues on with the despicable discriminatory laws against Polish Jews, their forced resettlement into the Warsaw Ghetto, and the herding of ghetto residents (including all of Szpilman's family) off to concentration camps. Although he personally is spared the camps, Szpilman is conscripted into a German labour compound. He then escapes into hiding as a Jewish refugee, forced to take whatever assistance he can from others, usually complete strangers. During this period he helplessly witnesses, from the window of his hide out, the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 and Warsaw City Revolt of 1944.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody is absolutely brilliant in his Oscar winning role as the pianist. Although many events are depicted pertaining to both family and strangers surrounding him, the movie focuses on one particular Jew's personal story, thus making it particularly compelling. We see all the unfolding horrors through Szpilman's eyes, and Brody conveys such emotion with them. This is a gifted musician but otherwise, quite an ordinary person who feels constant anguish at the atrocities around him. Yet he is unable to help, instead forced to struggle for his own survival. He engages in no futile heroics but does everything possible to stay alive, ferret out food sources, and avoid detection by the Nazis as he moves from one hiding place to another. <br/><br/>There are so many riveting, horrendous scenes. Szpilman puts a human face on the initial loathsome laws when he is unable to go to the cafe or park with his new cellist friend, Jews being strictly forbidden. Later German soldiers force absurd dancing among ill matched ghetto couples in order to amuse themselves. Then much worse...A man in a wheelchair is dropped off a high building for refusing to stand up when Nazi soldiers enter his apartment. Later an entire line of Jewish men are forced to lay down and then systematically shot in the head one by one. When the Jews are being rounded up from the ghetto, one mother inadvertently smothers her baby to stifle its cries that would betray the family's hiding place.<br/><br/>The Szpilman family drama is itself heartbreaking. As they are standing in line awaiting transport to the concentration camp, Szpilman tells his sister that he wished he knew her better, implying fears that they may be separated forever. Perhaps the most poignant scene is again while they are awaiting deportation, when the father divides a tiny caramel in enough pieces for each family member to have a minute bit. <br/><br/>While the cruelty toward the Jews is well captured, the Jewish people in this story are portrayed not as saints but as real three dimensional individuals, which actually makes the story even more believable and compelling. Szpilman comes from a typical imperfect family, for example the members bickering over where they are going to hide the family's money. Polanski is unafraid to portray some of the Jews as assisting the Nazis by becoming Jewish police within the ghetto, in order to protect their own interests. Eventually we see a German officer with compassion, not all are evil monsters.<br/><br/>The film pays tribute to the music of the Polish composer, Chopin. Szpilman is himself a gifted pianist, whose talents must lay dormant during these horrific years, like all the other talents of countless other Jews...those that were fortunate enough to survive at all. The film wrenchingly depicts how much Szpilman misses classical music and his piano playing. In one scene, his fingers hover in rapid movement over the keys as he imagines the beautiful music of that particular piece, sound being forbidden lest it lead to his detection. Later when asked to play for the German officer, he conveys such intense passion. Perhaps a wee bit rusty at first, his fingers soon dance dramatically across the keyboard pouring forth the haunting Chopin Ballade, as Szpilman is overwhelmed with emotion. Some claim that he believes he is playing for his life or fears this will be his last performance ever, but I think he is simply lost in the pure joy of being able to play his exquisite music again, at least this once.<br/><br/>For me, The Pianist far surpasses even Schindler's List. This gripping story of one man's will to survive is definitely the best Holocaust film ever made."

"fimimix","10","0","2","9 May 2006"," ..the tagline says it all...
","""The Pianist"" is a movie which plays upon all of your emotions, as it should. Unless you had seen rushes at the theater or on TV (I hadn't), one would expect it to be primarily about classical music. It did get my attention because of its director, Roman Polanski; I've always enjoyed his films. Of course, that he can't come to this country to collect awards he wins also heightened expectations for the film. I was not familiar with a single member of the movie's cast. That bothered only because I didn't know who was doing what - I recognized Adrien Brody (Szpilman)from the ads in THE LOS ANGELES TIMES. He was in every scene; after all, it was his story. Not being familiar with the other actors-actresses certainly didn't effect my total enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>The first view of Adrien Brody at the piano kinda bothered me. I have never seen such emotionless piano-playing; I was a piano-student, concert-grade pianist. Even in those days - when it was REALLY difficult to break-into the classical music-field because there was no competitive programs to give you a boost - I don't buy all those stone-faced guys, great ones all, who played without the tiniest smile or pained expression. Were they robots? Neither do I think the overly-impassioned banging of today's pianists is natural, arms flailing and hair flying. Of course, unless a pianist doesn't do some of that, it's difficult for the audience in the last row of the balcony to determine if the pianist is just earning his breakfast, or really enjoying his music. It's kinda ludicrous for a pianist to get all worked-up over most Polish music, even Chopin's. BUT, I defy a pianist to play the really difficult music of Rachmaninov and not show one emotion over the energy it takes to keep pain-racked arms and hands working together or independently of one another - plus, the absolute fear you are not going to remember what comes next.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" was Roman Polansky's very best directing. Every scene was perfect and every actor/actress gave wonderful performances. The development of characters, to show the repressive torture all endured, even BEFORE the death-camps, looked absolutely real. The degradation they suffered just to survive was graphically clear. Also graphic were the roles of indifference - perhaps out of fear for themselves ? - most of the ""Polish"" citizens projected. No different from ""The Diary of Anne Frank."" Also in this movie, the compassion of the few whom this movie depicted to put themselves in harm's way to help others, was a powerful message.<br/><br/>Let's face it - today's people, especially Americans - would not have made it through the years of hiding and deprivation the citizens of all European countries were forced to endure. Every descent from one degradation to the next was heart-wrenching, and we were only following the misery of one family. We could watch, just across the street, helpless people thrown into them, shot-dead and then run-over by trucks?....set on fire?...shot for no reason at all? We could be locked-up in a couple of rooms for months-on-end without going stir-crazy? Not on your life - <br/><br/>After all of his misfortune, the pianist gave his greatest performance for the Nazi officer; it was brilliant - not only for the pianist, but for the untold truth (read guilt) and ecstasy on the officer's face. In that scene, Mr. Brody was a pianist; it saved his life - in his concert, post-war, to show him at the piano, then watching a totally different pair of hands blithely doing the work, was simply contrived. The artist may have been a prominent Polish pianist, but I don't think Szpilman would have approved.<br/><br/>You want drama - this movie gives it. We end-up where we began, in the radio-station. You should own it to be reminded that being extraordinary does not necessarily mean you will be treated that way - Bravo to all !<br/><br/>10/20/06 - Came back to this great movie tonight. I noticed two ""goofs"": when the family is selling the piano, the brother slams the lid to the keyboard shut. Two seconds later when the buyer is looking at it, it's open. When ""the pianist"" is playing for the German officer, there is nothing on the piano but ""the can""; the very next shot has the officer's coat and hat on the piano. He had none when he stood in the door of the kitchen........"

","Being a pianist myself this film really struck me differently than most. The Pianist tells a story of pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), who loses everything including his family and belongings and is forced to live a life of constant hiding and fear.<br/><br/>Taking place during the Holocaust, The Pianist portrays brilliantly the evils that took place during the mass genocide that took place. The disturbing events that take place in the film will leave a deep imprint on the viewer's mind for time to come; and it is certainly not an imprint that you would want to have.<br/><br/>Much of the imagery and events that are displayed on screen are very realistic. In fact, the director, Roman Polanski, went through many of the events that were shown in the film as a young child which could explain why he was able to portray these events so well.<br/><br/>One of the key factors in the film was the music. The music that kept Szpilman alive during this very dark time in history. The music that kept Spilzman going. Most of the music was written by Frederic Chopin, Polish composer who's music was very important to not only Szpilman but may of the Poles who suffered.<br/><br/>While the pianist is not for everybody, it is a magnificent movie that tells a story of how a pianist uses his talent to help him survive through one of the most troubling times in history."

The dilemma is: how can the film show us this one story and, at the same time, connect it to something larger, more meaningful, more complex? Bergman, one imagines, would know how to solve this problem. Polanski, I think, does not, and modestly tells his story in a fairly straightforward and uncomplicated way.<br/><br/>Naturally, since the subject of this film is the holocaust, I kind of wish I could say more either to praise it (for representing its subject well) or to condemn it (for representing its subject badly). But there isn't much more to say. Telling even one survivor's story is, obviously, a very laudable thing to do, but it hardly makes the film one of the greatest of all time--or one of the greatest holocaust films, either."

","Surprise Oscar winner Adrien Brody is magnificent in Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist."" (It was thought by the experts that Daniel Day Lewis would win the award for ""Gangs of New York."") Polanski's win was a surprise since the conventional wisdom had Martin Scorsese for ""Gangs"" winning the directing award as well.<br/><br/>This tremendous holocaust film deals with the destruction of a family. The scene where a family had its wheelchair bound member tossed from a window and then shot as they ran was eerie and never to be forgotten.<br/><br/>As a marvelous piano player, Brody captured the role with depth and a strong conviction. The scene where the family is placed on a train for their ultimate destiny can and must never be forgotten as well. From that point on, the focus of the picture becomes one of survival as Brody is able to elude the Nazi barbarians.<br/><br/>A strong film in the tradition of ""Schindler's List."" Surely, a film for humanity."

","This was a very good movie. The director was Roman Polanski, he does a great job of showing the characters emotion. If the character is nervous then you'll see them twittering their fingers. This movie reveals the tragedies of the Holocaust, and really makes you mad at the Nazi's. I have nothing against people that are formerly related to Germans. But, it shows the German's as basically animals. Yet it does show that some of them have compassion. Just like there are good and bad Germans, there are good and bad Americans. <br/><br/>I want to start out by saying I'm in my early teenage years, and this is the second R rated movie I am allowed to see. I wasn't freaked out by the violent aspects of this movie, but this quite a disturbing movie. Polanski does a good job of showing the hardships of the Jewish people of Europe. It has some intense action sequences. <br/><br/>I play the piano, and have been playing it for eight years. I kind of relate to the piano player in it, he has a passion for it, and he was taken away from it due to the war. I find that disturbing.

","THE PIANIST (2002) Number 1 - 2002 Top 100 - All Time MUSIC WAS HIS PASSION. SURVIVAL WAS HIS MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski, a great director (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby) whose parents survived the Polish ghetto, gathers the emotional strength to tell us a tale about the horrific, brutal persecution of Jews during the second war. This is no small achievement. What we see on the screen is not pleasant and Polanski delivers it with ruthless efficiency, holding back on any sentimental tools that Hollywood so often uses. This is a powerful masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, a gifted pianist, whose family is taken to a concentration camp and he is left to scatter along the empty, lifeless streets of a destroyed Warsaw. Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, a relatively unknown actor at the time, who consumes the role and delivers an extremely powerful, haunting performance throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>Polanski's direction also deserves praise. Technically superior, Polanski's camera-work is strategic in the way it translates imagery on the screen. His Oscar was very well deserved.<br/><br/>While 'Schindler's List' is comfortably superior, 'The Pianist' must be recognised as a brilliant film and a magnificent achievement, and in my opinion the very best film of 2002.<br/><br/>9/10"
"paul2001sw-1","10","0","2","8 February 2006"," Horrific, brilliant, almost uplifting
","It's widely believed that Roman Polanski has been in decline as a film-maker for a long time; but in 'The Pianist', he has produced a movie both brilliant and important, and fully deserving of its Oscars. He takes on a big subject - the holocaust - and brings to it a mastery of cinematic procedure and a surprisingly sure touch to a subject highly sensitive and also, through its terrible enormity, innately prone to melodrama if represented on screen. Like most films of its type, it tries to avoid this danger by steering clear of Auschwitz, which is probably incapable of inclusion in any sort of story without completely overbalancing it and isolating it from any point of connection with normal, human themes. But the horrors of what happened are in no sense hidden in the story of a survivor of the Polish ghetto who witnessed the most dreadful events, depicted here in a straightforward chronology encompassing the entire war. What happened first was that a community was forced to co-operate in its own extermination, induced to do so by the basic human need for hope; the eventual uprising was heroic but as doomed as non-resistance. By the time this happens, the hero has already escaped, but Polanski focuses on the desperate reality of his ""fortunate"" situation: the lack of heating, food, water, and also intellectual nourishment; and the near-unbearable psychology of living when any moment might be your last. And in this remarkable film, everything seems both appalling and yet natural; the movie is littered with arresting images that in no way seem forced upon the viewer; and every performance is spot on, with Aiden Brody superb in the lead (Frank Findlay in particular is also excellent, but there are no weak points at all). While very detail that is needed to make the story convincing is covered - Brody's body double (who actually plays the piano for him) has long, pianist's fingers, we know this man to be a pianist as surely as the German officer who eventually pities him.<br/><br/>And such is the skill with which the film is made that in the end, it leaves one not only reminded of the dreadful depths to which humanity can sink, but also of what is wonderful in our dubious species; and, after frequently implying the question, ""what is it that separates us from the animals?"", provides part of the answer in the redeeming power of music. This is simply the best movie on its subject I have seen; and the also best movie Polanski has ever made."

","I thought the most amazing thing about this movie was that for more than half of it there was very little spoken dialog. Adrien Brody was able to communicate in a very powerful way without speaking. It made his performance even more spectacular. Also, the music was breathtaking. Any movie with Chopin's Ballade in G minor is a good movie. I also liked how his ability to play music saved his life. When he played for the Nazi officer the officer decided to spare his life, he even brought him some food. I think that is a good lesson to learn about music. It can cross all boundaries. Even boundaries between Jews and Nazis."
"myschrec","7","0","1","22 December 2005"," A missed opportunity
","I should explain why I did not rate this film higher. I think it a good film. I think Adrien Brody did an incredibly good job. I think the film more than adequately portrayed the protagonist's near-death experiences. It is dramatic and life-affirming. Many scenes are memorable. Also, as an amateur musician, I can attest to how music can provide purpose, sanity, and sustenance in times of deprivation, pain and fear. Wladyslaw Szpilman was a truly remarkable man whose story of survival was worthy of honoring. But he did little to help others. He observed and suffered from the horrors of the ghetto, but he did little to confront them. Polanski singularly exalted Szpilman's personal survival, when he could have explored other aspects of Szpilman's story. For example, Szpilman's conduct of protecting himself -- and not joining with others, assisting others, or joining the Warsaw ghetto resistance -- was similar to the conduct of the Polish Resistance groups who refused to help the Jews in the Ghetto in spite of the fact that the Warsaw Ghetto uprising was at the time the more successful anti-Nazi effort being waged in Europe. <br/><br/>I don't fault Polanski for not exploring so many of the other issues that he could have raised -- just as I do not criticize Szpilman for not doing more to help others. But I think that the movie could have been better. It could have at least raised the question of selfishness and survival. <br/><br/>Of course, the film made the Holocaust more accessible and more palatable to a wider audience -- particularly to a non-Jewish audience. Szpilman seemed more like a Polish gentleman than the kind of ""alien"" Jews -- by that I mean the rural, shtetl-based Orthodox Jews -- that the many Poles hated and discriminated against, sometimes just as violently as the Nazis. I suppose that Polanski identified with Szpilman and was particularly horrified that the Holocaust would threaten the lives of cultured, assimilated Jews who were no different than their Polish neighbors. Of course, it is his prerogative to select what Holocaust story to tell. His film is similar to some of the films about Bonhoeffer and other Christians arrested by the Nazis. I just think that other films on this subject -- even those about non-Jews -- were much more illuminating, complex, and dramatic -- like ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" ""Amen,"" and ""The Grey Zone."""

","If I was an inch more sensitive I would've cried my eyes out. This film is heart-wrenching, a real weepy about the true story of some polish pianist whose name I cannot spell nor pronounce, who was left all alone in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2. Adrien Brody is sublime as the pianist. A man inspired by music to survive, a man who hid and tried to live even though his family had been taken cruelly by the Nazis. The film is slow and some scene of the Nazi brutality is shocking and sad. One man, a disabled inferiority who tries to protest about what the Germans are doing as they storm his house is shocking, and the pianist sees it all. The poor man is lifted in his wheelchair and is thrown over the balcony of the high rise house he lived in. that is one of the more brutal scenes, and the film is well made as all the brutality is shown from the pianist's point of view, and to know that this guy witnessed all this is very disturbing. Roman Polanski shows flair in his fantastic directing and the overall film is well worth watching. The only problem is that the ending is rather ridiculous, whether it happened or not. The part where he emerges from the derelict house which one friendly German has helped him hide in in a German coat and is then promptly shot at (not hit) by a Russian liberation troop is made farcical when they say ""Why are you wearing that coat?"" and he replies ""I'm cold"" - that is quite ridiculous and this rather silly emphasis on the liberation isn't powerful enough. I think they should have left this out and had the scene fade to the scene where the pianist's German helper is being held in a POW camp thing. Another reason is that The Pianist is nowhere near as good as Schindler's List, no questions... It is good and deserves some good recognition and viewings from everyone. It is good and deserves an 8"

","An excellent film about a musician making his way through the holocaust, and great and convincing acting by Adrien Brody, an excellent blend of emotions depicting the harshness that the Jews went through those times. I must admit Roman Polanski did a very good job showing us the misery and suffering of Poland during the days of Hitler, the holocaust and the horrible inhumane things they did to them, which could shock you and make you sympathize the people in it. Adrien plays a pianist who is very successful in Poland but during the outbreak of the Second World War, however, he becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the Nazis. By the start of the 1940s, he goes from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, then into a forced German Labor Compound. Overall, a true work of art, and a compelling movie which would make you cry and sympathize the people, seeing how they were killed, and you would enjoy it too, great work of Polanski despite his past, which I will not discuss. Recommended to those who like dramatic movies about WWII and others."

","Yes, yes, everybody knows that the pianist was a great movie. However, and I am being honest here, when I heard the title, ""the Pianist"", I thought that it was kind of a joke, like how a person with a Polish accent (or Italian, I guess, or European) would say ""penis"". You know, like, ""Look at-ah that kid's pian-ist!"" So basically what I'm saying, is that after I watched it a second time I knew what it was about and was not so disappointed.<br/><br/>As for the Nazis, I pretty much agree with the movie's point-of-view, which is that they were bad. Evil, actually, is probably closer to the truth, but I'm trying to stay objective. Speaking of which, my biggest complaint of the whole movie: Where was Hitler? Okay, the movie is not exactly about what I thought it was going to be about. Fine. But how many people like me expected Adrian Brody to become Hitler's piano player and give him the old around the neck with the piano wire? I'm sure if you look around the room you will be surrounded by raised hands. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Captain America is a legend, and that is because in his very first appearance in comic books he knocked Adolf Hitler right in his sorry jaw; Adrian Brody, however, not only did NOT punch Hitler in the mouth, but he was perched above an enclave of Nazis for a whole week and failed to report their location to Sgt. Rock.<br/><br/>I was just kidding about the last part. Everybody knows Sgt. Rock was DC, Captain America was Marvel."

","I won't repeat what so many others have already said. Yes, this is undoubtedly a moving, shocking and powerful movie of what happened to the Warsaw Jews during World War 2 - a great film by Polanski.<br/><br/>I watched it the other day and something kept nagging at me. Szpilman, the pianist protagonist, reminded me of another film character but I couldn't place him. Then the penny dropped: Szpilman is another Dr. Zhivago.<br/><br/>Both character are essentially outsiders to what happens around them, the momentous events of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath, the Warsaw ghetto and the Holocaust. Both are introvert artists who live in a world of their own, relating to most people and events around them in barely more than a superficial, disconnected way. They only make the weakest of efforts to get involved in, and influence, the turmoil of their time. Szpilman appears to be even more of a loner than Zhivago, who at least had the ability to fall in love with Lara. The Pianist is a single man who devotes his life to nothing but his music. His last words to his sister are significant: ""I regret not knowing you better."" Then, as he escapes destruction through no heroic action of his own, he becomes a total outsider to the violent events of the Ghetto uprising and the final battle for Warsaw. He watches the horrors from the windows in his hideouts, silent, barely reacting. He only comes briefly alive when he finds himself alone with a piano, which he can't play for fear of being discovered - but he plays it anyway, fingers in the air over the keys, hearing the music without making a sound.<br/><br/>When he has almost reached the end of his strength, barely surviving thirst, hunger and exhaustion, he is saved by a humane German soldier who makes him play the piano. As he does so, you see him coming alive through the powerful effect the music has on him. It almost seems as if through all his preceding suffering he has missed his music more than his family and friends who have all been wiped out by the Nazis. This scene now reminds me so much of Zhivago who sits alone in the depth of winter, in his remote house on the steppe, writing poems as this only means of survival.<br/><br/>Eventually, Szpilman is saved by the tides of war, and we see him at the conclusion of the film playing the piano for a large audience in a grand concert hall. Yes, he made it through the Holocaust, and his artistic strength hasn't left him - but what has happened to his humanity after having witnessed so much brutality and suffering? Who is this man who can still find beauty in music? How does he deal with the loss of his entire family and those who helped him survive? We never get an answer to that. And don't get me wrong - it is through no fault of Adrien Brody who fully deserves his Oscar. No, the answer lies in the character of Szpilman himself, someone who, like Zhivago before him, survives the madness of the world by fleeing in himself. In doing so he makes it impossible for us to know him, or even really care. And that may be the weakest element of this otherwise great movie."

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""The Pianist"" succeeds frighteningly in examining the horror, tragedy, and despair of the Holocaust, as experienced by a personal witness. A story brilliantly told from the eyes of an aspiring musician torn apart from the events of the Holocaust is extremely effective in depicting what actually happened to ordinary, and in this case, successful people, many of whom went from riches to rags in a matter of months. Sad, honest, brutal, and timelessly compassionate, the story follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, in his quest for survival from the cruel horrors which have plunged him into despair. Brody is brilliant in this performance of a man once at the brink of fame, who is now tarnished into mere survival, who begins to see the horrors of the Nazis between his escapes and who soon becomes the subject of their potential extermination. One can feel the passionate, personal story of Roman Polanski, who apparently experienced much of the horrors in this story, and who puts his heart and soul into translating those experiences into a sad, potent, and important film which takes us into a world of despair as we earnestly hope for Szpilman's survival.

But to share personal passion, appreciation and so complicated sorrow inside the heart with those who never experienced such great tragedy in the past human being's history.<br/><br/>The author was very lucky at that time.

We must also thank God to protect such a great pianist on the earth from being killed so we would have a great chance to listen to such wonderful music. Unlike his family or the German captain who saved his life, especially the captain, after his long torture in the Russian's war camp, his death came to the end peacefully. Whether the author did or did not try to save the captain's life, the answer is no longer important. The sorrow, the suffering, the happiness and the silence of the past were all gone to the dust. But we must not forget that the German captain did save the author's life so he could dress up and play the piano on the stage as he always wished. After all, not all Nazi German were bad or even evil. <br/><br/>The author's mind was clear that he was not interested to criticize on both side.

After seeing this film I was deeply moved. This film represented the horrible happenings of the Holocaust in settle, yet very very moving way. It provoked me to think about how lucky we all are to live without enduring such hardships. As time progresses, people begin to forget what seemed to be so recent, in this case the Holocaust. As new generations evolve, they begin to lose appreciation for such a terrible time. The Pianist brings us back to that time, and gives us a first hand experience as to what kind of brutalities went on. Being a member of a newer generation myself, I never fully appreciate and still probably don't foully appreciate what happened, but The Pianist has surely had a profound effect upon myself, and most likely my peers as well. <br/><br/>The entire film is captivating, and the Holocaust through the eyes of real-life survivor Wladyslaw Szpilman is deeply moving.

By simply telling the horrific tale of Szpilman's epic journey through the dark night of the Second World War and the Holocaust, with no attempt to editorialize or moralize on the story Polanski achieves, I think, almost a greater triumph than Spielberg did in Schindler's List. By focusing on one individual, the viewer is allowed to draw his/her own conclusions about what is happening. While everyone who sees this film will have their own ""most important""shot, for me it came when Szpilman climbs over the wall behind the house and we see Warsaw, or what is left of it. The devastation is immense, the emotional impact overwhelming. I do not mean to trivialize Schindler's List as I feel it too is a masterpiece; the two together go about as far as is possible in allowing us at the end of the century to participate emotionally and intellectually in a period most of us did not experience. They stand as a testament to why we must never, ever, let this sort of tyranny exist in the world."

","If you think you're going to watch yet another holocaust film you are in for a great surprise. Talk about a great movie. This is without argument the best Polanski's work. What makes this film so exceptional is the masterful way Polanski takes you through a gradation of emotions without you even noticing it. You start caring about the characters from scene one and you don't stop caring till the end, and your buy-in gets more and more intense.<br/><br/>To me, this is the best holocaust movie ever made (sorry Mr Spielberg). It's a very human view of the horribly inhumane time, told without pretentiousness or unnecessary preaching that most other holocaust movies incorporate. It's more compelling because it tells the story of one man's suffering and survival, and it relates to the viewer on a personal level. Thus the fact that this man is Jewish becomes secondary to the fact that this man is a human being.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody did a brilliant job portraying Vladislav Szpielman. A performance on a par with De Niro's portrayal of Jake La Motta in ""The Raging Bull"", similar both in its intensity and in the way Brody approached the role.

Adrien Brody looks like he was born for the role - his face alone provides everything we need to understand what he feels. The result is altogether touching and striking, even if the story doesn't benefit from some real life facts: if you think about it, the hero is never responsible for his own survival, always helped by friends.

In fact he probably should have gotten two for the number of times his character underwent a change. The film itself is long and drawn out but the acting blew me away.  Do not rate this film high but do make sure to mention Adrian."

","Holocaust movies are always tough to watch for me, and I confess my lack of capacity to be objective on this respect. Trying to re-tell the un-speakable in the format of popular entertainment is impossible, and I have a hard time avoiding the emotional aspects and mastering my personal feelings. 'The Pianist' is one of the best movies in the genre. The comparison with 'Schindler's List' is immediate, as both films look at the Holocaust from the angle of the tragedy of the Jewish people with personal or family connotations for the directors, as well as they bring the perspective of the True Human Beings who risked their own lives to save the lives of individuals threatened by the Nazi death machine. In my opinion both films are very good, some of the best cinema two great and different directors of our times have ever made.<br/><br/>'The Pianist' is a good film by all criteria. Although some editing cuts would have helped in avoiding repetitions, it never ceases to be shocking and emotional. Adrien Brody gives a great performance, and the camera work is great, with a classical touch reminding us that Poland gave some of the greatest cinema artists of our times. 10/10 on my personal scale."

","but I don't think Brody deserved the Oscar. I didn't think his character was outstanding enough to win. Any movie about the Holocost always is sympathetic so people think it is so good. While this was good, Schindler's List was so much better.  Brody just doesn't do enough to have received any awards.  The movie shows a lot of horrific tragedies  suffered by the Jews. We see many people killed for no reason.  The first part of the movie is about the segregation of the Jews and the round up to be sent off.  Szpilman is saved by a friend and ends up surviving rule under the Nazis. They are shown going for a march and at any moment, a German guard may pick out several Jews and shoot them.  Szpilman escapes and relies on friends on the outside to hide him.  They eventually leave the city and he is own his own to survive.  The best part is when he gets the chance to play on the piano for the German.  He finally got a chance to do what he loved when before he could only pretend to play the piano because of the noise it would make.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  This is the type of movie everyone should see to appreciate what they have today and learn a little history of what people had to do to survive during WWII."

","The invasion of Poland, from its beginning to the end, from the perspective of a Jewish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody is almost perfect in his intensity. It is a peaceful message against the horror of war and prejudice. The way the plot is developed, starting with Warzaw in a normal 1939 day made us feeling within the life of the protagonist. There are a lot of real details about the siege in Poland, including the role of the Jewish Police and the black markets. These facts are most of the time forgotten in other movies.

","""The Pianist"" is one of the most realistic and convincing films about the holocaust and about Poland in the war years.  What makes it so grand is that it is told with honesty and without emotion, or dramatization.  We see the events as they happen, without any added emphasis or, without what some would call ""manipulation.""<br/><br/>Watching ""The Pianist"" is like bearing witness to life in the Warsaw Ghetto. We see what Szpileman saw, and we never extend beyond his point of view. As a result, things are left unexplained; characters that help him or know him disappear, and we do not learn of their fates (like the blond female resistance fighter).  Other events do not always have an explanation, but we see them anyway; the SS man who suddenly appears and randomly forces a bunch of workers to lie face down for execution never gives us a reason for his presence.  Was it to keep the Reich's quota of dead Jews, was it ""disciplinary"" or was it simple bloodlust?  In any case, this random sequence turns out to be one of the most disturbing and memorable scenes in the film.  Watching, we often get one angle, from a distance, and often without close-ups (this is a film that really should be viewed on the big screen, and I understood this when I first saw it in the theater).  We also witness horrors without any added emphasis; a family is cruely massacred, and inhabitants of the Warsaw ghetto are forced to perform humiliating tasks and do unpleasant things (like eat food off the ground) just to survive.<br/><br/>
""The Pianist"" is a visual masterpiece.  The perfect cinematography gives us a real vision of what happened in Poland.  I felt like I was watching a real column of German troops as they goose-stepped through Warsaw.  Again, Polanski does not give us a closeup: we see what Szpielman is watching and nothing more.  For history buffs and historians, there are some extremely impressive recreated images, recreations that required an effort that those not familiar with this period would not appreciate.  In particular, there is a shot of Jurgen Stroop, the SS man in charge of putting down the ghetto uprising, that completely matches (down to the soldier's faces) a photo taken of him and other soldiers watching ghetto buildings burn.  Another scene has ghetto residents traveling over a bridge in the ghetto; the match to the real photo is so convincing its uncanny (I showed a friend the photos while I paused the dvd and he too, was amazed.)<br/><br/>I was also surprised at how good the film's few combat sequences were. Most of them are short and involve German/SS assault squads and resistance fighters.  They are choreographed beautifully, and are filmed in the same sort of undramatized way as the rest of the movie.  It will probably never happen, but I'd love to see Polanski direct a straight-war film.<br/><br/>Given Polanski's past, it is hard to endorse his works with a totally clear conscience.  But one can not doubt the impact of his deeply troubled life on his very powerful works.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

"jay-p-1","Null","0","1","1 December 2003"," One of the best war movies ever made
","WARNING:  SPOILERS<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's The Pianist centers around a Jewish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who lives in Warsaw around the time of World War II.  At this time, the atmosphere is just beginning to get overtly hostile towards Jews. Anti-Jewish laws are being passed, such as the restriction of basic liberties, and the law requiring Jews to wear arm bands is just coming into effect.  The Pianist is basically the story about the hero, Szpilman, trying to survive the Nazis, but Szpilman is no hero in the traditional sense of the word.  Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, and Thomas Kretschmann plays a sympathetic Nazi officer, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld.  A theme in the movie that stood out to me was the solace that Szpilman found in music, and especially that of the piano.<br/><br/>Szpilman doesn't actively oppose the Nazis or even do anything to hinder their plans, as does Oskar Schindler in Schindler's List.  Szpilman relies almost completely on the help of others that are sympathetic to his cause. He hides from the Nazis when possible, and runs when not, and is basically just trying to survive.  There are almost no bright colors in The Pianist, and the earth tones are only briefly pierced by an occasional flash of red in the background, which serves to remind us of the constant danger that Szpilman is facing.<br/><br/>There are several scenes in the movie during which Szpilman hears, plays or pretends to play the piano.  During these brief periods he retreats into a shell made of the music, and for a while at least, he has escaped.  Every time this happens a contented look comes across Szpilman's face as his fingers lovingly glide over the piano keys.  The most memorable such scene comes when Szpilman is discovered by Captain Hosenfeld and the officer asks Szpilman what he used to be.  Szpilman replies `A Pianist', and Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play the piano.  Szpilman fingers slowly regain their strength as he plays, and we see the light form an aura like effect around his head.  He again assumes his contented expression, and seems lost in another world.<br/><br/>The theme of music being a solace is brought out strongly in the movie, but by no means detracts from the story and the struggle for survival that Wladyslaw Szpilman is faced with.  The Pianist is a story about an individual's struggle to survive the Nazi occupation of Warsaw, and ranks amongst some of the best war movies ever made."

","BEFORE I start.I want to say something to this film detractors:give me something more coherent than 'this film is dull?'.And to all the Polanski detractors:GET IT OVER,MAN!. If you don't appreciate THE PIANIST then you are:1-Not a cinephile 2-You got no soul!.<br/><br/>_An Appreciation_<br/><br/>`Our hope can come only from the hopeless'.<br/><br/>
THE PIANIST just moved me the way no other film did.This realistic film has not a wasted scene(all the scenes are just perfection!).But you can't say ` I liked the Pianist','like' is a superficial word.With THE PIANIST you fell more impressed,with a feeling of AWE and after I saw it I feel totally exhausted!.<br/><br/>The protagonist, Adrein Brody,well,he  is so convincing as  WLADEK SZPILMAN that he is not 'acting' really.When you saw actors like ROBERT DE NIRO or AL PACINO,you already know all of their `tricks'.How they would react,because they are imbued with the' acting methods'.Brody as SZPILMAN is so out of manners,that it looks so frank,he is just a SOUL.In the first scene ,the film presented us to this artist: he continues to play Chopin in a radio studio while German shells explode outside.This scene is a powerful statement to his personality.It's interesting to see him changing  from a well-dressed ,educated  man to a phantom like figure starving to death.I would give him another Oscar!.<br/><br/>The behind the camera' talent of Polanski is unquestionable.Every scene are so breath taking and so real that this film is HUMAN HERITAGE,can't be treated just like  another film about  Holocaust  BUT AS A PROVE OF THE HISTORY.Polanski fans will appreciate even more The Pianist because of `the small details' that  maybe the average film goer would overlook it :that poor woman asking to the people in the streets if they have seen her husband;or this young mother regretful: 'why I did it'.,or another woman with a dying child in her arms begging for a drop of water.THAT DETAIL where SZPILMAN is at the tram,there is a special seat section in the tram for `Germans only',just notice where and how he lays down  his hand before this scene fades out.<br/><br/>In the first part of the film we witness how Szpilman's family and an entire group of `individuals' are subjected to humiliations,degradations and random shots by the Nazies(the death is unexpected and doesn't make any sense,without any purpose,the German soldier puts out the gun,stuck in the woman's face and kills her_a woman shot in the street falling into a crouching position).For example the scene when Szpilman's father was insulted by The German officers while walking the pavement in the reality this happened to Polanski's father.And how this people are left to starvation(desperation) only to lose their own dignity.Polanski camera never hesitates.The violent is show without tricks in a cold way and how it really was.Also the film is very effective by showing the  most atrocious violence against the most vulnerable people:The elderly people;cripples;pregnant women and CHILDREN: an image with a tiny boy smuggler whom Szpilman tries to rescue(Polanski,as a boy himself, was a smuggler during this period). A nightmarish state where we see corpses of children laid in the streets. It is not an coincidence that Polanski next project would be OLIVER TWIST. Szpilman,as Oliver,is left orphan and completely alone:deserted by a God,a country and the rest.Our Pianist as Oliver Twist survived thanks to the generosity of strangers. `Survival as an abstraction' or  instinctive ?(in one scene Szpilman pretends to be a corpse!).<br/><br/>In  one scene,after Wladek's family disappeared,he walks confused to the streets and enters at a building.There is someone  that hisses to him:is a man hidden inside a wardrobe and `invites' Szpilman to  enter the  hidden place or to `the coffin like shelter'(Polanski loves wardrobes,cupboards_it appeared in his famous films.If Luis Buñuel  used shoes as fetish,Polanski uses this furniture as shields).There are many scenes that reflects the absurdity of  a War State(its main focus is irrationality;cruelty ; annihilation and starvation) total `dispossession'.One of the woman of helped Szpilman,Dorota(EMILIA FOX)said in two scenes  'It's too absurd'(concerning the anti Jew restrictions). Wladyslaw Szpilman,the Pianist, abandoned his Chopin melodies only to hide himself in places where he can't get out,or  by doing  jobs as a mason.Thanks to one friend ,Wlad ek stays locked in an apartment.One of the man who visits him gives Szpilman an advice:'if the Nazies arrive,it's better that they don't catch you alive.In one nerve-racking scene,Szpilman sees below from the window that the German soldiers are entering the building,we hear 'steps noises `and just in case Szpilman opens the window,ready to jump.(luckily they are not there for him!).<br/><br/>In The Pianist the historical facts are presented not in a explanatory way,I guess Polanski don't want o underestimate his audience,you should know about the insurrection in the Warsaw Ghetto on April 19th, 1943 and one year later the Warsaw Uprising.In the apartment Szpilman observes from the window `helplessness,this two important events(in a previous scene we see the Warsaw people receiving help from the allies,the supplies of food were dropped from British airplanes.It's shown only for a few seconds,as Szpilman looks at the sky and observes how the packages fell down ,it's a great sequence).<br/><br/>Szpilman later hides in another apartment located in the other side of the Ghetto wall,there Wladek gets ill we witness another absurdity of war: in front of his apartment,there is a  'German' hospital but he can't go there for obvious reasons.(once again the lovely Dorota got a Doctor for him).Wladek survives his illness,but as many Polanski films_ if the situation is bad it will become even worst!.A tank in the streets is aiming to Szpilman's building-we hear the sound of the impact,Wladek runs away to the door but it was locked!, later we hear another impact,the soundtrack in that moment is of a damaged hearing after a big noise,this reminds me of that sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN where Tom Hanks went  sudden deaf.<br/><br/>In many scenes of the Pianist  Polanski show us `hunger and starvation' and how terrible it must be.One even prefers to die by a gun shot rather than die(slowly) of hungry.That increasing suffering of Szpilman,especially when he struggles to open a tin can of pickles,his loneliness,FEAR and an empty stomach.that make us wonder why Szpilman didn't lost his mind,his humanity?.His attitude surprised me. After the people helped him,he didn't forget the say `thank you'.Szpilman gave a new meaning of the word `THANK YOU'.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable moments I ever witnessed in a film in when Szpilman encounters the handsome Captain Wilm Hosenfeld(as one user comment accurately wrote': The can falls off the mantle of the fireplace, then rolls to the seemingly ominous feet of a lone German officer.') Here, however, Polanski -had to intervene: the encounter in the film is dramatic and moving, indeed. There is a classic shot of Hosenfeld,with the camera moving slowly upwards from his leather boots, showing the whole awesome beauty of the Nazi uniform-one of the favorite aesthetic devices of filmmakers.(the contrast between this two men is impressive)<br/><br/>In this abandoned house(his last shelter)Hosenfeld asks Szpilman who he is, what he's doing in the abandoned house, and what he used to be.Szpilman stutters `a pianist'.We perceive a piano there ,so,the Captain ask him to play.In this moment' the musician takes place' .We hear for minutes how he plays Chopin.The sun ray from a window lay down to his dishevelled hair,the same light gives a singular effect to his nose.It looks like as it becomes transparent.It give us the sensation that he is half ghost -half flesh and bone.We also perceive  that Szpilman don't want to stop playing.He is afraid because he doesn't know yet `the intentions of the German Captain.I presume that the pianist thought.'I will die after I stop playing'.(after he finishes the piece,just look at his hands).<br/><br/>But Wilm Hosenfeld is one of his last saviors(giving him food,an `opener' and a coat).Szpilman once again said the word THANK YOU.Myself ,I have to thank to Brody,Polanski, the real Szpilman(with his wonderful memoir) and the entire cast. Thank you very much for this Masterpiece.<br/><br/>Also I have to say that the sound of this film is outstanding ,from the first scene: the explosion in the radio station_ to the sequence where the German soldiers are marching in the streets of Warsaw(the sound of their leather boots has a powerful effect,to the contrary in Pink Floyd `The wall' the image of this marching hammer is the powerful one ).Also `the absence of MUSIC haunts THE PIANIST,his solitary moments.The camera catches Szpilman fingering some unheard Nocturne,playing a phantom piano in a chamber of his memory'.<br/><br/>And finally One shot I'll never forget: the ragged Szpilman walks toward us from the middle distance, down a wide, absolutely devastated,empty street in a City we know as Martyr.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Last night I finally rented ""The Pianist"" on DVD. It was a superb film and a crude drama on the realities of world war two. Although it has a good pace for a non-action movie, it does tend to get sluggish in parts and you can't help but wonder what actually happens to the rest of the pianist's family (probably killed in Treblinka, but the film never addresses their fate). Also, I wish some more insight could have been given to the Nazi Officer who ultimately became the pianist's savior, as it was truly rare to see such human kindness during a war like this. At parts, it reminded me a bit of ""Schindler's List"", although this is a more personal story and one of survival. Polanski did a terrific job capturing the atmosphere of Warsaw in Ruins and it's good to see that the Academy finally lifted their ""ban"" on him.

"Travis69","Null","0","1","15 October 2003"," The Pianist review
","Unlike several directors prior, Roman Polanski captures the personalities of the people involved in the world's greatest known horror, the holocaust. The Pianist is a landmark film that strikes not only the emotion of the event, but allows the viewers to connect and see what the, usually led to be, faceless were facing. In a particular scene, a Jewish man is offered a cigarette by one of the Nazi soldiers in a camp held outside by the Germans. With everyone around him looking hopeless, the elder does his best to convey faithfulness to the Nazi with his uttermost graciousness. It's a rather silly episode; but it's one that depicts how desperate these people were. The scene gives many in such a discouraging time a little bit of astonishment, even for a mere second. The scene also leads the youngest of Jewish victims some decent stray of hope.<br/><br/>	Our eyes naturally are going to jump at the big German men with the even bigger guns. The Jewish man does his best to distract our attention away from them with some flair, a little twirling dance of immaculate reception. Dominant, still, are the intimidating foot soldiers. No matter how dominant, there doesn't seem to be a high contrast between the heavy blues and grays of the Nazi party to the dark grays of the ghetto streets, buildings, and coats of the Jewish. With the camera head on, we feel as if we're a bystander also; the only indication of empowerment from the Nazi's are their formal wear and rifles. Polanski does a wonderful job indicating that everyone stuck in this situation is just another number. The guards are no better than the Jews and perhaps even some feel forced to do what they do for Hitler and Germany. <br/><br/>	Many of the scenes in The Pianist focus on Adrien's Brody's breakout performance of Wladyslaw Szpilman, which earned the role an Academy Award for best actor. Usually, Szpilman is isolated in the many locations he's hiding from-even with some help from the Nazi's-set with an intimate rendering of an artist going mad. He's famous, he's talented, but he's also helpless; his star can do nothing about his hefty family's looming fate. Even helping himself can only go for so long. Aside from this portion of the film, Wlayslaw Szpilman is like every other Holocaust victim, taking to the ghettos, doing anything for his next meal ticket. The audience, in turn, receives a stronger familiarity with the diverse number of personas also searching for their last string of hope.<br/><br/>	The old man secluding only one-fourth of the abovementioned dancing and prancing scene is not necessarily the sign of a turncoat. His eyes, slightly angled to illustrate sentiment, tell the whole story; they show desperation, almost forgiveness, and begging til Hitler come. Yet, the Nazi soldiers enjoy this sort of thing, parodying everyone in their part to entertain at the expense of others. The subsidiary contrasts set little children wandering around and showing amusement, perhaps joy, at the cohesion between the old smoker and the cigarette peddling Germans.

","Once I found out there was a movie called ""The Pianist"" and that it won la palme d'or in the Cannes Festival, I wanted to see it as soon as possible, especially just after learning Woijeck Kilar was providing the musical score in this movie. That's one of the main reasons I thought it'd be my favorite movie. Unfortunately it is not.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>I must begin by saying that the movie has some quality and is really interesting because it's based on the true events of a War survivor, which is worth watching; however, I found the movie very simple. ""Simple"" is the word I must use throughout this review, because the movie tells a very dramatic story, but the acting is shallow and Adrien Brody really doesn't show dramatic expressions or sadness. He's too simple and quiet while losing everything and being a survivor of War; he acts as if nothing happened. He's too quiet, and uninteresting. When playing the piano his facial expressions seem to be dissembled, instead he seems not to really feel the music he's playing as any great pianist would.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody's last scene where he's found by the police who want to catch the Germans and says ""I'm cold"" is overdone, It's not moving as it pretends to be; on the contrary it's pretentious and really unbelievable. Adrien Brody annoyed me with his quietness, he should have shown suffering and dramatic expressions without him overacting, but he didn't. He was too calmed, it seemed he didn't realize he was In a War. I knew he'd win an Oscar, even though his performance wasn't so good, however I'm happy that he did, because he's young and needs to take on more important roles to really show better acting skills. <br/><br/>Another disappointment of this film, is Kilar's music. As I mentioned earlier, I thought his music would be as beautiful as the musical score he provided in 1996's ""Portrait of a lady"". however, his music in ""Portrait of a Lady"" puts the music of ""the Pianist"" to shame. The music in ""Portrait"" is way more beautiful, interesting and dramatic; however, in ""The Pianist"" it's dull, simple, and with no depth. The music played by Adrien Brody is not really one of the pieces I like, it's too quiet, simple  and romantic, which I dislike; however the music in ""Portrait of a Lady"" is a triumph, because it's so dramatic, and so beautiful that you can't really stop listening to it, especially the shubert's part played by one of the supporting characters in the movie. <br/><br/>Of course ""The Pianist"" is not a total loss at all. It really shows very sad scenes, one I can remember is when the Nazis threw a person in a wheeled chair out of the window. Another great scene is when the people had nothing to eat and were really starving. I also liked the scene where the little boy tried to cross the wall and was trapped in it and Adrien Brody tried to help him. <br/><br/>To me the greatest scene was when the German was touched by Adrian's playing, and helped him survive. That was really great and shows the complexity, sadness and realism of War.<br/><br/>The pianist has very disappointing parts. It's not really what I expected; however it's still one of the best movies of 2002 and deserves all the praise it received. 7/10"

","I've just watched The Pianist for the second time and once again feel utterly compelled to comment here. The first time I saw this film, my mind was filled with the horror of the story - and my alarm at some of the fairly unpalatable comments others had posted.<br/><br/>This time too, I find myself almost overcome with emotion but now because of the music, which somehow seemed incidental to me before. The scene where a ravaged Szpilman plays Chopin (Ballad No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 23) for the German officer left me shattered. The beauty and sheer elegance of the piece simply annihilates darkness for as long as it lasts and its memory provides a benchmark for the human spirit when the last note has faded. Even in the midst of the incomprehensible darkness of the Holocaust there was still light, even if it was only able to shine in the hearts of people able to remember its warmth.<br/><br/>I consider myself an informed music lover but I believe this is the first time in my life I've ever truly understood its deepest beauty. For me this confirms The Pianist as a truly great film. It's certainly not unflawed but if a definition of Art is that which provokes genuine realisation in its audience then Polanski has here become an artist."

"Swangirl","Null","0","1","24 September 2003"," Not just another Holocaust film...
","Based on an autobiography of Polish musician Wladislaw Szpilman, ""The Pianist"" is not simply a Holocaust movie. True, it is set in the days of World War II and Hitler's Third Reich. More to the point, it is a movie about one ordinary man who managed to survive great hardship and trials because of luck and hope. <br/><br/>This movie is Szpilman's (played with class by Adrian Brody, who won an Oscar for it) story told in a very no-frills way that is riveting by the mere fact it does not give way to going over the top. Instead, the utter depravity of the environment is so part of the film that it is almost a character itself that Szpilman fights to defeat.<br/><br/>Born into a prosperous family of fellow music lovers, Szpilman refuses to believe the whispers that Hitler's forces will soon take over his hometown of Warsaw, Poland. As the film progresses and circumstance grow increasingly grim, Szpilman is transformed from a lighthearted, talented somewhat arrogant young man to a frightened, distrustful fugitive who darts from place to place seeking refuge.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" is not notable for its dramatic action scenes or emotional outbursts. That is its charm. Instead, it is a collection of moments in the survival of one man as he continually lucks out and manages to stay alive. All the while, his music keeps his spirits from completely failing. This is what makes this film so different than the average Holocaust film. It is more than the horror and death, it is about hope.<br/><br/>Eventually, Szpilman's luck seems to run out when he is discovered by a high-ranking SS official, who demands that he play something on the piano. It is a moment of great tension as you wonder if, after all this time not practicing and being in hiding, if Szpilman will be able to play with the precision and skill that he once did. This scene is one of the most powerful in the entire film.<br/><br/>Many Holocaust survivors will tell you that the only thing that kept them alive amid so many trials and terrors was hope. Hope that they would somehow make it. Those without hope, they say, almost surely perished. It would be too simple to say that music kept Szpilman alive through what he endured but it certainly played a large part. <br/><br/>Kudos to Polanski and Brody for bringing such a gem to the world."
"blurrychick","Null","0","1","23 September 2003"," emotionally confronting
","We are learning about the Holocaust in English at school and the various interpretations or i should say attempts at representing the inhumane events during the Holocaust. I have to say that The Pianist is a great representation of the Holocaust, one that challenges the functions of history and memory. Polanski wasn't afraid to exemplify the true horror of the Holocaust, much to the audience's stricken grief, but an important aspect was the fact that he also shedded light on the good Germans during WWII.  It is a very confronting film and I can't bear to watch it twice. I think its one of those 'watch-only-once' movies. I think Polanski was successful in trying to capture the 'true' emotions of the Jews, also reinforcing the retaliation in the ghettoes, stressing the idea that Jews were not passive and helpless during this time.  Although the Holocaust is ultimately un-representable, the director portrays it very well in a socialist point of view."

","Roman Polanskis Pianist is a haunting film that had on the edge of my seat as I journey alongside with Szpilman through Poland in WW2. I found the film to very realistic and very polished visually.   I was very critical with this movie being that it took me nearly a year to see it. Holocaust films tend to be downers, but I couldn't avoid it any longer. Brody deserves the Oscars being that he is in every frame of the movie from the midpoint on. His portrayal of Szpilman is hypnotic and heart wrenching. I feel giving this film any criticism would anti-semantic. One thing bothered me about the movie though. It didn't seem to go together very smoothly. It was a sequences of scenes that seemed to be cut together to show Szpilmans journey opposed in showing a plot with any type of flowing through-line. Being that this a true story, it is okay being that life doesn't always make a good script. Polanksi's goal was to tell Szpilmans story and not make a Hollywood blockbuster. I just feel it could had been edited more smoothly. I especially loved the relationship or lack there of one of the German officer toward the end of the film.

","Throughout the entire length of ""The Pianist"", I was incredibly moved and shocked speechless by some of the disturbingly graphic ghetto scenes, with Jews being tormented by the ever-present wicked Nazi soldiers. Of course, I've heard more than a few comments from other viewers who think this film is basically just a ""Schindler's List Lite"", if you will. These people say it's just another effort in a long line of supposedly exploitative Holocaust dramas from the past decade or so.<br/><br/>While I can clearly see their argument, I must add that, admittedly, I have not seen a great deal of those types of films (my best exposure to such WWII-era subject matter would have to indeed be the aforementioned ""Schindler's List"", arguably Steven Spielberg's greatest film); nevertheless, I'm sure that if I HAD seen more of those films, I still would have been just as fazed after viewing this one. I don't know about you, but I haven't exactly become desensitized to such horrific imagery (like some others apparently have), and I still find those topics to be increasingly fascinating to watch in movie form. As well, the fact that this entire project was held together by the phenomenal lead performance from Adrien Brody didn't hurt, either. I thought his acting was completely deserving of the Best Actor Academy Award win, and Mr. Roman Polanski as well was more than worthy of being bestowed with the Best Director Academy Award. The stunningly realistic look of the film, coupled with winning performances and a beautiful musical score, makes for a heart-wrenching, unforgettable true story. Highly recommended - although again, if you find yourself easily disturbed by the violent nature, perhaps you can avoid this one. It is pretty grim, as one would probably expect.<br/><br/>Aside from that, though, this is a masterpiece. Well-done."

","""The Pianist"" tells the story not only of Szpilmann,but also of Polanski himself.A lot of the scenes are directly from his youth in the ghetto of Warsaw.This makes this movie even more impressive.<br/><br/>Although the entire movie is very good,I personally was the most impressed by the first hour or so(until Szpilmann's family is put on the train to the concentration camp).this part is truly about the absolute horror of the holocaust and it shows the terrible circumstances in which the Jewish people had to live.Adrien Brody plays brilliant and deserves the Oscar he received,he is almost in every scene the main character!<br/><br/>Still,there are a few things that annoyed me in this movie.First of all the fact that the Nazi's speak German but the Polish people speak English(!?),this is really a shame since it takes away a lot of the realism of the movie.Roman Polanski should have said:Up yours! to the producers and big bosses of the studio's and should have let everybody speak in their native language.It is not consistent,or how we would say in Holland:He who says A,must also say B. Another thing is the,what I call,""overkill""-scene.This is the scene in which a couple of Jews are to lie down on the ground while a Nazi shoots them in the back of the face.The last Jew is a friend of Szpilmann and what I feared for happened.The gun of the Nazi is out of bullets when he wants to shoot him,so he has to replace the cartridge.This to me is too Hollywoodish and was not needed in this movie,it is too much sensation and gore! The last bad thing happens at the end.Szpilmann sees the Russians come into the Ghetto in which he hides.He comes out to celebrate,but he's wearing a Nazi coat that he got from a moderate,""human"", Nazi(if there are any).The Russians of course think he is the enemy,so they start shooting,I figured that they would kill him so that Polanski shows that this is the true horror and unnecessary factor that is war.But no,Szpilmann runs through the Ghetto like Arnold Schwarzenegger and he is not hit by one of the many bullets.This is again too much Hollywood,it is not realistic.<br/><br/>Although there are a few flaws in the movie that are a shame,(especially the English speaking Polish people)it still remains as one of the best and most impressive Holocaust movies ever made(to me Schindler's List is better,probably because it was made first,so that any other holocaust movie doesn't look like a real add-on).This movie is a definitely not unnecessary and it is very important as a historic piece of art.   9/10"

","This is a movie I will not forget. What I especially appreciated was that the movie -although it deals with the holocaust- was not predictable at all. Thereby, all things happening in front of my eyes were very pure, got lots of meaning and attacked my emotions in a way that few movies are capable of.  No romantic lovestory, no heroes, and in the end no words, just music; words only cannot describe the suffering. Terrible scenes at times, but life itself is much more terrible, one couldn't even imagine...<br/><br/>I would like to compare this movie with La vita e bella for a change. Both movies seem to go for showing the madness behind the holocaust (and human nature in general). The pianist uses a (ultra)realistic approach, while La vita e bella uses humor and fantasy. Polanski escapes in silence and music, Benigni in tragical jokes and gestures. I think both movies really contribute to the genre because they give another point of view. It might be the same old story that is told and that story might be easy to 'score' with, but one has to realize that  comparible situations are still going on in other countries NOW.  So why not use contemporary technics/ storytelling to find one's own reality in the NOW?<br/><br/>Why not compare it with Schindlers' list? I disliked the scene with the little girl in red dress walking through the black and white landscape.

His performance was subtle and certainly as Oscar worthy as any of the other nominees. Something was lacking for me. The film overall was visually impressive, the use of color for a subject that seems to demand B&W was daring and in the end handled beautifully. I screened Schindler's List the next evening and discovered that the characters were so much more involving, from the smallest bitpart to the leads, they grabbed me & made me feel their experience in a way the the pianist never did. There was a heart and a soul to Schindler, we watched him grow as a man, as a human being almost against his will. His journey from the opening of the film to the closing moments affected me deeply. As a Jew myself I have seen tons of material relating to the holocaust and it is not as easy to move me as it is others. The pianist did not move me, I found the key characters strangely one note, I never really understood why they risked their lives to protect this man, I never understood how he felt about their doing so. Most of all, by giving me no pre-war context for his place within Warsaw, I was robbed of the chance to see the true/larger change for this man. It took only moments in Spielberg's film to establish a world of information about Shindler's former life, the brief episode of his wife's trip the Krakow tells the whole story perfectly. I do hate to be disappointed by a movie, my expectations are usually so low that it doesn't happen often. I strongly suggest viewing Rosemarys Baby, a Polanski masterpiece from my humble viewpoint. He's getting too sentimental in his mature years."

What a disappointment. There was almost no piano playing, only the usual nonsense of how nastily the Germans behaved to humble, talented Jews. The entire movie was so ""outre"" that I actually laughed when a German officer pulled out his Luger and shot a Jewess to death for asking ""Where are we going?"" How ridiculous can this myth of the Jew suffering at the hands of persecutors become? Polanski is merely cashing in on this formula of the suffering Jew to get an Oscar, following the footsteps of Spielberg, Benigni and others of this ilk, milking the story of the Holocaust for all it's worth. As for the piano playing, forget it. There was an emasculated rendering of Chopin's Ballade in G minor and a couple of sentimental piano pieces. I play much better stuff than this. My rating for the movie is a -10 out of +10. Don't waste your time and money on this claptrap."

","I was eager to view this well-regarded feature via a DVD presentation and see what kind of ""Making of. . ."" extra would be available.  Universal did a great job of packaging this quality film; I have seen many memorable films about the WW II Jewish Holocaust but this ranks among the absolute top tier. The details about Szpilman's music and the corroboration about his eyewitness memoir written in the 1950's helps build the authenticity of this project.  The use of locations that were totally wrecked also helps the director's and screenwriter's visions to shine through.  I am impressed by this young actor's commitment and his implicit diligence at conveying the talent and intelligence of the Polish musician.  Brody illustrates how ""pretty faces"" are not the only men worth building cinematic casting lists around; I can't imagine Brad Pitt or Ben Affleck in such a role that requires intellect and solitary mundane discipline (his piano technique and artistry).  Kudos to Mr. Brody - - your Academy Award is a worthy one to a hard worker !  For those who with little awareness of the situation of the Polish people during the NAZI regime, this is a great ""intro"" and will display the many-sided nature of people during war time: the good and humane, the bad/sadistic/wickedly selfish, and the victimized people who were vulnerable and too trusting in a compromised ""modern civilization"" like Europe in the 1930's.  This film is a 10* product - - highly to be recommended to the young who will talk over the graphic victimization with understanding mentors and older adults who know about this crucial tragic event in the 20th Century that must never be repeated!"

Watch the 1978 Holocaust or Uprising (2001 Leelee Sobieski) or Schindler's List, and you'll see that everything in this movie has been done before and done much better.

"GCENGPC","6","0","1","10 July 2003"," A nice effort by Polanski but...
","***Possible Minor Spoilers*** The Pianist was not as good as it could or should have been. But of course it has a few great features in it like the acting epscially from Adrien Brody, who won an extremely well deserved Oscar for his role as the Jewish pianist, Wladslaw Spzilman, the photography, and editing. But ultimately it was very mediocre. The story of the film is very unoriginal, many of the characters seem to really have no depth making them just seem flat and lifeless, and it sheds no light on the Holocaust subject and whatever elements of that subject that were covered in this film was already covered in the past by other films already. The only thing that was actually original in this film was showing the Nazi officer who helps Spzilman in the end. And as Polanski goes, his direction in this film was very uneven and by the end he didn't really have much of an explanation to his movie, I think if he wanted to make a Holocaust movie, he should have done his story growing up in the Krakow ghetto or something similar to that since he was there and witnessed everything that happened there while as Warsaw goes, I don't think really knew what happened there considering how the uprising sequences in this movie seem somewhat uninteresting. In conclusion, I can't help but give credit to Polanski (seeing him win the Best Director oscar was nice), but Schindler's List really steps all over The Pianist in every single aspect. I give The Pianist 5 out of 10 stars."

","The year was 2003 when I fell in love with the Academy Award movies in which instead of watching mindless movies from XXX with Vin Diseal or The Scorpion King with The Rock, I started watching movies that were nominated for Academy Awards no matter what the award was. 2002 was a year of memorable movies from Chicago and it's razzle dazzle to Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York showing how violent America was during the early years of the mafia. But no movie has touched me more deeply and profound than Roman Polanski's look at the holocaust in ""The Pianist"" in which the director himself was a victim of the tragic event before escaping into hiding.<br/><br/>Adrian Brody plays real life pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who is force to move out of the apartment complexes with his family and into a small community after Hitler announces that certain parts of the country will be divided for those who are Jewish and those who are not. Wladyslaw and his family see the horrors that go on from soldiers forcing people to dance in the streets, homeless Jews fighting people for food; even at night when Nazi soldiers break into people's houses to execute Jews for no apparent reason. The scenes are so real that I gasped at first sight.<br/><br/>After Wladyslaw and his family are moved into concentration camps to work in enslavement, he leaves where he's like a mouse hiding from building to building in avoiding the cats to get him. Years go by for the famous pianist in which the horrors are continuing in the streets for which there are a few people not afraid to die trying in the fight.<br/><br/>The film is mainly a survival for the pianist, but the film's portrayal of what went on outside the concentration camps during the holocaust is a masterpiece that only Roman Polanski never thought he could show. Adrian Brody's performance is so wonderful that you'll be shaken by his performance; Thomas Kratchsmann as a sympathetic German Nazi soldier to Wladyslaw is another good portrayal in the film that shows how good acting can be when putting a survivalist and a soldier meeting face to face."

","Roman Polanski has the curious habit of oscillating between pure masterpieces such as Tess, Rosemary's Baby and Frantic and unadulterated rubbish like Fearless Vampire Killers, Lunes de Fiel and Pirates ( to name the extremes ). The pianist is, I think one of his better efforts. First of all, the picture quality, the music and the sets are absolutely perfect. The story line too is very watchable and nicely simple. We know who the good are and who the bad are, even if the various characters are probably a little over-stereotyped in their traditional roles, notably the Nazis who are portrayed as generaly fat, extremely cruel and heartless.<br/><br/>The scenes of violence are, nevertheless coldly cruel and realistic, such as the herding of jews into the cattle wagons, the indiscriminate picking out of certain people to be shot on the spot, and the scenes where the Germans force the jews to dance to keep warm. There is a lot of violence in the film but, hard to take though it is, it is probably in conformance with the reality of the time.<br/><br/>I would nevertheless contend that the film is a little overlong and should have been kept down to under two hours. The first half, and of course the very end are the most interesting. Too much time is given over to Szpillman's staking it out in the flat where nothing too much happens. This is not to say that the reality was not thus, but for the spectator, it gets rather boring. The ""boredom"" is suddenly cut short when local resistance members start attacking the Germans and we see some more action, as during the first half.<br/><br/>I was most impressed with the sets of ""burnt out Warsaw"" and do wonder where they were actually shot.<br/><br/>I therefore maintain that the film has documentary qualities and shows to those who were not alive at the time the terrible conditions in the Poland Ghetto. So, certainly recommendable, and I shall probably end up buying the DVD which has just come out in France."

","This is probably the best film he has done since ""Chinatown"". That doesn't say very much however. It has been a sad thing to see what Polanski has been up to, during the 80s and 90s.<br/><br/>This is a melodrama. You've seen much of it before, but of course you might need to see it again. But there are also aspects here, that you don't find in average movies about the subject. The total loneliness of the main character is what this is about and that's not a loneliness only in WW2 Poland, but for all times. That is the main point here and it's obvious in the scene there the main character walks totally by himself in the ruins.<br/><br/>The dialogue is still the weak part and the fact that Polish-Jewish victims speak English to each other is not acceptable. If the ""market"" demanded that, Polanski should have had the integrity to refuse. This is commercialism at its worst and takes the film down to a lower level."

","Having dealt firsthand with Nazi terrors, it was perhaps inevitable that director Roman Polanski would finally present his interpretation of it.  His film offers a strong, clinical take on the Nazi inhumanities with a relatively detached emotionalism, personifying some key elements to understanding how individuals managed to deal with the horrors of the time. Adrien Brody is absorbing as an artist overwhelmed in the escalating nightmare; his characteristically expressive mug reminding me very much of the Giancarlo Giannini protagonist in Lina Wertmuller's SEVEN BEAUTIES (still my favorite movie dealing with Nazi persecution).  THE PIANIST is another great film by Roman Polanski.  From the resoundingly ominous explosion at it's start,to the tragic vista of Warsaw as a devastated wasteland, THE PIANIST turns out to be another unique chiller from a film-making master."

"Eli_Cash","8","0","1","15 June 2003"," Jarring Holocaust Piece of a Man's Determined Survival
","This was improbably my first Polanski, not surprisingly my first Brody, but certainly not my first World War Two/Holocaust picture.  I have to admit I knew little going 'in' to this except holding foolish thoughts like 'how many more times are they going to make a movie on this topic?' <br/><br/>
Polanski blows that preconception apart.  He provides a startlingly fresh approach to the genre which includes _Schindler's List_ and to a lesser extent, _Saving Private Ryan_.  Like 'SPR' _The Pianist_ uses technically proficient shots of horrific violence.  Unlike 'SPR' these sequences are sporadic and always come like a jarring physical blow.  Much like some of the more successful practitioners of some forms of metal and punk music, you can come off being far more brutal and shocking if you're not so thick with the dissonance.<br/><br/>Yet much of _The Pianist_ power comes in the form of traumatic psychological violence.  Like _Schindler's List_, this is the story of Jewish survival at all costs during the Nazi Pogrom.  However unlike 'SL', this is not the epic broad-stroke of an entire population's suffering but largely the tale of a single man and his efforts to stay alive.  Not to say that either this or 'SL' is significantly better than the other, they are to disparate in their approach to be fairly judged tete a tete.  But _The Pianist_ accomplishes a few things 'SL' couldn't by narrowing its scope somewhat.  Not that Polanski completely throws away the horrible effects such atrocities had on a wide range of people.  We learn that it takes the fellowship of his people, the kindess of the underground German resistance, and a few other more unlikely supporters not to mention no small amount of sheer luck for Mr. Szpilman to survive.<br/><br/>Brody is terrific as Szpilman logging more screen time than just about everyone else combined.  I hope to see him again as soon as possible.  Now to go see more Polanski immediately."

","This is NOT a movie about the ""Holocaust"".<br/><br/>This is not a movie, as Brody has has said, about ""The power of Music and survival"".<br/><br/>This isn't even a Jewish fairytale of martyrdom or a condemnation of Germans.<br/><br/>This isn't a condemnation of Poles either. (For a group that played such an an importantant part in Mr. Szpillman's story they aren't mentioned in these reviews. The people speaking English were really speaking Polish, whether Jewish or Polish, rather then Russian or German.)<br/><br/>This movie finally put European cruelty in perspective. As a person of European descent you believe that Europe had entirely seperated itself from some sort of ridiculous instinctual behavior.  It has been an uninterrupted history of civilization. The only reason this episode of history, and it really is just an episode, happenned is because some sort of abberant thought infected itself into the European political bloodstream. The more likley explanation would be that humanity infected itself into the political mainstream of Europe.  Humans are nasty creatures.<br/><br/>This movie in a simple and moving way showed the true nature of man. Who we are doesn't change....from the sack by Crusaders of Constantinople to the sack of Constantinople by the Turks. Somebody is going to sack somebody and and make them pay. Rwanda is horrific only because they had radios and AK-47s. It would have been 100s instead of 100,000s.<br/><br/>Which brings me to this movie.  Are there major moral issues that a man survived by luck and connections within the Polish artisan class? Not really. He did what he could do (after doing everything possible for his family). What could he have done during the Jewish uprising except die ""in dignity"".  What could he have done during the Polish uprising except be shot by his ownside as an unrecognized combatant. He could have done either, both honorable (another thankfully worthwhile instinct) but then we wouldn't have his story to illuminate human nature set in 20th Century Europe.<br/><br/>
What he did is simply write a book describing his survival and for me thats enough.<br/><br/>One last note for everyone who believes this is an anti-war testimony:<br/><br/>This is a pro-war testimony.  Jews weren't being slaughtered because of war but because war wasn't declared soon enough. Violence DOES solve things. We still are, after all, human."

"trpdean","Null","0","1","10 June 2003"," Very well done movie of a ghetto survivor
","Although I'm going to make some criticisms of the movie, I want to first say that I think it's very finely done. The acting, the sets, the music, the lighting, the overall direction are first rate. We are moved again and again and reminded of man seeking survival at all cost. IT is definitely worth seeing - and it clearly deserved the honors it received.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, I don't think it's as wonderful as it might have been. It's very straightforward - there seem too few moments of imagination. Undoubtedly, the overall facts of Jewish life in Poland in the 1940s are of course going to bear similarities.  <br/><br/>Yet, e.g., a survivor's hunt for food and water in civilian houses during W.W.II - I kept thinking ""I've seen this before"" - and Eureka! Yes, I had - in Empire of the Sun. <br/><br/>The separation of the Jewish family - some marked for the concentration camps and some not, the uprising in the ghetto - I kept thinking ""Where have I seen this?"" Oh, yes, in the miniseries, Holocaust. <br/><br/>The use of music as the counterpoint to Nazi horror and escape from death - where have I seen this before? Oh yes, Vanessa Redgrave in Playing for Time. <br/><br/>The railroad siding at which some are spared from the death camps - gee, I've seen that before. Oh yes, Sophie's Choice (which was far more gripping).<br/><br/>It's not that I dislike movies from or about the Holocaust. I think there's always room for more stories from the Holocaust - and I suppose Polanski is going to be drawn to it more than to, say, the horror of the imposed famine in Ukraine in the 1930s -- but I would like to see more imagination used in the telling. <br/><br/>(E.g., in Empire of the Sun, the juxtaposition of the dying breath from a woman's body and the protagonist's certainty he sees it merged into the mushroom cloud from Hiroshima - or the wonder at the stadium full of looted luxury taken by the Japanese - or the transformation of a prisoner of the Japanese from idolizing their strength to idolizing the Americans' strength - the last particularly was very human and seldom acknowledged in movies). Or in Lawrence of Arabia - the use of light is so extraordinary (the match being blown out, the figure of Lawrence along the tops of rail cars, etc.) These are striking memorable images -and unfortunately The Pianist doesn't have much that is distinctive visually. <br/><br/>Still and all, it's an excellent movie - well worth seeing."

","From the moment of horrific irony as the small family celebrates the declaration of war with a small party, thinking their lot is bound to be improved, to the searing agony of watching Szpilman gulp at a bucket of filthy water at the abandoned hospital, this movie provides such a realistic picture of the deterioration of a brilliant, famed artist into a starving, lone phantom that we cannot help but be overcome ourselves watching his desperate clawing at his locked door in the safehouse or his defiant efforts to open his solitary can of food in the abandoned mansion.<br/><br/>Yet this is not a movie just about the survival of his body.   What many, many survivors of war and the Holocoaust lose at least temporarily is their purpose, the life of their souls, either to bitterness or madness, or simply confused by the wave after wave of remembered horror after horror.  We learn in the climatic piano solo played for the German officer that Szpilman may have been reduced to starvation and hiding for his life, but the life of his soul, the purpose and spirit are still just as fiery and abundant and flourishing as ever. The Piano itself has saved him from insanity, the piano that has always waited, and the moment of their reunion is one of the most brilliant pieces of filmwork ever.

It's based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish musician living with his family in Warsaw at the time of the Nazi invasion of Poland. The Szpilmans are Jewish and suffer the Nazi's monstrous designs for European Jewry.  The story's told in almost a matter-of-fact way. First there are the required identification markings for Jews, followed by restrictions of movement, limits on the ownership of money...slowly, one step at a time, leading to mass murder. And Wladyslaw Szpilman is there through it all, extraordinarily lucky, and blessed with great friends, so that he lives through all six years of Nazi occupation. An amazing story of human survival.<br/><br/>The filmmaker, Roman Polanski, survived the Krakow ghetto as a child. With ""The Pianist"", he has made his best movie, his masterpiece, surpassing even his previous greats, ""Chinatown"" and ""Repulsion"". This is a great labor of love. It's perfectly filmed, the horror and humanity of the story hitting home like few movies, no, few works of art in any medium, can. If you haven't seen it, do so."

","The opening sequence of ""The Pianist"" shows a pensive young man sitting at his piano, playing a sonata.  Soon, bombs burst everywhere, leading to a swift evacuation of war-torn Poland.  ""The Pianist"", written by Ronald Harwood from the memoirs of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (1912-2000), is heart-tugging moviemaking at its peak.  Adrien Brody is compelling as the beaten but not defeated Szpilman, who amazingly survived the German invaision over a five-year period (but lost his entire family).  His struggle to secure food, shelter and elude murderous German officers is often painful and unbearable to watch, but during these troubled times, serves to remind us of the senseless brutality of war.  The supporting cast is also incrdible, including Emilia Fox as Dorota, one of Szpilman's admirers who aids him during his peril, and Thomas Kretschmann's small role near the end as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, the German officer who spared Szpilman's life when he caught the pianist in hiding, is fine as well. Roman Polanski's most personal film to date may also be his best.  Three Oscars for Best Actor, Director and Adapted Screenplay.  A moving, immensely powerful story.  ****"

"hart_keith","Null","0","1","31 May 2003"," Fascism, then and now
","I saw this movie only recently on video, while I am spending three months in the USA.. I have been coming here for thirty years and I am a great fan of this mysterious society and its warm people. Lately, I have been disturbed by a discernible shift to autocracy, even brutality in public life at home and abroad. Much of this is justified as the need for security in response to ""terrorism"". We all depend on impersonal society, call it law, bureaucracy, the market or whatever. And the quality of face-to-face interaction with other human beings is still our measure of the standards we set for personal society. The balance between the two is a thin line we tread daily. Personal society can mean feudalism or criminal mafias and no-one wants that, whatever we may think about the tendency of bureaucrats to trample on simple human interests.<br/><br/>The other day I left my wife crying at the airport where her personal goods had been systematically ripped apart by officials claiming to be just following orders. She said she had never been treated that way in the Soviet Union. There is no question that people who travel through US airports these days expose themselves to harassment and humiliating treatment that would have been unthinkable two years ago. All in the name of security, of course. Black young men have suffered much worse from the police for much longer. But it does seem as if American society could be sliding imperceptibly towards instituted inhumanity of a sort we once called fascism. The present government's indifference to law, whether in Iraq, at Guantanamo or in the domestic detention of suspects, and its apparent ability to lie with impunity merely reinforce the impression that we are witnessing something new here or perhaps rather something old that we thought we put behind us after 1945.<br/><br/>These thought were brought to life and made relative by watching The Pianist.  The first half of the movie is harrowing. It shows a decent middle class family shuffling down the slippery slope to destruction by a fascist society that had trained some of its members to behave with the most callous brutality imaginable. At every step, normal people could doubt the plausibility of what was happening to them. By the time they tried to resist, it was too late.  The second half is a chase whose outcome is already known (it wouldn't be a movie if the hero died before the end). This reduces the suspense and contributes to a feeling that the film lasts too long. The main character and his relationships don't develop at all in a protracted sequence marked by historical dates, the Warsaw uprising, the arrival of the Russians and so on. But the movie did provide a useful way of placing disparate phenomena along a continuum we might label 'fascist'.<br/><br/>Could I claim that roughing up the belongings of a French woman with a baby at the airport is analogous to picking eight men out of a line at random and shooting them in the head? My answer was and is Yes. Because Nazism started out with the acquiescence of ordinary people in brutality that escalated imperceptibly over time. And because all nationalisms are implicitly a racist assertion of superiority over foreigners who lack any claim to human rights.The critique has to start with the inhumanity of normal society -- harassed women slapping kids in supermarkets, men in their 50s being thrown on the scrap heap because the terms of trade dictate it, a teenager being strip searched because she fits a drug runner's profile. I think this makes me a liberal, as does the belief that we can't return to the Warsaw ghetto or the Gulag, not that far. Why so?  We are witnessing an attempt to put the lid on a popular uprising that was continuous since 1945 and peaked in the 90s. The resistance is not obvious today because people are fearful about losing more than they think they can afford to. And they are right to be afraid. But I don't think the repressive classes can get away with as much as they did in mid-century. And here I rely on the classic liberal idea, that people know too much these days.<br/><br/>So I wonder what this fine movie provokes in the minds of the audience: that this couldn't happen to us again or that it could, if we forget the history it brings alive for us."

I missed it in the theater, but I don't get to go to the theater often; there isn't any in my town.  I was at my supercenter last week, and when I saw it in there, I just had to buy the DVD.  I went home and watched the whole thing. Adrien Brody's hypnotic performance captivated me for the next 150 minutes. Here we see a successful musician become a sordid shadow of a man, struggling for the basic needs of life. Roman Polanski's incident-prone style kept the film going, and Brody gave a perfect performance.  The scenes of Jewish extermination were raw and emotionless.  One of my favorite scene was where he was carrying bricks and drops some. The German officer was an extra-nice touch. The end wasn't spectacular, but the film really paid off for me.

Terrible and horrifying as the war is you see that not everybody on the wrong side is bad and not everybody on the side of oppressed is a good one. You also see  that in times when there is almost nothing that can keep you going that can give you hope there is something inside to which if we hold very tight it may just allow us to survive and if not that at least to die with dignity. And it is not only dignity given to the holder (the pianist) but also to people that moved by the power of his art are willing to risk their lives to help him survive. And this is real story.

"Donolog","8","0","1","26 May 2003"," Polanski delivers a personal masterpiece, and a masterpiece that is personal
","Disclaimer: Considerable discussion of the plot<br/><br/>There are not many of us who could have our spouse and a number of personal friends visiting murdered by a group of cult members and it not be the biggest personal tragedy of our lives.<br/><br/>Such was the case for Roman Polanski in 1969, when a group of those following cult-leader Charles Manson brutally murdered Polanski's wife Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant with the couple's first child, and a number of the couple's friends at Polanski's Hollywood home (Polanski was travelling at the time).<br/><br/>As tragic, and horrific as this was, it followed an even more troubled childhood. Polanski, and his Jewish parents were living in Poland at the outbreak of World War II. He would ultimately separate from his parents as he escaped the Ghetto to seek refuge with Catholic families in the countryside. Meanwhile, his parents transferred to concentration camps where his mother would meet her death in a gas chamber.<br/><br/>After a career of filmmaking that spans nearly fifty years, Polanski has arguably created his best work ever with The Pianist. The film, a true story, begins at the beginning of World War II as Germany has begun bombing Poland, and follows pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, and his quest to survive his persecution as a Jew under Nazi rule.<br/><br/>The film follows as his rights are stripped away from him and his family. First the family loses its sense of security, then their possessions, then they're forced to move to a ghetto where they live in poverty and terror; ultimately his family and friends are shipped off to concentration camps where we all know they will meet their death. Szpilman however manages to find ways to avoid this, first by staying on to perform slave labour in the dismantling of the newly vacated ghetto, and later by going into hiding in the underground supported by a network of Polish nationals. There is nothing heroic about what he does, he just does what he can to survive, and every step of the way there are many who don't survive.<br/><br/>Polanski's direction of the film is excellent, yet subtle to the end. Messages are not spoon fed to the audience. The pace is borderline slow, yet captivating nonetheless. Because Szpilman manages to escape before being sent to a concentration camp, the film ends up being less about the Holocaust, and more about what happened to its victims before the camps.<br/><br/>The Pianist is the first of two films (The Quiet American being the second) I've seen recently that in their timeliness have added texture to how I view the World and how it deals with Iraq. Early in the film, Szpilman's family take consolation in the fact that Britain and France have declared war against Germany in response to its invasion of Poland. They assume that it will be a matter of weeks before they are emancipated from their newly found oppression. I don't want to get particularly political in a movie review, but the film does do an excellent job of portraying just how much damage can be done by a dictator once he gets going, and that while these may end up as faceless newscasts in on our end, there are real victims on the other end that rely on the rest of the world to oppose the tyranny that affects them."
"vivesi-1","7","0","1","30 May 2003"," Not brilliant and issue-ridden
","First, I don't believe in praising people for anything who refuse to face their criminal actions. What if Timothy McVeigh had made a good movie? The scale of the crime is different but the principle is the same. What if the guy who kidnapped Elizabeth Smart turned out to be this really cool dude with an artistic vision? Would Hollywood give either of these people a standing ovation at the Oscars? What if Polanski had violated one of their 13 year-old children? I think the outcome would have been a bit different. (For you kids who came along late in the game--The victim was 13 and Polanski raped her and fled to Europe to escape punishment. France would be the country that lets him live freely as a fugitive from justice, if you hadn't guessed that already.)<br/><br/>But the movie itself angers me as well. Critics, paid and not, have praised everything about this movie--its honesty, artistry, acting, etc. Sure, it's a technically fine movie. Smarter critics have noted that it isn't a predictable ""triuph of human spirit"". It is wholly observational as some have mentioned. But the underlying premise of this movie is unbearable and could only be made by a man like Polanski, who thinks that art erases crime. The premise is that the artist must be spared no matter what, even if he doesn't want to be. Good, decent people must die, kind of like sacrifices, for the greater artist who must live live live, no matter what kind of person they are. Only Hollywood would applaud this diabolical level of narcissism. Ethical human beings, artists and others, would not. If Polanski were honest and upstanding he would have made a movie about a film director coincidentally spared in the Holocaust who tragically lost his wife and unborn child and then went on to drug and rape a thirteen year old girl (a passion he continued unhindered in Europe. Just ask Kinski.) Let's see the child molestation film, Polanski. (That people *thank* him on this site is truly bewildering. I hope you don't plan to introduce him to your adolescent daughters.)<br/><br/>This movie is also a big flip-off to the US (why not Germany? why not make this film in Polish or French? It was aimed like a warhead to the US.) Polanski seems to snicker to himself at our gullibility, at our reliable tendency to confuse the appreciation of art with establishing our own identities. You are what you like in America. And Polanski cleverly capitalizes on this national identity crisis. There are the people who trip over themselves to stutter about their favorite artists, and they use the word ""artist"" as an insult to the less informed. Those people generally love Polanski. And he knows it. Here is the movie to prove it.<br/><br/>Completely without reference to its creator, ""The Pianist"" is only a pretty good movie. You know the story and you've more or less seen the scenes and heard the dialogue in other movies. There is nothing new here in writing or direction. It is well acted (Brody was just fine)and stark enough with enough shocking scenes to elucidate a little of the terror of the Holocaust. I have, however, seen more gripping scenes about the same subject (see: The Grey Zone, among others). ""The Pianist"" doesn't have smooth edges (the other reason it's gotten so much acclaim. I'm surprised there's not some Indie formula now to rough up the edges of movies. Hint hint--don't be neat. Leave your movie's shoes untied.) But overall, this movie is not a great accomplishment. Polanski should have the courage to tell his own story and face its consequences in the real world instead of pandering to actors and the US indie crowd. He is a coward and a criminal and we should view his movies through that lens. Polanski is trying to tell us something with this movie, but I don't think what he's trying to say is honorable."

","It seems that the apologies still have to go on. Call me a fascist but haven't there been enough holocaust movies that have done everything in the genre possible. This film takes one step backwards. The main character is not even a character. He is a non-active ""participant"" in a series of sketches showing how horrible the nazis were. Summary executions etc. all shown in scenes which provide nothing to the story and do not move the film along in any way whatsoever. <br/><br/>It seems that Polanski wanted to finish the book on nazi nastiness. Well, he succeeded. However, a good film this does not make. Having virtually every scene fade to black shows the lack of continuity and story in this movie. The protagonist is not a protagonist. He does nothing throughout and those around him are of little interest. There are no other proper characters and his ""character"" as I said before doesn't count. <br/><br/>I heard the book was great and went to see the film thinking that this guy was active in his own survival, somehow playing music for nazis and avoiding the gas chamber. That is not the story and what is presented is a little more than the straw that broke the camel's back in this type of film. There is nothing new, no story, no great characterisations and there is little that holds the viewer, except their unconscious or worse still, conscious guilt. The SFX are pretty cheap and it's overlong. <br/><br/>The best bit is the end, when he plays the piano for a long period over the titles. This is a clever gimmick as it means that you can't leave the cinema before the piece ends or you may seem to appear not truly affected by the ""weightiness"" of the subject. This film will bore you if you are not either, jewish, polish, or easily pleased when it comes to ""worthy"" material. Oh, also if you have no idea what film is about. Hopefully good film is about story. This is a non-story. 5 out of 10."

Common to those movies is humanity under outrageous rampage and tragedy. From ""The Pianist"", two things came into my mind. 1) Why the pianist could survive? Not only he was lucky, but because he was loved, or there were many people who thought this pianist should be saved.<br/><br/>2) The gap between his starvation and music. Most of the time he was caught to seek something eatable. He was like an animal.

","When I went ot see this film before the nominations of the academy awards were announced, I was amazed. After I walked out of the Theater, I said to myself right away. The Pianist is going to win it all at the academy awards. Well about a month or two later, the academy awards give Adrien Brody the award for best actor (which he deserved!) and gave Roman Polanski the best director's award. I really thought The Pianist was going to win best motion picture. But the film I thought was going to win it before i saw The Pianist beat it out. But I was really happy for Adrien Brody, who hasen't gotten noticed until now, which is a bit sad. Even though it was a very tragic film, I had to see Adrien's brilliant performance one more time."
"nick suess","10","0","1","2 May 2003"," An unforgettable story of humanity and survival.
","I sometimes look at what are the essential elements of evaluation of a film, and wonder whether the finer debatable points of cinematographical art can be totally divorced from the overall impact that the movie has on the viewer. ""The Pianist"" had such a massive impact on me that I could not score it at anything less than 10/10, and view with some bemusement the comments of the ""spoilers"", wondering whether they watched the same version as I did. OK, we don't all have to agree to agree, but who are these people who are so absorbed in dissecting the minutiae of the `art' that they don't actually take in what is before their eyes.<br/><br/>Now, I confess to some bias. I am the son of a holocaust survivor, who himself narrowly avoided boarding the train to a death camp. He is now 85, and I hope he may live to 100 and beyond, but as the generation who can remember those horrors is rapidly passing from us, we are increasingly aware of the global growth of the holocaust denial industry and its exploitation of both the dwindling number of surviving eye-witnesses and the apparently growing number of people so obsessed with their lives of 21st century consumerism that they simply don't want to know. So I consider we are fully justified in the assertion that anyone bleating out ""not another holocaust movie"" is lending support to that vile camp. It's a story that needs telling and re-telling over and over again. Let it never be forgotten by any future generation.<br/><br/>And an eye-witness account is precisely what ""The Pianist"" is. Wladyslaw Szpilman wrote his memoir ""Death of a City"" back in 1946 while it was all fresh in his mind, and the view we had was every bit as fresh and therefore as mind-numbing in its horror as if we were living through it ourselves. That is the director's art. That is the actor's skill. That is why they both received well-deserved Oscars. Szpilman didn't view himself as a hero, and Brody portrayed with great finesse his guilt at not being there across the wall in the uprising. There have been plenty of great movies portraying that event from inside the wall, but Szpilman was outside, and we saw his agonising difficulty in coming to terms with his survival when all around him was cruel and pointless death. His reaction to the incident when a number of his group of workers were randomly called out of line and cold-bloodedly murdered (let's not use the word ""executed"", which conveys some notion of legitimacy to the act) is reminiscent of that of Pierre Bezukhov in ""War and Peace"" when he is spared the firing squad simply because when it came to his turn in line the French officer had just got too bored with summary ""executions"" of ""incendiaries"" amongst the Russian civilians.<br/><br/>I haven't read Szpilman's book, but I am assuming the movie remains true to his account of events. So if people sitting in comfortable 21st century cinemas find it lacks action, or fails to cater to their minimal attention span, being slow and long, well that's tough, because that's how it was. Look at this comment ""the length and editing of this movie made me feel as if I'd actually been living for five years during WWII"". Yes, you got it, mate! A long slow occupation during a long slow war. A long time to sit it out and try and survive. A long time to focus on getting through each day with the sole goal of miraculously finding yourself alive at the end of it.<br/><br/>One of the detractors even hit upon this to rubbish it ""All Germans speak GermanÂ… and all Jews speak English."" Oh, this guy is so sharp! He's failed to pick the obvious code that when people were supposedly speaking Polish, they delivered their lines in English, for the obvious benefit of an Anglophone audience, and whenever German was being spoken, that was what we heard. So whenever the Poles were coping with a  foreign language, so were we English speakers, but at least we had the benefit of subtitles. OK, so this commentator is a German thinking the movie is terribly unfair to his nation. Well, sorry pal, your folk weren't all entirely nice sweet boys during the first half of last century, so please try and get your mind round that idea and you might ultimately benefit from it!<br/><br/>The Warsaw ghetto was possibly the most controlled exercise ever in the extermination of a population, but as the Polish people soon found to their great cost, as Slavs they too were considered ""Untermenschen"" and they were just the next in line after the Jews, with the destruction of their city in the creation of eastern European ""Lebensraum"" for the Aryan master race being all part of the plan. We saw their partisans being cut down too by bullets, and the woman shot in the back who curled up in death into a kneeling position almost of prayer became a strong visual icon in the latter phase of  the film. So it ain't just about Jews. It's about one man's agonising journey of survival against all the odds. Not a man who sets himself out as great or special in any way beyond his outstanding musical talent. Just a human being. That's it.<br/><br/>I repeat, 10/10, an unforgettable experience."

","I just saw this movie last night. I was amazed, moved and touched, especially by Adrien Brody's performance, which was nothing short of flawless. The whole direction the movie takes and the truthfulness with wich Polansky tackles some of the most jarring events is amazing. Polansky doesn't want us to shed a pool of tears, he keeps the flow of events swift, doesn't dwadle on any particular scene where the atrocities of war are being shown. As a result, we don't get lost in the melodramatic aspect of war. This is instead, a survival story, and one told from the point of view of a very charismatic person. <br/><br/>Adrien Brody is simply superb in his role as Wladek Szpielman, his performance is one I will quite possibly never be able to erase from my memory. I was taken by his character from the get-go, especially by the sweetness of his personality, his frankness and simple humanity. People were drawn to him immediately, and would risk their safety to help him. I am not a religious person by any means, but just before the movie ended I found myself thinking, not without a tinge of shame, of the biblical phrase ""The meek shall inherit the earth"". Wladek survived. He lived on because his only eartly passion was for his music, and this was enough to see him through genocide and live on to be 88. He never let himself be consumed with hatred or anger. There's something we can all take from that.<br/><br/>NK"

I bet many Americans would do so in spite of all the superheroes like Batman,  Spiderman, Superman...What about Annie Frank? She's hiding as well! Though she was caught and was sent to the gas chamber at the end, but that doesn't even the fact that she, like Szpilman, was cheating death through hiding. This movie is not Schindler's List 2, so why should you expect the character to save the day? If you can't deny that if you were in that situation, you would have done exactly the same, why should you complain some other people doing so? The character was only a human! If you are unhappy about him not saving people or fighting against the Germans, what about Chopin? He didn't really fight as well! He fight through his music, so what's the big deal? This is a story of how to survive, not about some kind of heroism! If you can't stand seeing films about ordinary people struggling in unordinary times, please go to another cinema and watch ""Daredevil"" or something like that.

","The story of the Holocaust is one that  needs to be told and retold. Tragically, it could happen again, to another group of people, to us or to our children.  History too often repeats itself...<br/><br/>For me, ""The Pianist"" is one of the most moving and powerful films of my lifetime.  Each person brings to a film a different life experience.  I have been to Warsaw and seen the ghetto; I have been to Auschwitz.  I will never  forget the sadness I felt.  It had to be a horrifying and hopeless time for Polish Jews, and for those few who were able to survive the Nazi occupation.  The story of Wladyslaw Szpilman mesmerized me; I was close to tears throughout much of the film.<br/><br/>Polanski's filming of Szpilman's story is honest and unsentimental.  All aspects of the film, especially the music of Chopin, add brilliantly to the whole.  The actors are well-chosen - family members, friends, strangers who helped.  Thomas Kretschmann as the German officer is perfect.<br/><br/>Yet it is Adrien Brody's performance that triumph's in ""The Pianist"". He portrays Szpilman as a man of many layers and moods - first smug and self-satisfied, next mystified and unwilling and unbelieving, finally strunggling to help his family survive.  When he is cut off from those he loves, his music, his life, Brody is especially powerful.  He shows us Szpilman's hopelessness, boredom, frustration, longing, fear, his desperate will to survive.  I could not keep my eyes off his expressive eyes (and eyebrows). I will always cherish this compelling film depicting both our humanity and our inhumanity.  I was ecstatic when a surprised Adrien Brody won Best Actor at the Oscars.  Roman Polanski's well-earned win was also deserved.  And for me, it WAS the best film of 2002.

","The Warsaw Ghetto: Historical Background<br/><br/>When World War II broke out on September 1st, 1939, the Polish capital of Warsaw was one of Germany's first targets: the Luftwaffe bombed the city intensively for a fortnight, and then troops laid siege. Despite courageous resistance attempts, electricity outages and water and food shortages forced the residents to capitulate on September 27th. The Germans marched into Warsaw on October 1st. Of Poland's 3.5 million Jews, 360,000 - artisans, traders, workers, and professional people - lived in Warsaw, representing roughly one-third of the capital's total population. Following their occupation of Poland, the Germans used SS Police and Gestapo to set out on a deliberate and brutal course of subjecting the Jewish population to degradation, deprivation, starvation, confiscation of their homes, funds, and property, and random killings, leading to their total annihilation - ""the final solution,"" as it was named by the Nazis. By December 1st, they were ordered to wear white armbands with a blue Star of David. Conscripted into labor squads, the Jews were forbidden to use public transportation and parks, to sit on benches, or to walk on the sidewalks. As all of the Jews in the region were forced in, the Ghetto population swelled to nearly 500,000 by November 15th, 1940, when the designated ""Jewish District"" was walled in with bricks. 100,000 Jews soon died, whether from famine and epidemics or from being shot dead at the whims of the SS Police and Gestapo. But the Ghetto inhabitants strove for a degree of normalcy even under such horrible conditions. Schooling efforts continued. Clandestine political and cultural activities were held. In July 1942, mass deportations began. Nearly 310,000 Jews were evicted from the Ghetto and loaded onto cattle cars, sent to the Treblinka extermination camp. The executions touched off an insurrection in the Warsaw Ghetto on April 19th, 1943. The revolt was led by Mordechai Anielewicz, from his bunker at Mila 18, and backed by the remaining 40,000 Jews - only 200 of whom were armed. SS troops, under the command of the infamous Gruppenfuehrer Jurgen Stroop, used tanks and artillery to put down the revolt. 7,000 Jews died during the fighting, which also claimed many Nazis. The standoff still lasted until May 16th. Anielewicz and his core group committed suicide. A few Jewish fighters, including Marek Edelman, managed to escape. The remaining 30,000-plus survivors were either executed on the spot or sent to the gas chambers. The entire Ghetto was razed. When the Germans were forced to retreat from Warsaw in January 1945, there were only about 20 Jews left alive in the city. One was Wladyslaw Szpilman.<br/><br/>
About Wladyslaw Szpilman<br/><br/>
Wladyslaw Szpilman (1911-2000) [pronounced ""Vuadysuav Shpilman""; also addressed as Wladek (""Vuadek"") Szpilman] was born in Sosnowiec, in Poland. As a young boy, he studied piano with Josef Smidowicz and Alexander Michalowski, themselves students of Franz Liszt. In 1931, he left for Berlin and continued his studies at the Academy of Music, under the direction of Leonid Kreutzer; and the Academy of Arts, under Arthur Schnabel and Franz Schreker. During these years, he composed a 'Concerto for Violin'; his Suite for piano 'Zycle maszyn' (""Life of Machines""); numerous pieces for piano and orchestra; film scores; and popular songs that brought him celebrity in his homeland. At the age of 27, Szpilman had established himself as one of Poland's foremost composers and concert pianists when Poland was attacked. In 1935, Szpilman was hired at the Polish state radio station of Warsaw. He was performing live on the airwaves, playing Chopin's 'Nocturne in C# [C sharp] Minor,' when the Luftwaffe dive-bombed the station on September 23rd, 1939. As Jews, Szpilman and his family (parents, brother Henryk, and sisters Halina and Regina) were soon evicted from their apartment and herded, with several hundred thousand others, into the Warsaw Ghetto. There, Szpilman scraped by, playing piano in the bars where black marketeers and collaborators gathered. On August 16th, 1942, it was one such Jewish collaborator, Itzak Heller, who stopped Szpilman from boarding the train that took his entire family to their death in the camps. Szpilman remained behind in Warsaw. Aided by an ad hoc network of pre-war acquaintances (such as his friend Dorota) resistance fighters (like Janina), and - most surprisingly - a German officer (Captain Wilm Hosenfeld), Szpilman survived the war. Warsaw was liberated in January 1945. Szpilman immediately wrote his memoirs, Death of a City, recounting his incredible but true experiences amidst torment. In a detached tone, his authentic account told of life in the Ghetto and of the victims and torturers in that singular world. The book was published in Poland in 1946 - but was then banned and suppressed by the Communist authorities. Polish radio started up again, fittingly, with Szpilman performing the Chopin piece that had been so violently interrupted six years earlier. He was named musical director of the state radio station. He also resumed his career as a pianist, playing in concerts and solo performances in Europe and America. He performed all over the world in piano duet with Bronislav Gimpel (with whom he also founded the Warsaw Piano Quintet). Szpilman also began composing music again. Many of his 300-plus songs became popular standards in Polish culture. The songs he wrote for children in the '50s earned him a 1955 prize from the Polish Composers Union. He later applied his composing talents to create ballets and classical pieces for younger audiences. In 1961, he founded the International Festival of Song at Sopot for the Union of Popular Song Writers in Poland. In 1964, he was elected member of the Academy of Polish Composers. He retired from concert performances in 1986, but continued composing. He resided in Warsaw for his entire life. In 1999, Szpilman's son Andrzej, whose father had never spoken about the war years (not uncommon among that generation of fathers and sons), arranged for the book to be published in Germany. The new edition incorporated wartime extracts from the diary of Captain Hosenfeld, who died in a Russian POW camp in 1952. The response to the book led to a worldwide translation and publication as The Pianist: The Extraordinary True Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw, 1939-1945, generating international attention and acclaim. Roman Polanski, who had already met Szpilman twice years before, committed to make a film version of The Pianist. At their third meeting, in early 2000, Szpilman expressed his pleasure that the book was to be brought to the screen by a compatriot. Wladyslaw Szpilman passed away on July 6th, 2000, at the age of 88, a few months before filming of THE PIANIST began. He is survived by his wife Halina and sons Krzysztof and Andrzej.<br/><br/>Source: the pianist production notes."

The editing depended heavily on close attention to detail and scene, as Polanski is certainly not given to fast editing (thankfully); however, the presence of several spurious scenes ultimately led me to feel tired upon completion of the film.

","The Pianist is simply horrific, in the sense that it is filled with horror, and not much else. Like Saving Private Ryan and most other recent movies in the Holocaust/WWII genre, the violence is spectacularly well done.<br/><br/>The scene where the Nazis throw an old man in a wheel chair out of a window is as gut-wrenching as any you'll ever see, as are the numerous summary executions and a scene where a tank fires into Brody's building.<br/><br/>But so what?<br/><br/>Adrian Brody is an anti-character. He projects zero presence, says nothing of any interest, and practically does nothing for the entire movie. Its as if Polanski was out looking for a story set with the Holocaust as backdrop and gave up, giving us a look at an uninteresting human being who essentially does nothing while great events unfold around him.<br/><br/>And while the visual panorama is spectacular, not even the music is well done. One would tend to expect to hear a lot of music in a movie about one of the better pianists of the twentieth century. Instead, we hear very little, and then only at the beginning and at the end, where it is inserted awkwardly. The camera centers mostly on Brody's fingers (if Brody is indeed playing), as if purposely to deny any connection between the Chopin and what's going on outside - a silly aim to say the least."

","Nominated for seven Academy Awards and winner of three, Roman Polanski's The Pianist is deserving in two of those three. Polanski's directing is superb, clearly the work of a master, and Ronald Harwood's screenplay is deeply moving and shocking. However, Adrien Brody should not have won, considering he was against Jack Nicholson in one of his greatest acting showcases, About Schmidt. I'll get into that later.<br/><br/>Brody is Wladyslaw Szpilman. He's a pianist for Polish radio and he's Jewish. Being Jewish isn't exactly the greatest thing to be in Warsaw in the height of World War II, so him and his family has to move to a ghetto. However, his family is taken away, and the ghetto is destroyed, so Szpilman has to survive in the world with the help of others.<br/><br/>The Pianist is touching and well thought out, with powerful moments throughout. It really makes us look at what we take for granted, and realize how lucky we are. Szpilman had to struggle just to get water to survive, yet we complain on when we have water out of the tap instead of `purified' spring water. Anyone in a luxury life should really check this movie out.<br/><br/>It basically was a one-man show, and Brody could have been a lot better, since he basically was the movie. Although I see how he was nominated, because this role was a taxing one, I don't really see how anyone could consider this role the best acting job of the year. Clearly, Jack should have won.<br/><br/>The cinematography was also superb. One shot I particularly liked is when Szpilman was walking through the completely destroyed city and a giant pan shot moving backwards. It was totally effective and I felt drawn in. It made me feel even more sorry for everything that happened there. I wish I had something more to say about The Pianist, besides that it's a harrowing two-and-a-half hours that affects you deeply.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and brief strong language."

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","1","12 April 2003"," Pianist hits the right notes for me
","In May 1991, I was invited to give a lecture in Warsaw and took the opportunity of my time there to visit the wartime locations of the Warsaw Jewish ghetto, the station from which the Jews were deported to the concentration camps and the final assault of the 1943 Jewish Uprising as well as a monument to the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. That wet Sunday, I found it all hard to internalise, but now Roman Polanski has directed a compelling film in which all these events and locations are brought to life all too realistically and vividly. Polanski himself was a child in the Krakow ghetto and lost his mother to the camps, so this is an intensely personal and painful work that has taken many decades for him to address on film.<br/><br/>All too easily, films about the Holocaust can overwhelm the senses with the sheer, incomprehensible scale of this modern-day barbarity, but Polanski gives an individual dimension to the account by telling the amazing, but true, story of the famed Polish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman, portrayed brilliantly by relative unknown Adrien Brody. Equally such films frequently present a stereotypical view of good and evil, yet here writer Ronald Harwood manages to depict - sometimes even in the same character - both cruelty and kindness by Jews, gentiles and even Germans. Ultimately what could so easily have been a depressing return to familiar if important territory becomes a work of affirmation and redemption."

His performance has to be one of the best ever captured on film. You are just there with him in his tortured existence hiding from the Nazis. This movie captures all of it -  the claustrophobia of the walled commune, the desolate, terrifying railway stations and the desperate rebellion of the Poles against the Nazis when they held out for so long. Nothing is banging you over the head, it is all laid out so beautifully - the elegant middle class existence before the Nazis, then the harrowing work (if you were lucky), the cruelties, the hell that was Warsaw then. Roman Polanski has made a masterpiece and Adrien Brody is truly gifted and one to be watched. Extraordinary. 9 out of 10."

","Brilliant film - in my opinion Polanski's greatest, or at least one of them. Polanski is not afraid to use frightening or graphic images to send a message that should touch anyone's heart: the world has made a mistake. It is time to correct that mistake.<br/><br/>Brody's performance in the title role is deeply moving.  He is extremely well-cast, and carries a good part of the movie on his own, or nearly so. The integration of the German soldier is well-wrought and unexpected despite a persistent, terrible sense that the pianist's ""luck"" cannot hold out.<br/><br/>Ten out of ten to this film; it is as near flawless as it is possible to be."
"jedsalazar","10","0","1","3 April 2003"," A beautiful symphony of emotion....
","I will begin this review by stating that the weekend I viewed the film was a classic fest. Films like Amadeus, Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, and 2001 could have easily rendered this film much less than it was. What I experienced at the theatre was a raw appreciation.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody lays the bricks of the road to greatness. The unknown actor has amazed us all, in this inspiring snapshot of the human spirit. The emotion given in this role has surpassed many of the greatest films of time. I think we all expected an emphasis on the combination of beautiful music and an undistinguished script. Brody applies a rare performance that demonstrates the possibility of perfection. A rare illustration of flawlessness.<br/><br/>
Unfairly, from the opening credits I was comparing the film to Schindler's List. The two films shine in their own rare illumination. I knew not what to expect from The Pianist, and still I was overjoyed with the ending result. Something to emphasize that we have not forgotten, and memories don't die. This is film. This is brilliance, craftsmanship, creativity, and virtuosity. Another reminiscence, of the decay that lurks in the human soul and the divinity of overcoming these evils.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I felt my emotions piercing during the atrocious imprisonment, and segregation of human beings. This era challenges my beliefs in human decency. To have lived to see such a time when abominations were carried out negligently intoxicates me that times are past. Yes, this is all leading up to the fact that the film caused me to involuntarily cry. I wasn't weeping, but I noticed a tear during one scene (which will remain disclosed).<br/><br/>If you have ever wanted to celebrate the generosity, sympathy, charity, and tenderness of the human soul, see this film. The most important time in history. The allowance of the celebration of individuality, uniqueness, and humanity. We could all use this film at a time of counterfeit reasons for innocent bloodshed in this war of arrogance."

You can almost feel the dust of the demolished city, the cold of the snow, and the hunger of the sequestered Jews in a constant search for food.

Instead of showing platoons suffering in the battlefield, this film shows a lonely man lost in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, occupied by the Nazis for the six years of war.<br/><br/>The direction is breathtaking.

","Exceptionally well made with a wonderful, under-stated central performance, the film is let down only by one scene near the end in which survivors of the concentration camp are seen haranguing captured German soldiers. The portrayal of starving, emaciated human beings is always a problem and this film is no exception - everyone looks just too well fed. The fact that a stodgy, tasteless musical like 'Chicago' won the Oscar for Best film over 'The Pianist' is beyond comprehension."

","Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is an absolute masterpiece.  There's really no way to describe it without writing pages, but there's a reason it's currently at #45 on imdb's top 100 films ever (and climbing).  As a film student, I must say that this is probably the most brilliant direction job in the past two decades...Polanski's absolutely masterful sense of timing, his ingenious attention to detail, his passion, and his care for the actor's craft shines through to the end of this film--every color, every grain, every outfit, every face, every camera shot is an artwork, creating a film experience like few others.  This movie also has an incredible combination of joyous scenes, horridly disturbing scenes, and scenes that are so powerful and beautifully-realized that it's hard to take--I've seen many films in my days, and I've cried during about ten of them--usually just teary eyes though.  During this film tears were uncontrollably streaming down my face, and I sat in the theater, simply in shock at what an experience this film is.  Afterwards, on the trip home with a group of friends, none of us talked once for the mile walk.  Once getting home, I was so profoundly moved and had so many thoughts and feelings I couldn't read, watch TV, anything...it all seemed so unimportant and trivial.  I was rooting for Almodovar at the Academy Awards for his amazing job on ""Hable Con Ella,"" but I had not yet seen the Pianist--all I have to say is that it deserved to sweep every category of nomination.  Brody absolutely, without a doubt deserved his award (his performance was one of the best, most precise, most accurate, and most heart-felt I've ever had the pleasure of watching), and it also deserved the Best Screenplay award.  But I have a feeling that not even the Academy, notorious for it's payoffs and balanced out voting tactics, could let the show end without Polanski winning Best Director.  The fact that ""Chicago"" won for Best Picture is a travesty, and I really don't know how that cast got up there and accepted that award, knowing how ridiculous their victory was...but that's the multi-million dollar politics of the Academy Awards.  Anyway, I'm rambling, but EVERYONE must see this film--will go down in history as one of Polanski's best, Brody's best, and as one of the greatest cinema accomplishments of all time."

Roman Polanski is back at what he does best and Adrien Brody was beautiful. His subtle performance brought life to a role that many actors strive to achieve. His academy award was much deserved. The story of a man that started with every thing and lost every thing was very inspiring. Unlike other Holocaust films, the entire process of what the Jews went through was portrayed. You saw a man that had every thing, a good life with his family and soon it was all stripped away. Its inspiring to anyone who thinks they have it bad!

","spoilers herein<br/><br/>When signs of trouble start to show, nobody had any idea the devastation when it's all over. Events follow one after another, and each time you think that something terrible has happened, something soon follows that makes what happened before completely insignificant, as you are propelled towards a nihilistic world you didn't believe would exist.<br/><br/>At the beginning, together with your very close family, you argue over how to hide the extra money that you are no longer allowed to keep under the German occupation. Then, humiliating regulations are imposed that Jews must wear identifying arm badges. You fiery brother vows that he will not obey, as you all take comfort that Britain and France are declaring war on Germany. But then, more atrocity follows as Germans start to rough up and insult Jews on the streets. Before long, your family is out of money and how to make a living becomes a serious concern.<br/><br/>You are wondering how much worse things can get when the shock comes: all 360,000 Jews in Warsaw will be moved to a ghetto area. The familiar and still affluent surrounding is, all of a sudden, lost. As you and your family try to comfort yourselves that your new ""home"" is not too terribly crammed, you discover that they are building a wall around the entire ghetto. You're now all prisoners.<br/><br/>Life in the ghetto becomes a constant struggle against starvation, as you see people around you breaking down - losing theit sanity, crawling on the ground to suck up spilled food - as the Germans get more wicked. Then, one night, the cold, hard reality finally sinks in, when you witness in the apartment across the street soldiers throwing an old man, still in the wheelchair to which he is confined, into a hedious death in the street below. Everybody else in that same apartment is then chased into the street and shot down, running. This the the beginning of the nightmare.<br/><br/>You try to hang on, you and your beloved family. Enduring humiliation, you get your hot tempered brother out of trouble. You try to get your family working permits which you hope will save your all when the cruel day comes. But the iron, cold grip of reality is there, has always been. You're all finally rounded up, with many others, to wait for the death train. In the last minute, a friend saves you, only to see your family all packed onto the train, like a herd to be slaughtered.<br/><br/>Life seems to have lost its meaning but you, all alone, hang on in the work camp. Nothing would happen for a day and then in the next, you see your friends pulled out randomly, ordered to lie face down on the ground, and shot. You wonder why they just lie there doing nothing, waiting for death, and you ask yourself if that's what you would do too if it happens to you. In the depth of your heart and soul, you do understand that some of them have been completely numbed by the atrocity (now you grasp the full meaning of the word) around them, and have lost their will to live.<br/><br/>You have not lost yours. With help from your friends, a German couple fellow-artists, you escape and hide in an apartment. But soon, they are found out, and you know they will be killed. But you don't have time for remorse because you too have been found out. Cold, exhausted, starved, you found help again. More hiding and isolation. You feel completely helpless, like a small child who has to depend on someone to feed you. For safety, you are locked inside the apartment, can't even go out. When your friends do not show up for two weeks, you finally understand that when you are reduced to this state of bare existance, there is only one thing on your mind: survival. You cling onto this one single thought when you are delirious with illness.<br/><br/>The Allies are fighting back and winning but can you survive to victory? When local resistance strikes back, the Germans bring in tanks. You are closests to panic when shells pound on your building. The door is locked from outside and you have no escape. A shell, while half-stunning you, opens an escape route. In a half-stunned, half-delirious state, you hide in a deserted, a quagmire of a hospital, searching for every scrap of food. German fire-throwers soon flush you out. Climbing over the wall in the backyard, you find in front of you, as far as the eyes can see, the city in complete ruins, reeking decay.<br/><br/>The last stage of your ordeal is hiding in an attic of the ruins. You are down to the most primitave state of existance. You don't know why you are stil hanging on, but you are. Then, help comes unexpectedly from a German officer who, while recognising you as a Jew, has his curiosity aroused by your claiming to be a pianist by profession. In the half-ruined house you play, as ordered, a piano that luckily has escaped destruction. You are exhausted to the edge of collapse. Your fingers are freezing and rigid. Sitting in front of the piano, you tentatively touch the keys, like a student. Then, you move along more confidently. As the music feeds you and you feed back into the music, you feel life surging in you and you feel like you are back in the familiar studio in the Warsaw radio station once more. Music and life come together again and maybe that is the reason why you have hung on for so long, against every adversity.<br/><br/>When you are finally rescued, you are wearing a German army coat given to you by the kind officer, and nearly got shot because of that. When you rescuers ask you why, you're answer is the only one that makes any sense: ""I'm cold"".<br/><br/>You survived, to become a better and wiser person? Maybe. There is something you have definitely learned: what a war is really like.<br/><br/>

"mhasheider","10","0","1","29 March 2003"," Roman Polanski is back in true form.
","If there was one person who survived the Holocaust and several years later, he/she was willing enough to bring their tale of survival to the big screen. Director Roman Polanski (""Chinatown"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Tess"") may be one of those brave individuals who might fit the billing and in his latest film - ""The Pianist"" couldn't have come out in dangerous times like now.<br/><br/>The story is based on the life (and memoir) of the late Wladyslaw Spzilman, who lived with his parents and siblings in Warsaw, Poland in 1939, the year that Nazi Germany started to make their horrifying invasion of their unsuspecting European neighbors. Wladyslaw makes his living as a pianist and is performing for a Polish radio when he's interrupted by bomb blasts. For that point, Spzilman and the other Jews who lived in Europe at the time that German onslaught began, their lives would never be the same again. By telling Spzilman's story here, Polanski finally gets the chance to tell his own story as well.<br/><br/>Adrien Brody, who recently won the Best Actor Oscar for his mesmerizing and unforgettable portrayal of the musician is flat out incredible. Brody plays his character like you wouldn't expect in any Polanski movie yet you're left wondering how does Wladyslaw manage to avoid being caught by the SS or death itself? If I were like the main character here, trying to survive in an occupied city and stay out of sight isn't only impossible, but a true testament of the human heart.<br/><br/>The best scene in ""The Pianist"" are saved for the second half of the movie. Since Spzilman has been separated from his family and has been living on the lam with some help from unlikely sources. One of them is a sympatheic German captain, Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretchmann), who is kind enough to let Wladyslaw play the piano and Hosenfeld returns the favor by giving what appeared to be German chocolate and a loaf of bread. While Spzilman isn't only performing in front of the captain, he's also entertaining the other German soldiers to think about besides being chased by the Red Army.<br/><br/>Once I left the theater in Madison where I saw the film, it made me think twice before even looking at a piano again. Plus, ""The Pianist"" is one of those rare movies that wants the viewer to feel satisfied and look at life itself instead taking it for granted. I can't finish this review by applauding the Academy's decision not only to give Brody an Oscar, but to Polanski (Best Director) and screenwriter Ronald Harwood (Best Screenplay from another material) yet it didn't earn the Best Picture award sad to say. This movie when it comes out on video and DVD should serve as a wise choice for educating students of any level either in history or music."

","The Pianist, starring Academy Award winning best actor Adrien Brody, was one of the best films I have ever seen.  Directed by Roman Polanski, was based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a World War II-era Polish pianist who lived in the Warsaw ghettos during Nazi rule.<br/><br/>There were so many great aspects of this film.  I can honestly say that I think that Adrien Brody deserved his Best Actor Award.  His character changed looks, actions, and emotions throughout the whole film, yet he was still believable.  I literally felt sick when Spzilman was sick, and felt anguish when he did.  There was almost an hour of the film that Spzilman does not say anything, this did not bother me at all.  His acting was done through his body language, facial expressions, and his eyes.    Usually a film that focuses on one main character gets boring or tiresome.  Not true with this movie- I sat through the over-2 hour long movie without once having to look at my watch.<br/><br/>The movie was also beautifully done.  The colors of the movie match the mood of the characters.  After Spzilman is in hiding for a while and both depressed and starving, the colors of the film become mainly shades of greys, with few bright colors.  The scenes showing the destroyed towns were absolutely amazing, both beautiful and melancholy at the same time.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the film was another great aspect.  I play piano, which may have helped spark my interest in the soundtrack, but Spzilman's playing never seemed boring or drawn-out to me.  Instead, the beautiful playing that inspired him to survive helped make the movie the masterpiece that it is."

","I will admit that when Adrien Brody won the Oscar last weekend, his speech was so moving and genuine that I was immediately drawn to wanting to see the film, and I'm glad I waited until after the awards to see it for the first time. The depth of his performance is absolute madness. Everything that happens to him in this film shows the genuine triumph of the human spirit. His love for playing the piano is what keeps him alive when everything around him is destroyed, and his music was the only thing that remained constant in his life. The fact that this film was directed by Roman Polanski is the best part. A fellow Holocaust survivor, what Polanski survived came across every frame of this film. Simply put, no one else could have directed the film. However, the film is one word: DISTURBING. It moves at a good pace, never drags and in one scene, (no spoilers) Brody truly realizes exactly how close he has been to death. Not hesitating, this is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen."

","Often, holocaust films, or literature, produce a type of numbness in me.  Of course it was horrible, unimaginably so.  If I had been in the right place at the right time, I would have gladly wrung Hitler's neck.  But it's over, there is nothing I can do to reverse it, so my mind just seems to shut down about the whole thing.<br/><br/>But this film is different.  The portrayal of one intelligent and sensitive person's efforts to survive the Nazi occupation of his country is absolutely riveting.  I completely agree with the commentator who said that despite the fact that Chicago, with all its jazz, won the Oscar, this was the best film of the year.<br/><br/>One of the finest and most ironic features of it comes at the end, when Szpilman probably owes his survival to the actions of a sympathetic and humane German officer.  The point seems to be that, even as evil can arise from anywhere, so can goodness.  Run, do not walk, to your neighbourhood cinema to see `The Pianist""."
"Sweeper887","Null","0","1","23 March 2003"," THE Best Picture of the year (even if Chicago got the Oscar)
","The true story of the brilliant pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, witnesses the restrictions Nazis place on Jews in the Polish capital, from wearing stars of David on their arms to restricted access to anywhere outside the Warsaw ghetto. As his family is rounded up to be shipped off to the Nazi labor camps, he escapes deportation and eludes capture by living in the ruins of Warsaw.<br/><br/> You would think that Schindler's List would be the end-all of Holocaust films, but then I would say you're wrong.  The film retells the horrors that the Polish Jews went through during WWII, and more specifically, of one family and one central character from that family.  It is an incredible tale of survival and coming to grips with the most horrible truth imaginable - you're living in Hell imagined on Earth.  The fact that the audience is not shielded from the horrors that occurred within the Warsaw Ghetto and experiences what Szpilman went through, makes for a much more heart-breaking and honest film.  And having someone who had first-hand experience within the Ghetto at the helm (Polanski, who was in the Krakow Ghetto at age 7) added to the distinct feeling of authenticity that emanated from this film<br/><br/> Director Roman Polanski did a fantastic job with this film, and I think that it is his greatest accomplishment (and that is saying a lot, considering that Chinatown (1974) is one of the all-time greats).  Adrien Brody as Szpilman is beyond amazing - who would have thought that this young man from New York could so convincingly portray the trials of a man from half-way across the world and a lifetime apart?  His performance rivals the top of what was put out in 2002, and with stiff competition from Daniel Day Lewis for Gangs of New York and Jack Nicholson for About Schmidt, I believe that Brody climbs to the top of the pile with relative ease.<br/><br/> The Pianist is just a magnificent piece of work and should be seen by all that can stomach a heroing tale of surviving the unthinkable.<br/><br/> A+, this is THE best picture of the year."
"wonderfulfable","10","0","1","22 March 2003"," Brilliant and yet sad......
","I went see The Pianist tonight feeling a bit curious and expecting the usual Saving Private Ryan spread. Man, I was wrong. This Roman Polanski directed film effectively conveys the horrors of The Holocaust that the Polish Jews have to endure during the German Occupation in Warsaw, Poland WW2. Jews; young and old, are shot for no reason, abused, and ridiculed. Caught in the middle of this nightmare was Wladyslaw Szpilman (brilliantly potrayed by Adrian Brody) a young and talented pianist and his Jewish family. They, like other Jews, were forced into small ghettoes and are sealed off from other parts of the city. There, they live their lives in poverty, waiting to be deported to concentration camps. In a heart wrenching scene, he was separated from his family and was forced to survive on his own in the ghettoes of Warsaw. From that point of the movie, it started to run a little slow. Even so, Adrian's performance shows him constantly hiding in the shadows, waiting, watching, fearing whether the next day would be his last. He doesn't talk much in this part of the film but the facial expression and body language tells it all. The other actors that supported Szpilman like his family also convey the sense of looming fear and dread that is also present in the other Jews in the film. This really and I mean realistically, gives us the impression that the Holocaust is much more than just the slaughtering of 3 million Jews (FACT;from the start and end of WW2).<br/><br/>Some points of the movie are interspersed with haunting piano solos. Being a music appreciator especially piano acoustics, the music from the film further conveys the suffering endured by our pianist. There is one piano solo that still resonates in my eardrums, but you will have to find out for yourselves.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's beautiful cinematics truly captures the emotions and horrors of the war. A noted scene would be when Szpilman walks through the battered city ruins of Warsaw, a look at this scene reminds me of the blown buildings of Hiroshima after the first A-Bomb was dropped.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year, its going to be in my DVD collection later this year. Its a shame if the Academy does not recognize the talents of Adrian Brody and instead giving it to others like Daniel Day Lewis for Gangs of New York. Still, its very tacky to give it to actors who potray psychopaths. 9/10"

","As someone who has studied the Holocaust since the third grade, read countless books and seen most of the Holocaust-related films out there, I feel confident in saying that ""The Pianist"" is the finest Holocaust film ever made, and it deserves to win the Best Picture Oscar as well as Best Actor for Adrien Brody.<br/><br/>What makes this film rise above such fine efforts as ""Schindler's List"" is its unsparing first-person narrative. We do not flinch from the story or move to another part of the story when things get agonizing. We stay with Wadislaw Spzilman. We see how his life and the lives around him are transformed by what starts out as all-too familiar discrimination and paranoia and devolves into an inhuman cruelty that has rarely if ever been matched in history.<br/><br/>Seeing the Holocaust from a first-person perspective, with a master such as Polanski at the helm and such an intelligent lead is a revelation."
"renelsonantonius","Null","0","1","21 March 2003"," The one thing that Spilzman clinged on
","The subject of Roman Polanski's Palme d'Or-winning (and now, Oscar-nominee) film, 'The Pianist',isn't exactly new and provocative:the suffering of the Jews under the brutal and merciless rule of Adolf Hitler during World War II, when the Third Reich was ominously gaining power, the driving force of which was the assertion of Germany's superiority as a race and a nation.Or simply put, the Holocaust.<br/><br/>This has already been touched upon in some early films, like Germany's 'My Mother's Courage', Italy's 'Life is Beautiful', Sweden's 'Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg' and, of course,Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning 'Schindler's List' and 'The Last Days' (as a producer).Such works were already enough to break one's heart, to stir in the viewers such emotions as grief, fear and anger.With Polanski's latest work, who would want to visit an unpleasant and bleak territory once again?<br/><br/>Well, I daresay that it would be a lamentable mistake not to do so.As I go on with this piece, I hope that I'll be able to justify such assertion.<br/><br/>'The Pianist' is a quietly powerful and honestly moving true-life tale of individual survival in the face of massive destruction that was the Holocaust.The film opens with an actual, black-and-white footage of Warsaw, Poland in 1939, when the citizens were still able to go about their daily business in a relatively peaceful and joyous manner.But in the following scenes, all of this was about to dramatically change as the Nazis started to invade Poland, bringing forth misery and grief to the Poles, most specially to the Polish Jews--and this, ironical enough,in vivid colors!<br/><br/>If in 'Schindler's List' and 'Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg', it was the collective suffering of the Jews that was the central focus, in 'The Pianist', Polanski chose to adopt a different approach:to center on the suffering of a single individual.And that individual was Wladyslaw Szpilman, who possessed deft hands in playing Chopin pieces on the piano and upon whose memoirs the film was based.<br/><br/>Although in the early part of the film, the viewers still get to witness the brutalization of the Jews by the SS guards, when they were rounded up, confined in blocked settlements and cramped ghettos, and finally brought to the labor and death camps, this is presented as happening right before the own eyes of Szpilman (an old man feeding on spilled food on the ground, a mother bewailing over the loss of her baby, a little girl looking for her mother, a young boy dying in the pianist's very arms) that the effect is one of muted grief and shock, both on the protagonist's and the viewers' part (unlike in 'Schindler' and 'Wallenberg', where the scenes of mass murder and deprivation were intended to bring about a forceful shock).And in the succeeding parts of the film, when it would be otherwise inevitable to show the hellish condition in the camps (as 'Schindler' and 'My Mother's Courage' did), all the horrors and ruins of the Nazi occupation are instead reflected in the physical and internal sufferings of Wladyslaw Szpilman.<br/><br/>In fact, there's a considerable part of the film, executed in a quietly riveting manner, where the viewers only see Szpilman, desolate, haggard and in fearful and anxious silence, going from one place to another within the completely-ruined Warsaw, for fear of being caught by the SS guards and alleviating hunger and thirst with whatever comes his way.Such an insufferable existence would have easily defeated the man, if not for the one thing that the Nazis haven't completely destroyed in him:his passion for music.Whenever the moment permits, Szpilman still gets to perform his Chopin pieces on the piano--even if only in his mind, for he can't already lay his fingers on the keys.The piano is his identity, his livelihood, his life;it's the one thing that enabled him to confront and live through the horrors of the Holocaust.<br/><br/>And 'The Pianist' is the masterpiece that enabled its maker, Roman Polanski (who was a young child at the time of the Nazi invasion of Warsaw and who turned down 'Schindler's List' when it was first offered to him by Spielberg), to finally come to terms with that tragic period in his country's history that he himself experienced.<br/><br/>To ignore 'The Pianist' just because one is wary of having to visit a 'familiar' landscape once again is to ignore the individual's gift and capacity for surviving the hardest and cruelest of times, as inspired by Szpilman in us, we who have our own share of sufferings, whatever the degree is.<br/><br/>Much of the film's life comes from no other than Adrien Brody, who commanded such a subtle and affecting portrayal of the downtrodden pianist.Polanski made the perfect choice of having him solely for the lead character (in the same way that Stanley Kubrick perfectly suited Malcolm McDowell in the role of the deviant youth in 'A Clockwork Orange').I couldn't think of any other actor who could've given justice to the delicate person of Wladyslaw (not even Nicolas Cage or Daniel Day-Lewis, Brody's fellow best actor nominees in this year's Oscars).<br/><br/>The 29-year-old actor doesn't need to utter a word to express his sufferings.It all shows in his sullen eyes and undernourished physique.All the brutalization and demoralization being undergone by all the other Jews in the film are movingly embodied by Brody (as Szpilman) himself.<br/><br/>I've already seen all the other films nominated for best picture in this year's Academy Awards.Truth to say, they don't hold a candle to Polanski's masterpiece when it comes to starkness of content and sincerity of emotions."

","Clearly a masterpiece of world cinema. Polanski has made good movies before most notably Chinatown but nothing he has done previously quite prepares you for this brilliant work. What could be a bleak unwatchable horror show instead becomes a universal story of survival thanks to the central performance of Adrien Brody who is in almost every scene. Everything comes together under Polanski's direction to produce a great motion picture that speaks directly to our present time of good versus evil. Yes there is evil in the world and this story from only a generation ago informs us that evil is still very much in the world. Evil takes its form in our fellow man."

","I saw this movie yesterday. It was touching, and very intense. I've seen a lot of other WWII movies in my life, but this movie was so realistic, that it actually made me cry. It really showed all the tragedies that one man had to go to survive throughout WWII, and all the people he saw being killed and all the buildings he saw being bombed. You can also see all he had to go through to get food, and how he was starving. The fact that I'm a pacifist, and the fact that I'm Jewish were two reasons, out of many, that this movie touched me the way it did. I could see what my people had to go through to survive, and how people in general were being killed, which I hate. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time, getting the chills, and letting out a few tears as the story went on. Roman Polanski is a genius. This is the only one of his movies I've seen so far, but it's enough for me to know that he's a genius. His visions of the war are excellent, and very accurate. Adrien Brody is the best performance I've seen this year. He carries the film on his shoulder, and makes it come to life like no one else has. He should win the Oscar, no doubt. The music was beautiful, and the way this man plays the piano is excellent. To make a long story short, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Very chilling, and dramatic. If you're one of those people who normally cries in movies, bring extra tissues for this one, but still, don't miss it. You won't regret it. 20/10"

"waltergl","9","0","1","21 March 2003"," Out of a horrific time, a beautiful work of art
","Roman Polanski's The Pianist is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, and easily one of the top five films of the year. <br/><br/>The story is essentially Adrien Brody's quiet, good-natured classical pianist struggling to survive the horrors of the Holocaust. We watch him and his loving family as their hopes for liberation are slowly crushed, and, in an extraordinarily moving sequence, how he is separated from them, their fate left a mystery to him for several years. The rest of the film concerns Brody alternating between hiding and running from the Germans, witnessing pieces of the war, glimpsing and, to an extent, collaborating with the Jewish rebellion in Warsaw. It is a quiet, slow-paced film, often musicless but occassionally accompanied by beautiful classical pieces. Polanski's direction is subtle, disciplined, and impeccably well-timed. Brody's performance is also subtle, and he says very little, but compare his demeanor and facial expressions at the end of the film to how he looks at the beginning, and you see a profound change. Brody strikes all the right notes for this part, delivering a quiet performance of resounding power.<br/><br/>As far as the subject matter, you need to look to Polanski himself to truly understand why this film is significant. There have been several films made about this subject, most notably Spielberg's brilliant Schindler's List, but none quite capture the same tone that this film does. Polanski was himself a Holocaust survivor who survived not unlike Brody's Szpilman. He was not heroic, he did not defy the Nazi regime as Oskar Schindler did, but he hid, viewing the horror from an objective distance and avoiding it at all costs. Spielberg put us in the thick of the horror; Jews were shot and killed right before our eyes, the blood splattered in front of the camera. With Polanski's film we watch the horror unfold at a distance, from fourth story-windows we see tiny Nazi soldiers shooting tiny Jews in the street. There is a realism and urgency to what we are watching because we are seeing it as Polanski and Szpilman did, and we wonder if perhaps one of those soldiers may look up and see us. <br/><br/>The Holocaust was a horrible event most of all, Polanski reminds us, because heroism could not save the majority of Jews. Szpilman could not confront the Nazis head on, or he certainly would have died. Instead he hides in corners, watching and recording the events of a dark time in the world's history. The ultimate catharsis, for Polanski and for the late Szpilman, comes in the final scene, when the pain and suffering of the Holocaust is transformed into beautiful art, and Polanski places us in the audience, close enough to be touched but far enough away to feel as if we're really sitting in the same room. Playing piano was Szpilman's catharsis; filmmaking is Polanski's. The Pianist may not be Polanski's ""best"" film, but by watching it we see a glimpse of his soul, letting go of the demons left by the Holocaust."

Polanski's best work to date, Adrien Brody pulls off the best work of his career so far, hopefully this will be one of his building blocks to greater works. I have told everyone i know to see this movie, to open up their minds to the hatred and passion depicted in this horror of a tale.

"ilovedolby","10","0","1","17 March 2003"," Polanski has poured his heart and soul into this picture!
","Acclaimed director Roman Polanski (`Rosemary's Baby,' `Chinatown') brings us one of the most stirring Holocaust pictures ever seen, `The Pianist,' based on the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman, who is a Jew that survived a Nazi ghetto in Warsaw, Poland. Szpilman is the central character of the film, portrayed by actor Adrian Brody (`Summer Of Sam') who provides such greatness in his performance that it's hard to find a better actor in any film of 2002. Undoubtedly, part of `The Pianist's' magnificence can be attributed to the real life conditions that Polanski faced while growing up. He himself lived in a Nazi ghetto as a child, until he escaped. Both of his parents spent time in concentrations camps, where his mother eventually died. However, Polanski was reacquainted with his father in 1945. 	While watching the film, I couldn't help but feel absolute humility for the real-life characters. Even though most people are aware of the revolting things that Nazis did to Jewish prisoners, it's still quite heart wrenching to watch. For example, from the simple embarrassment that Jews endured in the ghetto of having to dance in the streets for the Nazi soldiers to another scene that depicted Nazis throwing an elderly man out of his wheelchair from an apartment building into the street, only to run over his body later. 	One scene in particular that showed the devastation of the war was one in which Szpilman walks down a deserted city street in the later part of the film. The landscape sent chills down my spine as the street stretched for miles and there was nothing but charred remains of buildings blown out by the onslaught of the war. All that could be heard was artillery fire in the far distance. On this street is where Szpilman spent the last weeks of the Nazi occupation, living in the attic of war-torn house.<br/><br/>	`The Pianist' is being nominated for Best Picture, although I don't feel it was the best film of 2002; my pick for Best Picture is `The Hours.' However, this film is absolutely remarkable. Polanski has poured his heart and soul into this picture, and he certainly deserves an Oscar for Best Director. But it's unlikely he will get it due to the fact that he fled the U.S. in the late 70s for Europe after his conviction for statutory rape. Among other Oscar nods that `The Pianist' has going for it are Best Actor (Brody), Best Cinematography (Pawel Edelman), and Best Screenplay (Ronald Harwood, Wladyslaw Szpilman). ****"
"gandersen-1","Null","0","1","16 March 2003"," Boy, what a film
","My brother recomended this film to me, he knows me, he knows when I'll like something. So, I invited a friend, he brought a friend too, this friend told me beforehand, ""I'm from the chec republic, I've seen all sorts of films about wwII, will be nothing new to me"". Part way through the movie I thought to myself, geez, another depressing flick about a Jewish family caught in the grasp of zee germanz, my friend has obviously seen this. My chec friend got up and walked out. That is about the time that things really started happening. This film alternates between making you think nothing in the world could make this poor fellas life more boring to literally making me jump. Wow. I've seen a lot of films, trust me, I work for netflix, this film does not focus on special effects like saving private ryan, however this is not to say they are bad, you just aren't immersed in full scale battles like S.P.R.. However, this film makes you feel as though you are being hunted, not singled out, but hunted as a race (the jews). At times I thought, why don't the jews ever fight back, and my question is answered, and pleasantly so. Additionally, touches such as a scene showing B-17's flying overhead were gratifying to say the least as I said to myself, I wonder if this pianist saw my grandfathers plane flying overhead (he was a navigator for a b-17 in WW2). The few piano scenes are incredible, this guy could play that thing (gonna have to give my mom more credit for moving that grand piano of hers through all of our rental homes). I have a peculiar habbit of only reading reviews after I've seen a film, however when I write one I try to leave out as much as possible so anyone reading will be able to see the movie and not know that the main character ends up building a time machine and actually saves the world from world war III, ha, just jokin with ya.<br/><br/>
Anyways, my reasons that you should see this film. One, suspense, yes, a friggin movie about a piano player has superb suspense (remember my coment about jumping out of my seat, no films do that to me, this one did). Two, the dam piano, I've heard my mom play every sat morning for the 19 years I spent living at home and wow, this guy has some very impresive fingers. Three, I said the special effects weren't suppurb, but that is only because this guy was not on the front lines, action happens, just not like private ryan, there are some very good nail biting action scenes, imagine getting shot at while hanging from a roof, or being an eye witness to an attack from your appartment building on a Nazi controlled hospital only to be retaliated against by a Nazi tank and troops, again, wow. Four, the necessary reminder of what humankind is capable of, low point of Nazis and the high point of countries like the U.S., which in our current time make me reflect on how Iraq treats it's own people like the jews, you speak against saddam you get shot in the street or your tongue cut out. And finally five, few films make me think in so many different directions. Fight club made me think in a few. Schindlers list made me think in several more, but this film, it made me think about so many things at once, it was incredible. I don't know if that was the intent, however I put this film at the top of my list, perhaps one of the best ever. Go see it, it will make you want to write a review to tell others to go see it."

","Seeing as how popular culture has all but killed classical music, I am always interested in the public's reaction to a film like this.  I find that many people seem to like pieces that are short and don't involve too much patience to listen to, whether they are aware of it or not.  I think that these people will love this film because Chopin's glorified elevator music is prominantly featured.<br/><br/>For those of us hoping for something a little more interesting, this film is pretty dull.  If Polanski had really wanted us to know what the concentration camps were like, he could have used any of a number of different 20th century composers, some of which actually lived in these camps.  As it is, this film fails to capture the imagination. It is just a series of deadpan reactions interspersed with action sequences of questionable accuracy.  By the end of the film Szpileman is just a grizzled looking vagrant to us; he doesn't bear the weight of his experience on his soul.  It's a valiant effort, but ultimately this film is just average."

Not only was this movie inspiring but it was true and that makes it that much MORE inspiring. To survive in the lowest forms of life, to have everything taken from you and still persevere, is a miracle. It's hard for many of us to believe, but it did happen. Some users have said that it is not as good as those of other holocaust movies. But I believe they all tell a different story so can you really compare? This one, The Pianist, seems to really capture the life of the ghetto. Sure you escape the death camps but you've only escaped a camp, not death. It didn't let anything go by, it was true to World War II's awful images. I reccommend this to anyone who wants to see a beautifully written story about a man's life."

While the film doesn't break any new ground on fairly familiar subject matter, it benefits strongly from Adrien Brody's excellent work in the title role, making you identify and root for his character as he hides from the Nazi's and tries to survive till the war ends.

"chris65203","10","0","2","5 March 2003"," one of the greats
","Over this past weekend two emotionally moving events happened.  First, I saw ""the pianist"": Second, I went on a church retreat.  Now I have been going to my church retreats for a number of years and they are almost always the highlight of the month, let alone the weekend.  But I would have to say that the pianist moved me more then the retreat.  I know this is pretentious but I just wanted to say it to emphasize the greatness of this film.<br/><br/>
In my mind, if Shindler's List was ranked #7 on AFI ""100 years, 100 movies"", then this movie would have to be ranked somewhere between #1-6.  Of course I don't think Shindler's List is the #7 movie of all time and I doubt ""The Pianist"" is in the top ten, either (though maybe the top 20), but that is beside the point.<br/><br/>This movie highlights what very few movies dare to say.  This is that it is not enough mearly to survive, but to survive as a human being.  This point is stated multiple times throughut the film (i.e. ""I'm cold""; when Szpilman expresses his emotions through a moving score with the German; how Szpilman eats the Jam plain without the bread like a small child; etc., etc.), and is really what makes the film great.  Brody really expresses how close to an emotional zombie Szpilman comes, without (in the end) eventually becoming one.  I think the reason that the film came across so powerfully, without being sentamental, was that Polanski was there.  I know this has been said before and will be said again, but I don't think it can be under-emphized.  P.T. Anderson makes great films about ""the valley"" because he lived there, Spielberg makes great films about family relations because he was very hurt when his partent divorced, Quintin Tarintino makes great films about low-lifes partially because for many years he lived and interacted with lowlifes as a video clerk in L.A.  Polanski was able to make a great film about the holocost becuase he was there.<br/><br/>And to all of you who have previously said that Brody flatlines on his acting I feel you have unfortunelty mistaken bad acting with suttle acting.<br/><br/>
Overall this is maybe one of the greatest films of all time<br/><br/>10/10"

That is what The Hours and Gangs Of New York are for.<br/><br/>I sat in my seat completely transfixed on the screen. Everything had such an amazing presence. It was completely believable, in both acting and story, and the hardest thing to believe is that this actually happened.<br/><br/>This film had soul, Polanski had suffered at the hands of the Nazis, and could direct with knowledge and experience. When reading the credits, I also noticed that most of the names were Polish or German. So this film was much more real than I had thought. I recommend this film to everyone.

"lilboyblue80","9","0","2","2 March 2003"," Best Holocaust movie I've seen
","I've seen what I guess I would consider the three big Holocaust movies of recent years--Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful, and now the Pianist. Now, it's been awhile since I saw the first two, but I believe that the Pianist is the best one of the three for me.  It's also the Best Picture of the year, whether the Academy picks it or not!<br/><br/>I was thinking totally different things after I watched this movie than I was after I had watched Schindler's List.  I remember thinking about how awful it must have been to go through what all those people went through after Schindler's List; all through the Pianist, all I could think about was the evil that human beings were committing against each other and wonder how that's even possible.  So while The Pianist doesn't portray the entire ordeal that the Jewish people endured from beginning to end quite like Schindler's List, I think it does a better job of communicating the even more terrifying idea that humans can be so evil.<br/><br/>
****Spoilers****<br/><br/>
The perfect example of this from the movie is when the Germans enter the apartment across the street from the family in the ghetto, and when the grandfather of the other family cannot stand up, they wheel him over to the balcony and dump him over.<br/><br/>
Of course, the evil that human beings are capable of is not the only thing this movie portrays.  I love the climax of the movie, when the main character has his final encounter with the German who helps him.  ""How can I ever thank you?"" he asks.  ""Don't thank me,"" the German replies.  ""Thank God.  He wants us to survive.""  That doesn't seem to make much sense, considering everything else we've seen in the movie!  If God wants us to survive, why is he letting all this other stuff happen?  Well, for some reason, all this evil does go on, despite God's existence, but he wants us to survive, and he does preserve a remnant.  That's the entire history of the Jewish people--not just during the Holocaust!<br/><br/>
As some other posters have pointed out, the movie does a good job of showing both good and evil in the Germans, good and evil in the Jewish community, and good and evil in the Poles--both sides of human nature in all groups. It's not black and white.<br/><br/>
It's amazing to contrast the struggles of the characters in a movie like this one, and the characters in a movie like, say, The Hours.  Now, I thought The Hours was a very good movie.  I can relate to it relatively well; it's the kind of thing many of us in modern America deal with, even if we don't deal with those specific situations.  But whatever we're facing here, now, it's nothing compared to what those poor people in Warsaw were facing.  A movie like the Pianist really puts that in perspective."

","I tried very hard to like this film.  It was just near impossible to engage with it.  As far as art direction, compostion and filmmaking, the film was well polished but dreadfully standard.  This left the task of creating a enjoyable or powerful movie to the story and the acting, both of which were... well, flat.  Realizing that the story was based on real events it doesn't seem fair to criticize the story itself, but stagnated flow made me wonder why the story really needed to be told in this format.  The main character goes from respectible to subdued to squashed to positively disheveled, and yet there seemed to be no reason why He should be cared about any more than the other thousands who died.  The man who acted the lead did a tremendous job of portraying the role but it wasn't enough to make the character truly compelling or interesting.  He just went through the whole film with the same expression, the same emotion, this dreadful... sameness.  It made me wonder why he had to be saved, when there were others around him who at least seemed to do something, feeling something, have some will or humanity.<br/><br/>Partly this is just a reaction to the hype, which i thought it didn't live up to.  Other user comments praising this film demonstrate that there are two sides to every issue, and many different points of view, most people seem to enjoy it. skipping it then might very well mean missing a movie that you will enjoy immensely.  I personally found little in the film to keep me interested, engaged, caring, or even entertained, and i'm not really sure why it won the the Palms D'Ors, other than PC reasons relating to its subject matter.  Just my personal view, but i really could have put my time and money to better use."
"modern_maiden","9","0","1","26 February 2003"," A powerful depiction of the unconquerable human spirit.
","""The Pianist"" is the first film I've seen that comes close to depicting the utter destruction of war. The scenes of the aftermath of the bombings struck me particularly hard.  When you see those scenes, remember that the same destruction occurred accross most of central and eastern Europe, by Allied bombs as well as Axis. Few cities were left unscathed, yet they all rebuilt themselves, brick by brick, a testament to the power of the human spirit.<br/><br/>The first half of the film was so full of horrible acts of cruelty, that I began to wonder if I really needed to see all this. Polanksi more than succeeded in making a statement about the horrors of war and genocide. It's not a film for the feint of heart. The second half of the film, though showing the terrible ravages and suffering of the survivors of war, also revealed the hope and determination, the resiliency of human beings and their desire to survive.<br/><br/>The acting and directing was superb. Every action was meaningful and powerful, the cinematography breathtaking. Adrien Brody was impressive. The music and piano-playing scenes were so beautiful that I could forgive the fact that it was unlikely that a perfectly tuned piano would be found in a bombed-out building in sub-zero weather.<br/><br/>
My only other criticism would be that I feel Polanski was a bit too obvious with the good vs. evil characterizations. For example, the evil Germans were all scowling and ugly, except for the lone friendly officer, who was handsome. The same stereotypes apply to the protagonists: heroic underground rebel Jews were either handsome or jovial, and the gentiles who helped them were beautiful and fair-haired and looked like angels. Maybe it was symbolism, but it seemed a little too simplistic to me.<br/><br/>However, that's a small complaint, because overall the whole film was incredible, both technically and emotionally.

"WriterDave","10","0","1","23 February 2003"," Haunting, Timeless, Unforgettable, Uplifting...One for the Ages
","Although not nearly as epic and emotionally devastating as ""Schindler's List"", Roman Polanski's deeply personal ""Pianist"" is by many measures a greater film and a work of true cinematic art. Haunting, cold, and austere where other films are sentimental and clichéd; true to the horrors of human existence where other films play for shock and gore; poignantly quiet where other films are overwhelmed by a swelling music score; darkly comic where other films don't even dare speak a word; and universally compelling where other films are specific and preachy (though a fact based Holocaust tale, this could have been anyone's tale of triumph over the horrors of man's brutality towards each other and could speak to a tribal warrior in Somalia or Palestinian separatist just as much as it does to a Jew from Poland). This is a film deeply rooted in the ethereal realm of the timeless artistic representation of man's struggle against adversity and our innate will to survive.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I watched a film and was so transported into the world the director created (I think only ""Mulholland Drive"" has done this for me in recent years) and yet was so aware of the artistic nature of it all. I don't think I've ever sat through a film before and thought during so many scenes ""this is one for the ages."" My personal favorite scenes are the shot of the snow covered street running through a bombed out post-apocalyptic Warsaw and the eerily poetic shot of the German officer standing by the car on that very street at night underneath the full moon while the sounds of the piano playing from a bombed out building break the serene silence. <br/><br/>The seamless editing and style of direction are purely European old school, and work wonderfully to keep the viewer entranced and spellbound by the state of Poland during WWII and the state of man's soul during times of tribulation. Polanski, working possibly from his own memories of his childhood in Poland during the Holocaust as well as by the actual accounts of his protagonist, gives this powerful tale its heart through the details (i.e. the family sharing the caramel while waiting to be taken away to the death camps). I can imagine sitting through this film a dozen times and still not catching everything. Half of the time I wasn't even sure what some of the details meant (like when he was playing piano at the ghetto club and one of the patrons asked him to stop playing so he could hear the sounds some coins made when he flipped them on the tabletop). Polanski clearly respects his audience as well as his characters and story. Sometimes we have to figure it out for ourselves what was the purpose of a certain scene or certain piece of dialogue (like when the German officer remarks that Szpilman, which only people with knowledge of foreign languages would know means ""player,"" is a very appropriate name for a pianist). It's this kind of attention to detail and respect for characters, setting, and audience alike that separate the good films from the great ones, and the movies from the works of art. This is a great work of art, and one of the greatest films of all time."
"bix171","10","0","1","23 February 2003"," An Underrated Genius
","Perhaps because he generally works in a direct, naturalistic style and in a variety of genres, Roman Polanski could quite possibly be the most underrated filmmaker working today--which makes a film like `The Pianist' all the more startling. It's unexpected filmmaking, a complex yet measured account of Jewish life in wartime Warsaw, both in the ghetto and outside of it, filmed, as always, in Polanski's clean, simple style with beautiful camerawork (by Pawel Edelman) and evocative lighting. Though it may appear cold and methodical, Polanski's passion is subversively striking. Based on pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoir (unread) and adapted in an admirably economical fashion by Ronald Harwood, his story probably serves as a counterpoint to Polanski's own: the end titles reveal Szpilman remained in Poland until his death in 2000 whereas Polanski has essentially exiled himself from his native land and there's a sense of wistfulness in his recreation of the time; Warsaw is displayed as a peaceful urban center disrupted only by the advent of Nazism and, with one notable exception, the Poles are depicted as concerned citizens given to either helping or at least ignoring the Jews. Although it's as brutal to watch as `Schindler's List' (there are some short images that are truly troubling) the comparisons are not quite apt: whereas `Schindler's List' concerned itself with the Holocaust as a topic in and of itself, `The Pianist' seems intrigued not only with that subject but also with art's critical importance in a crisis society: not only is it a savior in troubled times but it's the bridge that bonds victim and barbarian; Polanski seems intent on providing a no-fuss definition of art that can have meaning to any audience. Adrien Brody plays the title role, subtly moving from cocksure artist to emaciated blank canvas for the director to project his fears and wonders. Absolutely outstanding, the work of a true cinematic genius."

My compliments to him on an outstanding acting job.<br/><br/>The point of the film for me was not pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous survival of the Nazi Holocaust, but rather the portrayal of an important--and horrific--aspect of the Holocaust itself.<br/><br/>By concentrating on the history of the Holocaust in the Warsaw Ghetto, director Roman Polanski has reminded us of the inconceivably evil events that occurred there.  [Not commented upon was the betrayal of the Polish partisans in Warsaw by the Russian army.  This grim story will require another movie.]<br/><br/>In any event, this movie must be seen. Luckily, it is as close as most of us will ever come to evil on this massive a scale.  (At least, that is my hope.

"lvburns","9","0","1","17 February 2003"," The Metaphor of Music
","This is a Holocaust film, among other things.  In my humble opinion, the movie is about what happens to love, passion and life when oppression is permitted to take control of lives.  The one metaphor, and the primary one, that strikes me most deeply is the use of music as a bridge.  A bridge in that the Szpilman's hid their money in the father's violin.  A bridge in that Wladyslaw met the woman (another musician) who would later help him, despite her marriage to someone else, during a music broadcast over Polish radio.  A bridge in that many of those who were in the ghetto with Szpilman, as well as those outside who could help, did so because of his reputation as a musician.  A bridge in that the only thing that kept Szpilman from insanity and perhaps death during critical times during his hiding was the music he kept in his head.  Perhaps most importantly, and certainly most poignantly, a bridge in that music was the only connection between Szpilman and the German officer who discovered him, and likewise perhaps the German officer's only connection, other than the photograph of his family, to what remained of his humanity.  Just the look on his face as Szpilman played spoke volumes in shock, sorrow, apology, sympathy and maybe regret. Finally, music (the arts) as a bridge to an enduring place beyond repression, beyond death, inhumanity, loss and tragedy."

This movie is far superior to Schindler's list and has deeper insights into the experience of human beings whose freedoms and dignity have been taken away. Whereas ""Schindler's List"" was a cold, impersonal film without a glimmer of humanity or clue as to what morality is, ""The Pianist"" is a film that real and genuine people can relate to and will treasure for the lessons that may be drawn from it.  This is a movie whose time has come!  Without being political or preachy, this film tells the story of a pianist in Poland and what happens to him and his family during the German occupation of Poland. This movie is seamless and you won't want to miss a moment of this masterpiece.  It has something to say about what is wrong in our world today.  When good people do nothing, evil triumphs.  This movie without a doubt should be seen by peace protesters and liberals everywhere who are indifferent to the suffering of people whose lives are tyrannized by a mad man like Hitler.  It's inhuman to ignore what's going on every day in the lives of oppressed peoples the world over.  The movie so subtly and yet powerfully drives home the truth that there is no peace except when good men stand up and fight the evil of dictatorships.  The actors are uniformly superb.

","The only big dramatic moment comes when Brody plays the piano at someone's request, but there is no auditorium that gives him a standing ovation, there is no applause. There is an audience of one and when Brody finishes the dazzling piece (considering his state, to be sure) he's done. As a matter of fact, the care in which this scene is orchestrated is meticulous (is he just pausing...or can he remember it at all?).<br/><br/>The barking gunfire is jolting and crackling bombs send dust and debris flowing through the air. There are no big death scenes; when someone is killed (many of them are already face-down or on the ground), they slump over, the life in their body disappears and they go limp. There is one extraordinary death scene and what occurred to me was the way the camera follows it half-way. It's tense -- we don't want to see, and we never do -- but rather than satisfy us, we can only hear what happens, and it's much more affecting because of it. The film is violent but it isn't gory; it's emotionally powerful but not sentimental; it's elegant and tasteful but not without an edge -- the blackest of black humor that runs throughout the film is subtle and obvious and it's sure not comic relief (and it's not a cackling humor laughing at the hopelessness of a situation like in some of Polanski's other films, either).<br/><br/>Rather than add sentimentality and make us feel good about feeling bad, the film fills us up to the brink with the pianist's observations. The criticism this film has unfairly received from a few people that it's ""detached"" is bogus. We are observing the observer (and he's not one of those observers who talks to himself or thinks aloud so as to not leave us in doubt as to what's going on in his head). There is also no overview; we are aware of only what Brody is aware of. We aren't treated to a ""this is how it happened"" approach, either, rather we are shown specific incidents that amount to a whole (a man told to walk in the gutter, for instance). The film has been criticized by some for its portrayal of German soldiers as killing machines without depth. Of course there's the most important scene in the film which proves this completely false, so there's no point in even bothering to argue it.<br/><br/>Brody doesn't continue surviving by his wits alone -- which isn't to say he doesn't try his damndest -- he's helped by many others and what Polanski realizes (after his own experiences, how could he not?) is that this man need not live, but he does against the odds, drifting -- painfully -- into survival. His story isn't a ""triumph of the human spirit,"" it's an uncharacteristic end that few met and it isn't treated as a victory so much as a final reprieve.<br/><br/>The scene in which Brody realizes the horror he's engulfed in, for me, was when he tries to help a young boy struggling to climb out from beneath the wall separating the Polish Jews' designated area. The look on his face afterwards will stay with me, I'm sure, for a good long while.<br/><br/>This film's stature rests as art defending -- and demanding -- art. It's a complete film that could work as a textbook for lifeless hell. Polanski isn't just acting as a mere craftsman, he's using his craft to settle something within himself, all the while never venturing into overtly personal territory. <br/><br/>On my way home from the film I was thinking about which was my favorite of the year, which one was the best. I thought of more flashy movies with a style that overwhelms you, risky movies not afraid to go all-out, but then I realized what makes this film so astonishing isn't what it shows you or what it doesn't show you, but the way in which we are shown. Everything is so much more powerful because the awful truths of Nazi horror are shown opposite the stillness of inner turmoil. Then I asked myself which movie had a the deepest effect on me. Not in terms of a gut reaction or an immediate feeling, but which one is the most likely to leave an impression on my soul. It was this one.<br/><br/>****"

","The horror of the Warsaw ghettos and the untold misery inflicted on many thousands of Poles by the Nazis, is indeed a dark part of world history, and Polanski attempts to portray the effect of such horror in this film. However, Brody fails to give his character real emotional depth and the story fails to deliver any real insight into the mind of the pianist Szpilman. Giants of the English stage lend a helping hand and Lipman and Finlay give good if a little caricatured performances. All in all though, this film is highly watchable as it tells the story of how different people coped with the Nazi horrors, some more valiantly than others."
"zmarc","10","0","1","28 January 2003"," Is it possible to make a bad Holocaust film?
","Is it possible to make a bad Holocaust film? With such drama and history, it seems difficult. This one is certainly moving, and even shocking: you'd think we'd have seen everything by now, but some of what the Nazi's did is beyond comprehension. The story is the true story of Szpilman, Poland's greatest pianist. The Germans take over Poland, put him and his family into the newly established ""Jewish Sector,"" and eventually kill his family. It's a miracle he survived. What I liked about this film is the way it's so understated. Our protagonist isn't a hero: he just a guy. I compare him to a rat. I don't mean that in a negative sense, just that he's a rat scrounging for survival, and every time you think he's down, up he pops again. But it's not really a survival story either: mostly the guy survives via luck and friends. He doesn't particularly want to survive in some ways, he just does. It's like he's so overwhelmed by his circumstance he doesn't know how to do anything else. Adrian Brody gives a terrific performance as Szpilman, especially toward the end when things get desperate. Polanski is smart in his handling of the film: he just gets out of the way and lets the story tell itself. I didn't notice one superfluous camera movement or transition: you just forget you're watching a film and get wrapped up in the time period. It is a long film (over 2.5 hours) but every frame is important. One intriguing aspect that I felt was brilliant in retrospect (a bit of spoiler here) is that we don't get to really see Szpilman play the piano until late in the film. Sure there's a brief scene at the beginning, and a couple in the middle, but he's not really playing. That's wonderful, because part of Szpilman's pain is that throughout the war he has no piano to play, and we, the audience, glimpse that pain through the subtle absence of his playing during most of the film. When he does play at the end, it's a catharsis for both of us -- we've both been aching for that moment. We're overjoyed at his joy at being able to play again. Superb. All that said, where does this film rank in cinema history? That's difficult to say: it's tough to criticize a Holocaust film without coming across as a brute. This is an excellent film, and I liked that it tells a different story of the war and shows us new images and a new perspective, but ultimately it can't escape what it is: a Holocaust film. That tag carries a lot of baggage, and frankly, once you've seen once Holocaust film you've seen portion of all others. There's some new material here but it's definitely not as original as Life is Beautiful, a film I liked far more simply because it dared to be daring (a comedy about the Holocaust). This is a great film in the sense that it's well-done, emotionally moving, and has historical significance, but while I wouldn't have a problem watching Life is Beautiful over and over again, I can't say the same thing about The Pianist. I'm very glad I saw it, and I might watch it again on DVD, but like Schindler's List this is not a movie you want to watch over and over again. That diminishes it slightly in my book (for instance, it wouldn't be in my top ten favorite films)."

","""The Pianist"" is the kind of assured, confident movie that only an older director can make.  Sure, directors like Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino have exhibited prowess beyond their relatively young years, but the allure of a seasoned professional is unmistakable and inimitable.  He knows you'll be impressed through sheer storytelling magic, and won't jump through hoops to get the audience from point A to point B.<br/><br/>I have read Michael Medved's deliriously inane comments on film and film criticism, and he wrote Roman Polanski's best work since ""Chinatown"" off as simply a ""Holocaust drama.""  I disagree.  Yes, the main character is Jewish in the nineteen thirties and forties, and the Holocaust is used as a backdrop, but this is a simple story of survival.  Ronald Harwood's screenplay does not go into tons of exposition about who the Nazis are or what they're doing there, and doesn't use insulting little title cards to sum up the situation at the beginning of the film.  It respects the audience's intelligence.  We know what the Nazis did, and it doesn't labor the point.  <br/><br/>Polanski is gentle, yet masterful, letting the story flow instead of yanking it one way or the other.  It uses a minimum of dialogue, and doesn't try to convince us of what is wrong or right.  It expects us to know better, and therefore doesn't enforce a kind of ham-handed moral high ground that would be easy to trip over in a film like this.  It accepts everyone involved as human beings instead of faceless and soulless killing machines in gray.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of the film is Adrian Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, the Polish piano player who watched his family get packed on a train heading to a concentration camp.  With Polanski's spare direction and Harwood's lack of dialogue, Brody is the only thing to focus on.  One should not underestimate how daunting of a challenge this really is.  Actors have broken under lesser pressure, and something like this requires whoever plays the part to immerse himself wholly in the role; to become the character instead of looking like an actor going through the motions.  Brody more than rises to the challenge.  The soldier from Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" and the punker from Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" vanish.  Brody is Szpilman, it's as simple as that.  The feat is superhuman.<br/><br/>""The Pianist"" is everything a great movie should be.  The direction, writing, acting, and everything else are exemplary.

","What does a country have when it has nothing? When it has been decimated, razed, conquered, humiliated? I remember the question being asked and answered once when I was in Poland. The answer was, its art. The poverty of a nation has been transformed into a love and respect for their great artists  a sincerity that is apparent everywhere you go in Warsaw, from the Opera House to the Old Town. Figures like Chopin represent something that cannot be destroyed by bombs, by external powers, by materialism.<br/><br/>What sets The Pianist apart from other holocaust' movies is this ennobling of art, the spirituality of music especially, which has the power to live on, even to cross barriers of race and hatred. In its final analysis, it represents a triumph of the spirit rather than another bleak and horrific account of the Nazi incarceration and obliteration of Jews.<br/><br/>(contains some minor plot spoilers): The film's authenticity is movingly enlightened by Director Polanski's own experiences, which included escaping from a Nazi concentration camp as a child in WW2. Comparisons with Schindler's List (a film he turned down the offer of directing) are inevitable  yet in the Piano we see not only European cinema's attention for detail, of lovingly crafted scenes that sweep us away with poetic beauty and simplicity, and characterisation that has us truly believing in the individuals and feeling with them, but also a touching lack of bitterness: it is a German officer, moved by the purity of the Jewish pianist's music, that saves him  a scene that in other hands could have been rendered overly simplistic is given depth and grandeur by the skill of Polanski and a remarkable performance by Adrien Brody  as well as a fantastic story that has been based fairly closely on actual events.<br/><br/>Szpilman (Brody) is a Jewish pianist who is ghetto-ised when the Nazis invade Poland. A frail and delicate man, he is ill-equipped to cope with the rigours imposed, or the political shenanigans his colleagues use to try and gain favour. His music is his continual companion. Interestingly, the music featured on the soundtrack during his incarceration is all (if I remember correctly) German  Bach and Beethoven. It is only when, as a feeble, starving and barely human derelict, the threat is finally lifted from him and he plays the music of Chopin from his beloved Poland. Gentle, fragile music that, in all its fragility, rises phoenix-like to win the respect of the oppressor. The Pianist goes immediately onto my all-time list of greatest movies and I'm already eagerly looking forward to a second viewing."

With all the gratuitous violence in PG-13 movies and on television these days I do not think this film deserved an `R' rating.<br/><br/>

","The reason I found this film to be so compelling is because yet again another movie expresses the destruction of humanity during the Holocaust. I don't think this topic can ever be ""overdone"", and I'm glad that a film about the subject is made consistently every few years. The beauty of this film is that our protagonist is not a ""hero"" in the classical sense. He's an artist struggling to survive. Living in a life of music and beauty didn't prepare him to run from the Gestapo. We don't see him jumping out of windows and landing on his feet, nor do we see him beat up the bad guys, or ever really fight back. Instead we see him stumble, run, and beg for his life. His character illustrates what a ""real"" person did to escape brutality. Brody's performance is amazing! The depression and isolation Szpilman must have felt is portrayed so convincingly. The parallels with the classical music works extremely well. The music lived within Szpilman just like his will to live did. Neither of these could be taken away nor locked up. A definite 10+ from me."

"mafioso","8","0","1","26 January 2003"," entertaining but predictable
","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Being a music major I was very eager to see this film.  My verdict: The Pianist is a film well worth seeing that you will enjoy, however it has its share of flaws and should not be considered Oscar material except maybe Adrien Brody for Best Actor.<br/><br/>The film's main problem is its predictability and attachment to a 'formula'. Way too much borrowing from ""Schindler's List"" and nowhere near that film's dramatic ""best picture"" impact.  I really prefer B&W for WW2 movies. If you were expecting various forms of Jew bashing you got it.  If you were expecting Mr. Szpilman (the hero) to be miraculously spared the awful fate of his fellow jews ""on the train to labour camps, gas chamber etc."", you got it.  In fact he is the only member of his family spared, and Polanski (director) creates an awful loose end by never mentioning, not even at the end of the film, what happened to his family.  How Szpilman manages to survive can only be described as a completely implausible miracle (but if that's what you like, great)  Overall you may also find the film's pace a tad slow, especially the part where is shuffled from apartment to apartment by friends (almost 1/2 hour of screen time if I recall correctly)  Did they really need to bring in the doctor at that one point? (we could tell he was suffering so that scene should have been cut on the cutting room floor). But perhaps the greatest insult to the viewer is the German officer near the end who instead of blowing his brains out takes pity on Szpilman and says ""Ja, play me somethink on de piano"". (yes, he just happens to take refuge where there is a beautiful grand piano for him to play)  And so a little Chopin from Mr. Szpilman's bruised fingers (i.e. hand double for Mr. Brody) saves the day and at War's end he is back playing the piano for Polish National Radio or whatever it's called.  Too bad that nice officer got killed later on anyway.  Far too predictable for my taste.  I could have guessed that sort of ending from the very beginning.  And no love story either except for a little flirtation with a girl who marries someone else as we discover later.  If you love Chopin and the Beethoven ""Moonlight"" (what else were you expecting) remember to thank Chopin and Beethoven, not Polanski and his crew, as the music 'saves' the film from being very average.  Just remember this film is no Schindler's List so don't set your expectations too high. Notwithstanding the film's flaws, I felt that Adrien Brody did quite a convincing job despite the formulaic plot in a difficult role portraying Mr. Szpilman and therefore ought to be nominated for ""Best Actor"" at the upcoming Oscars. (unlikely to win even if nominated)  Otherwise no other nominations deserved.  My rating 7.5/10.  See it in the theatres if you must otherwise this will make a decent rental."
"Shakespeare-2","Null","0","1","25 January 2003"," Holocaust redux: Sepia and stereotypes
","Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is like virtually every Holocaust film you've ever seen. It's all there: the litany of Nazi cruelty, the change in the Jews from helpless victims to freedom fighters, the triumph of the human spirit. But you never feel the characters -- Germans or Jews -- are flesh-and-blood human beings. You never understand why and how the Germans could commit such atrocities, day after day, without any moral scruples.<br/><br/>Granted, the nasty Nazis are ""redeemed"" by one ""good German"". Yes, the film is based on a true story and this person really existed. But in Polanski's retelling he is a stereotype nonetheless. He keeps a photo of his family on his desk. He addresses Szpilman using the polite ""Sie"", where the Germans usually refer to Jews using the familiar ""Du"". And curiously, he is the only person in the entire film who makes any mention of God.<br/><br/>Equally unremitting and relentless is Polanski's color scheme. The set design, costumes and lighting constantly irked, irritated and annoyed me. More often than not, they conspired together to create the soft sepia tone of an old worn photograph. For pity's sake, we know we are watching a film about the past. We do not need to be constantly reminded.<br/><br/>My other peeve about ""The Pianist"" is that everyone in the film speaks English, except the Nazis, who speak German (with English subtitles). How about a little consistency, Mr. Polanski? Either have everyone use English (we know who the Nazis are, because they wear uniforms), or else have them use their respective languages (German, Polish, Yiddish, or whatever).<br/><br/>Not every Holocaust film is like ""The Pianist"", nor does it need to be. My own personal favorites are ""Korczak"", about the Jewish doctor who became the protector of the children of the Warsaw ghetto, and ""The Harmonists"", about a Jewish musical comedy team of the same period. They too illustrate the triumph of the human spirit. But, whereas Polanski's Holocaust is ho-hum and humorless, they show, even under the most trying of circumstances, human beings are still capable of love, joy and delight."
"E Canuck","10","0","1","24 January 2003"," Making it real
","The Pianist is a masterpiece film--not only because it brilliantly depicts the stark reality of war--a particular war--and the persecution, specifically, of Jews in Warsaw. For me, this film attains the universal by way of the particular. It continually pulled me into its present moment and the challenges confronting the characters, making me question myself--who would I be in these circumstances--the brave one? the broken one? Would I steal food from my neighbours, ask another to her risk her life for me, fight back, give up?  <br/><br/>The Pianist reminded me of my essential sadness about the kind of world we've made. It torqued up the tension I, and perhaps most people, possess but effectively evade, much of the time. That tension comes from hoping for something better, wishing that the best of who we are will pull through the worst circumstances--just as we hope for Szpilman to survive. I don't particularly like being made to bleed a little, but I am grateful to Polanski for rendering me a little more real and awake."

This is a griping epic about a terrible time and an even more terrible chain of events that are too horrible to imagine and for the same reason must never be forgotten.<br/><br/>Director Polanski catapults into a new class with this work. It is cruel and terrible to look at in many parts but often the truth is just that way. Dare I mention his name with David Lean?  I think so.<br/><br/>I have to point to Thomas Kretschmann who plays Captain Wilm Hosenfeld with just the correct amount of Prussian correctness that must have come from his years of living in East Germany. But the world owes the real Wilm Hosenfeld too and it is not lost in the moment nor in the end. The Pianist is the first ""9"" I have given in years for a movie rating.<br/><br/>Perhaps as we are drawn to look clearly at the horror of what happened in Poland under Nazi occupation, maybe we can see fit to try to stop war wherever it may try to arise. It may not be within the formate of this forum but this film makes anyone who is sane see.<br/><br/> Now we have bigger guns and bigger bombs but the one common denominator is PEOPLE DIE just on a larger scale!!!! So I urge all to pray for peace and insist that this country who we all love and have served, will not set the precedent of a ""first strike"" against anyone.

","I saw this film several nights ago and find myself still thinking about it several nights later. I will not bore other readers with a rehash of the plot, but I will say that this is certainly the most challenging film of about the Holocaust I have seen. Roman Polanski has delivered an amazing portrait of the horror and the beauty of human life. Polanski justly deserves every bit of praise and award he receives for being so honest and so skilled at delivering movie to the world. The role of randomness, fate and just blind luck in the survival of Szpilman, and by extension everyone who perished or survived those years, has humbled and horrified as a human being. That he survived to write out his story is amazing when you consider how many times he might have made the wrong turn, or said the wrong thing, knocked on the wrong door and met his end. That he survived and was able to write his story with unflinching honesty and without gloryfing his own actions is even more remarkable. How many of us could be so honest and not be tempted to cloak ourselves in heroic actions? Many people have commented on Szpilman apparent lack of heroism. They seem bothered that he was just a man who was pushed into freedom and helped along by many acts of kindness, as if this was a character flaw, that he would be more worth a movie if he had been more daring and noble. In an odd way it was his passiveness in the face of danger that in part gave him the chance to survive and then to tell his tale to the world. Szpilman, as a friend said to me, is an everyman, neither sinner or saint, hero or villian. None of us who have never experienced anything remotely akin to his situation can predict with honesty how they would behave if confronted with the same choices.  We would all like to think we would behave bravely, nobly and honestly, but we can never be sure what the deep desire to live would lead us to do in our human need to cling to life. I would also like to add my appreciation for Adrien Brody's remarkable performance. It was so subtle that it appeared not to be acting. This was a performance of remarkable depth. He deserves an Oscar, although I doubt he will receive it. Subtle and understated never is well appreciated. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an ounce of taste and love of filmaking as an art. This will be something that will stay with you long after you leave the theater."

","Not only was this film based on a true story (same title), but it followed the book very closely, right down to the family sharing the last caramel. And unlike many holocaust stories which are written years later, The Pianist was written by Mr. Szpilman just after the war. The extraordinary thing about the book is that at no point does Mr. Szpilman ever make a judgement on what happens to him. He just reports the facts.

"ochiang","10","0","1","11 January 2003"," Powerful film about hope
","Only word is able to describe the new film by Roman Polanski: AMAZING!  I never thought that a director could transcend the viewer past the holocaust while in the middle of Germany's occupied territory.  But, Polanski does it superbly in the ""The Pianist"". In the first scene, we see the title character, the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), playing on Warsaw radio while bombs drop literal right outside the  window of the studio.  Actually, it only takes the repercussions of a bomb that explodes through the studio to get Wladyslaw away from the instrument that we see clearly that he was made to play with elegance and beauty. Polanski is able to quickly set up to the viewer the giftedness of Wladyslaw.  He is considered the best pianist in Poland and, some say, the best in the world. However, as World War II rolls on, Wladyslaw's family is driven from their home to the Warsaw ghetto where the Nazis place all the Jews.  The struggles that the Jews in Polish must endure are portrayed powerfully throughout the middle hour of the film. Polanski focuses on the Szpilman family as they adjust from a life of comfort to poverty and misery. Wladyslaw is only able to play in a restaurant where the affluent of the Warsaw Jews go to drink and mingle where his talent is ignored and under appreciated.  A patron even asks him to stop playing so that he can count his money.  His brother, who is selling books on the street to support the family, even blames Wladyslaw for the apathy of the rich for the poor. As the film progresses at a steady pace that never loses its direction, Wladyslaw is able to escape the concentration camps and works his way out of the heavy hand of the Nazis and into the helping hands of friends from the past. Polanski portrays the camaraderie of men in beautiful images and story lines as Wladyslaw moves his way around Poland in hope that the war will end with the occupation of the Russians.  Not only is this film hopefully in the understanding of human dignity between men but also what true compassion is to look like:<br/><br/>sacrificing ones own comfort and life for the comfort of another who is less fortunate.  To lend a helping hand beyond presupposed prejudices and, as a result, bringing out the unique humanity of each person that can be hidden from one's own heart and eyes because of what we are told to believe about others. There is so much more that happens as Wladyslaw tries to free himself from the oppression of the German occupation but that is not the point of the film. It is focused on Wladyslaw, who is wonderfully portrayed by Adrien Brody.  The direction of Polanski is wonderful and the cinematography is superb.  The story is compelling throughout and remains believable so that the viewer can be brought into the midst of Wladyslaw's struggles and deliverance. There can be hope in places that are devoid of hope.  We must be able to see beyond the surface of what our eyes see to those things that make our hearts leap and rise.  This hope can be found in something as small as the eloquence of a hungry Polish Jew as his weak fingers work fluidly over the keys of a stand- up piano in the middle of a war torn building.  It is difficult for us to see anything noble come out of something as horrific as the Holocaust.  However, ""The Pianist"" vividly illustrates that there is beauty in the midst of darkness, a friend in an army of your enemies, and hope when despair seems to be our only choice. Film can transcend what our minds can not imagine and the ""The Pianist"" succeeds in this endeavor.  ""The Pianist"" will shock you, surprise you, and, in the end, make you want to stand up and cheer as listeners of Szpilman do.<br/><br/>Because of Polanski's success in executing this film, he has made one of the best portrayals of the atrocities of the holocaust.  But, more than that, he has made a film about the freeing of the human spirit and joy that is accompanied by the sacrifice of oneself for another."

""Schindler's List"" had a redemptive<br/><br/>ending, a message of hope, but ""The Pianist,"" although much<br/><br/>more grim, still found a way for art, as embodied in the culture of<br/><br/>music, to find a common language for Nazi and Jew.

Unlike Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby and The Ninth Gate, here evil eventually has to give way in the face of good.<br/><br/>The film is also timely.  There has been in recent years an upswing in anti-Semitism.  Jewish studients in US and Canadian colleges report verbal and physical abuse by faculty and other students.  European nations ignore the rise of anti-Jewish violence in their own countries.  Arab press and websites praise Hitler, deny the Holocaust and call for a war of genocide against Jews. (How can one both praise Hitler and deny the Holocaust is beyond me, but I have read the articles!)<br/><br/>The Pianist is based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's autobiography.

Good people don't need melodramatic claptrap to tell them that genocide is bad then, now, or ever; and those who are evil will never get the point anyway no matter how many movie screens it dominates or videos it sells."
"Shade-3","10","0","2","25 December 2002"," Polanski's dormant talents blossom in this screen adaptation
","Mr. Polanski has been investigating other realms for a few years now, with some head-rearing during The Ninth Gate and Bitter Moon, though the grand genius has been muffled in those tales. Here, Mr. Polanski's unique cinematic vision erupts in dangerous imagery as only he can bring it to the screen. The scene where the man in the wheelchair is thrown from the window loudly echoes Trelkowski's fall(s) in The Tenant. Polanski functions at his best when working with an 'outsider' tale and here has a protagonist who is an outsider in every sense, from the first frame to the last. Alone in the studio with his piano, a sole individual inside his tight family, and alone in Warsaw, Adrian Brody's portrayal of Wladislaw Szpilman's true outsider offers Polanski the method to achieve his strong telling of the solitary individual. I will never forget the bent-over death contortions of the female fighter in the streets, Brody's pain at losing him family on a train bound for Treblinka. Mr. Polanski, thank you for your work, and for your dynamic telling of a little-understood period of history. Bravo!"
"lawprof","10","0","2","28 December 2002"," The Moral Neutrality of Music-Survival Through Music
","Roman Polanski has created an extraordinary pastiche of one of the darkest chapters of Western history and the nadir of Polish communal life.  ""The Pianist"" follows, achingly and closely, the struggle to live of Warsaw piano virtuoso Wladislaw Szpilman.  The pianist is played by Adrien Brody who seems to have inhabited his character's body and soul. An incredible, indelible performance.<br/><br/>Before Germany sent its legions into Poland on 1 September 1939 Szpilman and his family lived a comfortable bourgeois life in a Warsaw in which an endemic, genteel anti-Semitism rarely intruded into the safe world of the Jewish intelligentsia.  Szpilman enjoyed success both as a concert hall and radio performer.  Indeed the very bombs of a Luftwaffe raid forced him to flee the studio as Warsaw was reduced to submission.<br/><br/>Rampant anti-Semitism emerged with the occupying German forces finding little need to whip Poles into paroxysms of previously barely sublimated hatred.  Decrees forbade Szpilman and all Jews from even the simple pleasure of sitting on a park bench.  Of course such restrictions were as nothing when all the Jews were ordered into a newly created ghetto, an area of Warsaw that could not possible accommodate the influx of uprooted families with any degree of acceptable sanitation or simple decency. <br/><br/>
Even worse was to come as Polanski unflinchingly shows both planned and random acts of German homicidal depravity, aided and abetted by Jewish police armed only with truncheons and the ephemeral and decidedly temporary power allowed by the Germans. The violence depicted is sickening, realistic and necessary to the story.<br/><br/>Szpilman is saved from transport to a death camp right at the Umschlagplatz (the rail departure point) by a supervising Jewish police accomplice of the Germans.  His family, shoved into a cattle car, departs, never to be seen by him again.  All were murdered - father, mother, brother, two sisters.<br/><br/>Szpilman's solo odyssey begins when he knows that he must escape the ghetto where plans for an uprising are slowly jelling.  To Polanski's credit Szpilman's desire to escape and live rather than fight the enemy to the death is presented non-judgmentally.  Szpilman in the film and in his book upon which it is closely based waxes with occasional fits of ambiguous feelings but, overall, his will to live, perhaps fueled by his single-minded desire to play the piano again, controls.  Who has the right to judge him?<br/><br/>One desperate situation after another leaves an emaciated and fever-racked Szpilman, kept alive by Poles who detest not only Hitler's brutes but the obscenity of murderous anti-Semitism.<br/><br/>Nearly at the end of his rope he is discovered by a German Wehrmacht (Army) captain who asks his occupation.  The officer motions him to a beat up and out-of-tune piano to prove his skill.  Upon doing so, Hauptmann Hossenfeld, somewhat blandly played by Thomas Kretschmann, succors the weak pianist with food and clothing. Hosenfeld purportedly aided other Jews but in the film it seems that if Szpilman didn't turn out to be a pianist, the officer at the least would not have helped him.<br/><br/>Szpilman survives for the liberation of Warsaw by the Red Army and he resumes a brilliant career as a pianist, composer (of pop songs too) and member of a chamber music ensemble that tours Europe and the U.S. He died at age 88 two years ago.<br/><br/>There is no false sentimentality in this film.  The violence of the Germans is in the viewers face and gasps from the audience were heard today more than once.  <br/><br/>Szpilman as a fine artist had no greater right to survive than any other Jew.  But his success, visibility, ability to write and commitment to tell his story made his escape from the death-dealers of the Third Reich well-known.  Supposedly, over a million Poles have seen this movie to date. That is good for while the Polish nation was marked down as inferior by Hitler and while much death and privation was visited on Poland the sad reality is that very many more Poles accommodated the occupiers than hid and fed the desperate Jews.  And too many in Poland  today deny the extent of both the Holocaust and the willing assistance of Poles in its execution.<br/><br/>Some have suggested that the music of Chopin, Bach and Beethoven which is part of the film is really simply a leitmotif to the story of an individual's will to live.  I don't agree.  For Szpilman, music was a counterpoint to Nazi brutality, a living heritage that he could not allow to be silenced by the conquerors.<br/><br/>Music is, of course, morally neutral by itself.  Szpilman's deep love of music is easily matched by the knowledge and devotion to Bach and Beethoven by one of the greatest monsters of the Nazi regime, Heydrich.  What is important, as Polanski proudly and powerfully shows, is that those who are decent and who love music must win out if culture is to have meaning and relevance.<br/><br/>I was bothered by one aspect of the film and I'm curious if any others were too.  A roiling debate over the past four or so years in Germany and to a lesser degree amongst American historians is the issue of the role played by the Wehrmacht, the Army, in actually committing crimes against humanity. For decades many Germans have argued that the soldiers more or less were at worst bystanders rather than initiators and principal perpetrators.  That role was assigned to the black-uniformed SS.<br/><br/>In this film, virtually every murderer and abuser wears the ""feldgrau"" army uniform BUT in the end credits all are identified as SS personnel, save one: Hauptmann Hosenfeld.  This is curious.<br/><br/>The mounting evidence is that the army committed very many atrocities in Eastern Europe against Jews and subjugated peoples.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's stunning vision of his native Warsaw is a haunting classic that will inform future generations of sober and stunned viewers. Polanski has performed a deed of epic moral hygiene in bringing Szpilman's saga to the screen.<br/><br/>10/10."

"OKinareh","8","0","2","5 December 2002"," Roman Polanski is back at the top of its form !
","Roman Polanski has had his highs and lows these last twenty years but, because the subject of the Pianist is so close to its Polish Jewish origins, he does a great job at chronicling the survival experience of a talented jewish pianist from Warsaw during the 1939-45 years. The only flaws would be a very formalist style (we closely follow the characters but rarely interconnect with most of them except for Brody) and some points will draw eye browns (how could he survive that long, etc... but after all it's a true story). Anyway, go see that movie, probably the most powerful about the Holocaust since Schindler's List."
"lenbeeler","10","0","2","2 December 2002"," Superb movie
","Truly excellent movie, better than ""Schindler's List"" in my opinion. The fact that you can see the horror of the holocaust through the eyes of a normal family makes everything more believable. Polansky wisely decided not to include a love story (not even hinted at)and the Warsaw ghetto looks exactly like you can see on the history books. Superb acting and directing, some scenes of this movie you will probably never forget: after being arrested by the SS, a group of jews stands in line and are told to be ready to move. ""Where are you taking us?"" a woman asks shyly. The answer is a bullet through her head, shot by the SS officer Whenever the SS raid a house, you are actually inside the house yourself, looking for a way to escape... See this movie and take your teen-aged children along, as what they learn about the holocaust on the history books they might forget, but they will not forget this movie!"

","Based on a true story, The Pianist recounts the experiences of Wladislaw Szpilman, a brilliant Jewish concert musician in Poland during World War II. Szpilman's extraordinary story of persecution, family tragedy and, ultimately, survival is brilliantly rendered in what is arguably one of Roman Polanski's greatest achievements as a film-maker. The Pianist does not flinch from re-creating the appalling horror of what happened to Polish Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, or avoid their eventual fate in the Nazi concentration camps. Nevertheless, this is not a dramatised documentary or a grim history lesson, instead The Pianist focuses very much on Szpilman's personal journey and what we see and feel is through his eyes. More by luck than good judgement, he becomes a fugitive and escapee in occupied Warsaw, where his terror and isolation are only offset by the help of friends and his memory and belief in the music he has performed. Adrien Brody (Bread and Roses, Summer of Sam) has already received considerable critical acclaim for his mesmerising performance as Szpilman and he is ably abetted by an impressive ensemble cast. British writer, Ronald Harwood, provides a sensitive and measured script; Pawel Edelman's photography provides luminous, unsentimental images and, of course, there is the music which is a major character within the film, setting tones and atmosphere. Above all, though, this is a Roman Polanski film and, considering his own World War II experiences in the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos, this may be his most personal and heartfelt film. Certainly, The Pianist is one of Polanski's most perfectly realised movies and, deservedly, won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival."

","There is something I would like to say to Pianist's admirors. Polanski (director) saw it. With his own eyes... Roman Polanski as a boy was also prisoned in ghetto. Cracow ghetto (the same described in ""Schindler's List""). I am sure Roman Polanski have seen all the drastic scenes shot in the movie. I have never seen such realistic scenes of death, street fights and so on. I am afraid that Roman Polanski still have the picture of ghetto in his mind. And by making this movie he is trying to forget...<br/><br/>Btw. I was born in Cracow. 1000 ft from place Roman Polanski used to live..."

"esteban1747","9","0","1","3 November 2002"," The Story of a Jewish pianist during the II World War
","Tough, real and excellent film of the director Roman Polanski. The scenes of the film are very cruel and shows to what extent Nazis hated Jewish people and the suffering of those living in Warsaw, who were first restricted to ghetto completely fenced around, and later deported to other areas. The pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was able to escape to this deportation owing to various Jewish persons who helped him. Finally he escaped from the workshop, where selected Jewish people were working under control of Nazis, and decided to hide himself. In this later part he got even the help from a Nazi officer who had the opportunity to appreciate the art of Szpilman playing the piano. The content is really good and historically precise. My personal appreciation to Polanski for a such film and to Brody for his excellent acting."

"drella1966","10","0","1","9 September 2002"," The best Polish film in years
","I was not a big fan of Polanski's work before I saw 'The Pianist.' I wasn't crazy about 'Rosemary's Baby' or 'Chinatown,' or any of his early his that some of my friends watched millions of times. I kind of liked 'Repulsion,' but that was it, and I'd only seen it once and have not felt like giving it a try again since. But watching Roman's latest release felt like something so much different, something more than any of the 'good' films I have enjoyed watching in the past weeks, years maybe. Throughout the whole two and a half hours, I was never for a single second bored or distracted, my thoughts could not drift away from the story that was so majestically unwrapping in front of me, making me a solitary witness of Wladyslaw Szpilman's wartime fate.<br/><br/>The entire room was silent from the first moment, when on screen appeared pre-war movie chronicles, showing Warsaw on a sunny summer day, with people crowding its streets, parks, theaters and avenues, lined with 19th century apartment buildings, similar to the ones you can see in today's Vienna or Prague. And then the viewer's quickly taken indoors of the building where the Polish Radio station used to be, inexisting today, into the recording studio where the well known pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is on the air, in the middle of a concert created by that most Polish of all composers, the quintessential exiled patriot spilling his heart out in memory of his lost fatherland, also one of the most talented pianists of all time, Frederic Chopin. Chopin's music will return later in the film, and in the grandiose closing scene the surviving Szpilman will be shown once again, playing his music in front of a full-house audience in the Warsaw Philharmonic, barely a year after the end of the war. It has been pointed out by the all-knowing Polish film critics that such a 'structure' is typical of Polanski's works, as many of his movies begin and end with a very similar scene, the story coming back to the point where it had started. Is it something that comes out unnatural? Artificial? Awkward? Certainly not, and having witnessed the whole terrible madness and turmoil of war, the viewer barely notices the resemblance between that elegant, solemn concert at the end of the film and the more 'private,' intimate moment of Szpilman's opening performance so brutally interrupted by bombings. But the critics w i l l  analyze that, so let them do it. that's how they earn their bread.<br/><br/>But what annoyed me most about one unfriendly review of 'The Pianist,' published in one of Poland's most popular weeklies, 'Polityka,' was the unprofessional tone of the writing, which all in all sounded more like some piece written for a school paper by a cross young boy  envious of a friend's successful performance in a school play. The author just could not resist painting himself as a lone ranger daring to criticize a medium-quality film (or, as he puts it, an unfulfilled work made of a very promising story), while everyone else in Cannes was on their knees complimenting the director on his latest production. Very strange, because in my opinion a critic at work would better use their eyes and hearts and souls rather than their personal feelings, especially the pride and envy that devours them, when finally, after years of repetitive and imitative trash we have been given a truly great movie. And what do the critics do? They ignore completely the authentic and deeply moving power that radiates from the screen, and put down the absurd statement that Adrien Brody's acting is 'surprisingly emotionless, as if the whole story was happening next to him, without his participation.' And all that under a huge still of the actor walking by himself on a deserted ghetto street with scattered personal belongings of the people just driven away to be executed, with as desperate a look on his face as it's only possible, including red eyes screaming desperation, beautifully raised eyebrows and a half-open mouth- the face of a weeping, deeply disturbed man.<br/><br/>And in the end I'd like to add that, again in spite of what the critics say, this film is not a cleverly made string of tricks that Polanski turns on us, nor is it a line of very convincing 'real-life scenes' from the ghetto, shown more like stills on a projector than a film production. It is in fact a rather fast-paced story, only as fast as needed to give the viewer an honest picture of what war was like in Warsaw, or, for that matter, any other big town in Poland (Polanski himself spent much time in the ghetto in Cracow when he was a child). It has scenes of fighting: we learn about the outbreak and defeat of the Ghetto uprising in 1943, and the great Warsaw Uprising in August 1944, at the same time as Szpilman, already in hiding outside of the ghetto. We see examples of bravery and sacrifice, but also of spite, swindles and denunciation. But also we see people passing through Szpilman's life, touching him for a moment, then disappearing, then emerging again, by chance, people he has known, people he loved, befriended, people who helped and who used him to get their own. And finally the incredible character of the German officer, wonderfully placed by Thomas Kretschman, to whose kindness the artist was to owe his life, illuminates the story with a lighter, poetic shade of raw feeling. And, very important information for all my American friends: it's all in English, except for a few passages in German which I believe are accompanied by subtitles!"
