"MR_Heraclius","8","41","46","22 February 2020"," Underworld
","Movies like Underworld just don't end up with the calibre of actor that Underworld has under normal circumstances. Somehow, Underworld did though, and yes, it's very much a product of that early '00s industrial inspired age, but it is a solid, solid take on some realistic(ish) aspects of supernatural monster mythos."
"lotus_chief","8","184","246","4 February 2004"," Surprisingly good! I'm impressed!
","As soon as I saw the preview to this film I wrote it off as a silly Matrix rip-off trying to attack a subject that is so tired (vampires/werewolves). I really never had any intention of seeing Underworld until my girlfriend, who saw it in theaters, repeatedly suggested I watch it.  After watching the DVD just now I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.  I was completely into the story, which is surprisingly rich and engaging.  One would have to be a bit na√Øve not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films, most notably The Matrix.  It should be obvious to any free-thinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original, but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more.  This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from.  Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with the Matrix films.  The most refreshing aspect of this movie is the story, which surprisingly has many layers and puts a totally fresh new spin on the vampire/werewolf stories.  This aspect, along with the excellent visual effects makes Underworld an enjoyable experience.  A sequel for this is inevitable, and I must say that I'm really looking forward to it.  Underworld was a very pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>*** out of **** stars"

","Everything you've heard from the critics, everything you know about vampires and werewolves, everything that is standard in most fantasy/action films. Then you'll enjoy this film. I, unlike a lot of fans, will not claim that this is a move masterpiece, I will not claim that this will change movie making history. I, however, will go against the critics and say that this is a good film. Not getting a chance to see this in the cinema, when it came out on video I rented it out immediately. Now, at first, I could see what the critics meant it wasn't how the trailers depicted it and the script and acting in places was a bit rusty. I put it back and gave no more thought to it. However I soon found myself thinking about the film and the bits I'd enjoyed. I soon realised that this was good because it wasn't conventional and I couldn't stop thinking about it. There had been so many plot twists, so much to take in that I knew I had to see it a second time. This time I bought it, on DVD, and I found myself watching it again and again. This film gives you wonderful villains and just when you start to hate them something nastier comes along or they give you a motive which makes you confused. In one film the world which you are presented with at the beginning, Lycans (Werewolves) vrs. Vampires, is thrown into doubt. There are no longer good and evil, it is no longer this side versus this side and our hero Selene is stuck in the middle. The thing is every villain in this film seems to be fully justifiable in their actions yet completely nasty. I was trying, after falling in love with this film, to work out where it went wrong. I realised there was too much. You are thrown into this world and you have to keep up, there is no chance to sit down and work things out. That comes after seeing the film, this world explains itself through the characters actions. It is as if this world is real and we are meant to know about it already. Their is a history, their is a false history, their are legendary characters and not all of it is gone into in particular detail. Pieces of the world's history are just thrown in by the characters, as they would be in real life, with no long detailed explanation. That mixed with the cliff hanger ending, the promise of more characters from the past. MEans that even if you weren't sure about this film, the sequel Underworld: Evolution looks like it will be amazing."

","I knew I was in trouble when I saw the previews for this film, I loved them.<br/><br/>I know I would love this film. I knew that I would take much flack for loving this film. I know that I would not care. I did, I did and I don't. People who complain about films like this should spend more time at the library and less time at the cinema, and even less time telling everyone else how smart they are and how silly films like this are beneath them. Cut it out. Film is an art form about light, the lack of light and the bending of light, I thought the light was marvelous. What do you want from a film about a war between vampires and werewolves?, I know what I wanted and this film delivered. It was stylish, amusing and well paced. This film was a testament to people who know priorities, no big money star vehicles, just fine actors, young and old, wonderfully silly duologue, played straight, appropriate screeching metal music and lots of shooting and many scenes of Kate Beckensale doing her thing, marvelous. I adore Ms. Beckansale and this film almost allowed me to forgive her for ""Brokedown Palace""....almost. I can't wait for the sequel, I will be there when it opens, to blazes with all the snobby nae-Sayers who are unable to appreciate the genius of lines like ""You are acting like a pack of rabid dogs"" delivered, straight faced, by the disgusted head of the Lycon community and for the Amazing Ms Beckansale who managed to be every bit as sexy as she was in ""Haunted"" without removing any of her clothing...any of it, a true movie star if there ever was one."
"aran_turgon","8","46","63","29 May 2005"," A lot Better Than Expected
","When Underworld was release in the theaters I didn't bother seeing it, because of the bad reviews. I recently rented it because the video store didn't have anything better to offer, that I had not already seen, and I must say that I was very much surprised. It was far better than expected. I especially liked the acting of Bill Nighy as the vampire lord Viktor, and Micheal Sheen as the werewolf leader Lucian. I think that the plot is quite strong, and it does not ruin the vampire or werewolf legend. What i didn't like as much was the werewolf costumes. I didn't find the convincing. But apart from that, it was very entertaining, and I am looking forward to see the sequel i the theaters."
"aimless-46","Null","63","92","1 November 2005"," Features on the 2 Disc DVD Make It the Way to Go
","The ""Underworld"" sequel will soon be out so now is a good time to revisit the original. Personally I enjoyed this film more than any high budget ""mainstream movie"" I have seen in years years. But I can see many of the problems others have pointed out. Although the small action scenes work very well, the more elaborate scenes are disjointed, confused, and somewhat silly. If you compare the opening subway sequence to the train station sequence in ""The Untouchables"", you see an illustration of why less is better; and ""Underworld"" expends more ammo for less effect than anything this side of a ""Godzilla"" film.<br/><br/>Along with too much aggressive confusion is the silliest head-splitting in cinema history. Similar to the way Tarentino dispatched Lucy Lie in ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" (i.e. a delay in the actual detachment-I don't know which film did it first but Tarentine did it way better), the effects editor overlooked the need to show a slice in the head before it topples off. Surely this was just simple incompetence and not deliberate, because there are ways to show this (i.e. a line) that would still make it a relatively shocking scene.<br/><br/>The story itself breaks too many horror genre conventions and fails to generate much real suspense (although the climax is somewhat surprising). But ultimately these problems did not interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>This was because it is first and foremost a Kate Beckensale's vehicle, as emphasized by recent trailer for the sequel. It is likely that your feeling about the film will depend on your impression of Beckensale. She has never looked better and I'm just talking about her face which I could watch in closeup for two hours without the slightest complaint. She is increasingly an absolute ringer for a 1940-ish Loretta Young. An earlier comment noted that: ""This 30 year old has the figure and face of a magazine model, with the bored flat expression to match. Pour this tight little body into a rubber suit with especially reflective pants and you have something to anchor your movie"". All this is very true but add intelligence, subtlety and nuance not seen since Diana Rigg was playing Mrs. Peel. The film does not demonstrate her range (you have to watch ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" for the best evidence of that) but it is one of those rare cases where you can't imagine anyone but her in the role.<br/><br/>The production design, lighting, and cinematography are all excellent and the DVD has some great features explaining these aspects of the production.<br/><br/>The film has a nice consistent look that fits very well with the story. I don't understand the comments that are negative overall, or what films these people are unfavorably comparing it to, can't be the garbage films that have been coming to mainstream theaters over the past few years. Bottom line, if you like the genre, appreciate stylish production design, and think highly of Ms. Beckensale you should make it a point to see this movie."
"EmperorNortonII","7","52","77","10 April 2004"," New Blood For Vampire Legends
","""Underworld"" is no ordinary horror movie.  It tells the tale of a secret war between vampires and werewolves (or as they're called here, lycans).  Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a lethal assassin on the vampire side.  Scott Speedman plays Michael Corvin, a man who finds himself wrapped up in this brutal war.  This movie is rather well done, despite all the blood and graphic violence.  The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brooding, which fits very well with the story.  The script is interesting, using science to bring the vampire and werewolf legends into the modern age (such as saying the lycans are allergic to silver).  The story of the bitter rivalry between to two mythic characters would make a fascinating prequel, and the sequel should follow ""Underworld"" with real impact as well."
"wnterstar","7","146","233","11 January 2005"," Better than people want to admit
","I can understand why some people were unwilling to give this movie a chance. I started out thinking, OK, so Anna Valerious from Van Helsing is now a female Blade! I was wrong! I also went in thinking it was going to be a push button movie with no real twists.<br/><br/>Again I was wrong.<br/><br/>I didn't really see the twist coming at the end (surprising, since I figured out who Kaiser Sosay was!) I liked this move for a lot of reasons. The darkness in the movie wasn't oppressive. The acting was good, and the story strong.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10."

","I have just watched Underworld for the second time, and I was gratified to discover that it was every bit as good as I remembered - if not more so. No two ways about it; this is one terrific movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes and some of the special effects could be better, but the movie has utterly superb style, mood, plot and acting! The story itself is probably the best vampire-slash-werewolf story I've encountered (though admittedly I don't know many, as I'm not really a horror fan), and the ending is just fabulous.<br/><br/>I also just love the thing about the chief vampires sleeping for predetermined periods of time, and are then revived - this is incredibly cool.<br/><br/>And the whole thing is borne aloft by the great skill of the British lead actors - particularly hard-hitting cutie Kate Beckinsale, wild-eyed Michael Sheen and that late bloomer of a genuine acting icon, Bill Nighy, who gives an unflinching performance.<br/><br/>It won't be long now till Underworld: Evolution comes out - and I'm just thrilled at the prospect of seeing more of this stylish world! If they can fulfill my expectations of the sequel, I will be making an upward correction of my rating of this movie from 8 to 9, because then we'll have a larger universe which makes sense in a larger context. That's how a good movie franchise should function.<br/><br/>Crossing fingers!"

"RaidaS","10","41","63","18 May 2004"," Original Vampire & Werewolf film
","I loved Underworld. But I love most decent Vampire or Werewolf films, so that's a bit biased, eh? Basing the two species on a genetic, scientific idea makes them work exceedingly well, and removes all those problems that mysticism brings to a film, like reflections or holy items. This Vamp-Werewolf model make explanations easy, rather than requiring long prologues or in-depth discussions. The whole 'virus' idea is logical, and easy to follow. It's slick, modern, fast-paced action combined with classic, Gothic Vampire & Werewolf ideas, like the Vamp's high-tech weapons being kept in a massive, stately manor. I'm a real fan of the whole colour scheme, with few colours used in any one shot, and blues used for almost everything, keeping it looking cool, and sleek. I am also a Kate Beckinsale fan, and I love Action films that don't use women like an extra person to shout 'watch out!' or hit someone over the head. K.Beckinsale's character is great for this, it's someone who could easily be a guy. (Although, I'm thinking the outfit'd need a bit of enlarging if it were)"
"Elswet","10","51","84","19 September 2003"," Underworld. A new legend is born.
","Let me start this review by saying that, while this work is NOT scary, it was not MEANT to be scary. This production was classed into the genre of ""Horror,"" strictly due to the ""monster"" factor. There are ""tense"" moments, to be sure, but this is not a ""boo!"" kind of movie. There is; however, plenty of action, lots of well enacted drama and wonderful realistic effects. I was actually amazed with the apparent lack of high-dollar effects, the almost Rice-ian Vampire clans lounging in the well designed lush and lavish ""mansion,"" the gritty tension held throughout the movie, and the stunningly clever costume designs. But what held me mostly in thrall were the effects.<br/><br/>The effects were so well done, they were believable. They explain that the older Lycan can change at will, regardless of the moon's cycle...with that in mind, the way the werewolves' mandible bones FORCED themselves out and into place was dead ON. Changing at will would BE like that, especially in times of anger or great stress. Someone (possibly Wiseman?) had heard (and correctly believed) that ""less is more,"" because the effects were done in such a way as to appear REAL and not...simply more Hollywood ""Matrix"" flash. <br/><br/>These scenes were so well done; so well directed, filmed and portrayed that we could, even if for a short time, believe the things we were watching...were possible. The wonderfully unique bullets used by both sides are absolutely brilliant. It reminded me if the horribly campy western/vampire movie made about 10 or 15 years ago entitled, ""Sundown,"" where the vampire hunters used wooden bullets.<br/><br/>I am simply stunned to discover that this is Len Wiseman's first attempt in the field as Director. I eagerly look forward to more brilliance from this man. (He was also one of the writers of the original literary work.) If this is his first attempt, we may have just been introduced to the next Spielberg. Personally, I'm hoping he leans more towards being the next Hitchcock. <br/><br/>The weaponry Selene (Kate Beckinsale) utilized was quite unique and completely interested the small audience in my hometown theater. When she drew her stars and threw them simultaneously at the Lycan; when the scene slowed to an almost stop just long enough to allow you to SEE the throwing stars as they CHANGED into much more deadly projectiles, was absolutely excellent. AND was also the ONLY scene in this entire movie which even remotely reminded me of ""The Matrix."" The other critics keep droning on and on with comparisons between these two movies, and frankly, I just don't see it. <br/><br/>Also, ""Blade"" has been used as a source of comparison. The only similarities between ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"" are that Viktor, the oldest and strongest of the Vampiric race of ""Pure Bloods,"" uses a sword. Oh, and there are Vampires. Those were the ONLY common points, as far as I could tell. This is an original work; not a petty rip-off or a ""jumble of other movies."" This is a very creative and unique attempt; a successful one, if you ask me. <br/><br/>While guns were used more than I would have liked, the additional weaponry chosen for this endeavor was not your standard action-flick fare. One of the vampire ""Death Dealers"" uses a pair of 10' whips quite well. And don't forget about the bullets I mentioned...what an extraordinary intellectual and creative power. <br/><br/>The costumes were kept simple, yet served the purpose of helping to set the mood. Two words...understated elegance. Absolutely brilliant. Some have said that the story line is hard to follow, or that there is no discernible plot. Let me be frank. This is not a movie for the squeamish, nor is it a movie for those who like to be able to NOT concentrate on the plot. Sure, there is enough visual eye candy to keep most casual fans of the genre entertained, but there is also a very complicated and beautifully sinister plot and subplots going on beneath the flying bullets and shots of Kate Beckinsale's butt in latex and leather. <br/><br/>The Shakespearean relationship between Selene and Michael (Scott Speedman) is well written and pleasantly portrayed, in the midst of all that darkness and drama. A bit of candle-light to shine hope into the darkness of despair, as it were. The story is an upgraded spin on a timeless classic, with enough additional plot and sub-plot to keep even the most common movie-goer interested. The war between the Vampires and the Lycan has raged for more than a thousand years. The Lycan, once the serving class to the Vampire, had risen against their masters and won their freedom. But was that the real story? Was their freedom truly the motivating force which stoked the fires of this war for this long? In the center of this war are Selene (Vampire) and Michael (Lycan). Their love of one another is forbidden by every Vampire Covenant written, but will that be enough to stop them from falling in love? <br/><br/>As one of the chosen ""Death Dealers,"" an organization within the Vampire Clans trained and equipped to hunt and kill Lycans, Selene is faced with a decision most dire: sell out and live? or be true to herself and die? Will her loyalty to her ancient maker keep her from making the right choice? <br/><br/>And that is where the sub-plot kicks into overdrive and makes you sit back and say, ""Oh wow! No kidding?!"" at the darkling twists in the plot. I was thoroughly entertained by this work, and cannot wait to add the DVD to the Vampire section of my horror collection. Superb acting; rich depth of character; talented, creative directing; and realistic effects put this movie at the top of all other Vampyre movies, for me. <br/><br/>It earns an ambitious 9.7/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

"mstomaso","6","40","69","3 January 2006"," Expect Nothing, get a little more
","I enjoyed Underworld. I expected it to be absurd, awful, plot-less and pointless. While it is certainly not the most brilliant and original story, nor does it teem with insight about the human condition, its not awful, its plot heavy, and it really isn't pointless. It's just a tad absurd, though.<br/><br/>This is the story of a human (Scott Speedman) entangled in a six hundred year old war between vampires and werewolves, and the vampire death dealer (Beckinsale) whose compassion for him permits her to seek the truth in ways that few of her species have before.<br/><br/>The acting is of variable quality. Kate Beckinsale is wonderfully cute, and does a pretty fair job of acting when she's not doing a Keanu Reeves/Neo impression. Michael Sheen provides a great supporting performance. Shane Brolly isn't really up to the task, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The script is good, although it's full of clich√©s. The editing and directing are both impeccable, and help to move everything along at an entertaining and brisk pace.<br/><br/>This is a fun action-oriented film, with stylish darkness and enough originality to make it worth seeing. Mildly recommended for vampire and werewolf fans."

","""Underworld"" culls two races from mythology, vampires and werewolves, and has them co-existing in the same setting. While the two are staples of the horror genre (""Dracula"" and ""The Wolf Man""), this doesn't play out like a traditional horror movie. This action packed story will please horror fans and convert new ones due to the melding of movie types to create a fresh interpretation to a century old genre.<br/><br/>A male human (Scott Speedman) unwittingly becomes involved in an on going war between vampires and werewolves. When a female vampire (Kate Beckinsale) notices the werewolves following this human, she becomes suspicious and begins to investigate why he is so important, even if it changes everything she has ever known about her life and vampire history.<br/><br/>This monster movie follows the age-old traditions established in the early novels (by Bram Stoker) and movies (""Werewolf Of London"") featuring vampires and lycanthropes. Of late, there's been some wanna-be trendy, horror movies that have thrown the standards out the window. Those standards are comforting and we, the audience, expect to see them. Vampires deteriorate in sunlight leading to instant death. Werewolves can only be killed by a silver bullet. ""Underworld"" takes these traditions, builds on them and makes them their own.<br/><br/>While it reads as a horror, it plays more like a gangster movie. Both races participate in gunplay with specially modified bullets to instantly kill their opponents. The werewolves are brutish goons, wanna-be gangsters with more brawn than brains. On the flip side, the vampires are like a communal family with hierarchy, ancient customs and they're legitimate business owners which funds their criminal endeavours.<br/><br/>Due to the aforementioned gunplay, this is more violent than gory. It's still bloody but there are no scenes that'll make you queasy or nauseous. The violence is another reason why it has a gangster feel about it.<br/><br/>There's a class system subtext that runs through this movie. The lower class werewolves battling the upper class vampires. Working class is possibly a better adjective for the werewolves. They are masculine, unkempt and unsophisticated. On the other hand, the gothic vampires are immaculately dressed with a expensive sense of style. They lounge around looking glamourous as if they're supermodels at a cocktail party. Opulence and high class is the style the production and costume designer has given these blood suckers.<br/><br/>Beckinsale's quite fetching in her erotic, PVC, full body costume. Her bondage like outfit's more interesting than her intentionally emotionless performance. One wonders why she didn't keep her British accent as the cast is made up of international actors with a pot-pourri of different brogues? It's good to see her in a lead role, above the title credit, where she holds her own portraying a strong, forceful character. Of late, she's played the glorified girlfriend part (eg. Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor""). Here, she's independent, without a partner to justify her significance. While this is the kind of role a man would normally play, she's still feminine and sexy without having to show any flesh.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy has a supporting role as an elder vampire who's resurrected before his time in order to help Beckinsale. Nighy's rightfully become popular in the last few years. He's adept in any part he plays even a centuries-old vampire with superhuman strength. His climatic fight scene never draws unintentional laughs which shows what a convincing actor he is.<br/><br/>The other name star of this movie is Bacardi. Product placement is rife during the opening sequence in an underground train station. This is quite surprising when you watch the entire movie.<br/><br/>Never at any time is there any indication where and when this movie is set. The gothic architecture and vehicle licence plates have you thinking that this could be somewhere in Europe. There are no title cards, characters speak with differing accents and there are no recognizable landmarks used as locations. All we do know is is that where ever they are they have Bacardi. If the moviemakers were trying to create a nondescript world, alien from our own, then why use blatant product placement for Bacardi?<br/><br/>The colour film stock has been manipulated intentionally to give a blue hue to it. This reinforces the gothic style of the movie. Blue isn't just a colour, it's also an emotion. It's constantly raining which adds to the cold look the cinematographer and production designer have created. These races are unemotional people which also strengthens the blue tone.<br/><br/>Computer generated visual effects were used for the movie which is far removed from John Landis' ""An American Werewolf In London"". While the special effects are impressive, there is no mystery into how they were achieved. Special effects and make up were a real art form before the days of CGI. These technicians are a dying breed due to computers. It's a shame that moviemakers rely heavily on CGI as it's slowly becoming run of the mill.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Underworld""'s a good action/horror/gangster movie with a strong female lead. This hybrid is filled with polished set pieces and seamless CGI. There's talk that this is the first of a proposed trilogy and I hope the next two will be as strong as this."
"dee.reid","9","29","55","20 September 2003"," Should be a comic book
","For all I know, there could already be a comic book in the works for the vampire-werewolf fantasy, ""Underworld.""  I just got back from seeing it and I must say that this movie should stand up pretty well in the face of all the ridiculous (read: pointless, useless) ""Matrix; Crow; Blade"" comparisons. I've heard that this movie is based on some RPG game I have never heard of and if that's true, I don't really care; this movie could probably beat the hell out of it.  <br/><br/>""Underworld"" really has a unique feel to it.  The story doesn't stand up well under a whole lot of thought, but that doesn't really matter.  What should really capture some people, are the special effects and the sets. There are some pretty nifty werewolf transformation scenes that certainly deserve Oscar attention.  The sets, highly Victorian as they are, also should get some props.  This movie is going to be a comic book; I can tell. It certainly has the look, feel, and story of one, yet that still doesn't make it bad.  <br/><br/>Speaking of the story, though it isn't strong, it gets to you.  The thought that vampires and werewolves have been duking it out for thousands of years right under our noses is intriguing, even if it hasn't been fleshed out that well in the film.  Even still, it gets you thinking about everything that war means to them and us.<br/><br/>As for the action scenes, they are certainly well shot and violent. Surprisingly, there isn't that much gore here either.  But what is really surprising is that the movie doesn't offer us pointless action scenes to fill in for lack of story; there's actually meaning behind it all.<br/><br/>""Underworld"" is a pretty well-done fantasy that deserves to be immortalized in the comics.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I saw this first in a theatre in 2003. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - Kate Beckinsale is a vampire looking incredibly hot in ridiculously tight leather matrix style clothes whose job it is to eliminate the werewolves as part of the centuries old war between the two species. Her acting is good too. Things change when Beckinsale tries to protect a human, Speedman who is targetted by the werewolves for some reasons. The movie has a distinctively Gothic look, with great attention given to the backdrop. Every inch of the cinematography is polished. The architecture and costumes are true fashion statements. This world is so dense with aggressiveness it is almost surreal. Borrowing from The Matrix and Blade, the director Len Wiseman made Underworld more of a goth action flick n less of a vampire/werewolf. Nonetheless pretty enjoyable action flick. Was happy that none of those hand held shaky cam stuff was added."

If you were a Werewolf, wouldn't you try to fight back against the Vampires during the day???  Oh, wait...  I forgot.

","This is another one of those types of films that should not be taken too seriously. If you watch the film from a critical standpoint then you will miss how enjoyable the film can be. <br/><br/>Those who have no interest in vampires etc will not like this film but for those who do, this film is well worth watching. While the script may not be perfect, the actors manage to keep a straight face and are entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>What many will like is the back story of Kate Beckinsale's character and the history between the vampires and the lycans. This may not add a lot of depth to the characters but it succeeds in progressing the story.Both Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy are great as the leaders of two opposing forces. The two steel the film whenever they are on screen.<br/><br/>Since the film is about vampires vs lycans, you can expect a lot of bloody action. The actions scenes can be compared to The Matrix and Equilibrium but they are still fun to watch. Even though some scenes do look dated (the lycans often look like puppets at times) they are still enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>The sequel may have improved CGI effects but that is not enough for it to triumph over the original."

","Once again I find myself disappointed with a vampire movie, there was potential here but I think it was squandered and what was produced was mediocre at best. The plot was confusing for the most part, it prompted me more than once to say, ""OK, that's nice but why the hell does this matter""<br/><br/>I am also disappointed by the serious lack of writing/directing/acting talent in this movie. The dialouge is not capturing or memorable, nothing stands out from this silly plotline flecking with gratuitous firefights. If making a good horror film is as simple as using a dark filter on your camera to mute the colors and dressing bad actors in black, this would be a hit.<br/><br/>The lead actress did what she could with what was written for her, but there are failed attempts to establish depth in the character, these are writer's faults. However acting was not a talent requisite for ""Kraven"" or any of the ""Lycans."" The pathetic accents and horrid vocal patterns nearly made my ears bleed. I guess good directing is ""you, talk real loud and overdramatic"".<br/><br/>All in all I disliked this movie, I wish there were more good Vampire films, but alas no one can fill the bill it seems"

The development of the characters seemed silly and contrived.<br/><br/>This is another example of Hollywood abandoning logic, reason, storytelling, plot, and good characters, in exchange for big guns explosions, and special effects, special effects, special, effects.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of; The Fast and the Furious, The Blade movies, and Tomb Raider.

","*Minor Spoilers - don't worry, you spot them coming a mile away*<br/><br/>Some of the fights were decent. The morphing thing on the werewolves was good. The costumes were interesting, if not a tad redundant, and the setting kept very gothic and fitting for most of the film.<br/><br/>That is where the virtues of this film end.<br/><br/>We have been waiting almost ten years for another decent vampire movie, and we keep getting cliched disappointment after another. Vampire culture barely factored into it. We hardly see them demonstrate any of their powers. This could very easily be about human werewolf-hunters, and the plot would need only a little tweaking. That aside, the plot was still quite bad. The avenging-murdered-family bit is getting very old and very tired and it's pulled off in uncreative enough a way not to give them the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>When Selene (Beckinsale) and Mike (Speedman) inevitably fall in love, you begin to wonder why, as nothing has really happened that merits any feelings for one another. Their first kiss comes from out of nowhere. I realize this is primarily an action movie but let's put SOMETHING behind the relationships.<br/><br/>That being said, the action sequences that were rewarding to watch were few and far between, and none of them involved Selene. Kate Beckinsale seems very out of place in a fight. And in the final battle, the death of the big bad guy is actually very comical, and the cinema I was in burst into laughter when he died, which I somehow doubt was the intent.<br/><br/>
And finally, as a horror film, it doesn't even try to scare you. I can't see it being considered a horror film in any serious capacity.<br/><br/>And as a detail, why didn't we just call them ""Werewolves"" instead of ""Lycans"" which sounds exactly like ""Lichens."""

","I am stunned and horrified to read the comments on this movie.<br/><br/>I can scarcely find words to describe how badly this movie stinks. I can only assume that many of the US reviewers were fooled by a bunch of English accents and dreary shots of a dismal Eastern-European city into thinking that this was somehow a classy piece of work.<br/><br/>Beckinsale was a leather clad plank - I felt no sympathy or empathy for her character simply because her character did not exist - she was just speaking a few words.<br/><br/>In fact this applies to damn near everyone else in this mess. There were virtually no character building moments at all - we just have no idea who these 2-dimensional S&M fetish-freaks are at all.<br/><br/>There is no plot to speak of - all we need to know is laid out wholesale in the opening monotone monologue. If the director had not been so keen to slap his now-fiancee up on screen at every opportunity, he might have realised that there was a story to tell - that of the unwitting human caught in the middle of events he doesn't understand. Had we seen the story through his eyes we would have been shocked at the initial battle and surprised as the extent of the 'underworld' is revealed to us. Quite simply the director is telling the wrong story.<br/><br/>Instead the movie treats the audience like bunch of slack-jawed morons and spoon feeds us the whole story up front just so we don't have to worry our pretty little heads with such nasty complicated stuff as plot.<br/><br/>Okay. I love vampire movies. All of them Nosferatu, right through to Blade, and I'm pretty sure that in all of these pretty much the whole point is that vampires are like, *evil* and, you know, *drink blood*.<br/><br/>Wearing a bit of leather bondage tat and moping around a big old house at night does not make you a vampire. Where was the blood-sucking? We barely even saw a set of fangs - these were simply the most boring vampires I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The werewolves were a bit better, but the CGI was very poor and the man-to-sort of mutant pig-gorilla thing transformation is totally eclipsed by twenty year old classics like American Werewolf and The Howling.<br/><br/>The less said about the noise which passes for a soundtrack the better. In fact I've said too much already. So I'll stop.<br/><br/>I hated this film so much I can't even be bothered to rant about it any more.<br/><br/>Go see this film if you want leave feeling like someone hit you over the head and stole your money - or just find a dark street and wait to be mugged for a similar, but possibly more entertaining experience."
"Warwolf243","1","27","58","19 April 2005"," This movie was a complete BUST
","Underworld was a travesty.<br/><br/>A complete and utter travesty.<br/><br/>This movie was touted as featuring a battle between werewolves and vampires. Yet the movie rarely saw any real combat besides overly clich√©d gun battles. The plot, for much of the movie is non-existent. Werewolves were once slaves to vampires until one werewolf (just a side note werewolves are called Lycans in this film, by the way) took a vampire for a bride. Her father, Viktor, kills his own daughter and makes Lucian, the Lycan in question, watch. This starts the war. Mainly cause Viktor feared the creation of a Lycan-Vampire mixed breed.<br/><br/>All this comes out in about the last ten to fifteen minutes or so of the movie by the way.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we have Selene, a 'Death Dealer' (a vampire who hunts werewolves), who hunts them out of revenge, falling in love with Michael Corvin (I'm having flashbacks to the hideous Crow 3 here folks, even if the guy's last name IS from Crow 2) who's the descendant of some guy named Corvinus or something like that. Supposedly he has the potential to become both vamp and Lycan. Which he does.<br/><br/>And yet in the end it's SELENE who kills off Viktor, who had killed her family 600 years prior to the events of the film. This is another clich√©d plot twist. I mean come on. ""Werewolves killed my family, so I kill them to satiate my lust for vengeance against werewolves who may have already been killed anyway."" Yeah, who the hell DIDN'T see that coming by the time this movie was ended? Seriously, show of hands.<br/><br/>Any takers? No? Good for you. It's too completely obvious.<br/><br/>Here's the kicker. Lucian (Lucien?) has been trying to turn himself into a cross-breed Lycan-Vamp, which would make him more powerful than either race. Well, as you might expect, Michael gets bitten by a Lycan. Goes through most of the movie having 'hallucinations' which are actually Lucian's memories of what started the war between the two races. Gets shot and nearly dies because of some idiot SOB (who is Viktor's second in command of course.), gets bitten by Selene, and becomes the hybrid Viktor is so afraid of seeing come into existence. Cue the only DECENT fight scene in this movie. Viktor and Michael go at it pretty well. It looks like it's going to become the sole redeeming quality in this movie. Then Viktor gets Michael in a headlock. (Hey, when did this turn into a wrestling match?) Guess what. Selene gets involved and slices Viktor's head in half diagonally.<br/><br/>Making the concept that Michael is supposed to be more powerful than both Lycans and Vampires (and let me point out here that Lycans in this film are also supposed to be immortal once changed, and that all either race has to do is a simple bite.), abso-fricking-lutely POINTLESS! Whoever wrote this movie must have been on crack. I mean it. The story was contrived, the 'fight scenes' shallow except for Michael vs. Viktor, and they actually managed to RUIN that fight by having Selene get in the killing blow. This type of flagrant sexism in horror movies in which the villain/monster/alien from beyond/whatever almost always dies at the hands of a woman has always dragged down my enjoyment of most horror flicks in general, and utterly annoys me throughout Underworld as Selene is like a female Blade in reverse with NONE of the potential that Blade has to be in potential danger even if he's just faking it. I never get the impression that Selene is in any way harmable because she's far too much like Blade mixed with the Punisher mixed with Daredevil. She also is the driving force of this film, which means that Michael, whom she's supposed to be in love with, and who, from the apparent standpoint of the movie, is supposed to be the character around which all of this utter stinkbomb revolves, is little more than a footnote, and appears in barely a quarter of the movie. He is more or less just a helpless idiot throughout most of the film. Then, they remove any power and presence his transformation is supposed to give him by not only having Viktor in a position to kill him, which should have ended with Viktor's hold being broken by Michael's supposedly superior strength speed and power, but by having him be rescued by Selene, who has basically been the only character who really DOES -anything- in this entire movie.<br/><br/>I put off buying Underworld for almost two years because I was wary of it. Mostly because of the way I disliked the werewolf costumes in the trailers. I will admit, I have come to like the werewolf suits, but not enough to consider them a saving grace of the film.<br/><br/>This film managed to ruin the one thing which could have redeemed it in my eyes. And sadly, it hints at a possible sequel at the end with another of the Vampires who is supposedly as old as Marcus and possibly a halfbreed himself taking over as the main villain. Which means this pile of utter waste is likely going to have a baby brother.<br/><br/>Avoid it at all costs folks. This movie was a bomb. BIG TIME.<br/><br/>As a fan of both werewolves and vampires, I feel embarrassed on behalf of both creatures for this disgusting film."

The movie is about a secret war between Vampires and Lycans. The movie follows Selene, a vampire Death Dealer, that discover a Lycan plot.<br/><br/>Underworld has riveting action scenes that are fun and stylistic to watch. These action scenes have a great gothic style to the scenes. These action scenes are also headlined with a good performance by Kate Beckinsale. The action in this movie are incredibly visceral and gory to watch. The action scenes are a big plus to this movie.<br/><br/>The movie's world and characters are interesting. The movie does well with its dialogue and history. The movie spending the time to do this is a nice change of pace as the movie uses it as a break between the action scenes. It is nice to see the characters have an actual history with one another that should have been expanded upon further.<br/><br/>The movie is vapid in its plot and characters. I wish that the movie focused on the character history more than the strange plot. The plot seemed like it wanted to be an excuse to have action and a reasonable plot. The movie made many strange concessions to have both. The movie should have been more of an action movie or a plot driven movie and not both. There are still some
good scenes in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend Underworld.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"hinurdin","Null","13","25","4 February 2004"," Nice, underrated movie
","I am surprised to find that at the time I cast my rating, this movie only got a 6.3/10. I think it is actually much more entertaining than that. First of all, this flick has what seem to be novel ideas in it, in particular the introduction of a kind of ""kinship"" between humans, vampires and werewolves (referred to as Lycans in the movie). I don't intend to give away spoilers, but let me just say that there is a really surprising twist in the second half of the movie. When you go through the first half, you think that the plot has been given away too early. But to my delight, this was not the case, due to the surprise twist I mentioned earlier. The story can be viewed as a metaphor for racial conflicts and prejudices that exist among humans and it pictures how senseless hatred is borne from generation to generation through cover-ups, deceit and misinformation, and how heavy sacrifices have to be made to bring end to conflict and reach some peace agreement or truce. The action sequences in the movie were also quite decent, although not quite up to the standards of movies in The Matrix trilogy. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely perfect for the role of the female vampire Selene. I must say she looks stunning in her movie hairdo and she is totally hot in the tight black vampiress latex attire. Bill Nighy (who recently played Billy Mack in the feel good X-mas movie ""Love Actually"") has also been aptly cast as the powerful vampire overlord Viktor. He plays convincingly as the hate-mongering bigot of a leader who is willing to do anything to perpetuate the enmity and hatred of the vampires towards the Lycans. The only weakness I found in this movie is the rather anti-climactic ending. But, highly recommended nonetheless.<br/><br/>I give it 8/10."

","First time director Len Wiseman definitely knows how to make a good looking movie, but not much else. Mr. Wiseman has nailed down the look that is evident is most of today's vampire movies: dark, grainy, gothic, leathery, bluish hued skin and RAIN!  Lots and lots of RAIN.  Most annoyingly, outside of the terrible overacting of Shane Brolly as Craven (he espouses anger in EVERY look and in EVERY word he utters) and the stoic, zombie-like acting of Kate Beckinsale is the director's use of DOORS! Every damn scene of this movie either starts or ends (and sometimes both)with someone slamming open/closing a door, or gate. My guess is that doors must swing to and fro over 100 times in this movie.  This must have been the editor's first movie and asked the director to use the doors as cues for his cuts. Once I pointed this out to my friend, he couldn't stop laughing every time a door swung.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty thin and close to being stupid. Plot spoiler follows: Why would the leader of the vampires and the werewolves want to create a mixed, super breed of half vampire, half wolf? The new super wolfpire would surely doom the vampires and werewolves to extinction. Secondly, we are continuously told that the vampires defeated the werewolves and pushed THEM to the edge of extinction.  Yet, except for the finale, every fight between vampires and werewolves is dominated by the werewolves.<br/><br/>
So if you just want to have a good laugh and watch a stylish vampire flick, ""Underworld"" is for you.  But if your looking for a crafty, fast beat, well directed movie (e.i. ""Blade II""), it ain't this one.  You'll be bored to death and you'll learn to HATE DOORS!"
"SimonHeide","1","20","42","19 January 2008"," Worst cinematic experience in a very long time.
","I really think that this movie was made for young, self-centered people with no knowledge of the vampire lore. It made me furious to watch Selene as I saw her as a very narcissistic person who constantly was too aware of her own appearance. It made me feel like I was watching somebody up on the catwalk each time I saw her. The way she jumped, walked, shot with her guns and the way she looked from under her hair. I was so annoyed. Completely without any kind of character. It has been stated that she falls in love with Michael Corvin but that is something we have to deduce from the fact that she kisses him. I didn't see any affection, tenderness or soft spoken words between them. She is just too hollow.<br/><br/>So much from the vampire lore was omitted that it felt really weird. What had become of their demonic nature, why didn't they drink blood and, as others have pointed out, how come that they cast a shadow? As we learn, they are still vulnerable to sun-light, but there isn't any during the whole film.<br/><br/>Were we supposed to feel any sympathy for either side in the conflict? I didn't at all and basically I think that if you do not engage yourself in the protagonist then the movie has failed seriously. The only thing I was hoping for was, that everybody ended up killing each other.<br/><br/>I don't think that I will spoil anything by saying, that there will be a show-down in the end. Let me just say that they should really, really have used a stand-in/stunt-man for poor old Viktor. So in order to make this film a good experience you really have to stop thinking and just drift with it - and this was simply impossible for me.<br/><br/>regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

","Vampires and werewolves are fighting against each other in a battle of hundred of years. In the present days, the gorgeous vampire Selena (Kate Beckinsale) is a werewolf killer warrior. Both races use very special guns: the vampires use a bullet made of silver nitrate, while the werewolves use a sort of special bullet with daylight glow. The werewolves chase the human Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), and Lucian (Michael Sheen), the leader of them that is supposed to be dead, bites Michael. Selena is intrigued with the interest of the werewolves in Michael, and while protecting him, she falls in love with him. Kaven (Shane Brolly), the leader of the vampires' coven, does not pay much attention on the observations of Selena about Michael. She decides to wake-up Viktor (Bill Nighy), the ancient leader of the vampires, when deep secrets are disclosed. <br/><br/>'Underworld' is a great Gothic adventure. Once all the characters are night creatures, the story takes place along the night and the dark photography is wonderful. The acting is good, but the grimaces of Shane Brolly, trying to look evil, are the weak point of the film. However, the story hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): 'Underworld ‚Äì Anjos da Noite' ('Underworld ‚Äì Angels of the Night')<br/><br/>Note: On 12 November 2006 I saw this film again. <br/><br/>Note: On 27 January 2017 I saw this film again."

","I read through these review and find it interesting how some people ""got it"" and some must have seen the 1997 Underworld movie with Dennis Leary and done a review for this Underworld by accident. This movie creates a new world in which vampires and lycans don't get along and actually wage war on each other. There are some good performances from most of the leads, with the exception of Scott Speedman (who was given a very short script) and the actor playing Kraven, who terribly overacted his part. Considering the small budget this film had to work with, it's actually pretty well-made technically and attempts to do quite a bit. A solid soundtrack, nice visuals and some good action scenes (not enough for some people, evidently) help create a solid film-going experience. Pacing is sometimes poor (Wiseman's first movie) and some shots are questionable, but this is hardly less than a 6/10 film. When I see lower marks, it makes me think there are either some drama queens watching the movie or people that just didn't pay attention to what was going on on screen."

","It took me a long time to see UNDERWORLD. I only heard bad things about it and the trailer didn't evoke anything in me. So when I finally rented the movie and played it on my home theater system, I was totally knocked-out. From the opening sequence, with the narration provided by Kate Beckinsale, I was hooked.<br/><br/>Is it a profound film? Not really. Is the acting brilliant? Not really. Is the story complex? Not really. Does the film look good? Yep. Are the action scenes well conceived? You betcha. Is the Goth atmosphere a near perfect blend of old and new? Yes, yes, yes.<br/><br/>I like UNDERWORLD a lot. I believe it's the best ""comic book"" film ever made. It evokes a lot in me, the Goth in me. Personally speaking, I think UNDERWORLD is a near perfect blend of Goth aesthetics: it mixes the old (vampires, werewolves, myths, old world setting, etc) with the new (the sleekness of technology, androgyny, DNA, bleakness of the future...). All of this in one sexy package.<br/><br/>It's Grand, almost over-the-top and yet it's very minimalistic in its approach to the story/action. It takes itself very seriously but fortunately, it never crosses the line into camp, which would have made the seriousness intolerable.<br/><br/>I usually don't care for action movies with a lot of guns and shooting but here, the gun play is almost part of the soundtrack. The repetitious gunfire is almost hypnotic. When I watch UNDERWORLD, I'm almost in a trance. The composition and look of the film are near perfect. I wouldn't change anything about it. The battle between Selene and Viktor at the end is simply great and razor sharp. Arf. The only weak point in the film is Shane Brolly as Kraven. Wow, what a bad actor! But the weakest link can be easily overlooked when everything else is almost pitch perfect.<br/><br/>There are very few films made these days that make it on my favorite films list. UNDERWORLD is on it and it's one of my favorite films ever."

THe wolves do seem to be the stronger characterization although it truly comes across as a gamer script.

Someone's gotta teach these people how to wear black.<br/><br/>
POSSIBLE SPOILER The secret to the film is that vampires are wimps.  Apparently anyone with a gun can fight wearwolves and the vampires don't have any advantage.  Once a vampire jumps and climbs on the ceiling; in the opening scene the lead jumps off a high building easily.  For the rest of the movie vampires seem to forget they aren't human.  Oh, look it's a werewolf, I'm scared!  In one scene vampires are hunting the werewolves which easily hide right in front of them in the shadows.  Apparently vampires have trouble seeing in shadows (or maybe werewolves have some power we don't know about)  It's obviously some gamer role play rule that they forget to explain.  (Yes, I played the vampire games and as I recall, I could see in the dark, in fact, I also could run fast)  Anyway, the whole thing is a gun fight in which some people who happen to be immortal, except that they are really easy to kill fight off super werewolves (the writer must have played a werewolf in the game)<br/><br/>And what's with the knives?  Am I to believe that vampires in this world will fall over because someone pricks them with a knife?  Or is this more game play rule BS?  SPOILER - the lead gets stabbed by the lead werewolf whilst driving a car and passes out from blood loss.  FROM BLOOD LOSS! WTF???  She's supposed to be a vampire.  For chrissake, a knife in the shoulder would only p**s off most people I know.

","Great fantasy/horror films are hard to come by and one of the great ones that comes to mind is Underworld. The introduction of Kate Beckinsale explaining the war between vampires and lycans (werewolves) was a tremendous start and hooks the viewer right off the bat. Len Wiseman really put his heart into this story, the craft is just exceptional. Kate Beckinsale was a great choice to play Seline, the lead vampire and main character. However, it was Bill Nighly that really flourished in the film playing the stern ruthless head vampire, Viktor. Great action sequences are prevalent throughout and even though it doesn't hold up today like it did in the early 2000's, it's still a great film. If you haven't seen Underworld you have really missed out on a great action, fantasy, horror flick."

Am I the only one out there who is bored with characters skulking round blue lit, rain soaked streets in figure hugging black PVC, dark sunglasses and trench coats? Well worth a look if you need to see vampires fighting werewolves, and definitely a lot better than it probably should have been."

(That one blew me away, it came out of nowhere!) And they both have their weaknesses; vampires to sun and werewolves to silver. (Where do they get these fresh ideas???)

The movie is a direct copy of not only a novel, but two games as well. Not to mention a shameless copy of Romeo & Juliet. I mean, come on!! Why are people still copying a 500 year old play? And not even changing a single detail!!! Writers should be able to write a novel without being afraid that some producer will come along and flat-out steal the ENTIRE thing!!!

"MorgaineS","10","11","23","8 March 2005"," Absolutely the best of its genre
","I've watched this movie about 20 times now, and I've ordered a copy for myself because it's the best Goth-themed movie anyone has produced so far. (I have high hopes for the sequel.)<br/><br/>*Slight Spoilers*<br/><br/>The plot was ingenious. The idea of the Vampires having at one time enslaved the Lycans (werewolves) and later warring with them for centuries created an interesting dynamic. The look and the feel of the film was perfect - beautiful, spoiled, elitist vampires in lush dark environs; coarser, but more sympathetic Lycans (once you got to know them). Every part was well cast and well-acted.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed with Kate Beckinsale. I'd only ever seen her in a Jane Austen production, and you'd never know it was the same girl. Despite her petite frame, she played the part of warrior ferociously. She had a darker, more sullen approach to her character than is usually written for a woman in an action film. <br/><br/>Scott Speedman is easy to love, of course, but I initially had my doubts about him in the role of Michael Corvin. Somehow, I never pictured him in an action role. I was pleasantly surprised that he can appear so fragile one moment and kick ass the next. The relationship between Michael and Selene will make or break the sequel. I can't wait."
"ash_0777","1","11","23","20 December 2004"," A dull ride
","I have rarely seen a movie that had SO much potential, and seemed to ignore it almost on purpose. The premise is sound: a secret war is being fought between vampires and werewolves. a great premise, but unfortunately, the flaws hold it back from being either an action or a horror, and especially from it ever being a romance. The first flaw is noticeable all through the movie. Let me get this straight, these two creatures have been fighting for years, and years, yet humans have no idea. They shoot in subways, and hotels, and sewers, yet we have no idea. In Blade the humans who knew about vampires became Familiars. They worked along side them. Here, they just don't exist. Oh, except for speedman, he exists solely for the plot, to give it a bit of life. Sorry, nothing could give this bore-heap life. The other huge flaw, is the supposed romance between Speedman and Beckinsale. It has no merit. It just evolves without rhyme or reason. There's no connection or chemistry. The script calls for a love relationship between the two, so it seems like they just through it in. They kiss, they fight along side each other, but never have chemistry. It just goes through the usual motions. Most of the characters are generic and dull. They all seem to just exist on the most basic level. They simply go on pouting or scowling the whole movie. My favorite example of this is Kraven (Shane Brolly). He keeps one angry expression on his face the entire time. He looks about two seconds away from a temper tantrum. The last big gripe I have for this movie is simple and basic: Where oh where was the action through all this? I counted two and a half basic action scenes. I wish I could have slept through this boring mess, but my insomnia was acting up that day. My rating? 1 out of 10 My advice? If your in the mood for a GOOD action horror, stay away, go rent a Blade flick."
"cmivie","6","7","13","19 January 2006"," Excess bullets=Cool!!
","Why is it that most action movies these days have to have a scene in which thousands upon thousands of bullets are flying all over the place, and yet maybe one person actually gets shot? I guess action films are trying to get a high rating for ""coolness"". In the opening scene of Underworld, we are treated to a shootout between the Lycans (Werewolves) and the Vampires who are at war with one another. This shootout takes place in a subway station, with many, many helpless humans around. And guess what? Only one human actually gets shot. The other 100 or so people actually dodge or dive out of the way. And it ain't like the Lycans or Vampires are using six shooters either. These are full-auto guns, and as a result a gazillion bullets fly. Now, the shootout does look good, but the logic with it is just heinous. But then again, this is an action movie, so we should just enjoy shootout. But, I actually thought to myself, ""Hey! No wonder one side can't get rid of the other. They can't shoot a damn gun!"". But, and I have to state this so here is a MINOR SPOILER ALERT......when Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who is a Deathdealer for the Vampires tracks down a Lycan in the sewer shortly after the subway shootout, she nails the guy with three or four shots. In the Subway, she couldn't hit a damn thing (except for the walls and columns). I just had to point that out.<br/><br/>In any case, aside from Underworld being a bit illogical at times, this is actually a good film from an entertainment point of view. Beckinsale does a good job playing her role. I was concerned that she couldn't pull it off, but trust me. She is Selene, and she looks good at being a bad-ass. Scott Speedman is......well........I just don't know what to think of him. I see a lot of potential in him, and he does a good job playing Michael. Michael Sheen as Lucian is great. I wish he would have had more screen time, but at least we get to know why Lucian hates the Vampires.<br/><br/>Shane Brolly? He is the guy playing Kraven, who is the worst character in this film simply because I am convinced that Shane Brolly is one of the most horrible actors I have ever seen. I mean, Jean-Claude Van Damme could teach this guy a thing or two about acting. Brolly looks so much like Trent Reznor (of Nine Inch Nails) that I thought he was gonna break down and start singing ""Closer"" at any moment. I realize a film like Underworld won't give you Oscar type performances, but this guy should never have been given the part of Kraven. Hell. Trent Reznor could have done a better job.<br/><br/>Overall, Underworld is good for what it is. It entertained me, and has me looking forward to the sequel. It has its' holes and can also leave you confused at some points in the film, but the story does fill the holes (or it tries to). Get past the subway shootout and you should enjoy the rest of the movie."

Nothing more.<br/><br/>UNDERWORLD was a huge surprise for me. I had supposed that it would follow the paw prints of American Werewolf in Paris and would disappear into the forests of cinema shame, but not in the slightest. This movie was my introduction to a new kind of horror movie, one suited for the post-apocalyptic vigilante in all of us. No doubt it was influenced by movies like Matrix and Vertigo and will likewise influence future horror productions in the vain of Van Helsing, Blade 2, ad infinitum.<br/><br/>Concept, concept, concept is the name of the game when you dabble with blood, and dabble it does. UNDERWORLD is a modern day story about the genetic war between werewolves and vampires. It doesn't get cooler than this. To the story add mixed blood lines, lots of bullets, and the slightest dash of history, and I believe you me have an instant classic on your bloodstained hands.<br/><br/>Let's imagine, if you had to shoot a werewolf-changing scene, how would you do it?<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, all of the monster scenes in UNDERWORLD are masterfully and meticulously done so as not to offend anyone. If you haven't seen the movie yet, you can stop reading this piddly review and head to the video store this afternoon before dusk to see what I mean.<br/><br/>My last comment about UNDERWORLD will be a big hail to the UK, whose actors appear in cunning disguise throughout the movie like an underground model UN. Sure, there is a German guy who dies and bleeds all over the place midway through the film, but we never know whether he's a werewolf, a vampire, or what. If we want to pursue that controversial issue we have no choice but to buy a ticket to the sequel, or prequel, and see what happens when the full moon emerges.<br/><br/>JY"

It would have been nice to have someone to root for! <br/><br/>There also is - no surprise - too much violence and bloodshed. It's not ""Van Helsing"" in that regard (overdone action) but it isn't far removed.

You know, werewolves, vampires, guns, lots of leather (why don't armies issue all their troops with tight fighting leather outfits, as they are sooooo practical for fighting in), lots of black and CGI.<br/><br/>Vampires fight and kill werewolves, the question is why. Set in Eastern Europe such a plot has a range of intelligent options that could be explored, but a ignored and simplified (and explained repeatedly so Americans can follow the plot).<br/><br/>I loved the action, and yes the CGI is not that great, but this is not a big budget movie. The plot idea has depth, even if the story skims over it. There is enough plot material for an entire series, unfortunately it is crammed into one movie.<br/><br/>Bad guys and good guys are ambiguous in so many ways. At the end of the day, this little, effects driven movie that follows on from Blade and The Matrix is an interesting story for lovers of THAT type of movie.<br/><br/>Others may not get into it so much, but we can wait for the sequel and the prequel to see if they have the courage to delve into the true depths of this story."

","Underworld is a great movie with phenomenal casting. The actors did a great job of portraying the characters without that ""empty"" feeling you sometimes get when bad actors are cast in supernatural roles. The characters are rich and integrated into the story without a feeling of overcrowding. Unlike most vampire films which I feel loses that ""gothic"" feel, Underworld brings it all to the table to keep you on the edge of your seat. I loved the way vampires and werewolves were explained, which I felt was an original take, which I felt translated to film in an excellent way. The characters didn't have an ""all of the sudden"" hatred, the reason between any angst is explained and very logical. A great movie from start to finish, I cannot wait to see what else comes from this franchise."

The gaps in the plot made the story very hard to follow in the early stages, but this may have been a decision made in the cutting room to keep the audience from realising that they'd seen it all before.

","Vampires and werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skintight rubber. What more could you ask from a movie? Now nobody is going to confuse Underworld with any kind of work of great cinema. But for what it is it works. Yes, the whole thing is rather silly. At times it is very hard to take the movie seriously. So don't bother trying to take it seriously, just enjoy it. Silly vampire movie that it may be Underworld does have some brains to it. The vampire/werewolf back-story mythology is worked out very carefully. The movie's not just vampires and werewolves brainlessly slaughtering each other, there's actually a reason they're slaughtering each other. Much of the back-story is not revealed until well into the movie so you've had time to build your own ideas of what's really going on, who is good and bad, what is right and wrong. Then the movie springs some surprises on you and puts a whole new spin on things. And then the vampires and werewolves resume slaughtering one another.<br/><br/>Beckinsale, lovingly photographed with as many butt shots as possible, is the glue that holds the movie together. There's some rather silly stuff she's forced to say and do. Some of the movie's dialogue is rather laughable. But Beckinsale makes it work. She brings an air of seriousness to the proceedings. But not too serious. A movie about a thousand-year war between vampires and werewolves can't be too serious. It needs to be fun. And this movie is. More or less. There are pieces that don't work. One acting performance, that of Shane Brolly as the vampire Kraven, is rather disastrous. The performance is off, the character is off. It's as if Brolly is acting in his own little movie. And his movie is much worse than everybody else's. But the rest of the cast performs admirably. Kate's great in her role of Selene, a vampire whose mission in life is to seek out and destroy Lycans. By Lycans I mean werewolves. The movie insists on calling werewolves Lycans because I guess it sounds cooler or something. Whatever. Michael Sheen makes for an excellent antagonist as the leader of the werewolves. Scott Speedman is appropriately flustered as a human caught up in the middle of all this nonsense. And Bill Nighy gets special credit for his performance as vampire elder Viktor who doesn't look too good when awakened from his long nap. Nighy deals admirably with one of all the all-time movie prosthetic/makeup jobs. The movie looks terrific with some dazzling visual effects, great sets and wonderful costumes. The story takes a little while to get going and has its ups and downs. But it eventually pays itself off pretty well. In the end there is really no ending at all, just a setup for a sequel. This type of thing I generally despise but here I'm actually looking forward to seeing Beckinsale shoehorn herself into that catsuit for some more vampire/werewolf shenanigans. Underworld is by no means a great movie. But its got enough fun and, especially for its genre, enough smarts to make it worthwhile. And it's good enough to make you want to jump back into this world again."

And leather.<br/><br/>Selene (Kate Beckinsale, who would soon marry the director - luckiest man alive, Len Wiseman) is a vampire Death Dealer, with guns bigger than her acting abilities and leather so tight and curve-hugging my Carnal Nerve nocturnally emissioned. She's a lethal stalker and killer of werewolves (natch ""lycans"" in sexy new street cred).<br/><br/>Story is interesting twist on the legends, yet if you enjoy werewolf slash vampire movies, this may or may not be your cup of blood. You see, whereas all other werewolf and vampire movies have been correctly slotted into the horror genre, UNDERWORLD is an ""action"" movie whose characters happen to be Vamps and Thropes. We're in THEIR world now, so their intrinsic alienness is the norm, rather than an anomaly. Movie can get on with the shooting and running and blood-fests as common occurrence between the two ""races"" (just as any two given races on Earth at any given point in history will engage lovingly in shooting and running and blood-fests). Subsequently, dialog is childish, and action is filmed in that style that suddenly slams into slow motion to accentuate the flounce of capes and the thrill of tight butt-leather, with no meaning other than for the sake of capes flouncing and butt-leather bouncing.<br/><br/>Latent werewolf, Michael (Scott Speedman) is bitten by a vampire - to breed a hybrid race that will win the war for the lycans, who are jealous that the vampires have such cool leather. Even though he's a trans-gender, Selene inexplicably falls for Michael. Because he's hot, I'm guessing. But vampire-werewolf love cannot be. So it is written in the ancient scrolls of the TV Guide. For advice on her love life, she calls on the Dr. Phil of vampires, their sleeping king, Viktor (Bill Nighy), who in hibernation looks like a zombie husk of a mummy, until he is revived by fresh blood, whereupon he looks like Bill Nighy (i.e. a zombie husk of a mummy).<br/><br/>Casting Kate Beckinsale was not a mistake. Garbing her in such tight leather is. Because I am blinded to anything else when she is on screen. She is just too breathtakingly beautiful, too achingly sensual-- Those pointy incisors; those devil-blue eyes-- Look at that cutie go!

","Actually I would say that this is one of the best stories I've seen. Lycans vs. vampires. On the beginning we can tell who's ""good"" and who's ""bad"". But as the story develops we change our minds few times. Nothing is what it seems anymore. So, basically - two (or maybe even more in the second part of the ""Underworld""?) species learning to live next to each other on the same planet. Two different ""nations"" I would say. Does it ring a bell? Anyway - very good story, great soundtrack (both -instrumental and regular) and just dark, Gothic atmosphere. I would recommend it, but I have to warn - it's not a typical horror/gore story. If you liked The Crow then you will certainly like this one."

","Now don't get me wrong -- an epic battle between vampires and werewolves has a lot of potential for a cool movie.  After all, werewolves are big, hairy monsters with claws, and vampires are effeminate pale-skinned people who wear stylish clothes and have a thirst for blood.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when the vampires can't fly and cast visible reflections, and the werewolves' only superhuman ability involves running at highway speeds, one has to wonder -- what kind of vampires and werewolves ARE these?<br/><br/>But the movie quickly answers this question by reducing all the significance of the two creatures to molecular biology.  Oh, you thought vampires were really the undead?  Pfft.<br/><br/>At least the audience can empathise with the pain and suffering of the war-wounded by means of the painfully wooden acting, and the suffering caused by exposure to yet another Romeo and Juliet ""forbidden love"" story ripoff.<br/><br/>Bela Lugosi's dead... and so are cool monster movies."
"crosseyeddragon","1","8","17","26 September 2006"," Boring
","I've just watched this film and found it dull, boring and dreary and thats with vamires and werewolfs fighting each other! Seriously, if you were turned into a vampire or a werewolf would you really like to spend the rest of eternity with either side? Other then running around with guns in pvc bodysuits what else is there? Both sides are miserable and dull to watch. And wheres the werewolf pvc clad babe? Actually were are the werewolf babes pvc clad or otherwise? Both sides seem to lack the things that make them vampire or werewolf, like vampires reflecting in mirrors and passing out from loss of blood from stab wounds. Werewolfs however are able to run around like spiders on walls and ceilings and manage in werewolf form not to look like wolfs in the slightest. And being a werewolf wouldn't you try taking on the vamps in the daytime? In my opinion i'd say this film was just another three oclock in the morning last minute idea ""hey lets put vampires against werewolfs, we'll make lots of cash from this"" decision. As for the plot... oh wait was there one? Something to do with a medic bitten by a werewolf who catches the eye of a vampire who tries to help? que? i'm not going to watch it a second time to fully understand whats going on. In my opinion just a matrix wannabe. By the way Bill Nighy should of made a better vampire."
"ImperatorHazel","1","10","23","18 January 2005"," It sucks. There's no other way to describe it, with or without pun.
","The first thing people learn how to do in life is to suck. When a baby is born the mother then breast feeds it and it learns how to suck. The people who made this movie never mentally progressed beyond this stage because they still suck. This movie is not so much a movie as it is a test of endurance. You have to sit idly by while this movie destroys everything good and holy in this world.<br/><br/>""Underworld"" is a horror/sci-fi/action/adventure/occult/Gothic/bad movie where an unexplained Romeo and Juliet type love takes place, although without the part where the audience cares. Apparently, there has been a blood feud between Vampires and Lycanthropes (spelled 'lycans', pronounced 'lichens') going on right under our noses. Selene, a piece of eye candy who hates lycans, is a death dealer who just can't keep her hands off two things; guns and Michael. Why exactly she can't keep her hands off the latter is not explained, but the former is because, of course, she also can't stop shooting Lycans. Kraven shows us he can't stop loving Selene but also that he can stop acting at will, if he even was to begin with. Viktor shows us that, wow, vampires drink human blood, and Lucien shows us that vampires can get pregnant, despite reproducing solely through biting.<br/><br/>Before I witnessed this unholy sacrilege, I took the time to read the novelization. I, thinking this movie would be a wonderful portrayal of aristocratic vampire and carnal lycanthropes, wanted to know everything about the movie before it actually came out. Before I was thoroughly disappointed by the movie, I found the novelization to be very entertaining. The fact that the novelization was better than the actual movie moves us into my next two points; the poor acting and low-grade cinematography.<br/><br/>""Willing suspension of disbelief"" is a term used by actors and directors meaning the audience will believe and go along with what is presented on stage. Movies follow the same rules, but ""Underwold"" decided to be new and different and suck totally. From start to finish, the actors fail to emote and deliver their lines in a believable and appropriate manner. I cringe simply thinking about how horribly this movie sucked. As for cinematography, it rivaled ""Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"" on the meter of how badly-placed and incoherent the scene transitions were. Not only is the audience left bewildered and confused, by they quickly become disgusted as they are fed more mediocre and unemotive dialogue. If these movie makers simply wanted to see how badly they could suck in a two-excruciating-hour movie, they achieved their goal in the most obnoxious way possible.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is bearable. It would make any goth in makeup smile. The settings set the mood well, but the CG sucked. Of course, one could argue that this was due to lack of a budget (the acting proves as such. And did you see those dismembered limbs?) but give this thought a spin; George Romero, director of the Dead trilogy (""Night of The Living Dead"", ""Dawn of The Dead"", and ""Day of The Dead"") had little to no budget for his movies. The zombies had no torn-flesh, decomposing makeup (which ""Resident Evil"" proudly sports), but you could still tell they were zombies. Sucky budget should be compensated by a good dose of creativity. But no, Underworld decided to suck once again and make the CG not only choppy and far-between, but the werewolves (Or lycans, while they're trying to be different) looked like rampaging horse/panther demons from any movie containing the words ""Thing"", ""From"" and ""Beyond"" in the title.<br/><br/>Sure, a horse/panther demon might be scary for a five-year-old boy with a complex, but that isn't the target audience, now is it? Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-lycanthrope. The vampires had their fair share of sucky creativity as well. Besides the frilly, synthetic-blood sucking, nancy-ass vampires who probably whined that they needed makeup to distract the audience from their terrible acting (also known as the main characters), most of the vampires looked like humans with those $5 fangs you find at a secondhand costume store glued to their incisors. Any vampire or lycanthrope purist would know that this movie is pure blasphemy. It defiles all of the traditional aspects of vampirism and lycanthropy that have been well-established throughout the years of horror movies. Vampires are evil beings. The thought of vampires realizing that mortals aren't just there for food sickens me to no end. And, somehow, lycanthropes are not as profoundly connected with the moon as everyone thought! Imagine that! Perhaps I'm nitpicking, but it is my belief that changes should be made for the better, not to further increase how much something sucks.<br/><br/>The most excruciating part in this movie is when, at the end, they decide to further advance the sucky plot by setting up the possible thought of yet another Underworld movie. A part of me wants to see this simply to know how far these people will go to ruin their reputation entirely.<br/><br/>In short, this movie sucked. There really is no other word that so best describes it. Bring your friends, bring your family. This movie sucked."

Trinity, I mean Lara Croft, I mean female Blade...er....whatever, reads her lines as if from a teleprompter, not that it makes much of a difference, the dialog is so hackneyed that you'll groan with every sentence.  The story sounded interesting when I first heard about it, but leave it up to Hollywood to just turn the whole thing into a Matrix rip-off.  The special effects mainly consisted of the main characters falling from great heights only to land on their feet.  This was done five or six times throughout the movie.  In my twenty-two years of movie watching this has been the first time I have ever come close to walking out on a movie in the theater."

","While I am not a huge fan of vampire movies, I do enjoy a good one. Unfortunately, this is not a good one. I was intrigued by the trailer and this was on my short list even though it received a one star review in USA TODAY. It is filmed in the typical modern vampire style (ie, slow motion action scenes, grimy, greasy set decoration, and ""blue light""}. Kate Beckinsale, who I like as an actress, is given no memorable lines in an incomprehensible script. The action scenes are blase, the werewolves are generic and the whole thing looks like a bad mid-nineties music video. I can't reveal the ending, although I want to, to save you your nine dollars, because I walked out early. It is outrageous that this is currently rated at 7 stars.

"uf36","5","6","12","23 April 2006"," Dark but hollow
","Len Wiseman took the topic of vampires and werewolves into the neutral zone. Like a Japanese Manga artist he claims total ignorance of the Christian superstitions and history linked to it. That moves the film into the genre of pure action. It also helps that there is no real screenplay. Although the plot contains a nice turn where our our first impressions are betrayed, the story is quite simple. The acting is lousy but Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous in her tight leather suit. There is a lot of shooting and - later on - fighting. The movie would be a total loss if it weren't for the visuals. In fact, the whole picture is just a long video clip. Its the artistic use of special effects and the creation of dark, impressive images - although bordering on kitsch - which lift the movie just above the average of this genre."

"alecwest","10","4","7","28 May 2004"," Criticism ... but not of the film itself
","I must admit that I was prepared to see just one more vampire and/or werewolf film filled with wanton blood and gore.  Instead, I was left in both awe and circumspection.<br/><br/>The filmgoer has become so used to the ""2-hour-format"" (give or take a few minutes) that films which don't please them within that format are panned. But, this film like others (ie., 1984's ""Dune"") appeared to be better suited to a 4-hour or longer format ... spread over 2 separate films, perhaps.  In short, attributing weaknesses of this film to acting or writing might be unfair.  To me, the weaknesses seem more attributed to editing or perhaps budget constraints put upon the production company.<br/><br/>This film would have had all the earmarks of epic quality had it been filmed as an epic.  But epics are rarely crammed into a 2-hour timeslot with success.  The acting by largely unknown actors was riveting and allowed me to suspend disbelief entirely.  The camera work was breathtaking.  And the choreography of battle scenes was on par with or better than that found in ""The Matrix"" trilogy.<br/><br/>I gave this film a 10-out-of-10 rating on effort alone, despite my reservations over the rushed nature of the storyline which detracted from a filmgoer's ability to appreciate it more fully."
"MovieAddict2016","6","4","7","27 January 2004"," Interesting racial undertones evoking the Civil War era, some good special effects, and some OK fight sequences make ""Underworld"" a decent Friday night matinee...
","It was only a matter of time before a film like this was made. Unfortunately, the end result isn't quite as amazing as everyone had hoped it would be.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you like werewolves and vampires, then ""Underworld"" will probably wet your teeth. For the most part, I found the film an enjoyable enough experience to recommend--although there are some scenes that seem to slow the film down and add nothing to the story. I was also disappointed in the way that the film pays more attention on keeping its vampires and werewolves in human form, talking for the duration of the film, rarely fighting and evolving into beasts of the night. As Homer Simpson once said, ""Less yakkin'; more zappin'!""<br/><br/>""Underworld"" is about a vampire named Selene (Kate Beckinsale) who lives in a scary mansion in Europe with dozens of other gothic beasts like herself. They're so busy fighting werewolves, it made me wonder where they all get their stylish leather attire--it's like a ""Grease"" reunion or something.<br/><br/>Selene is a ""hunter""--she seeks out werewolves and slaughters them, and this happens in the opening sequence which is pretty ""Matrix""-esque. The vampires fight them with silver bullets, and the werewolves fight vampires with big teeth. Not much of a challenge for the vampires, eh? You'd be surprised. With the help of CGI, Selene has trouble fighting the animals. (They are apparently pretty strong, and apparently a big rip-off of the creatures from ""An American Werewolf in Europe"" and ""Paris."")<br/><br/>Werewolves, we learn, used to be slaves to the vampire species, before Lucius--the head of the werewolves--fell in love with the vampire ""lord's"" daughter. The latter was killed, and the former escaped, only to form a pack of followers that would battle with vampires over the ages.<br/><br/>Now Lucius has targeted a young doctor who has the capability of forming a hybrid between vampires and werewolves. I didn't understand everything regarding how, exactly, this is possible, since I think the explanation is purposefully quick and slurred so that audiences can't stop to evaluate any implausabilities.<br/><br/>Selene falls in love with the man and tries to stop Viktor, the lord of the vampires, from killing him. He tells her that the doctor is an abomination--that vampires and werewolves cannot be mixed together. She doesn't believe him.<br/><br/>The film is basically politically-correct. Werewolves used to be slaves, freed themselves, and were still faced with racism until a lone vampire decided that the two species could unite. Doesn't that sound a bit like truth? Regardless of any implied backdrops, the film will probably satisfy any action fan who is looking for some neat battle sequences and cool special effects.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film is probably the fact that the vampires and werewolves never really evolve into vampires or werewolves. We do see some large dogs occasionally, but for the most part it's just people with glowing eyes battling big muscular people who sometimes rip off their clothes and turn into big hairy beasts.<br/><br/>But the film is an enjoyable Friday night matineee; a good movie if you're in the mood for something light and enjoyable. It rips of ""The Matrix"" a bit with its style, but what gothic action film hasn't since 1999? Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous here, and worth the price of admission alone. The film isn't too original, and it's not nearly as great as it could have been (chances are ruined here), but it works as a dumb, fun movie.<br/><br/>3/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

","As I left the theater, I overheard bad comments coming from behind me- ""I couldn't get into that story"" ""Man, this movie kinda sucked"" ""I don't know what that was all about"" It's true that the same flock of people that came in expecting ""Blade"" like flick, or perhaps ""The Matrix"" of vampires and werewolves, would probably be disappointed. The movie doesn't stay on one concept, it's lower budget (23 million) gives it less CGI and smaller, reused locations, and the touted romance between main characters Michael (Scott Speedman, kinda boring) and Selene (played well by Kate Beckinsale) never really has time to develop. But if you take a closer look at the story, you'll find some interesting aspects.<br/><br/>Vampires and werewolves have fought for many centuries, with the vamps having the upper hand. They live in large mansions above ground, while the werewolves live in underground sewer-like conditions. The war between them is about to become worse, and in the thick of it is Selene who suspects a conspiracy, one that may eventually lead to an attack by the werewolves. Lucian (Michael Sheen), is the leader of the werewolves. His rage is one that will lead to secrets that unfold later in the movie. As they hunt down a human who carries what is needed to create super 'werevamps', Selene has to deal with the clan at home. No one seems to believe her that something very nasty is about to happen. Which is too bad, since, in this movie, everyone here seems to go with their gut feelings and fantastic insights on what other people are thinking and doing.<br/><br/>Acting wise, everything is as expected, but Shane Brolly, who plays Kraven, the leader of the vampires, does a rather poor job. He did not convince me, as an actor, that he was a leader, and when he gets upset, he looks like a little kid who had his blood candy stolen. Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are quite good, however.<br/><br/>Action sequences were a bit mixed. There was hi-tech gun play, and there was plenty of it, but the actual confrontation sequences left a lot to be desired. Usually what you saw when it came to the hand-to-hand shots were closeups of the werewolves teeth... cut to the next smoke filled fight scene, wash, rinse, repeat.<br/><br/>Rules of how vampires get killed were changed a bit. In here, they can die rather easily in comparison to other vamp movies like this one. But water doesn't hurt them, that's for sure, since half the movie is drenched in rain. Perhaps to balance the werewolves weaknesses? Roleplaying games, books and movies have gone through various different ways of rules that can be applied to how vamps and wolves function, so this is a moot point.<br/><br/>SFX department- with Editor Martin Hunter and several dozen visual effects techs didn't do a bad job. With hardly any CGI in site they manage to do a bang up job with the werewolves' changes. The locations where the movie was shot, Prague and Budapest, give the movie a very authentic feel.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie had more potential then what you see, perhaps a little more on the romance side? Better characters? But hey, I still liked it.<br/><br/>Just don't expect oscar winning performances, mind-blowing CGI sfx, or originality.

Then there is the super sexy Kate. She looks cool in her action mode. She is without a doubt the movie's best asset."

","When going into this movie, I expected one thing and one thing only; Action. I wasn't disappointed. In a movie about a war between Vampires and Lycans, I want to see some great action scenes and Underworld delivers. But you get more than just good action; you get a great looking movie. I absolutely loved the dark dingy look throughout the entire movie. There isn't much color but that's the point. I think they also did a great job in the costume/makeup department. The Vampires look believable but not overdone and I love the Lycans. The acting was so-so and the story while not bad in my opinion was nothing to write home about. If you're looking for a stylized, fun, action movie, then this one is definitely worth a shot. O yea, and Kate Beckinsale is in it¬Ö. Need I say more?"
"The-Sarkologist","6","3","5","7 January 2012"," Not the most enthralling film out there, but not bad either
","I'm not really sure of what I make of this film. It is not a bad film, but it is not one that is absolutely fantastic either. It is not a boring film, but it is not riveting either. To me it seemed to be a standard Hollywood style good guy verse bad guy, with a few twists and turns thrown in. Maybe it is because it is a vampire vs werewolf film and that I have found very few such films out there that have been all that exciting. In another sense I must say that vampires and werewolves do bore me though.<br/><br/>The film is about a vampire warrior who is in the front line of a war between the vampires and the werewolves, however most of the vampires believe that the war is long over and have fallen into decadence in the decades since the final battle had been fought. However, our hero stumbles upon a plot which involves creating a hybrid vampire/werewolf, something that the vampires find rather offensive.<br/><br/>Vampires and werewolves have a long history in our culture. While we can point to Dracula as being the beginning of the modern vampire story, werewolves have no such starting point. Some have suggested that the idea goes back to the Greco-Roman world where people were turned into wolves, however this is not the modern concept of Lycanthropy (the mythical diseases that causes people to become werewolves) and further these metamorphoses were not limited to people turning into wolves (Ovid's Metamorphosis is the best ancient text for these myths as pretty much all of the main characters turn into something else). The other thing with Greco-roman metamorphosis is that they generally do not turn back to humans. Once they have changed, they have changed for good.<br/><br/>For some reason Vampires and Werewolves have always seemed to go together, but maybe because that has something to do with our legends. We do have ghosts and faeries, but they do not seem to come into the same category (though a horror film using faeries would be decent in my opinion, and I know that there is literature out there that uses this concept). I also notice that Vampires and Werewolves are one of the staples of modern horror films (but then again so are brain eating zombies).<br/><br/>Look, I did actually like this film, but it is not something that I would put into the category of films like Twelve Monkeys and Edward Scissorhands. This film is entertainment, though I would not consider it horror (mind you, I would not consider many films that use the title horror as actually being horror) because I doubt it is supposed to create fear in the eyes of the viewer. Gothic I would because it is set in a dark and grizzly world. Oh, I also liked the idea that the Vampires were very high-tech while the Werewolves tended to be a little more backward. I note that the vampires' lair had a lot of high tech gadgetry, but the werewolves' lair seemed to be something that hearkens back to the 60s."

","This was an awesome film to watch. Firstly, the Gothic style of the architecture and dark lighting gives the film a magnificent look throughout. The shots are epic and the look of the werewolves is terrifying. Some criticize the 'over-acting' but in general it's still pretty good. As a fan of classic horror and monster films, it was great to see the amount of mythology that went into the screenplay. Kate Beckinsale was pretty awesome in her role and was a great anti-hero. There are great characters here, which are why I enjoy it so much, like Lucian played by Michael Sheen. My favorite of them all is Viktor. He had an incredible presence only Bill Nighy could give off. Some characters are left poorly developed, especially Raze (Kevin Grevioux). He could've used more screen time and the character of Michael Corvin was a decent character but he doesn't really stand out until he becomes the hybrid.<br/><br/>But the pacing is fantastic and the score by Paul Haslinger really surprised me. The action hits hard and the setting just completes the film. The near climax portion of the plot might lose a few but it's just a fun movie to watch."

Not the older gentleman, but the young guy with longish hair. He is the only sub-par performer here. In light of all the attention devotes to the Twilight series, it's worth your time, if you're into the legends and the lore, to check out this particular movie. I'm not actually a self-proclaimed vampire movie fan, but this particular take on the old themes is very well constructed and tugs at the conscience in just the right way. All else is terrific.

","Ever since Buffy came along and made everything cool again we have had an influx of three separate related things: 1. Movies starring a strong, independent female kick ass character (Aliens, Valley of The Dolls, Underworld). 2. Cool vampire movies with cool characters and cool vampires (Blade, Razor Blade Smile, Underworld). 3. Movies and shows which blend horror and comedy creating what I call 'Hilarious Screamers', such as Scream, Ugly Betty, and Underworld. Now, underworld is slightly different in that is disbands the humour and plays everything very straight laced (and leather clad). Most hilarious screamers aren't very funny anyway and it is probably a good idea that this is more like an action drama horror. Everything is dark and cool, rainy and gloomy, blue and atmospheric.<br/><br/>Kip Beckinsale plays a vampire who has been at war with Werewolves (the technical terms is lichen) for centuries- since the time of The Vikings and when there used to be Greeks. She is one of many, working day and night (apart from day time) to stop the war boiling over into human land. One day a man is accidentally bitten by a werewolf and will turn in a few days. However, there is something special about his blood or something and he is able to waken an ancient vampire monster who will end the world. The plot was very complexicated and I can't really remember too much. To be honest I was too busy googling at Baxendale's chests in her leather. The story never really matters in films anyway, as long as there are plenty of guns and killing, and perhaps some excitements then it is a classic masterpiece. There is lots of action here, with guns, steaks, vampire vs werewolf fights, chases etc. The graphics are very nice too, better than the computer game. Beckinsdale is a good vampire, but I think that Buffy would beat her up in a normal fight. She is only a normal vampire with ordinary powers, and considering Buffy has beaten The Master, Dracula, Glory (a God!) and hundreds of uber-vamps, I don't think Becks would have a chance. She does have lots of guns though, but in a straight fight that would be cheating. Overall this is a nice film to watch after a Sunday roast- just don't have too much garlic or the TV might switch itself off! Incrementally, the film is named after the knicker making factory from Coronation Street- The Director's favourite show! Best Scene: I liked the way Backonsale jumped off rooftops onto the streets below. This is something I also enjoy- roaming the streets in the moonlight, climbing up onto Church steeples and watching the world go by underneath. Sometimes I dress up like her too."

","Best vampire/werewolf movie of all time beating out Lost Boys, Near Dark, John Carpenters movies, nothing compared to this movie when it comes to vamp flicks. The movie only has one thirty minute sequence in which there is little action every other fifteen to twenty minutes is an outstanding fight scene, the movie takes several corners and twists that just makes you keep wondering how this all happened. There is a biological twist to it that I rather enjoyed as opposed to the ""god"" look at it where vampires exist just cause they do. It tells the story of Selene the death dealer that we learn is still human in some sorts and tries to hang on to what she believes in as well as what she is told to believe in. Excellent movie for anyone, the gore, violence, language, and sex (if you buy the extended version) are well under control and not overdone in any way. 10/10"
"MrLuthor89","10","3","5","25 January 2006"," One of the Best Action Thrillers in Years...
","Vampire and Werewolf movies have been seen constantly throughout the years, from classics like ""Dracula"" and ""The Wolf Man"" to the awful ""Van Helsing"", the terrible ""Cursed"", and the truly rancid ""Dracula 2000"". Underworld provides a new, updated, edgier, and sexier approach to such long-running genres. The film combines incredible special effects (done with little money), stylishly Gothic sets and costume designs (full of black and dark blues¬Ögotta love it), and a stellar cast of actors that include Kate Beckisnale, Scott Speedman, and Bill Nighy. The film starts with vampire and ""death dealer"", Selene (Kate Beckinsale), telling us of the long running war between Vampire and Lycan and its unknown origins to how it all began. The vampire empire is controlled by three elders, two of which stay asleep while one remains above to rule, thus alternating every century. The current elder awake is Amelia (Zita G√∂r√∂g), while powerful and feared leaders like Viktor (Bill Nighy) and Marcus (later played by Tony Curran) reside in protected covens. These covens are run by the greedy and untrustworthy Kraven (Shane Brolly).<br/><br/>The Coven is shaken when the Lycan begin hunting a certain human by the name of Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), for an unknown scientific purpose. It is shaken further when Selene believes that the thought-to-be-dead Lycan leader, Lucian (Michael Sheen) may very well be alive, and in league with Kraven. After rescuing Michael from both sides, Selene sacrifices her good name in the Coven to uncover the conspiracy. Selene awakens her father-figure elder, Viktor in order to bring justice to the treacherous Kraven. Unfortunately, at first, Viktor would not be able to look past her insubordination and disregard for the laws that he so heavily believed in. From there, the truth of the conspiracy unfolds, involving the creation of a hybrid, the betrayal of a colleague, and the descendant to the father of all immortals¬ÖAlexander Corvinus (later played by Derek Jacobi).<br/><br/>While many would say this film looks like ""The Matrix"" and plays out like a typical horror film, they obviously haven't sat through the entire film. This movie not only provides action, blood, gore, sex appeal, and solid entertainment, but it also balances all of that with a firm storyline. A storyline that sets up an epic tale of lies, deception, and deadly blood feuds (forgive the pun). The visuals are also paralleled with a myriad of fantastic performances. Kate Beckinsale owns the character of Selene. She is sexy, violent, tender when she needs to be, and an overall bada$$. Speedman was perfect as the human caught up in a supernatural conspiracy that can cost him his life, or make him a God. Finally, there is, of course, my favorite performance of Bill Nighy as Viktor. Nighy is an underrated genius of an actor, and, although he is in only in a small percentage of the 2 hour film, he steals the show. While he fathers Selene and lays down the law in the Vampire world, you can't help but like him (especially when he grabs the enormous Lycan character of Raze by the neck, only to kill him easily), but the revelation of his true character only adds to Nighy's brilliant, suave, and menacing performance. Shane Brolly, Michael Sheen, and Erwin Leder played their roles out to perfection as well (although I think Shane Brolly could lighten up on his facial expressions). This film is epic, exciting, and overall just a damn good movie. After you see this you will be dying to see the sequel, which I also highly recommend."

And this is a vampire movie with even a few twists up its sleeve, and how often does that happen?

I'm a fan of movies so even when i'm disappointed in a film i still appreciate the efforts made to bring the movie out.<br/><br/>Underworld to me was refreshing even if the effects were nice, the story classical, far fetched coincidenses and the plot predictable. In fact i've read several fantasy novels that were all about the same. it's just that a good entertaining movie was made about it with lots of noir (noir as in dark/black). Just like Brotherhood of the Wolf which was ignored by many people simply because it was french. Since i like long movies i was a bit disappointed with this movies length.

"alichino","7","3","5","10 May 2004"," Trouble suspending disbelief
","I love vampire movies and unfortunately for this flaw I will always rate said genre higher than Mr. Joe Public would care to.  In the case of this particular movie I found that I couldn't accept the ineptness of the immortals.  The werewolves at least had the cool ability to change shape, but the vampires seemed almost helpless, almost lethargic at times.  They seemed to level the playing field not with mystic power but with fully automatic weapons. Mayhap that was intentional, to show that the two species were almost identical.  <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the movie so I'll tread a delicate line when I say this:  the fight scene at the end was terrible...I would have greatly sacrificed the well light chamber for a dimly lit, blurry, high speed scene, more reminiscent of John Woo.<br/><br/>That said, Kate B. does a good job of delivering her lines and even though you can't see her very well, looks stunning in that matrix style pleather jumpsuit.  The overall plot is some what predictable, but at least not worn out.<br/><br/>As I said, I love vampire movies and I rated this 7.

"Li-1","Null","4","8","3 February 2004"," Underworld finished under my expectations.
","Rating: ** out of ****<br/><br/>As an introductory film to hopefully a larger, more epic and expansive series, Underworld fulfills its requirements adequately. There's enough action, blood, and tight latex outfits to satisfy a genre fan's thirst and the execution is decent enough that I look forward to the sequels, but there's the unmistakable sense of promise left unfulfilled. <br/><br/>Set in an unnamed city, the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a ""Death Dealer,"" a vampire whose job is to hunt down the remaining Lycans, aka Werewolves. According to vampire history, most of the werewolves should have been wiped out in past wars, but a subway venture reveals there is still a formidable-sized population of werewolves. Against the wishes of her master, Kraven (Shane Brolly), Selene investigates further and discovers that the werewolves are particularly interested in a human named Michael (Scott Speedman). <br/><br/>After an encounter with head werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen), Michael is bitten but saved by Selene, who grows infatuated with this human. Why, is never made clear, other than the fact that he ""saves"" her life. As Selene pries deeper into the mystery surrounding Michael, she uncovers a conspiracy involving both vampires and werewolves that could tip the balance of the war.<br/><br/>As most people have already said, by far the movie's most memorable image is the sight of Kate Beckinsale in tight latex. For those who find her a hot babe (like me), Underworld might just be worth watching for her alone. Hell, if she'd shown some nudity, I would have even bumped my rating up 1/2. Alas, she's still great eye-candy.<br/><br/>The picture itself is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's lots of shootouts and fight scenes that are well-staged and filmed and reasonably exciting. The werewolf effects are excellent and the transformation scenes are some of the slickest, most convincing I've seen on-screen, certainly better than anything seen in The Howling or An American Werewolf in London. Beckinsale, in addition to being a delectable hottie, makes for a kick-ass, first-rate female action hero. <br/><br/>But on the other hand, Underworld is a grim, joyless picture, accentuated by its deadly serious performances and occasionally laughably earnest dialogue. Much like the Blade films, a lot of what the characters have to say is hard to take seriously, the mythology hampered by the fact that it's being juxtaposed with CGI-infested action scenes (though, admittedly, any five minutes of Blade has a much worse problem with this than all of Underworld).<br/><br/>Underworld is neither scary nor suspenseful. Selene never really gets herself into any combative situation she can't get herself out of, usually because most of the opponents she fights aren't nearly as skilled as her. Though there are plentiful werewolf effects, I think I would have preferred more scenes of Lycans skulking around in their hulking bodies rather than watching them in human form.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Scott Speedman must be one of the worst examples of a romantic leading man I've seen. He and Beckinsale have no chemistry, and considering it's her affection for him that spurs her to ""betray"" her own kind, this is a pretty damning flaw. It's also during her scenes with Speedman that Beckinsale is at her least convincing; she won me over as a kick-ass vampiress, but I had a hard time believing she was in love with this bland nobody named Michael.<br/><br/>Directed by first-timer Len Wiseman (who apparently stole Beckinsale's heart on-set, enough that she left Michael Sheen for him), Underworld is slickly-crafted and boasts a strong, pervasive atmosphere. Maybe with more passionate performances, more well-orchestrated thrills, and some bare skin from Kate, the sequel will be an unqualified success."

This is fine with me, after all we go to films to define fantasy, and we demand ever new twists on what we want.<br/><br/>We don't have many kickass female heroines.

I wish I could find something nice to say about it...I mean, I like Kate Beckinsale, really I do...but better to put a stake in it and let it just wither away. Such a sad waste of resources."

","Underworld is an action horror movie directed by Len Wiseman and stars Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen and Shane Brolly in the leads.<br/><br/>Now to start with the movie is surprisingly good to watch. Acting was good by almost all the characters. Please note that this is not an ordinary horror movies with dog howls, creepy sound by doors or lightning. It's a horror movie in itself.<br/><br/>The fight between vampires and werewolves is beautifully captured and shown. The men turning into werewolves could be fascinating for the viewers who loves this kind of genre.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen is a surprise package in the character of Lucian and had did the job exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Look forward for a more promising sequel."
"view_and_review","7","2","3","10 January 2017"," Good Mix of Story and Action
","Just watched Underworld: Blood Wars in the theater and it made me want to review the 14 year run of Underworlds that began in 2003 (wow that seems so long ago). So, I forked over some money to Amazon to watch the first Underworld. It's amazing how much I'd forgotten. I think I watched mindlessly the first time because I missed so much of the story line.<br/><br/>This was the genesis hence it requires a certain level of adoration. I think the sequels are actually better (which is a rarity for franchises) but this movie started it all. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) simply wants to be a warrior--""death dealer""--for her species against the Lycans. It's this dedication that led her to unveil a lot more than she'd bargained for.<br/><br/>The movie is high powered, fast-moving, and dark. Sure, Vampires are allergic to sunlight but that doesn't mean that the sun never rises! The entire movie takes place at night to the degree you'd think it was one long continuous night. Even with that the lighting is good enough to distinguish what's going on and there is no strain on the eyes.<br/><br/>Underworld was an excellent mix of good story with action. It was a lot more to it than I remembered and I'm glad I watched it again."
"MaximumMadness","8","2","3","8 January 2017"," ""Underworld""- A wickedly entertaining and sleek exercise in style over substance.
","For nearly fifteen years now, the ""Underworld"" franchise has been entertaining audiences with its relatively competent action and overly moody visuals. And that is most certainly to be commended, considering the original film was definitely the product of its time and might not quite hold up for modern audiences with its decidedly dated aesthetic. This is through and through an early 2000's cheese fest, with borderline insane Gothic overtones, melodramatic writing and a penchant for outlandish wire-filled stunt work... yet I have to say, it's a lot of fun. I remember being in High School when this first chapter hit screens, and it was a big hit with us. And even to this day, I still think it holds up rather nicely, if for no other reason than its just so excessive and so stylish, yet with just complex enough a story to keep you guessing, it doesn't lose its effect.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a ""Death Dealer""- a sort-of vampire assassin who helps wage war in a seemingly never-ending battle against the Lycans- werewolves. However, when she finds herself mysteriously attracted to a human man named Michael (Scott Speedman) who is being sought after by her Lycan enemies, and as she starts to uncover hints of treachery and conspiracy within her vampire house, a chain of events will begin to unfold that will not only change the way she views the world, but may hold the key to changing the war in unimaginable ways...<br/><br/>The success of the film really falls onto the shoulders of director/co-writer Len Wiseman and the fairly excellent casting that brings the sometimes stock characters to life. Wiseman is a really interesting filmmaker. I haven't necessarily been a fan of his, and sometimes his choices are just head-scratching... but I appreciate his efforts, and when it pays off (as it does here, or in other films like his amusing and thrilling ""Live Free or Die Hard""), it really pays off. His use of a deathly cold color-palate and overly-Gothic design sensibilities really brings you into the world of the war between vampires and Lycans. It helps to sort-of let us know that we're in a different ""world"" that exists alongside our own. He also just knows how to tell a darned-good action scene, and some of the gun-battles and martial-arts displays he gives us are still pretty darned awe- inspiring even to this day. Even if they can sometimes feel a little hokey, you'll never be bored by his use of action. It really helps to elevate what could otherwise have been a drab, lifeless affair.<br/><br/>The cast is just great. Beckinsale might not be an Academy Award winning actress, but she knows how to kick some serious Lycan butt and look good doing it, and she's got just enough of a charm that we can buy the more tender moments of romance and pathos that the film occasionally gives her. There's a reason why Selene is still a popular character and people still enjoy these films. Speedman's role might be a bit under-developed, but he's fine in a supporting role as Selene's love interest, and a few twists later on give him some good concepts to sink his teeth into. Michael Sheen is absolutely fantastic in a supporting role as one of the Lycan leaders- an ancient figure with a definite chip on his shoulder. I'm more used to seeing Sheen in comedic roles, so it's a lot of fun seeing him as a brooding, violent figure. And Bill Nighy is just amazing as Viktor- a vampire elder who is awakened and plays a large part in the story. Nighy chews the scenery with such glee and is just a blast to watch. It's always a treat when he pops up, because no matter how far ""out there"" the role is, he goes for it completely.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film does have some pretty big issues, most of which boil down to some fundamental problems with the writing and the execution of the material. And that's where it loses a few big points from me. The script by Danny McBride (no, not THAT Danny McBride), from a story he co-wrote with director Wiseman and co-star Kevin Grevioux has a lot of issues with the establishment and conveyance of characters and some themes. It took me a few sittings before I could really wrap my head around things, which is a bit of a problem in my opinion. It can move too quickly while doling out information a bit too haphazardly. I also can't help but smirk and shake my head at the pretentious nature of certain characters and scenes... maybe it's just me, but it always just feels silly when vampire and werewolf characters all have really prim-and-proper sounding names like ""Viktor"" or ""Lucian"" or ""Selene"" or ""Kraven"", all speak with prim-and-proper sounding accents and while all using a lot of five- dollar words. I also think that the film can be a bit contrived at times, like they tried to shoehorn in a bit too much plot to match the action.<br/><br/>Still, at the end of the day, this is a Gothic action movie, and as a purely visceral exercise in excess and a display of style over substance... it's a ton of fun. You could definitely do a lot worse. Can it be silly? Absolutely. Can it be confusing? Definitely. But is it always entertaining and will it keep you glued to your chair? Yes, yes, yes! ""Underworld"" is a great time, and would definitely serve well to spice up a slow afternoon when you're stuck at home with nothing else to do. I'd even recommend the first few follow-ups that came out.<br/><br/>I give ""Underworld"" an 8 out of 10 just for sheer style and fun."
"incredibleegg-98345","Null","2","3","8 November 2016"," Underworld: A Movie so Good that it's the Equivalent to the Taste of Garlic Bread
","What makes a good movie? In any story, especially in movies, characters and it's theme is crucial towards having a successful and well liked outcome. Underworld, a vampire and werewolf movie, compliments this criteria as it is used in an innovative way. We see this through character development and theme, ""man vs man"" that's apparent throughout the movie. Action, is recognized throughout Underworld. By meeting the criteria, Underworld captures my eye consistently throughout the movie. Some disagree with the idea that Underworld meets the criteria mentioned such as a critic, James Berardinelli (Berardinelli 2003). While his disagreements may be valid, other parts of the movie, such as the characters, do justice to this genre of movie. Characters and it's theme plays an engaging role in Underworld. Examples of meeting this criteria, is depicted when it shows their characters grow into more than just a person on a screen. When Selene says, ""...Two vampire elders have been slain¬Ö With differences will be set aside. Allegiances will be made. And soon, I will become the hunted""(Wiseman 2003). It accomplishes these things because it conveys you can't trust your own‚Äîit symbolizes the idea ""family"" can really be your enemy. It's theme, man verses man, meets the criteria because it illustrates what a person is capable of: this inspires many including myself. The third piece of criteria, action is met throughout Underworld because it's intense and realistic. Overall, Underworld is a rejuvenating movie that meets my standards. Five out of five stars."
"ivo-cobra8","10","2","3","29 October 2015"," The most awesome spectacular film in the series to be ever created!!!!
","Underworld (2003) is one of the most awesome excellent action horror films about Vampires and werewolves. It is the first entry in this fantasy-action franchise. It has Action, twists, romance and an awesome story tel. This is my second favorite film in the series. The first will be Underworld: Evolution (2006). There are two version of this film: Theatrical and the unrated version (Directors Cut) I prefer The unrated version that really makes this movie a hell of a lot better, story wise and action wise: P you learn so much stuff about everything, and you get a lot more action, plus you actually see in the end that Kraven is a coward, as you see him trying to find an exit everywhere.<br/><br/>I was blown away by the action sequences and the overall story behind the warring factions. Lots of gratuitous violence and sexy ladies in black latex in leather doesn't hurt either. I love everything about this movie, the darkness, the action and the story. Plus Kate Beckinsale is not too bad to look at.Kate fits in this movie like a glove, she did an excellent job and She kicked ass! COMPLETE AWESOME mix of romance action and adventure!!!!!!! I LOVE it. I love all the twist and turns between the Vamps and the Werewolves. There hasn't been a story like this so it was nice to see something different. It was truly an awesome movie! One of my favorite vampire movies!!!! This is one of my all time favorite action vampire flicks. I love this genre and this story is fabulous. love the acting done by Beckinsale and Speedman, the history between werewolves and vampires is told very well! <br/><br/>This is a great adaptation on the Gothic story of vampires with a great introduction to another fantasy race, the lycan. I love how the lycan have elements of werewolves with a close tie to the vampires. The action overall is intense from start to finish. What else can I say about Underworld that was already told? I love Kate Beckinsale as Seline (the Beautiful,sexy, tasty Kate Beckinsale)in her sweet & sexy supple, full-body-suit clad vampire Death Dealer. Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin a medical student who becomes a hybrid. Here is also Wentworth Miller as Adam Lockwood, a colleague of Michael's from Prison Break (2005) TV Series my awesome TV Show. Viktor: (Bill Nighy) he was made for this part, just an awesome performance by a great actor. Lucien (Michael Sheen) excellent performance by him, excellent character. Sophia Myles as Erika, Kraven's trusted ally and love interest portrayed perfectly she was like the only girl who was a vampire and noticed in this film, she acted her role as a real talent! Len Wiseman did a beautiful job writing a story and directing this film. He directed also Live Free or Die Hard (2007) my third best favorite Die Hard film. It is very imaginative and brilliant! The film is also violent, and somewhat bloody. But still entertains, it is fast paced film. I have a lot of funny with it. <br/><br/>I love all the characters in here, the finale in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. The end of the film was brilliant, it did end with a cliffhanger but that makes you guessing more what will happened next. What will be in the sequel. <br/><br/>In the Underworld, Vampires are a secret clan of modern aristocratic sophisticates whose mortal enemies are the Lycans (werewolves), a shrewd gang of street thugs who prowl the city's underbelly. No one knows the origin of their bitter blood feud, but the balance of power between them turns even bloodier when a beautiful young Vampire warrior and a newly-turned Lycan with a mysterious past fall in love.

"SanteeFats","7","2","3","11 January 2014"," Entertaining
","Not a bad take on the human, vampire, lycan genre. There a some questions that I have though. If the lycan's prey on human's wouldn't there be so many going missing that the human's would notice, even if it was the runaways, the homeless, or those in the boondocks? If only the oldest werewolves can transform at will what do the younger ones eat when they are not in werewolf form? What do the vampire's feed on if not human blood, animal's, blood banks? This does not seem to be answered in this film. Selene is a death dealer among the vampires and goes after any lycan she can. Lucien is the first of the lycan's and is still alive even though he was supposedly killed 600 years ago by a vampire named Kraven. Kraven is just like his name. He entered a deal with Lucien to save himself. Selene figures all this out and raises Viktor, an elder, from hibernation to help her. It turns out that Viktor is the one who killed her entire family centuries ago and turned her. Selene has been led to believe it was the lycan's who did it, therefore her hate for the lycans. She learns of this from Kraven this info leads ends up killing Viktor. Along the way it is discovered that a human descendant (Michael) of the founder of both the vampire and the werewolf lines is alive. He gets bitten by a werewolf and then by a vampire. This would normally kill a human but because of his heritage he survives as a hybrid. Selene has been protecting him from all comers and squirrels him away in semi-hidden places. So at the end of the movie Selene and Michael are safe, at least temporarily, A lot of the bad guys are dead, and only one of the three elders are left, Marcus the son of the founder. Oh yeah, Amelia is the third elder from Europe but she has been killed by the lycans. So there is a really nice set up for the sequel."
"aegiswiz-accede","7","2","3","25 October 2013"," Vampire vs Lycan
","In this outing it is Vampire vs Lycan. Lycanthrope being roughly ""werewolf"". I suspect between this movie and the colossal vampire story output by Anne Rice it was inevitable that any number of people would want to take this theme and idea in every direction imaginable. This particular outing isn't highbrow.<br/><br/>This one is action packed. From the beginning we're shooting 30 -40 -50 rounds out of a single 8-9 bullet clip in a pistol. How some of the bullet victims can appear to squeeze their sphincter and have the bullets crawl out of the holes they've made in heads and bodies leaves me a bit curious, but it is kind of exciting. I had to get used to the idea that some die and some don't, and I never really figured out why because the movie was moving so quickly and was exciting, so I just forgot to care why. And I think that is what this movie is shooting for¬Ö exciting. Unlike many ""shoot 'em up"" fun-arcade like movies this one actually has a story line. A PLOT! Actually there are a few subplots going on as well. Mind you, the story isn't written by Jane Austen.<br/><br/>How about this¬Ö there is enough ""plot"" left over to demand Volume II. Let's raise the Pom-Poms for sequels. Think Kate Beckinsale in tight black shiny leather and superhuman strength. But ladies, don't cringe away from this one so quickly. There is some kind of epic love thing going on here as well and plenty of ""love story novel cover"" type objects of affection.<br/><br/>So, you know it is a vampire vs werewolf shoot 'em up story with love story subplot. What? You want me to write the story?<br/><br/>I was entertained. I'm not going to knock some ""taking liberty"" with things like how many bullets and what can go through brick walls or leap from high buildings. Truth is, I recently learned J. Michael Strazynski wrote Underworld #4, so I'm starting again from the beginning as I've never known JMS to write a bad script. <br/><br/>This one earned its #7 (8?) by pure excitement and entertainment. Sorry to the highbrow's who think Bridges of Madison County is the only way to climb up to high ratings."
"lectrick","8","2","3","13 January 2012"," I liked it because...
","... nobody's character was black and white. People who you figure early on are dicks end up having a noble streak and the ones you think are good have skeletons in the closet and a serious chip on their shoulders. This made the movie consistently surprising (at least compared to the usual cut-and-dried action movies out there).<br/><br/>The movie's been out for almost 10 years now but I only just saw it for the first time (I'm now dating a woman who is into the series and I want to watch the 4th movie with her soon so I'm catching up!)<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch if you like action movies with flawed, three-dimensional characters and no particular morality lesson."
"tburke85","7","2","3","22 June 2009"," Underworld A Decent Gothic Sci-Fi Action Adventure
","Underworld is a decent Gothic sci-fi action adventure from director Len Wiseman who does a good job in making this movie but there are some flaws that weigh it down. I'll get back to that later. Kate Beckinsale turns in a solid performance as the lead Selene a vampire Death Dealer in the middle of a war between her race and werewolves known as Lycans. She looks great in leather and is convincing as the character especially in the action/fight sequences. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael Corvin who eventually becomes a powerful vampire/werewolf hybrid because something to do with his blood. He gets a few fight sequences near the end that are impressive but for the most of the movie he's either being chased, running, or being held prisoner. Speedman however like Beckinsale is good as his character. Michael Sheen is terrific as Lucian the Lycan leader whose supposed to have been dead and is after Michael for unknown reasons until those motives are revealed later on in the film. Sheen's role may get cut short near the end but he does a great job of portraying someone who you're not sure is either the villain or a man simply driven by revenge who is willing to do whatever is necessary to defend his race. Well done. Bill Nighy is equally impressive as one of the vampire Lord's Viktor but he isn't given a lot of screen time and his showdown between both Michael and Selene near the end felt a bit rushed. He's also easily defeated but Nighy is effective in the role none the less. The rest of the cast including Shane Brolly, Sophia Myles, and a brief appearance by Wentworth Miller are okay in their roles but don't have much to do. The action/fight sequences are well executed but a slow pace in between made the movie fee a little long. The film seemed to be juggling a bit too many characters and it sort of lacked a central villain because there are quite a few of them in this one. If they had focused on just one instead of Nighy, Brolly, Sheen, and many more the movie would've been a little better. It did have a Gothic feel which seemed to fit with the tone of the film and made it a little different than some sci-fi action movies out there. The music seemed to match well with what was happening on the screen as well. So despite some flaws Underworld may not be the greatest movie ever made but it's certainly not the worst either. Overall Underworld has an intricate story, intense action, some suspense, cool special effects, and good performances by the cast who make this sci-fi movie worth watching at least once."

","I know there's people who doesn't understand what the story was really about..and they unrated the movie because they didn't think it was good..but in my opinion: THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER..<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale did a great job in this movie as the werewolf slayer Selene. She has been added to one of my favorite actress since. I always liked vampire and werewolf movies, but this is the most fantastic i ever seen. With this great dark picture and the great soundtrack. This genre of rock music relates perfect to this thriller. It makes the whole movie really Gothic and i like that.<br/><br/>Selene who has hunted werewolves for many hundred years is now ready to make her mission bigger when she meets the future-hybrid Michael Corvin. Michael is protected by her, but he doesn't know that its time for his life to protect her from future danger.<br/><br/>I love all of the characters and especially this fascinated story about the fights between werewolves and vampires and which side who will survive the war. I don't think anyone could play better as these actors here. And they could have been won more awards for their incredible job at this movie. My favorite scenes was when Mickael turned into the hybrid at the end and when Selene finally killed Victor, when he tried to kill Michael. The werewolves was perfectly created like the vampires..<br/><br/>Rating 10/10;)"

"lucky_star_1","9","2","3","4 March 2007"," Underworld is everything it should be - Gothic, violent, scary, sexy
","I give a lot of credit to Kate Beckinsale because she picks some very memorable and yet critical roles to play, which moreso than never she tends to pull off well. Her role as Selene in Underworld makes no exception - she really is quite amazing as the dark, brave, independent female vampire. As the protagonist, Kate plays a much better part than Angelina did in Tomb Raider, because it's more serious and in many ways more believable Given I don't think Underworld adds up to the brilliance of other horror movies like 28 Days Later (which REALLY scared me) and Interview with the Vampire, it's not that far behind. I agree with a lot of people who have said that it's better than Van Helsing. Mainly because Jackman was the only reason I watched that film and Beckinsale's accent was too much to bear in it. Underworld is a refreshing change and is quite a shocker, with some gruesome scenes. Beckinsale has chemistry with co-lead star Scott Speedman, and the Selene-Michael romance is clearly set to develop in the sequel. The whole vampire and werewolf falling in love thing is actually intriguing to watch.<br/><br/>The eye candy's certainly not bad - for the women who are interested, Speedman and Shane Brolly who plays bad guy Kraven are more than a treat. Kraven certainly has his moments where he plays the jealous lover card, when he sees Michael with Selene.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was a great movie, and I'll definitely be watching the sequel. I disregard all the negative comments because they don't fit with my opinion of the film. I've always loved Vampire movies and so this one was a treat"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","2","3","9 August 2006"," An innovative, entertaining mixture of styles
","I'll be completely honest - vampires in tight latex suits fighting werewolves is not my idea of Citizen Kane. But Wiseman's Underworld (2003) is such a pleasant surprise on every level. Sure, it is not the most original action/horror out there, but I believe it does innovative things in mixing old-school vampire flicks with new stylized Matrix effects. The novelty of this fresh mixture is so entertaining in this film and better yet, it is seen through a grey-bluish film noir tone, bathing Underworld in a dark atmosphere.<br/><br/>The story is completely solid and while there is a lot to keep track of - twists, characters, names, history, it never strays from its template plot, which is the politics and action of the raging vampire-lycan war that Selene (Kate Beckinsale) fights. Onto Beckinsale then, she is absolutely abominably atrocious in her role. Her acting spectrum is frightening narrow, giving us one facial expression that she recycles for every emotion (and the emotions are sparse). Please.Stop.Acting.<br/><br/>Aside from Beckinsale, nothing really needs to be said about the performances of the rest of the cast because it is not what is in focus in Underworld. It isn't character-driven - it's action and visually driven. The villains are all nuanced, colourful and charismatic and that is what matters (that, and Shane Brolly is sexy as hell). The ending may seem somewhat anti-climactic, but now we know why - Mr. Kate Beckinsale already had a sequel in mind, making the ending of this film only assured on his part, paving the way for 'Evolution (2005).<br/><br/>That film happens be incredibly disappointing, but that's another story and Underworld is surprisingly good. 7/10"

","I'm a little late on this one but I have to do it. When Underworld came out in theaters back in '03, I never went to see it. I thought it was a gay vampire thing.

I'm like who is this hot chick whoopin azz and hey cool its Michael sheen, hey that guy is a werewolf..I mean lycan (hope this doesn't qualify as spoiling). I still didn't think much of it, I was too young to appreciate it. Now being about 3 years older I know now what I was missing. I am totally hooked into the Underworld Culture. To me it was dead until a recent revival at the beginning of the week, my deepest regret is not seeing the movies at the theater :(. Its probably because I didn't wanna go by myself and none of my friends were really into that kinda thing, and neither was I at one time. I mean I am seriously disappointed because I have been asking and none of my friends have seen this movie and only 2 of them have seen the sequel. But hopefully this will change, I am wandering aren't I? I seriously cannot stop watching this movie and the interesting and powerful sequel. I have been watching them every night for the past week. Overall this film is awesome and I highly recommend it. There is really no comparison for me, I have honestly found my very favorite movie of all time. The Underworld Franchise has made me reconsider my life and now I have finally decided what I will study in college and what I want to do as a career. Similar movies are the matrix and van helsing but they don't even come close."

And of course, beh√•llningen (what keeps it on top) is the wonderfully sexy Kate Beckinsale. The story is somewhat krystad (Swedish again). This means that sometimes, no matter how hard the actors try, the lines and story just isn't cool, or they are too pretentious. But that doesn't really matter when ms.

There is very little language with only three uses of the F-word and one of the S-word.This is a a fairly long movie with a lot of detail and a lot of long conversations, this is the only reason I only gave this movie a nine instead of a ten.Iwould definitely recommend this movie to anyone, and I have yet to see the sequel, I am waiting for it on DVD."

","As much as I love vampire and werewolf movies, I had my doubts about seeing UNDERWORLD upon its release in the Fall of 2003. It had a first time director, a writer whose only credit was an episode of ""The Outer Limits"", and Kate Beckinsale in the lead role, who hadn't exactly won me over with her performance in PEARL HARBOR. It certainly seemed like it could end up being a total stinker. To my surprise, I found myself loving UNDERWORLD when I got around to seeing it on DVD. I had been wrong about everything. Director Len Wiseman proved to be an excellent director, bringing a strong visual and kick-ass style to the picture that made it seem like a spin-off of BLADE. Danny McBride's screenplay is smart and extremely interesting. But what I was really wrong about was Kate Beckinsale. Wow! Here she proves not only is she sexy, she can actually act as well! Some of the other performances aren't up to par. Scott Speedman is okay, though didn't seem particularly right for the role he was playing while the less said about Shane Brolly's performance, the better. The other main flaw of the film is that it runs too long. What should have been a fast and exciting 90 to 100 minute seems padded and is dull in spaces. Thankfully, these flaws don't completely ruin UNDERWORLD. It remains one of the coolest and stylish films of the 2000s so far! Hopefully the upcoming sequel will be ever better. 8/10"

","K, to start off you have Kate Beckinsale as Selene a beautiful Vampire, who falls in love with a human. Awwww, what a great love story. Than there's the werewolves and they want to kill the vampires. This movie is pretty good, it's a great versus flick. I thought Kate did an amazing job in this movie, I've been a fan of hers for years. Also, the guy who plays Lucien, he's good too. For the fans who don't like a lot of gore like myself you'll be happy to know that unlike other vampire movies in the past, this one has gore, but very little of it. Also, the action scenes were great, awesome special effects and terrific acting make this movie a pretty good movie to see. I gave it a 7, because I personally really liked it, and I encourage you to see it for yourself. By the way, I am looking looking forward to watching the sequel, you can bet i'll be seeing that shortly and posting that review for you as well."

"ivc7-1","8","2","3","26 December 2005"," Fun movie, but not perfect.
","Funny how so many idiots have written grossly erroneous comments about this movie. Such stupid things as ""worst movie ever"" and ""Matrix rip-off"". It's not at all like the Matrix and only a fool would say it significantly is. Only a huge fool would say it's the ""worst movie ever"". Blade Trinity is a horrible movie and still isn't the worst ever. Underworld is actually a pretty solid movie with the exception of the Kraven character, which is poorly acted. The script is limited for some characters and takes a hit on that, but it's usually intentional. This movie also had an incredibly low budget and suffers from some lack of action and special effects. Those idiots that say it's action scenes are ""Matrix-like"" are about as far from the truth as it gets. There is NO bullet time and only two slightly slow-mo parts. To sum it up, for those of you who gave this less than a 4/10, you need a brain transplant."
"natchassl","10","2","3","30 November 2005"," love it
","A truly great and under appreciated movie. Wonderfully woven tale of love, very Romeo and Juliet with great action sequences and I really enjoyed the genetic component of the vampires and lycans existence. I also thought the actors cast in the film could not have been more perfect for the roles. They bring you into the characters and suspend disbelief. Another high point of this feature is the lack of cgi. Terrific throw back to monster making really brought the werewolves out and gave their movements balance and substance. While I love this film I understand that the content might not intrigue everyone. However, it well worth the money for a rental at the very least."
"kazmas","10","2","3","7 November 2005"," Different from other Vampire Movies which is excellent
","I watched Kate Beckinsale in Serendipity and i loved as much as acting as her Beauty.Later came out Van Helsing and i was wondering how will she managed that kind of a role-wild princess with a sword: and after i saw it i realized that she can play any role in any style of the movie. I'm i bit freak when it comes with a vampire movies (love old classic ones with Cristopher Lee as Dracula)-but as far as it goes-the movie has to have a good acting and good music to make it work. Well Underworld has it all. It has a great story (wich is very rear in the vampire movies). And Kate looks hot in it. Underworld is not a typical vampire movie we all now about: its different from other movies beacose it takes place in modern times, where are guns present in the battle. What surprise me is the style of the movie and the actors.They are drinking blood from glasses in ""civil"" way and they have modern cars like ""porche"" and all that. The movie is so fun too watch beacose there use real masks when it comes to werewolfs and not any computer effect-especially fighting sequence looks so real. I don't wanna go in the subject of music-all i wanna say is that the sound is brilliant and it goes very nicely with the movie.If you love horror vampire movies then you have to see this one- its worth it."
"Darkfrog24","9","2","3","7 November 2005"," It shouldn't be good, but it is.
","Let's face it, this movie has a stupid premise. Vampires and werewolves fighting? Okay... What this movie teaches us, it seems, is that if the writing is good, the story is good, the plot twists are good and the characters are good, it's okay if the premise is a little stupid.<br/><br/>Underworld surprised me, and that doesn't generally happen. The non-spiritual take on vampires and werewolves was a real treat, and Michael's flashbacks remind me of nothing so much as Niel Gaiman at his best, but I'd have to say that the most appealing part was the almost skeletal way they played the romance: The hero and heroine have only known each other for two days and... act like they've only known each other for two days? Brilliant! It made what was there so much more resonant and believable and highlighted the paranoia of certain other characters.<br/><br/>The biology referenced in this film was close to accurate, although not perfect. For Hollywood, it was Mensa.<br/><br/>There was one thing that I found particularly jarring, though: ""Lycan,"" sounds too much like ""lichen"" for the name to be particularly intimidating. That and the ending was a little bit too ""Hulk smash!""<br/><br/>Word of advice: I've seen the regular cut and the extended cut, and I have to recommend the former. Many of the ""extra"" scenes were good, but they just didn't fit into the whole."
"lordoftheguitar","8","2","3","13 October 2005"," A film of great magnitude
","Recently, this week, I have watched Underworld twice.<br/><br/>I admit the first time I watched it, I was a tad confused, especially with the first half, but as soon as you see the end it all makes perfect sense. Upon watching a second time I realised how good the film actually is (I did realise this before don't get me wrong). The film has what some people would call rusty acting, but if you listen , it is not actually rusty, just people with different accents from all over the world, showing the extreme power of the Vampire and Lycan covens, and how they have obviously travelled all over this globe. The best thing about the film though (SPOILER) is that you follow the paths of the Vampires all the way through the film, as the people who are out to do good, destroying this evil race that hunts them down also. And then two thirds of the way through there is a major twist and the whole film turns around so that you actually realise that the Vampires are the ones who started this war, and the bloodshed, and it was the Lycans who were under attack, after being kept as slaves. I think that in itself is a great power to do in a film. It is the same as watching the Matrix trilogy, then realising half way through, or in the last film, the the computers are the good guys and Neo and his friends are the evil ones... A great twist, backed up by fantastic effects and a passionate storyline. This film gets my vote."

This movie however hasn't really a plot. What's the movie about? who can actually say in words?? Selene is Beautiful and she falls in love with an attractive hybrid (Michael)I know the only reason men are seeing it is because of Kate. and girls for the thrill of the handsome actors in this film. I watched this with my brother and he fell asleep. After many times of watching it, I've come to see he was right, the plot was nowhere to the viewers visibility but The action is quite high and also the graphic and stunt work is pretty good.

","I saw this film on DVD first, came over it by accident while i was bored at my grandmothers. But my god when i finished that film i just had to watch it again, and again, and again.<br/><br/>It was pure genius, and this kind of a film coming from Len Wiseman where this was his first real directing job, i mean wow he can direct. I loved the whole story the Hybrid theory as it was, the fact that no one has ever really thought 'What if you crossed a Werewolf sorry lycan with a Vampyre'.<br/><br/>And you can relate to every person, Lycan or Vampyre. You have Raze a big brute of a Lycan but who solemnly pledges his allegiance to Lucian and Lucian the leader small in size but that doesn't stop him from casting his long shadow over his many minions. Then you have Selene, unbelievably beautiful yet dangerous, and Viktor the most powerful Vampyre by far, his stance alone can scare anyone or anything into cowering.<br/><br/>OK so Speedman kinda sucked, but the simple fact that Beckinsale and Knighy where absolutely awesome just completely overpowers your urge to rein hate on Speedman. And the special effects weren't half bad either, there were a few bits where you could see the transition to CGI or suited guys. And the gun fight at the start, when i first watched it i was kinda to enthralled and of course loved it, and i love every scene to this day, but my god that subway scene shows that Lycans and Vampyres cant aim at all.<br/><br/>But again all the bad points were completely washed away by the good. This is a great film and easily re watchable material. If you like the whole Vampire, werewolf's scenario you're going to love this, if you don't, well.............. you're still going to love it.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite films of all time, and i cant wait for the sequel"

When Michael becomes a vampire and werewolf he is totally hot and I would love to meet both him and Kate. Of course I don't think what Viktor did was right, he liked to Selene. The wolves didn't kill her family he did. And why would he kill his daughter just because she found someone that she really loved?

I liked the idea of the story but when I watched it I was disappointed because I had already seen most of what would have been the best parts. I have no connections with either side and the back story is vague.<br/><br/>The movie failed to lock my gaze. I found myself looking and interacting with other things while it was playing 1st run. I even let it play while I raided the fridge. Not much replay either, I've had it since it came out and i've only played it 2-3 times. By comparison: I have played the mummy and jp1,2&3 monthly.

","I have seen almost all the Vampire movies that have ever been made, and Underworld blows all the others away. Absolutely the best Vampire movie ever made. Kate Beckinsale's performance as Selene is outstanding. She makes you feel what you are seeing is real. The chemistry between she and Scott Speedman was awesome. It had several of the best action sequences that I have seen in any film in a long time. And this did not come off as cheesy at any point in my opinion, which is a HUGE accomplishment. Most Vampire films you end up going oh PLEASE! And you feel like your back watching one of those really awful B horror flix. NOT so here, this one was a winner from start to finish. I can't wait for the sequel!"

","I'm not an expert of Vampyr mythology, but I was always under the impression that Vampires had a physical, as well as mental <i>edge</i> over Lycans, so it was confusing (although visually appealing) to see a leather-clad Kate Beckinsale swirling in her black cape (a la Matrix) shooting from a pair of inexhaustable handguns at physically larger and more powerful werewolves.<br/><br/>I did appreciate the backstory to the War between the Vamps and the Lycans, but I think Wiseman failed at the exposition. Too much unneccessary exposition of Corwin's character and his odd chemistry with Seline could have been done more effectively. Their initial kissing scene came so far from left field, I felt embarrassed for the actors."

","Out of everything, Vicktor was the real star. His transformation was scary and his voice was creepy. I had reservations about getting this when it first arrived on PPV. Then I thought, vampyres and werewolves should be very interesting. Aside from the abrupt opening right into the action, the movie was strong in what is was built to do, MOVE. It kept moving too, as they were on slow parts what-so-ever. <br/><br/>The settings were awesome, the special effects were grand and the actors were on cue. The music was not my speed, so that was my only downfall. I noticed a few glitches here and there but still, I enjoyed what I saw.

","Did you know that there was a secret war going on that humans pretty much are clueless to? Seems werwolves and vampires have been living anything, but a peaceful coexistence. Vampires and werewolves have been engaged in war for many centuries now, but when one vampire starts questioning why this has been going on for so long and why the werewolves are after an oridnary citizen, it turns the vampire community inside out and causes the raising of an ancient vampire leader.<br/><br/>Borrows more then it's fair share from flicks like The Matrix, Blade, Resident Evil and countless other video games and movies, but it takes all of the elements it has stolen from other films and combines them skillfully. The film has top of the line sets, costumes, and really well excuted special effects that don't look nowhere near as cheap as the popular CGI. Plus it has an interesting Romeo & Juliet angel where one of the vampires ends up falling in love with a werewolf. Combine that with some daring casting that works for the most part and a script that tries not to be predictable and takes you on a route you didn't expect and I would say you have what will probably be the best horror film of the fall / winter 2003 season."

Review: I watched this movie as a kid and returning to it now, 10+ years later, I was expecting cringe and aged effects. Well, I am happy to say that, despite it's age, ""Underworld"" is still a great and very fun movie. Of course, it isn't a masterpiece, far from it. But it's what I think movie about vampires should be. My objections? Action could be better... A lot, lot better. If only someone who knew how to make good shooting scenes worked at the movie, we would have a gun fu epic, this way it's just average most of the time. Though I didn't watch the rest of the series, I know the quality sinks lower with every movie, so, if you need to watch one and be done with it, it would be this one, and not the prequel or sequels (and I doubt watching the prequel or sequels will change my mind). Al in all, it's a good blockbuster with decent acting, great main character and interesting story. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride while it lasts, and don't ask too much questions :D 8/10!

True, it isn't the most original concept and we have oft seen similar styles of treatment of ancient rivalries, but Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are engaging enough in this tale of vampires v werewolves. Scott Speedman provides the eye candy (but very little else) and Bill Nighy is superbly over the top as the recently raised from his slumbers ""Viktor"".

"Bored_Dragon","7","1","1","14 December 2019"," Underworld Franchise (2003-2016)
","Still a better love story than Twilight :D<br/><br/>Set (predominantly) in the present day, this fantasy franchise tells us of a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves. We follow the story from the perspective of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), one of the greatest vampire warriors, who leads the werewolf hunt. When she meets Michael (Scott Speedman), a man who is persecuted by werewolves for a mysterious reason, her life and worldviews change drastically. This saga has quite a well-crafted story and characterization, though as the franchise goes on, the quality of the story declines to eventually turn into a shallow action. The acting, the camera, the directing, the effects, the music ... it's all pretty well done, but nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>Underworld (2003)<br/><br/>The first film introduces us to the dark world of vampires and werewolves, which secretly coexists with ours. While vampires are a well-organized society with a powerful army, werewolves are a wild unleashed horde that is gradually exterminated by vampires. And then emerges a leader capable of uniting werewolves, as well as a man capable of uniting the features of both races in one hybrid being. A good thriller with a story that will intrigue you, and with just the right amount of romance and well-directed action.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Underworld: Evolution (2006)<br/><br/>""Evolution"" continues directly to the first movie and now Selene and Michael are trying to break into the history and secrets of both races, in a desperate attempt to bring the centuries-old war to an end. A worthy sequel in the same manner and quality as the first film.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009)<br/><br/>""Rise of the Lycans"" is an ""origins story"" and takes us into the Middle Ages. Vampires were aristocracy, and werewolves were their slaves, until the young werewolf Lucian rose into a leader who led his race in the struggle for liberation, thus beginning a centuries-old war between the two races. The franchise still holds a level.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Underworld: Awakening (2012)<br/><br/>Humans discover the existence of vampires and werewolves and decide to exterminate them. Michael and Selene are hit while fighting humans and she wakes up twelve years later, not knowing what happened to Michael. She now has a twelve-year-old daughter, the first natural-born hybrid, who she must protect from Lycans that want to take advantage of her in their fight for dominance.<br/><br/>The fourth film is slightly weaker than its predecessors. The action continues in the same manner, but the story is underdeveloped. I was under the impression that I was watching a long movie trailer, not the movie itself. But basically, I liked it.<br/><br/>6,5/10<br/><br/>Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)<br/><br/>The latest installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. ""Blood Wars"" rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.<br/><br/>5/10"

","22 September 2003. I can't say that Underworld was spectacular. It did make use of the latest special effects, slow-mo action moves from other contemporary action films (notably Matrix). It did have a decent script and a reasonable, consistent storyline that was intelligent. Yet I didn't find the movie really breaking any new, innovative ground, except for the fusion of vampires and werewolves (an intriguing idea done well). The acting was decent, if not superlative. There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth to many of the lead characters.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this horror movie didn't really spin the way most horror movies go and the Romeo and Juliet spin-off went a lot more American than the English version. I enjoyed the movie, but the action scenes seemed less than explosively dramatic and exciting than say for example Charlies' Angels. The horror wasn't as terrifying as for example 28 Days or The Ring.<br/><br/>This blending or fusion of genres makes for a more modest accomplishment, a more cerebral effort towards horror that produces one small step for vampires and werewolves, a giant step for a future movie.

","I'd heard so many negative reviews about this movie but I actually saw it in theaters with a friend. This was the first Kate Beckinsale film I actually liked. She made a good vampire she-warrior. It's no longer good versus evil but a story of survival. Who are the true villains? Vampires or werewolves? Or is there something darker at work? There's a lot going on and I found myself wondering who was who and what was going on throughout the film. It went pretty quickly. But in the end, it was a satisfying story that ended with an opening for a sequel. I remember coming out of the theater and hearing two people, a man and a woman, talking about it. They were both older than me, and the man apparently enjoyed it, but the woman said it was stupid. Or something like that. But as for me, it wasn't the worst film I had seen. It's no Oscar contender either but most movies aren't Oscar worthy. I mean, who really needs the Oscars? It's just a clique. Anyway, back to the movie. I was entertained and I especially liked how the makeup was done on the characters. Really creepy but cool. If you want action and vampires and werewolves, try this."

","As this film opens we are told that a war once raged between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) but six hundred years ago the Vampires killed Lucian, the leader of the Lycans and the war was over; since then the Vampires have been mopping up what was left of the Lycans. Then during one such operation Selene, one of the Vampires, senses that a nest of Lycans contains far more than had been seen in centuries. Her leader, Kraven, is dubious but she is convinced and investigates what the Lycans were doing. She is surprised to see they appear to be following a specific human; Michael Corvin.<br/><br/>It turns out the he is a direct decedent of the ancestor of both Vampires and Lycans and could potentially become a hybrid of both! The Vampires are determined to kill him but Selene isn't so sure. As time passes she learns that much of what she has been told is untrue and if she is to survive she will have to battle both Lycans and Vampires.<br/><br/>This is a decent fantasy adventure; they is lots of action throughout and an interesting story. The setting is dark and moody which gives the film a good feel; this is added to by the fact that the characters seem to have a thing about wearing black. This is especially true of Kate Beckinsale who looks fantastic in tight black PVC; she isn't just there for her looks though; she does a fine job in the role. She is ably supported by Michael Sheen as Lucian and Bill Nighy as Viktor, the most powerful of the Vampires. Scott Speedman is slightly less impressive as Michael but that could be seen as a deliberate attempt to make the human character less of a presence than the supernatural creatures. The action is directed stylishly and nicely updates the vampire/werewolf mythology with modern weapons used to fire special bullets that play on each creatures traditional weaknesses. Overall a solid enough film that fans of the genre are likely to enjoy."
"Aaron1375","8","1","1","23 June 2007"," Gothic tale of the war between vampires and werewolves.
","Rather good and sleek action/horror hybrid in the same vein as a Blade, though not quite up to that movie. The action is good, and the scenery is good to as the city setting seems very other worldly, a Gothic mixture of old and new. The story, there has been an ages old feud between werewolves and vampires, the vampires apparently winning as they are slowly but surely wiping the wolves out. However, there seems to be a new target of the wolves, a young doctor whose blood the wolves want for reasons that are not immediately clear. So there ya have it, throw in a lot of gun fire and some latex and you have your movie. There are problems with the film though as there are a lot of double crosses and I am still not one hundred percent clear as to what made the doctor dude so important. Still, there is plenty of action to watch and lots of blood too. It was funny seeing how the werewolves were a bit rough and the vampires looked like aristocrats. It was a bit hard to pull for either side until the end when all the motivations were on the table too, as neither side seemed really to be making a target of humans. So all in all a good action/horror flick."

","I liked the movie, but there was so much that could have been expanded and so much that could have been left out. Throughout the entire movie there was one kiss and it wasn't even a real kiss!!! The scene where the guy with the metal whips was fighting the werewolf could have been better. I have some other opinions but don't have the time or the energy to try and type them all out so this is a just a basic overview of what I thought."
"mmrufflo","7","1","1","3 October 2003"," action makes up for the poorly done script...
","I don't know why reviews were squashing this movie. Mabye because it was about vampires again! Perhaps because it was a perfect mixture of the Matrix and Blade II. Whatever it was, I don't care. I thought the movie was fun and quite enjoyable to watch. It had some good actors, a good plot, and a TON of ACTION.<br/><br/>To me, a movie doesn't have to be all story. They basically got the story in about a total of twenty minutes so what to do about the other one hour and forty-one minutes left? ACTION! Why not amaze the audience with some horror, gore and fun? The warewolves changing were very new and different from the old changes. The effects were great and the actors worked well with it. Kate Beckinsale did a fine, not great job playing Selene. She wore the leather well and spoke the lines perfectly. The other actors did fine too but MY GOD; what was with Shane Brolly's (Kraven's) role! I think he just, well....sucked. He did a terrible job and I believe he could have been replaced. It would have made the movie better. One bad actor can screw up a whole movie. Besides that, the acting was great.<br/><br/>In the reviews, they talked up how rediculous the romance was between Selene and Michael. Only one problem with that, there wasn't any! They shared one meaningless kiss and then they went back to the beautiful ACTION.<br/><br/>So bottom line, if you don't like vampires, darkness, The Matrix, or ACTION-don't see this."

Incredible camera work, awesome stunts, brilliant casting, unbelievable score, and kick ass special effects make this movie one of the bests I've seen this year.  However, the movie was not flawless.  There were certain points in the plot that reminded me of Blade, which is not a bad thing.  There was also one character whom, every time he spoke, I felt as if I were going to vomit.  Other than that, the movie rocked.  I give it ****1/2 out of 5."

Yes it is all surface, all visual.  but to complain about that would be like complaining about a painting being all visual.  That is the nature of the work.  There are some great visulal moments like early on with a view of rain dripping off of Kate Beckinsale's supernaturally long fingers.  The problem is that it is not as visually powerful as BLADE or THE CROW although it is in the same genre.  If that is your cup of tea (or blood) see it. Don't worry about someone spoiling it for you by telling you about it. Since it is entirely visual, there can't be a spoiler."

","for one reason or another, this movie was given mediocre reviews before it even came out. fans and critics alike were comparing it to ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""The Matrix,"" and various other dark and/or romance movies. i went in thinking the same because 2 of the lead stars, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, made their names known in such movies. but i am here to tell you that some people should not count their chickens before they hatch--this movie was GREAT! Len Wisemen knew what it was he wanted and he delivered. what made this movie so superb was that everything made to make this movie(music, lighting, wardrobe)seemed like it was made FOR this movie. and of course, the cast(along with the makeup crew) added the finishing touches. i won't go into the plot of the movie, but i will tell you that the previews were a bit misleading, in a good way. there is no way any of the previews could possibly show a viewer what this movie has to offer. it's not gothic, it's not romantic, and it's not gory, but it is still a great movie. i will not compare it to any other movie because there is nothing to which i can compare it. just go to this movie to see a good movie, not Oscar winning performances or gratuitous violence. for action, originality, and an overall well made movie, go see Underworld."
"Stanley_L_Walker","10","1","1","25 September 2003"," Not Bram Stoker's Dracula, but hella cool in its own right
","I think this movie will be hated on namely because it trounces this summer's big budget action movies in every department for only a tenth of what it cost to make the major releases.  I paid $19.50 for me and my girl to see this film and it was not at all disappointing.<br/><br/>In fact, it rocked.  And hard!<br/><br/>If you've seen a preview, then you already know the film looks good.  It is very stylish and heavy on the atmospherics.  There was a surprising and action packed story with characters one grows to like.  The creators do a very good job of conveying the realm these creatures dwell in and the war between the covens of vampyres and the dens of werewolves.<br/><br/>You'll read a lot of reviews screaming ""derivative! derivative!"" and then mentioning names like the Matrix and Blade.  Don't believe the hype.  The Matrix by no means whatsoever originated leather clad badasses.  By the same token, Blade did not originate sword wielding immortals nor the nonmagical, nonmystic take on vampyres.  UNDERWORLD does a great job of respecting known vampyre/wolven lore and adds to it and paving the road to an intriguing future.  There's no doubt a second installment is forthcoming.  There must be, as it would be too great a waste of such a terrific setup.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that UNDERWORLD does deliver on the action and never falls prey to cheese.  It follows its own rules and doesn't fall into the horrific trap of ""letting the hero/ine just because s/he is the hero/ine."" Everything makes sense and comes together and you'll have great time getting there."

The story could have had a little more detail.  Secondly, about halfway through I got the feeling that I was just being set up for a sequel, which obviously was correct. Lastly, you really don't get to see too much about the werewolves, other than they are constantly attacking the vamps.

"AlissonNJ","7","1","1","23 September 2003"," Gritty & foreboding
","I wanted to 'love' this movie - instead I 'liked' it a lot (I would have given 3.5 stars if possible).  Underworld tells a story of a war between vampires and werewolves that goes on for centuries.   Each side it trying to wipe out the other.  With assets such as the beautiful and deadly vampire warrior Selene and a powerful lineage of elders, the vampires have dominated. until now as the werewolves have a new plan found in Michael, the newly bitten werewolf and his unique bloodline.<br/><br/>First the positives - Underworld has a decent story line with some compelling twists to keep it moving along.  It has an awesome look and feel that manages to maintain the gritty, foreboding feeling displayed in the trailer. The CG was for the most part not overdone.   The music is good and well matched.  Plus. they left it wide open to a sequel.<br/><br/>The negatives - There was no strong actors to deliver the strength and power that this film needed.  While the story was well crafted, it lacked the details to make it very interesting.  The werewolf transformations (CG) took place in the dark in an obvious attempt to hide any flaws.<br/><br/>While I was a little disappointed, I certainly recommend this movie and I have great hopes for the sequel!"
"mwendel","7","1","1","23 September 2003"," I really enjoyed this film (possible spoilers)
","This film was not what I expected.  I truly expected a knock down drag out end-to-end attempt by vampires and werewolves to annihilate each other with big explosions, unbelievable fight scenes and over the top special effects. Is that what everyone does these days?<br/><br/>Instead, there actually was a decent surprisingly unpredictable story with good sub plots and a very gothic ambiance.  I think all of them might have been a little bit under developed, or maybe they were lopped off to bring the length of the movie down; I guess we will have to wait for a director's cut to find out.<br/><br/>The story does have some surprising plot twists, which you may or may not be able, to figure out until they actually happen- thankfully, in my opinion, they were not telegraphed.  Another notable element is that vampires in this story don't turn into bats, fog or rats, they're just people afflicted with a virus as are the werewolves.  Which is one of the different strains (no pun intended) of the supernatural/horror genre that's from a more scientific than mystical influence.<br/><br/>The technical special effects, thankfully, were not ridiculously overdone and made in such a way to blend very well into the film.  It seemed like a lot of detail went into doing the effects that were used, rather sparingly, which I felt lent more credible to the movie as a story than a wide screen goth-horror-action explosion.<br/><br/>I think the characters were intriguing, although knowing a little more about them might have been interesting, especially Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) - we know in the end what his ties to both the vampires and the werewolves is, but we really don't know much about him other than that he was a resident at a hospital.  For Selene (Kate Beckingsdale) you don't need to know much because basically she's been doing what she's been doing for several hundred years and her character is basically unchanged - she's a warrior and a survivor who follows her instincts for better or worse.<br/><br/>It would have been more interesting to find out how the deal that spared Kraven's (Shane Brolly) life actually occurred as that is on of the major catalysts to how the story unfolds.  The only other thing I would have really like to have found out about, was the hierarchical structure of the vampire world because it appeared very complex and sophisticated.  Whereas, it appears that the werewolves have little to no structure at all and that which they have is all through the mechanizations of Lucian (Michael Sheen).<br/><br/>But if I say more, I may give too much away, if I haven't already.  I think this movie is worth seeing.  The sets are good, the weapon's tech is very cool and all in all it's a movie that has a slightly different beat than most of what we've seen this year."
"1024","7","1","1","23 September 2003"," Great concept and atmosphere spoiled by too much ""product""
","First off, let me say that Len Wiseman really did his homework for<br/><br/>this film. Bringing in the real life (and still living) Corvinus family<br/><br/>and several other historical incidents of vampires and werewolves<br/><br/>added authority to the film. Wiseman was a set designer, and his<br/><br/>attention to detail and atmosphere shows up well. The weird<br/><br/>monochrome blue cast reminds me of the best black and white<br/><br/>cinematography from the 30s and 40s. Let's face it; Kate Beckinsale leaping, jumping  floating and<br/><br/>slithering around in a glossy black latex corset is no small reason<br/><br/>to see this film either. Maybe the most intriguing aspect of all is the<br/><br/>novel idea that Vamps and Lycans have a genetic mutation to<br/><br/>thank for their immortality rather than a supernatural cause. I really tried to like this film. It IS above average (10,000 times<br/><br/>better that the God-Awful Dracula 2000) but not as exceptional as it<br/><br/>could've been. Wiseman seems to be trying to make a John Woo<br/><br/>horror flick. There's just too much gunplay and too little script. The<br/><br/>young male leads prove that Hollywood is taking full advantage of<br/><br/>gender role reversal by hiring lots of male ""metrosexual"" actors<br/><br/>who know a lot about ""Hair Product"" and very little about how to<br/><br/>deliver a line onscreen....the lead male Lycan is perhaps an<br/><br/>exception. After the umpteenth gunfight, I started yawning. The final gun-free<br/><br/>battle gets better when Beckinsale joins the fight and at least<br/><br/>delivers a stirring ending.  This is a B movie with an A budget,<br/><br/>elevated to higher status by superior sets and Kate Beckinsale. It<br/><br/>has some pretty novel ideas, and could possibly develop into a<br/><br/>really good series if Wiseman can focus a bit & Beckinsale<br/><br/>returns. It's worth a look if you're into Vampire flicks."
"Mykewood","10","1","1","23 September 2003"," If you liked blade, you'll love this!
","This movie is a good take on the old original story of werewolves & vampires.  Werewolves were the daytime protectors of the vampires.  But something happened that caused them to become mortal enemies & started a 1000-year war.  There isn't a lot of direct character development, but that would have slowed the movie down.  It's much like the 1st Matrix, enough action at the beginning to get you interested, then they tell the story so you have an understanding of what's going on, then they get back to the action.  The character development is subtler, in that you discover the inner workings of Selena as she does.  In this type of story it works.  You can't go into this movie expecting Terms of Endearment or Casablanca.  It is what it is, an action/horror flick.  It does the action very well; the horror part is more shock value then actual horror, like most so-called horror movies these days.  The acting is decent.  Nobody really stands out as far as the acting, good or bad, which I like, because it keeps 1 character from dominating the film.  All the characters I thought blended well into the story.  So you care more about what's going on, then who is doing what.  I give it a 10 out of 10.  Because it is very good in its genre, it's the best sci-fi/action movie since Matrix.  I recommend it to any action movie buff.  I if you liked Blade, you'll love this!"
"MadWatch","5","1","1","22 September 2003"," Out of the way traditional mythology!!
","Out of the way traditional mythology!! Here comes the all-new, all-different mythology!<br/><br/>Remember when Vampires were solitary undead creatures that fed on the blood of the living? They were scared by symbols of religious power, hurt by garlic and sunlight, cast no reflections, could mentally dominate someone weaker than them, change their form into a bat and the only way to kill them was to put a stake through their hearts.<br/><br/>Well, those are the ""old"" style, stuffy vampires (*rolleyes*). The ""new"" age vampires are sleek and sexy and like to hold partys in elaborate mansions. If holy artifacts or garlic bother them, there is no mention of this and there is no no-reflection problem. They like to wear tight, black clothing, roam around the urban sprawl at nighttime and use guns. A lot.<br/><br/>Remember when Werewolves were solitary creatures with tortured souls that were *cursed* with lycanthropy? The full moon made them turn into murderous, half-wolf creature fated to kill until someone was able to put them out of their misery.<br/><br/>Well, those were the ""old"" style, stuffy werewolves. The ""new"" age werewolves live in packs under the city and can change their form at will. It is not so much as a ""curse"" of lycanthropy, but a way to get super-hero powers of supernatural strength, agility and invulnerability. Also, they like to use guns. A lot.<br/><br/>It's a sad fact that what the modern world continues to call ""vampires"" and ""werewolves"" and almost completely different creatures from their originals.<br/><br/>Anyway, how was the movie otherwise? It was okay. As others have mentioned, it was an action style Vampire/Werewolf version of Romeo & Juliet. As I mentioned, since the original ideas of Vampires and Werewolves are long gone, you just have to assume that the creatures in this movie are doing what they are supposed to be. The feel of the movie is more like watching someone playing a video and you missed the first part. The person playing know what is going on and accept what is happening, but what is being presented to you is missing explanation.<br/><br/>One of the jokes about action movies is that the main character can go single-handedly against a bunch of enemies, with bullets whizzing everywhere, and walk away unscathed, while the enemies are all dead. Well, this movie goes overboard on this. In one scene, the main character, Selena is confronted by 5 machine-gun weilding enemies. She is crouched down at the far end of a room and fires her pistols, straight-armed at the enemies that are using the doorway as cover. Meanwhile, 5 of them unload machine guns into the room she is in. The result? 5 dead enemies, while she walks away unscathed. Why are these Lycans so scary?<br/><br/>Despite having Vampire and Werewolves (traditional ""horror"" creatures), this is in no way a horror movie. It is an action movie. I cant even say that this movie has nice combat scenes, because whenever Selena was confronted by an enemy, there was no suspense, no assumption that she may get hurt. It was like she invulnerable (or what gamers would call ""being in God mode""). *Yawn*<br/><br/>I thought that the Vampires were a bunch of prissy, lad-de-da, gothic party goers and really, really wanted them to die. Even though the Lycans were ""supposed"" to be the bad guys, I felt pity for them because they seemed downtrodden and had little hope, where the Vampires lived the life of luxury (this is explained in the movie, though).<br/><br/>I also, couldnt help but notice the underlying social undertones: The brutish, animalistic Werewolves were all male, yet the sleek, sexy, charismatic vampires were males OR females, with<br/><br/>the lead character being a female. Of course, it was the Lycans plan to bring them all together in a form of harmony and joining and it was the Lycans that were enslaved by the Vampires.<br/><br/>Overall, I give the movie a 5 out of 10. The story was rather blase for the 1st two-thirds, but picked up once you found the ""true"" story. The action scenes were pointless, especially the ones involving the main character."
"DesiringMachines","4","1","1","20 September 2003"," Bah
","I think the director took a few too many cues from The Matrix despite lacking the ability to hold such a big story together, and obviously lacking some of the effects budget - the Lycans were cool looking but the fight scenes weren't that great - since when would vampires fight like Marines? Not a bad movie. Just not good either, which is unfortunate because it had potential."
"csumen","10","1","1","20 September 2003"," great concept- see the trailer instead
","Not bad for a female Blade movie. plot is not as light as it appears and has some interesting premises (eg. the fighting cousins concept, slaves vs masters). Lotsa guns, action sequences well done but few in number (hence the trailer is the best part about it) and the movie has an overachieving low budget feel (a la Equilibrium) rather than the cinematic opulance of Matrix for example. Beckinsale combines fragility with a lethal attitute, not a bad action heroine start. The love interest guy was very dull, didn't portray an MD type convincingly, and Kraven was a whining muskrat of a vampire, so much so that I was laughing at all his line deliveries by the end. The vampires were very effete creatures and it was a wonder how they could ever lord it over their lower class brethren, especially with the day disadvantage (the only classical vampire weakness brought up in the movie). Overall, the movie is pretty cool and as flashy as the fake silvery 'silver nitrate' the vampires used...don't know if it's cool enough to be pre-wired for a sequel though."
"The_Dodge","10","1","1","20 September 2003"," Better than i expected
","There is a great war between Vampires and Lycans (Werewolf). Selene (A cool Beckinsale, is one of the werewolves who is fighting to avenge her family's death. However she uncovers a plan where the werewolves are looking for a human (Scott Speedman), and its up to her to protect herself and Speedman as both the Werewolves and Vampires search for them. To be honest i expected this film to suck. I mean the tone is similar to Blade, the fight scenes are out of the Matrix, and its got just about everything from every Vampire, Werewolf and Goth film out there. However, Underworld is a pleasant surprise as it tries to at least give put some thought on familiar trodden territory. The storyline is pretty well throughout, even though with the amount of subplots and backstory it does get confusing at times. Beckinsale is excellent as Selene as she seems very capable when it comes to the action scenes, and she wont let fellow Vampires stop her from doing the right thing. She is always focused on acheiving her goal without anyone stopping her. Scott Speedman is perfectly cast as the confused human (Michael) who gets bitten by a Lycan and is protected by Selene from the Lycans who are out to search for him. The action scenes are excellent. From the Vampires using an arsenal of gun s to the camera changing to Werewolves viewpoint (Which is inspired by Sam Raimi), there are some of the best scenes in terms of action you will probably see all year. The only thing i don't like is the sometimes confusing plot and the exposition, but that could be because i expected the film to have a thin storyline when i walked into the cinema. However a few scenes don't work very well which have very little aside from a few characters talking about certain plot points for a few minutes. However this is only a minor quibble and it shouldn't distract from the entertaining film too much. Even though this film hasn't got the budget or hype that other blockbusters films do, it deserves to do as successful as them. Who knows this may even evolve into a cult classic.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I went to this film out of a liking for the ""Blade"" films and a desire to entertain myself with some black-leather eye-candy (AKA ""Beckinsale"") -- expecting VERY little.  With the starting graphics, annoying voice over and Kate Beckinsale's lack of grace as a vampire I was immediately concerned that I was in for a very poorly executed ""me too"" flick.  But by the time the initial 15 minutes got over with I found myself being pulled into a very captivating and beautiful world.  (In fact, the sound was off in the theater, making the dialog sound all hollow and distant, and I was so intrigued by the story I didn't want to go out to complain that I could hardly hear!) Not deep, but then again not nearly as pretentious as most other ""comic gothics"" lately, and that gives it a charm not at all present in other efforts, Clones, Matrices and Blades.  Definitely worth a view."
"Makaroni","4","1","1","19 September 2003"," Nothing original.
","I hoped this would be a really cool movie. It showed some potential. I kind of figured it wouldn't quite cut it though. It was entertaining enough to keep me awake for two hours but the plot is somewhat muddled and confusing. The movie spends most of it's time presenting stylish shots of vampires shooting werewolves and likewise. Things go boom a lot and there are some serious cliches, some guy's head gets sliced with a sword and then after he stands there for a few minutes the top of his head slides off. How many times have I seen THAT this year? The action sequences are also very confusing. The vampires and werewolves all wear similar drab grey clothing and combined with the drab grey filming and poor editing the end result is an insane jigsaw puzzle of who's killing who. Most of the time it is impossible to tell what's going on. There are huge editing/screenplay issues. Someone is credited as Michael's Girlfriend in the end credits. If you are paying close attention you will see that she is one of the bystanders killed during the first ultra stylish vampire vs werewolf action sequence. She must have been really special to him too, since he doesn't seem to care AT ALL that she's dead. He doesn't even mention her at anytime through the rest of the film.<br/><br/>But to sum it up, what you've got here is a whole bunch of soap opera actors playing unconvincing vampires and werewolves and a fairly bland screenplay with a lot of shooting and cliche dialogue. It was very clear to me after watching this that the filmakers' intention was simply to cash in on the goth/vampire subculture and not actually to produce a good movie. Then they figured they would throw in some cool Matrix moves. Why not? Everyone else is doing it."
"JulioBro","10","1","1","19 September 2003"," Juicy red...and tasty
","This movie is, as we say in Puerto Rico, ""brutal""! (pronounced brootaal) It's simply one of the best movies made regarding transylvanian characters. Like in the Matrix, a combination of themes and stuff previously experienced in other movies is successfully combined, but with the unique European style.<br/><br/>Most action movies from Europe tend to be very fast, not much development for characters and some slow motion; this is different. Like in Brotherhood of the Wolves, the inner feelings of the characters are more displayed and developed; their past an integral part of the story. The action is very stylish with exotic guns, exotic cars, high fashion in black, good special fx, and very detailed slo-mo takes; very, very nice.<br/><br/>What makes Underworld truly different from the others, is what made The Matrix different, a detailed structured story with good foundation and motivation. This is not let's kill everyone because they're bad, there is a very specific and logical reason for what's happening, and the story makes you interested on it. The movie is not that much Matrix, it's more Shakespeare meets Blade. The drama is deep, controversy and intrigue is everywhere, and the twists are surprising, as they should be. This could only come from Europe, I just wish they would use more expensive film or higher resolution cameras, most of the movie is kind of grainy and we're already accustomed to the sharpness and solidness that 21st century movies should go for; but that's a minor glitch.<br/><br/>As far as vampires and werewolves go, the movie is super. A deeper kind of creature story with attractive styling, but enough blood as to not let you forget...these are monsters of the night, they feed on humans."

","Selene(Kate Beckinsale) a vampire warrior and a death dealer, along with the rest of her kind, is in a war with the lycans and hunts them down and kills them. But things get complicated when a human(Scott Speedman) gets bitten by a lycan and Selene falls in love with him. Slowly she starts finding out about her past, how she became a vampire in the first place and why vampires and lycans hate each other. Now, this movie may sound and look good in the trailer but it definitely isn't. I like old-fashioned vampires, not vampires who wear leather pants, own guns and spend time on the internet. There was way to much action going on but not much of a story. This movie was very boring and too long and just a big waste of time. I would give Underworld 4/10, for some good scenes and because it could have been a better movie if it tried."

","Forget the Matrix Reloaded...if you want a dark, leather trenchcoat clad movie, dripping with coolness from bloody fangs, then Underworld is your movie.  Far too many movies I've seen over the years have promising trailers, but fail to deliver.  This is why I was hoping that this movie would deliver, and I was pleased to find out that it most certainly did.<br/><br/>Great performances all around and spectacular special effects (save for a few sub par CGI moments) really makes the story flow nicely.  Speaking of which, yes, this movie actually has a story!  As sad as that may sound about most Hollywood movies of recent times, this movie has a great, engaging story that is coherent as it is interesting.  Quite a change from the confusing plotlines of Matrix Reloaded and other films that have come out this year.  The plot is excellent, and is explained well throughout.  Any times where you may be scratching your head are cleared up usually a scene later, which I cannot say about other movies I have seen recently in the theater that opt to leave holes in the plot that remain unanswered.<br/><br/>This movie is a combination of The Matrix, Blade and Romeo and Juliet.  You have two feuding families of vampires and werewolves, whose only purpose is to eradicate the other...and oh yeah, they wear cool, dark outfits and sport state of the art weaponry (I thought the werewolves' bullets that contained sunlight in them was by far the coolest).  You also have the talented and insanely hot Kate Beckinsale as the lead, kicking fierce butt.  Her performance was by far the best of all, and you can feel her character's torment throughout.  Save for one very bad actor, who sadly is a major character in the film, every other performance is excellent, and adds to the gothic darkness that is the setting of this movie.  And of course, the special effects (especially the werewolves) were among the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The only thing I wanted more from this movie was a little more character development.  Though the actors do an incredible job of making their characters realistic as if popping out of the pages of a graphic novel, the script, unfortunately, did not supply enough background on many on the support characters...but, there is still enough background to give them depth, and to give a damn when one of them gets dispatched.  Also, almost every character does have a secret motive for his/her actions which adds to the story.  But, that is truly my only complaint with the movie, that there could have been a little more backstory to each character...otherwise, this has been the best movie of the year by far, in my opinion.  This is an exciting movie with great performances, dark, gothic set pieces, non-stop action and one of the best stories I have seen in a movie in a long time.  I highly recommend Underworld...it truly does come close to giving the original Matrix a run for its money.  9/10 stars."
"Viz79","10","1","1","19 September 2003"," Easily the best pure vampire movie I have seen
","Before I went into see this movie, I was a little.. concerned, simply because of a couple of reviews I had seen. The trailers seemed like a dream because of the style and the content which I found really appealing. Come on, werewolves, vampires in a dark gothic setting battling it out.. if done well it could be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is a masterpiece I can tell you now - never does it bore, but the story does captivate you, continues to twist and in the end it would be very odd if you were not satisfied on the storyside. The cinematography is again superb, giving you classic slightly grey view of everything and even openly shows some cliched gothic backdrops to indicate that it is very much the world that you would have thought of.<br/><br/>The acting is more than adequate for something like this but the visual effects are great as well - it is not the Matrix and only shows the 'slow down' scene twice in the entire movie, yet the action is always interesting as you follow it all on screen.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I felt I was there, in a world where vampires and lycans existed and where at each others throats for their own reasons. And if this movie managed to achieve that, and had me coming out of the movie going 'wow that was superb.. Ill be watching that again, I want the DVD and I hope desperately for a sequel' you know you have something special."

","Maybe I'm getting jaded in my middle age but I don't quite get as wrapped up in flicks as I used to.<br/><br/>Not so with UNDERWORLD.  This is a very engaging flick.  Sure, it's evocative of Matrix and its clones but you know what?  Here's a case where a second-generation flick is BETTER than the ones that inspired it!<br/><br/>Maybe the secret of UNDERWORLD's success is that it is NOT a Hollywood flick?  The team of Brit, German, and Hungarian filmmakers have succeeded in making a big budget, FX-heavy flick that does not have the oppressive obnoxiousness of flicks like The Matrix or the incredibly awful Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (the REAL Worst IMDB flick of all time!). <br/><br/>Hidden away in Hungary, the filmmakers were free to make an interesting flick and not have to deal with studio execs and focus groups.<br/><br/>I agree there is not a lot of overt character development.  But what there is is subtle and nicely done.  Michael, for example, is shown as a caring person even during the subway shootout.  This IS the guy who will bring an end to the persecution of the downtrodden werewolves, despite being drawn unwilling into their conflict.  Selene is withdrawn, literally dead inside because of her centuries-old grief for her family.  Had she been wisecracking or even smiling, THAT would have been out of character. Victor is a truly scary depiction of a noble yet ruthless superbeing. Hopefully directors, writers, and stars of more tradition comic book flicks to come will take note, learn, and finally give a real performance rather than just do a Nicholson ham job. <br/><br/>One note about Selene's bodysuit--  it's 35 years since Diana Rigg set the model.  Nice to see it carried on."

","From the previews they make it look like they are going to make a big deal of the romance between Selene and Michael.  It's just downplayed a large amount which is great.

The ones they did use had some interesting results however.  <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie for lovers of vamps and werewolves alike.  I like the way they show the werewolves change.  Kind of a new faster way than the slow hair growing you might be used to seeing.<br/><br/>All in all this is a film that should do well in the box office and may have set itself up nicely for a sequel if the studio so desires.

"mentalcritic","2","5","12","9 March 2006"," A load of...
","The horror and action genres have become so overloaded with clich√©s that to some extent, they now must resort to great lengths in order to seem mildly unique, leave alone inventive. Underworld attempts to become unique by pitting two overused creatures of myth and legend against one another. Unfortunately, the writer/director is a first-timer, as are both of the writers where feature films are concerned. Sometimes, one can disguise the fact with flashes of brilliance or inventiveness. Nobody would suspect that RoboCop was Edward Neumeier's first sold screenplay, for example. Unfortunately, Underworld wastes no time in showing that Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride have about as much writing talent between them as Edward Neumeier's nose hairs displayed in RoboCop. Indeed, a comparison is fair between RoboCop and Underworld because both try to reinvent a stale genre. Underworld fails where RoboCop succeeded because it has no idea when to break the rules, or how. The fact that it dates itself without stopping for breath does not help.<br/><br/>Underworld concerns itself with the seemingly endless battle between the aristocratic vampires and the savage, ornery werewolves. In another attempt to distinguish itself, the word Lycan is used in place of werewolf, despite the fact that Lycanthrophy is generally used to refer to morphing into a number of animals these days. And that highlights one of the most major problems with the film. The makers have a poor attitude, having the nerve to claim that audiences were indifferent to the film because they did not ""get"" things like the use of the word Lycan. This attitude has apparently not changed in the sequel, where the screenplay progressively reverts to werewolf. The problem here is that this telegraphs both the kind of audience the makers were aiming for, in addition to their contempt for the audience. From the editing to the hideous photography, Underworld announces itself as an R film trying to pander to a PG-13 audience. As a result, it winds up in no man's land, trying to appeal to everyone and pleasing no one.<br/><br/>Failing to help matters is that the characters have all the extra dimensions of puddles, and the actors are unable to combat the effect. Bill Nighy looks especially uncomfortable trying to deliver his atrocious dialogue, which is heavily burdened with trying to set up the rules instead of putting them into effect. Which only serves to highlight the film's most fatal flaw. In its attempt to make something the audience have never seen without the expertise to make it make sense, Underworld gets bogged down in exposition to such an extent that the middle section could be used to prove Einstein's theory of relativity. In Einstein's most simple explanation of the theory, when one spends an hour with a beautiful woman like Kate Beckinsale, it seems like a mere second, but when one spends a second with their hand on a hot stove, it seems like an hour. The second act of Underworld, in which Selene attempts to secure Michael against those seeking to use him to their ends and expose the truth about Viktor, is like having a wart burned out with liquid nitrogen. The middle of Underworld literally makes one feel as if time is slowing down in order to amplify one's discomfort.<br/><br/>Apparently, the makers of the film felt the boredom was insufficient, because they have delivered an extended cut that replaces eleven minutes of existing footage while adding another twelve. While I cannot comment on the extended cut of the film, I can say that it would take a lot more than replacing eleven minutes to address the film's most stunning problem. In contrast to the recent sequel, in which Selene and Michael managed to show enough character to make viewers care about their plight, the entire cast here might as well be dolls with human mouths blue-screened over theirs. One knows even less about them when the film is over compared to when it began. Viktor suffers the worst from this terrible storytelling, with his character having no other purpose to betray his own kind and be an insufferable so-and-so. Matter of fact, the only characters who do not warrant a good punch in the face throughout their screen time are Selene and Michael, which is just as well when you consider that they are the characters upon which the entire film hangs. Even George Lucas was able to give characters like Anakin Skywalker a second dimension during his prequel trilogy, if only barely.<br/><br/>As I said in my comments about Underworld: Evolution, the sequel is a bit of an improvement. But when you have a lead-in like this, even the third Matrix episode constitutes an improvement. By comparison, the two recent X-Men films directed by Bryan Singer take a first act that generates tear-inducing sympathy for the most important characters from an educated audience, and adds a second act that has the audience cheering on the mutants as they wage war, regardless of their actual goodness or whatever. By comparison, Underworld is a sleeping pill followed by a dash of coffee. Due to differences in the way my neurochemistry works, neither have a discernible effect upon me, and I would not be overly generous in the description of the effect they have on others. And thus, the failure of Underworld is summarised: in spite of trying to pass for adult-oriented entertainment, it barely has enough to excite the teen audience the studio had in mind. In fact, I feel I am insulting teenagers with that sentence.<br/><br/>I gave Underworld a two out of ten. It is too good to be bad enough to be good. Thus, it winds up firmly stuck in no man's land. I have heard it jokingly called Underpants by detractors, and I say if the shoe fits, then wear it."

","The movie is wonderfully made and has a perfectly, moody dark atmosphere. The visual effects are convincing enough and there are some nicely shot action sequences. Still the movie is not as good as it could had been, especially when considering what its concept is.<br/><br/>Problem with the movie is that it isn't really an entertaining one to watch. The movie could had really used some humor at times and the story and the movie in general, takes itself way too serious. It makes the movie a bit heavy and hard one to watch at times and because of this all the movie doesn't really have an high entertainment value. Another thing is that the story becomes unnecessary hard to follow at times, because of the very same reason. The movie is not halve as entertaining as it could had been. The concept of the movie; Werewolves versus vampires sounds good but the execution of it is done too seriously. It's done with style certainly but not with a sense for entertainment. The result is a good looking- but mostly empty movie that isn't really always constantly pleasant to watch.<br/><br/>The movie also lacks some real likable characters. Seline is a cool chick but I don't have the feeling that we ever fully get to know and understand her. Also there is absolutely no chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman, which makes parts of the movie weak at times.<br/><br/>The acting is fair enough. The actors fit their roles well and that is what really counts. Bill Nighy is always great to watch in a movie and this one is no exception. He plays the best part of the movie, a sort of √ºber-vampire.<br/><br/>It certainly is a watchable movie, especially to those who also liked the first two Blade movies.

","Obviously no one in the editing department cares that handguns do not have unlimited ammunition. During the first scene, the female lead fires about 50 rounds out of a handgun before unloading. I love it how characters simply drop clips on the ground everywhere, and their guns when they are out of ammo. It's like automatic machine pistols are ten bucks at Mall-Wart or something, and not several thousand dollars as they are in *our* world. This movie was just an excuse to play shoot-em-up.<br/><br/>People watching this movie might become confused who the ""bad guys"" really are. I actually wanted the protagonists to lose, because I simply had no sympathy for them. Vampires seemed bent to the point of lunacy in their quest for killing werewolves. Why? I like the werewolves. What did they ever do? The movie also introduces the hilarious concept of a new breed of vampire-werewolf mix. It reminds me of children's toys that blended concepts in order to boost sales; look, it's a gun-robot-dinosaur-spaceship! <br/><br/>The script must have been written by someone in marketing, because it just relies too much on concept and flash, without much content. Everything in the film is either a gun battle, or an excuse to show off vampire fashion, (long leather overcoats.) This movie has nothing on the Blade series, which developed a much better ""culture"" for the vampires. The vampire culture in Underworld seemed like Zoolander, where models strut around with an, ""I know I look hot,"" attitude.<br/><br/>This movie seems like a copy of Alien vs. Predator or some kind of mixed genre flick from the 50's. Swamp Men versus Mummies or Zombies versus Spider People might have done just fine instead.<br/><br/>By the way, why is it that vampires seem to have tons of money and live in lavish castles all the time? Where do they get their cash? The poor werewolves seem to be incapable of balancing a check book. They have to live in a sewer tunnel.<br/><br/>If you're thinking about renting this one, don't bother.

Selene; without prior tactics, armed with only pistols killing 6 werewolves who are armed with assault rifles and ambushing her behind a door. People who are not main characters are shooting with precision of a deaf bat. There are lots of scenes like this, get used to it. Of course, Selene dropping to lower floor by shooting the ground and pack of lycans are not chasing after her; let's not forget that scene.<br/><br/>*Illogical details: Why is Viktor and Marcus who are the strongest vampires, lay in the catacombs defended only by one ordinary vampire who can be easily distracted by saying: ""Hey, uh, Kraven is looking for you.""? If vampires are meticulous about purity of their species and bloodlines why there is a black vampire managing the weapon department? Why, for the love of god, nobody awakened an elder vampire before and why Selene did it because of some paranoid thought which would most likely end up ""Oops, I awakened you before your time, sorry about that."" and cost her life.<br/><br/>Little details like these makes the movie's second half and some parts of first half insufferable, absolutely trash details.

"suburbannightmare","4","3","7","4 November 2006"," pretty.....but not beautiful.
","I wanted to like this film the minute I heard it was in production. A story set in the present, smack-dab in the middle of a war between vampires and werewolves. OK, what's not to like about that idea? Well, nothing really. Underworld delivers a huge slice of supernatural warfare with amazing style ¬ñ from guns that use ultraviolet bullets, to of course, Kate Beckinsale dealing death with two huge guns whilst slinking about in a black leather cat suit. So admittedly, the movie looks amazing. But that's really about it¬Ö<br/><br/>During the latest skirmish, Seline (Kate Beckinsale), one of the vampire coven's elite Deathdealers discovers that the Lycans are trying to capture a human (Scott Speedman). Seline sets out to find him before the Lycans do, and discover their purpose.<br/><br/>To be fair, this movie has many good points. It looks amazing, the sets are ipeccably atmospheric and the action scenes are short enough to keep your attention. There are also some good performances here. Kate Beckinsale, if you can get past her constant frowning is very watchable as Seline, although she does adopt a rather annoying monolithic pout as soon as she gets a gun in her hand. (She's almost like 'The Matrix's' Trinity. Except with longer hair, bigger guns and¬Öwell, fangs.) Bill Nighy does quite a menacing turn as the vampire coven's Elder, Viktor. He's almost fatherlike in some ways, and his scenes with his vampire daughter Seline are reminiscent of a Father rebuking a wayward child. But other times he's sinister as hell. Shane Brolly's Kraven, although slick and sophisticated, begins to grate on the nerves. (By the end, his whining and foot stamping make one want to administer a few swift kicks to his face) Disappointingly, Lucien and Michael seem to fade into the background a bit, despite being central to the movie's plot.<br/><br/>The whole movie though, is as slick as it gets; kind of an ultra-modern film noir. The exterior shots are made up of imposing buildings, moody back streets and perpetual downpour (Not a good advertisement for Hungary where the movie was filmed, eh?) and the whole movie is stylishly faded and muted. For a vampire vs. werewolf film though, the gore factor was (sadly) rather understated, and although the battle scenes are quite good, the whole pace seems to stagger about a bit, almost as if there's too much story to try and cram into the time available. The story is a good idea, but by the end I'd lost interest; mainly because the movie looks good, but there isn't that much else to it. Which is a shame as the plot could make for an amazing movie. But alas, it seems to rely too heavily on it's looks and it's main star¬Öafter all, gorgeous as Kate Beckinsale is, there's only so long one can wear a leather catsuit without looking silly."

"Uriah43","7","2","4","27 September 2012"," An Enjoyable Action Film
","For many centuries the vampires and werewolves (lycans) have been at war. The powerful werewolf leader, Lucian (played by Michael Sheen), is believed to be dead and the vampires conclude that the war has been successfully won. Selene (Kate Beckinsale), a member of the vampire warrior caste known as ""Death Dealers"", suspects otherwise and just happens to observe lycans mysteriously following a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). A gun battle between the lycans and the Death Dealers takes place with casualties sustained by both sides. It is at this time that the vampires discover that the lycans are using special radioactive bullets which can kill them. To even the odds the vampires make bullets containing silver nitrate which can also kill the lycans. Meanwhile, the vampire named Kraven (played by Shane Brolly), has a secret and is planning to betray his coven right before they can institute an important change of leadership ceremony. Anyway, having established the basic foundation of the film I would like to say that it had more depth than I thought it would. The director (Len Wiseman) did a splendid job setting the dark and dreary mood that was just right for this particular movie. Kate Beckinsale looked awesome and played her part very well. I also thought Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill Nighy (playing the vampire ""Viktor"") also turned in good performances. On the flip side though, I didn't especially care for the effort by Scott Speedman who seemed out of his league in comparison to others around him. The special effects were plentiful and if you like CGI then you will probably appreciate this film.

","I loved it the action vampires and werewolf , all needed for a Gothic action movie! I found it to be entertaining all the way through,<br/><br/>I watched it in the movie theater . And it was definitely worth seeing on a big screen ! The reason I loved it was the battle between the two, and their need to survive to weed out the weaker breed. It shows that if you can't see eye to eye and learn to coexist . There can be consequences , of catastrophic results. And that you can either fight your demons head on , or let them destroy you. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy good vampire and werewolf warfare. And grab the concept of the comic books . Although due to the blood and graphic scenes this movie would not be someone with a weak stomach. I give it an A!"

","Wow, for quite a while, I was actually expecting to like this movie! I don't recall even knowing about it upon its release in 2003, but was aware of its 2006 sequel, ""Underworld: Evolution"", while it was playing in theatres. I didn't bother going to see it, since I hadn't seen the original, but planned to eventually watch them both when I got around to it. Well, it took a while, but I've finally seen this first film of the two, and while I was expecting to like it enough to watch the sequel, it certainly didn't work out that way. I was very disappointed, and as a result, I saw no point in watching the sequel! <br/><br/>A war between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) has been going on for centuries, and one of the vampire warriors stuck in this war is Selene. She is a death dealer, who tracks down Lycans to assassinate. After a battle against a group of Lycans in a subway station, it appears that her Lycan rivals were after a human named Michael Corvin, and following humans is not something they usually do! Unfortunately, Selene cannot get her concern across to vampire ruler Kraven, so she investigates the matter on her own, trying to find out what these werewolves want with Michael. The reason why this particular human is wanted by them is a big part of their plot to gain power over the vampires, something they haven't had for hundreds of years. Also, Lucian, the Lycan leader who was long thought to be dead, has returned! <br/><br/>I would say the film opens with a decent narration from Kate Beckinsale as Selene, but it goes from there to a tedious battle sequence (the subway station one, in this case). Unfortunately, that certainly isn't the only tedious battle sequence in the entire film. Some of the acting is pretty weak as well, such as Shane Brolly as Kraven, and the haunted music/sounds hardly ever seem to stop. Like I mentioned above, there really isn't much in the movie other than misery, gloom, and mayhem. I certainly wasn't expecting a really upbeat film, and have been impressed by dark action flicks before, but it all gets so repetitive here, it just keeps going and going, which gets pretty tiresome, maybe even depressing! Nothing really progresses! I didn't really care for any of the characters, either, and ended up not caring about what happened to them or how the story went. Worse still, in addition to all these problems, all the gloom and mayhem is seemingly endless! It seems like it will go on for all eternity, and as I watched, I really wondered when it was going to end, and didn't see any possible way it COULD end! <br/><br/>I think I was way too confident that I would like ""Underworld"", even though I wasn't expecting an absolute classic. With that confidence, I rented this action/horror flick and its sequel together, but sadly, that copy of ""Underworld: Evolution"" had to go back to the video store unwatched. At approximately two hours, does this film seem longer than it really is? Well, if you ask me, absolutely! To me, it seemed more like three or four hours! If the film was around, I don't know, half an hour/45 minutes shorter than it is, I would probably rate it 5/10, but since the flaws in the film continue for so long, never stopping until it's over, I think even an average rating would be a tad too generous! Even with all its big-budget special effects, there's something unprofessional and immature about this film, filled with modern clich√©s. So, sadly, the interesting idea of vampires vs. werewolves had so much potential that wasn't reached!"

","I loved this film, it has a great plot focusing on the battle between vampires and Lycans (warewolves) for power.

The special effects, stunts and fight scenes for this film were of a good standard. The only bad thing i have to say about underworld is that the lead male character could have been better however Katee Beckinsale and Bill Nighy more than makes up for his shortcomings.

","Underworld had just the right mix of fantasy, mystique, romance, and action. I like Kate Beckinsale better in this role than any she's done to date. Her heroine is both strong and vulnerable at the same time. Scott Speedman was a new face for me but I think that he was a perfect fit for this part. He has an animal-like look and quality to him that really sales him in this role. I felt that he and Kate have a real on screen connection and chemistry that can't be denied. They were totally believable as a couple falling in-love against the odds. Having the this classic conflict existing between vampires and werewolves gave this movie just the right twist as well. Honestly, I think that with the realities of the world today, Underworld was just what the doctor ordered in terms of escapism. What a nice break from the ""real world"".

","The first immortals were Caine and Lilith, Caine was the frist Vampire, Lilith was the first Werewolf as per legend. Before they Separated Lilith and Caine had an unspecified number of Children together that carried the strains of Vampire and Werewolf. One of them was Alexander Corvinus, born during the Roman occupation of Hungary. He was made king of the Hungarians in the late 400's, and chose his seat as the city of Pest. Sometime later the city of Pest was attacked by an unknown vampire. His unique ancestry had the unforseen consequence of making Corvinus an Immortal. After the withdrawl of the Romans several vampires remained, as Lycans moved in from the countryside. Within a century open war started between the Lycans and Vampires, with the Lycans subjugated by 1200. In 1300 the Lycan Lucien was made, and entered into the service of the Vampire Viktor. In 1403 Lucien managed to impregnate the Vampire Daughter of Viktor. In accordance with the laws of the Coven, Viktor's Daughter was killed. Lucien then rebelled against Viktor and started a 600 year war. In the year 1463 the immortal Alexander Corvinus, now known as Matthias Corvinus returned to Hungary after living for centuries in Bohemia and Romania and was crowned King of Hungary. Over his lifetime Alexander Corvinus only prduced three Sons, one became a Lycan, another became Vampire, and a third, illegitimate son, Johann remained mortal. Alexander Corvinus entered slumber in 1490 and has not awakened to anyone's knowledge since then"
"Chris_Docker","8","2","4","20 September 2003"," Beautiful execution more than compensates for derivativeness
","'Underworld' is follows a trend of female action-hero movies, borrowing heavily from the Matrix, Blade and X-Men. What I particularly liked about this one, apart from Kate Beckinsale's fine performance (which shows that female action heroes can still be feminine), is the detailed attention given to the trappings of plot, scenery and costume. Beckinsale does most of the stunts herself, whether in tight black PVC and leather (with or without the de rigueur long black coat) or in high fashion Gothic ballgown outfits. In this world of an age-old battle between vampires and werewolves, Underworld makes up by means of great settings, scenes, respect for legend and openness to metaphor, whatever it lacks in originality, and the two species that are portrayed can easily represent any number of political or religious conflicts, though they are perhaps best explained by a clue in the website's historical 'timeline' which documents cases from Gilles de Reis right up to modern ones of schizophrenia."

","If you like your cinematography dark and Gothic like an Alex Proyas(sp?) film ala The Crow/Dark City, Underworld will most likely enthrall and hypnotize you with its gorgeous direction of photography, crafted set pieces and location shots. However, lore and mythology purists/for hards will be sorely disappointed as Underworld's creative screenplay leaves a hell of a lot to be desired when it comes to the established historicity revolving around vampyrism and lycanthropic legends: Neither species behaves or functions within their common frameworks in the Underworld cinematic universe, but instead follow their own physical laws/principles that are largely alien to established norms. Daylight doesn't exist here, regenerative powers are nonexistent or skewed or swapped entirely, lycans were actually slaves and day wardens of slumbering vampires (in spite of a total seeming lack of sunlight in the world), and everyone moves like spider-man caught in wire fu rendering of crouching tiger hidden dragon.<br/><br/>Fans of slow motion Gun play and black leather gothism will have no problems enjoying Underworld. It's an easy to follow story with enough originality to separate it from other genre Mainstays and the actors do a great job bringing their respective species to life on screen. But this is no Blade trilogy, or the likes of The Howling or Silver Bullet or American Werewolf--mythos purists will probably cry outright at the complete disconnect from the troves of established vampyric/lycanthropic lore in the literary and cinematic spheres (although the future Underworld sequels remedy some of these more glaring faults), and watching alongside one of your nerdy purists friends will most likely result in a ruined viewing experience when they bake nonstop at all the inconsistencies they'll recognize after failing to suspend their disbelief when you warm then at the film's start that this ain't their typical vampyr/lycan flick.<br/><br/>I think underworld deserves to be seen alongside the Blade trilogy so if you're fans of everyone's favorite marvel daywalking katana weilding demigod, you'll definitely acclimate to Serene and her Gothic romps though the lands of perpetual nightfall.<br/><br/>Excellent midnight blood romp for any Gothic action fan of Blade/The Crow/Dark City. Just don't expect the film to do your deep understanding of mythos and lore any kind of respectably satisfactory justice."

But the most impressive thing they do in this movie is that the human world does not know of vampires and lycans at all. Kate Beckinsale portrays Selene as a vampire and also how Selene is a death dealer. I always liked how Kate Beckinsale portrays Selene in this movie. Scott Speedman plays surprising well as Michael Corvin and Selene's love interest. He also plays the hybrid part at the end of the movie really good.

Underworld is not a bad directoral debut for make-up effects whiz Len Wiseman, yet the result is still missing something. The only factor that is not A+ material is the storytelling.<br/><br/>The war between Vamps and Werewolves is one that has lasted a thousand years, Set in what looks like Central Eastern Europe, this Gothic story is about Celine, a young vampire and a skilled wolf killer. She is respected by her clan, until she breaks the laws when she partners up with Dr. Michael Corvin He has been bitten by a wolf and Celine has become aware that he might be at the centre of a conspiracy between the vamps and the wolves. <br/><br/>The one flaw of Underworld is that it has a clumsy way of setting up conflict. Even the first scene which involves a long shoot out in the subway station is not terribly riveting because we have no idea of what is going on until long after it ends. It serves as merely eye candy, but action of epic scale should should never proceed exposition.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale seems to be what the studio has used to sell the film, but in fact it is the art department, make-up effects crew, and the camera crew who make the picture come to life. Underworld is a slick flick. I guess that is all it intends to be, and if that is all you want, than you have come to the right place."

The result is a slick piece of mainstream horror that, despite lacking any really effective scares or a genuine sense of excitement, still offers enough fun to make it worth a watch.<br/><br/>Beckinsale plays Selene, a beautiful vampire warrior embroiled in a centuries-long conflict against a race of werewolves known as 'lycans'. Driven by a desire for revenge against the creatures that she believes slaughtered her family, Selene has dedicated her life to destroying the lycan, but after rescuing a human from an attack by her hairy foes, the sexy bloodsucker discovers that all is not as it appears to be between the two races...<br/><br/>Director Len Wiseman's cast are all ridiculously attractive and impossibly cool, sporting the the latest in Gothic chic; the blue-tinted, rain-drenched cinematography is far more impressive than the rather forgettable plot; and nobody does anything without looking great whilst doing it. However, although Underworld is undoubtedly a case of style over content, it still manages to be pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>The script, by Wiseman and Kevin Grevioux, writes its own rules and includes such inventive gimmicks as ultraviolet and silver-nitrate bullets (for use against vampire and lycan respectively); there are some very impressive CGI werewolf transformations; the wonderful Bill Nighy gives a terrific performance as head vampire Viktor; and lots of noisy shootouts and fights (during which Selene never seems to be in any real danger) mean that things rarely get dull.<br/><br/>Films like Underworld won't change the face of horror cinema, but at least they're enjoyable for the duration.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."

Underworld stars Kate Beckinsale as Selene, a beautiful and ruthless vampire assassin(Know as death dealer's)) she has hated the Lycans for as long as she has lived, know Selene and the other death dealers have hunted the lycans to the brink of extinction. Or so they believe. Underworld is a sleek and stylish horror thriller that is sure to captivate and amaze, it doesn't matter how many times you seen it. Kate Beckinsale does an amazing job in the movie you can't stop watching. Underworld blends a sort of Gothic, graphic novel feel to it. It's like the film ""Sin City"", except a little less sinful. This film uses a style that didn't become overly popular until such movies as ""Sin City"" or ""The Dark Knight"" but stands on it's own two feet with the dark and mysterious theme to it. Very few horror films can ever follow this style; or even live up to the style of this film, because it's so unique and different that you can't do anything but love it even those who say they hated it secretly own a copy of this film and don;t want anyone to know. That's what it is, it's a film that you don't tell anyone you've seen and if you have you say you hate it when you secretly love it. This is a guilty pleasure film, and a excellent one at that.

","Kate Beckinsale in Underworld is a clear inspiration taken from recent vampire/goth/sci fi movies, particularly the Blade and Matrix series, and the audience will surely be making comparisons, even subconsciously. She embodies the sleek, ass-kicking skills of Trinity from The Matrix but her vampire element reminds me more of the surprisingly effective performance that Parker Posey gave in Blade 3. <br/><br/>You see, Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire who has devoted her existence to destroying ""lycans,"" the werewolves who have sleeked up their image for the 21st century by removing the 'thrope' from the end of their title. It seems that the vampires and the lycans have been involved in a raging war with each other for well over 1,000 years, which prompted me to wonder what the average kill rate is for a vampire or lycan soldier. Either they breed really really fast or they're just not very good warriors.<br/><br/>At any rate, Selene stumbles across a conspiracy involving the leader of the lycans, Lucian, and the leader of the vampires, Kraven, to combine the blood of the two species and create a new breed of nightwalker that would be more powerful than both. Vampires and werewolves are incompatible even at the cellular level (even their blood fights when combined), but Selene still fears that Kraven's and Lucian's plot would endanger the vampires, so she awakens their dark lord from a mummified hibernation a full century ahead of schedule.<br/><br/>The intricacies of the plot, however, are noticeably more complex than the material can sustain. There are three rulers of the vampires, and at any given time there is one awake and ruling and two in hibernation. Selene's waking of Viktor 100 years early is a sacred violation that hasn't been broken in 1,400 years. She needs to find get conclusive proof of this dark conspiracy or even Viktor would be powerless to save her from a most vicious punishment.<br/><br/>I missed the part, by the way, where they explained why Viktor couldn't be put back to sleep after having woken up, but no matter. He's awake now and his gradual transformation from a mummy into a cadaverous vampire leader is one of the more interesting make-up effects in the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects, by the way, are the thing that will make or break the movie. It's dark and dreary from beginning to end, which is not unexpected in a film about a war between werewolves and vampires, but the darkness gets a little repetitive long before the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Upon wakening, Viktor finds himself in the middle of a situation in which this vampire woman has broken a 1,000 year old tradition to report to him a virtually impossible conspiracy, even while she is falling in love with a lycan-infected human named Michael, which is strictly forbidden (it's forbidden because he's a lycan, by the way, not because his name is Michael).<br/><br/>Scott Speedman is given remarkably little to do in the entire film, although the transformation of his character provides for what is by far the film's best battle scene. The soundtrack is loud and violent, like much of the rest of the movie, and while it manages to avoid adding much to the vampire or werewolf genres despite having combined them together so well, there are some interesting ways that the movie brings the story into the 21st century. Not only do these ancient creatures now have cell-phones, but high-powered handguns that fire liquid-silver and phosphorescent bullets. They have, it seems, ""harnessed sunlight as a weapon.""<br/><br/>With these kinds of things going on, you might expect a better movie, but it's fast and brutal and stylish and ends with the promise of a sequel in which everything that we have come to learn from this movie will be completely changed. And for something that could so easily have been written off as a Blade or Matrix rip-off at the time of its release, that's a pretty successful outcome."

I loved it because I was hooked on the story and on the suspense build in Underworld. But also on the sublime acting of Victor (Bill Nighy) and Lucian (Michael Sheen). I really loved them and the way Lucian was played was really welldone. Michael moved further to the stupid and ridiculous teenage vampire saga , Twilight, but again I really loved his performance there as Aro.<br/><br/>Selene (Kate Bekinsale) looked gorgeous and indeed reminded you the most towards Neo in The Matrix. She played well too but I wasn't really into her. She was a bit the underdog. <br/><br/>Still, not that all into CGI I never had any problem with the lycans coming alive. Full CGI but still they add the real red stuff in it when they attack the vampires. <br/><br/>The script itself is just as simple as it can get. Vampires are living among humans, some are Death Dealers like Selene. They only have one reason why they are Death Dealers, to destroy the lycans. It's going on for ages until Lucian has interest in a human. It's for Selena to search it out why and she come across a revelation of lies. Once that happens the movie really becomes enjoyable. <br/><br/>Len Wiseman did an excellent job as director. He did Underworld Evoltion (2006) to move further to Live Free or Die Hard (2007) and the remake of Total Recall (2012).<br/><br/>If you are into vampires and werewolves and can dig a twist to the world they are living in than pick this up, excellent.<br/><br/>Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

","The darkness in this movie was what initially attracted me. I am a fan of things dark and macabre, and the cover art of the film almost made me salivate with joy. I went into this movie thinking, ""Dark, creepy, Gothic setting along the lines of Gothic horror..."", and I wasn't disappointed. From the opening scene, I was enraptured by the visuals. The costume design is stunning, as are the special effects. My favorite thing about the movie is the depth of the vampire and Lycan history. I also love the scenes involving Bill Nighy, who is an excellent actor. I would recommend this movie to vampire aficionados as a must buy, because it is simply excellent. My only one complaint, however, was the lack of martial arts action, which the movie threw out and instead focused on guns. I know the only way to kill the Lycans was with silver nitrate and the vamps with UV bullets, but I was anxiously waiting for an actual fight scene, and I was rewarded at the very end. Hopefully the sequel will fulfill these wishes to a better degree."

","Underworld's biggest strength is its rich atmosphere and feel of Eastern European-ish Gothic fantasy. If you really like a movie that sucks you in and has some kickass action (but not too much) with an entertaining story involving vampires and werewolves check it out.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale is a great heroine, and not only because she's in a completely form-fitting suit the whole time. ^^ Michael Sheen and Scott Speedman are also fantastic, and play their characters very well. The rest of the cast is so-so, but since the three aforementioned characters give us most of the story it doesn't matter too much that Craven seems like he took a term of high school drama and then signed up for the movie.<br/><br/>So if you appreciate dark brooding fantasy rent this movie or see if a friend has it, since it's certainly worth a few viewings."

","Overall, if you look at it as just a fun action movie I think you'll enjoy it. The over-the-top action reminds me of a video game, which is really fun to watch.

But the werewolves were stupid looking. That is the single style choice I think I disagree with. I've heard people call it the new Romeo and Juliet, but that is untrue. It follows that structure for a while, but by the end it dismisses anything that would even suggest that.

","Underworld is a highly stylized vampire and werewolf action movie. It sometimes appears on the horror shelf, but it really belongs in the action category. The vampires and werewolves do most of their killing with guns and not their razor sharp teeth. Thought there is a bit of gore, and transformation scenes, it is not scary. Of all of the deaths in the film, only one human is transformed into a creature, the rest are due to the war between the vampires and lycans (werewolves) as they are called in the film.<br/><br/>The movie features excellent action sequences, and a very interesting plot. The writers also did an excellent job of creating characters with depth, history, and an agenda. This film even has a sci-fi subtext which describes the nature of the vampires and werewolves.<br/><br/>One finds oneself drawn into the film quickly while following the lead character's quest to find answers.

","I understand why White Wolf sued. When I first saw Underworld, it blew me away. It was exactly how WoD should have been role-played, in my opinion: The protagonists questioning their motives, and not being able to put aside their still-human feelings about their actions. The styles were perfect, as well: The Vampires living in the artificially preserved past, concerned with style; the Lycans were animalistic thrill-seekers and berserkers. One has to wonder what Mage: The Ascension might look like.<br/><br/>The additions I thought very nice were the internal politics and rivalries, and the power transfer between elders made very good sense; the conspiracy between Lucius and Kraven was brilliant.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","0","0","6 April 2008"," Cool concept and stylish directing salvage a weak screenplay
","Anyone with a love or soft spot for creature-driven sci-fi/fantasy can appreciate what the writing trio led by Len Wiseman attempted to do when they conceived ""Underworld."" Creating a world where vampires and werewolves (Lycans) live amongst humans and are engaged in a secret thousand-year-old war is at the least interesting and respectable for fans of the like and so conceptually, ""Underworld"" at least has something to work with. Putting their vision on the big screen? Not as easy. The film is riddled with bad dialogue, bad acting and scenes that seem to lack any kind of contextual clues--not to mention bullets, lots of bullets.<br/><br/>""Underworld"" stars Kate Beckinsale as a ""death dealer,"" named Selene--you know, that troubled, martial arts-savvy vampire charged with the responsibility to perpetuate the violence between vampires and lycans by killing lycans and never questions it until, of course, the film is about twenty minutes in. The rich history the writers have concocted makes it a bit more interesting, but it would be nicer to see it than have characters waste time telling us about it through dialogue with other characters. Selene begins to question these things when she catches on to a vampire/lycan conspiracy hundreds of years in the making and tries to uncover the mystery and how a human being hunted by lycans named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) is tied to it all.<br/><br/>The film foremost but least obviously dodges the obstacle of explaining how vampires and lycans can wage their war without humans knowing. It gives no time (assumed the future, but who knows) or place explanation. In fact, daylight never happens in the film, it's all about the vampires and lycans. There is also nothing done to really get the viewer to grasp the conflict. You start to pick sides in your head as to who is right or wrong, but you never once feel the conflict through any of the characters and Selene seems to be a very odd and unmotivated heroine. All you get is one scene highly reminiscent of ""Silence of the Lambs"" of her telling her story to Michael and at that point it's too late for it to make a serious impact on the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly bland, but that could be more due to a horrible script. The script wouldn't have been half as bad if it spent less time explaining. Bill Nighy is the exception to the poor acting as vampire lord Viktor who Selene awakens in a desperate attempt to figure out what's going on. Nighy brings some actual character to his role and some serious evil. His performance was no doubt that which landed him his role as Davy Jones in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films.<br/><br/>The directing and art direction does offer this film a visual saving grace. Wiseman does some really cool transitions and some strange, but cool-looking action sequences. The film does seem to not-so-obviously cover its budget constraints in this manner, however, in that the best visual effects are in short snippets. Also, either they were steering away from anything that was going to garner an R-rating or they simply didn't have the money to show most of the violence, something that would have made the film feel a bit more real. Lycans go to maul people and Wiseman cuts away, leaving you doubting if the person actually got mauled.<br/><br/>Basically, if I weren't a sucker for films with a mythology placed in a futuristic sci-fi setting with similar art direction, this film would have been horrendous. Viewers with a genuine interest in story like that and sci-fi action sequences are sure to at least get a bit of entertainment out of ""Underworld,"" but that's about all this film has to offer."

","Apart from the comic trip look and feel of this film, apart from the special effects both on the side of the vampires and on the side of the werewolves, apart from the impossible love affair between a vampire girl and a werewolf boy, at the beginning qt least, soon to become something else, this film is decadent in all possible ways and somewhere kind of paranoid. And yet there is something that floats over the whole thing, that survives the animal horror that animates these pictures and bleak places. Two species have been fighting for centuries and the salvation of both is in a new blood line that will cross the two different ones. Peace can only come from crossing the bloodlines of the two rivals, the two enemies, the two antagons. And that works, in the film of course, because in reality if it were that simple¬Ö! It has been noticed that when a civil war starts we never know when it will stop. It took some thirty years for the latest episode of the Irish civil war to come to maybe an end and that was only the last episode of a war that was started by the invasion and conquest of Ireland by the English three or four centuries ago. And I will not speak of the Bosnian or Kosovar conflicts, nor of the opposition between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq and in the world. But that's the optimistic final scene of a film that targets teenagers when war comes to an end because the two bloodlines have been mixed in the veins of a new leader. Yet I found the film a little bit long and repetitive as for the fighting scenes.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","I love horror movies and grew up on the old classics. And when there are more than one kind of monster in them, all the better! needless to say, this film was right up my alley. And Kate Beckinsale? Oh my God. Mean, tough, slinging guns around AND wearing skin tight black clothes? Doesn't get any better, I say. The special effects were very well done, the characters all superb actors and actresses. The story great, the atmosphere excellent! So, why didn't I give it a 10? Soiler Because of the ""super-godlike-ultra-megga-hybrid"" they build up and build up through the movie. Then, when he's supposed to come up and slaughter the enemy/win the day, he fights like a sissy, and pretty much gets his butt kicked. He ends up only winning pretty much by accident. That's pretty lame. I know the film makers want to build excitement, but when you keep making this thing out to be the next biggest thing to God himself, MAKE HIM THAT WAY. Much like in Blade (the sissy blood God), and Lord of the Rings (the troll guy who you think is going to lay everything to waste and his first fight with the beardy guy is over in two seconds. Okay a human kills the most evil, tough thing to roam hell?) Sigh...maybe its just me, but that's a plot hole that could have easily been filled by the hero-godlike-monster at least fighting his way through a few foes, totally kicking-butt so at least he's a little tired for an excuse for fighting like a sissy.<br/><br/>But that's just me.<br/><br/>It still was a killer movie and more than worth the watch."

","The acting performances were very acceptable for the most part, but the thing that made this film zing was direction by Len Weisman. The fast paced acting with the ever twisting plot line always leaves you wondering if someone told a joke and you were left out on the punch line. Beckinsale has a standout performance. I found Speedman a bit weak, but only in as much as his character was not brought into the center of things really until late in the film. Sheen was excellent as Lucian and Bill Nighy brought the right mix of slyness, compassion and betrayal as Viktor. If there was one performance than irritated me throughout it was Kraven. The use of The Hungarian setting was just perfect for the feel of Gothic meets modern called for in this story. I am waiting to enjoy the sequel, when I can get my hands on it.

"anicerman","7","0","0","5 January 2007"," Another worthseeing thriller
","As the debut of Len Wiseman as a director and writer I would say he's got a lot of potential. The plot is overall imaginative and thrilling.<br/><br/>During a mission, Selene, a human-turned-into vampire death dealer, finds that the Lycans (werewolves) are not threatened with extinction and Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, is not dead as the vampires believe and they are after a human, Michael Corvin. As she gets closer to the truth she discovers the secrets of their chasing Michael and Kraven betrays his species to Lucian. She then wakes Viktor, the elder she respects the most, up for help.<br/><br/>The plot surely keeps itself going and makes you want to see how it goes. Each character is very distinctive and remarkable and contributes to the development of the story. However, a very important point doesn't make sense to me at all. According to the rule of ""the older the stronger"" for the vampires, how can Amelia be killed that easily? She's the third oldest.<br/><br/>A non-mainstream element I noticed is the thing that the Lycans fear - silver as it's supposed to be fatal to vampire in most of the vampire stories. Anyway it's just a kind of imaginative thing so I'm not going to criticise that.<br/><br/>The action part of the film is just fair as people are just ""fighting"" or firing shots (that's why I call it a thriller instead of an action thriller). Yet it's still interesting to see the war between vampires and werewolves goes modern that way.<br/><br/>You won't see good acting in this film as the performance of most of the actors/actresses is just fair. Kate is too clever to act well but the character is quite suitable for her. Shane as Kraven and Bill as Viktor tend to overact especially Shane as you'll see him talking so strongly in most of the scenes.<br/><br/>Despite the performance of the cast, the film is overall worth-watching and better than other many-million-dollars films."

","I'm a sucker for stylish action thrillers and Gothic horror flicks, and I love vampire and werewolf movies when done right, so I'm pretty much inclined to love this film based on concept alone. Luckily the execution nearly lives up to the hype. There are some plausibility issues (despite the fantastical setting), and the story, while intriguing, isn't explored well enough, but the film is so interesting and entertaining that it doesn't really matter. A perfect example of style over substance, though the substance isn't completely missing.<br/><br/>The story in itself is quite interesting, even if the plot is a bit disappointing. The original pitch, 'Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves', isn't that accurate, and it would have been a bit better had it been. Instead of a vampire falling in love with a werewolf, she falls in love with a human who becomes a werewolf (and then, later, a hybrid, which kinda ruins it). A slight difference, but a noticeable one. The overall setting - an ongoing war between the two species - is very cool and quite original, and is made even more effective by the fact that the film begins right in the thick of it, without much exposition. The history is explored later (not nearly deeply enough, though - that's left for the sequel), which makes it much more interesting. A deeply ingrained mythology accompanies all the stylish action, making it more than just a B-grade action flick.<br/><br/>One of the main highlights is the entire style and tone of the film - it's always night, and it's always raining. Very dark and creepy, just adding to the horror element. In between all the gunfights, there are scenes set in a vampire manor or a werewolf den, which helps ground the film with some sort of realism. The special effects are fantastic, despite being on a pretty small budget, as the werewolf transformations - and, indeed, the beasts themselves - are nearly flawless. And the acting is as good as you can expect from an action/horror/thriller, with Beckinsale, Michael Sheen as Lucian, and Bill Nighy as Viktor all standing out. Overall, a very cool movie with an intriguing storyline and fantastic style."

Any who, I'm sure everyone has seen this by now, if not..well...thats just crazy..anyways, what would you do if your every day routine of working all day as a medical surgeon go if a beautiful vampiress takes you hostage and tells you your in the middle of a blood-feud between vampires and lycans and that the lycans are after you but she doesn't know why..??..Not normal right? Well..thats how the story goes. Very interesting by my standards. You have a leather clad female Vampire aka Death Dealer played by Kate Beckinsale who fights and battles the lycans and is very good at what she does, take you to safety and then drop a bombshell on you. Selene,the beautiful vampiress, takes Michael(the rugged handsome human) and explains to him the whole vampires and lycans versus each other war and she tells him her past and reveals to him things about the current war. and as you go through the movie many many things are revealed. You find that Viktor is really responsible for the slaying of Selenes family, Michael is the carrier of the blood fusion they need, Michael becomes the hybrid, viktor tries to kill him but Selene interferes. the movie ends with Selene and Michael leaving the battle grounds and Selene must put her love life with Michael on hold until they can outrun their hunters.

","I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3/4 of this film. The acting, writing and direction were all up to the level of quality expected for the genre.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale as Selene was a solid performer, with the wonderful cast surrounding her doing a solid job portraying the mostly one dimensional characters in the huge cast. Len Wiseman's direction was surprisingly good and (in general) the writing leaves nothing to be desired.<br/><br/>The story did seem to flounder a little towards the end. I suspect if they could have fleshed out the Viktor character a bit more it would have helped, but regardless I really must rate this movie a solid 7."

","I thought that this movie was excellent. Now, I only saw it a few weeks ago when I rented it, and I liked it so much that I went out and bought it. <br/><br/>To start, I thought that the actors were perfect for the movie. They (Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman) worked extremely well together. Considering that this was mainly an action movie, I must say that all of the action sequences were very well done. The fights were well choreographed and quite realistic. Also, the creature effects were great, and definitely not overdone like they were in Van Helsing. The special effects were top notch, and the movie crew got everything right. <br/><br/>Normally, with a movie that has vampire's and werewolves, it is lame (and the whole story had been done before). With Underworld, the director put a new twist on all of the aspects of vampires vs. werewolves. <br/><br/>Now that the sequel had already been in theaters, I can only wait for it to come out on DVD, and I am certain that i will buy it.<br/><br/>If you like this genre, watch Underworld, and you will not be disappointed."

","Although the contrast is a bit too dark, I have to say that this was a great production and commend the people who put such hard work into the making of it. The fight scenes were terrific. The theme was a bit hard to follow, but all in all, the theme was awesome. Kraven's actions lead me to hate him as a character and Lucian's overall personality draws me more towards him. That is the reason that I'd prefer the lycans over the vampires. I like the whole idea of ultra-violet ammunition and the silver nitrate bullets developed for the movie. I'm sure that it was hard work coming up with those types of weaponry just for use in the movie. This movie was great, as is the sequel, and I must say that the only reason I rate it a 9 is because of the dark contrast and the repetitive music."

","Billed by as a ""sleek, action thriller,"" this movie is ablaze in true Hollywood fashion with numerous rounds of bullets flying everywhere, but never hitting anything. For myself, this was a fantastic film with its ""Matrix""-style fight scenes kept to a bare minimum. With its special effects in general being toned down, the story of newly turned Lycanthrope, Michael (Scott Speedman), and Vampire Warrior, Selene the Death Dealer (Kate Beckinsale), shines through beautifully. With both the Vampires (aristocratic nobles) and the Lycans (street thugs) at war for centuries, it's said early on that the Lycans had stolen an ""ultraviolet bullet"" from a government group. While never actually stated in the movie, that government group would be the C.I.B. from the six episode British television series ""Ultraviolet"" (1998). On a somewhat related note, I have noticed here that Kate Beckinsale sports a hairstyle that gives her a striking resemblance to her late father, Richard Beckinsale of both ""Porridge"" (1973) and ""Rising Damp"" (1974) fame. I still remember our Assistant Manager coming to work after seeing this stating that she wanted to be like Selene when she grows up, and that was a good enough recommendation for me to see this one that I enjoyed thoroughly."
"Robert_duder","7","0","0","7 February 2006"," The only unique Vampire/Werewolf film ever made...and brilliant at that
","Underworld is indeed a gem. It takes a deadly overused concept and finally comes out with something actually unique with an outstanding cast and concept, great story (if not a little complex) and definite future for turning it into a mega-franchise. Where to begin...Director and co-writer Len Wiseman puts everything together exactly the way a person would want to see it. Action, drama, romance, intensity and vampire and werewolves all round it out but none of it is horror...it's solid action.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale leads the cast as Selene, the vampire Death dealer who hunts Lycans (Werewolves) in an attempt to exact vengeance for the murder of her mortal family centuries ago. Selene is one of the best action movie heroes ever...period. Beckinsale is dark and beautiful and deadly all at once and she has awesome screen presence. She does an A+ job. Lead actor opposite her is Scott Speedman. I don't think he has near the screen presence of Beckinsale or any of the other cast members but he's adequate and he's fortunate enough to have the rest of the cast be so good that he sort of fits in. The plus side is there is some chemistry between him and Beckinsale, it's not quite as passionate as you would hope for but there is some. Shane Brolly plays Kraven, the villain vampire who is working with the Lycans to bring about the integration of their species basically creating an up-stoppable race of half vampire, half lycan. He's quite brutal in his role and definitely a great bad guy. He doesn't stand a chance against Selene and is put in his place more than once but he's still a good bad guy. Bill Nighy stands out as Viktor, one of the eldest vampires who is in hibernation awaiting his time to rule until Selene resurrects him to gain his support against Kraven. He's an even better bad guy, and a great vampire. Believable in his role and he goes from being weakened and sickly to being a powerful force. His death is one of the coolest...and also laughable moments in cinema history...or action films any ways. Michael Sheen as the leader of the Lycans Lucian. Lucian is almost an anti-hero and he opens up the door for much more of a back story. His role is well done and he adds class to the cast. They are of course many other actors who support the cast and they all do a great job respectfully as either Vampires or Lycans. The Special effects in Underworld are slightly minimal compared to other films of this caliber which is not a bad thing whatsoever, it simply means that the cast must actually work harder to make their roles believable and they do flawlessly. I must admit, after seeing this film again for the second time, and now I have seen the sequel, the story line to this one is a bit complex and you really have to follow it closely to figure out who is who and where the story is going. I'm thinking there is some sort of plot hole going from the first to second film but I can't say for sure and I can't think of anything off hand. If nothing else it means the film is very intelligent for a mainstream action film. I think the series will really show it's strength in a trilogy perhaps. It reminded me a lot of the Matrix series except it didn't start to suck after the first one.<br/><br/>Underworld is a must see film for action lovers or anyone who loves a good vampire story because it is very unique. The Vampires aren't evil...some of the usual rules apply to them...but they aren't preying on humans, in fact they have a personal pact to feed on livestock and cloned blood. It's the uncontrollable Lycans who pose a threat and the war rages with guns and hand to hand battles and coming up with new weapons to keep the other immortal team dead. Amidst this is betrayal, romance, and a history that only begins to unfold. You can't help but feel there is so much more to this story. Len Wiseman has created something very interesting here and definitely worth checking out. It's a brilliant story with a brilliant cast and it gets more brilliant with time. 7.5/10"

","1st watched 2/5/2006, 6 out of 10(Dir-Len Wiseman): Action-packed battle from beginning to end in this initial showing of the feud between vampires & lycans(the werewolfs). Not as good as the following, but plenty to keep your interest. Despite the comic book fantasy storyline and loads of action, the director(Len Wiseman) does a good job of pulling you in by keeping your interest in the characters involved. Beckinsale & Speedman are very believable in their portrayals of the death-dealer Vampiress and the confused human in the middle of this battle. Another thing I liked about this movie is that by the end, you're not sure who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, although at the beginning the Lycans appear to be the bad folk. All in all, this is a unique twist on the horror/action genre that is well done technically and flows well with maybe a little too much gun fighting when you figure that these creatures should have more to battle with because of what they are. But definitely a tad better than the normal action movie and a nice idea that should be able to be built on in later movies, TV shows etc.."

","Whenever a film of this genre is made I always look for one thing...is the story compelling? This film's initial ballyhoo was ""which side will you choose?"" I was worried at first that this was trying to compete against The Matrix, etc. but gladly I was proved wrong. Part of the allure for many who enjoy Vampire/Werewolf films and books is not only the story, but how deep does the rabbit hole go? I appreciate Weisman's development of the back story as well as the current goings on in the film. It delivers just tastes of the proud but tragic histories of the cast and cleverly builds to the moment we all learn the truth and realize that whichever side we chose we will probably switch! Much like the Legacy of Kain video game series this Vampire tale is deep, rich and thought provoking. And although it does lack a solid cast, I walked away feeling like I got my money's worth and I can't wait to see Underworld Evolution. It will most likely be even better than this installment!

It is very hard to watch this film without watching Beckinsale kick Lycan butt & look good doing it! <br/><br/>For centuries, Vampyres & Lycans(Werewolves) have waged a bloody war for control of the night. Beckinsale stars as Selena, a vampire Deathdealer who uncovers a secret plot to rip apart the vampire nation & unleash a legendary monster to tip the balance of power between Vamps & Lycans. Selena soon discovers that current vamp leader Kraven has made a pact with the Lycan leader Lucian to overthrow sleeping vamp king Viktor & call a truce to the bloodshed. In the middle of all this is Michael Corvinas, med student & ancestor to the Corvinas bloodline which will give rise to a new creature both Vampyre & Lycan. Selena works to save him from certain death by both sides & puts herself in jeopardy. To expose Kraven & restore order to the Vamps, Selena awakens Viktor a century early to gain his confidence. Angry & bloodthirsty for Lycan, Viktor learns the truth & wages war on the Lycans. Michael turns into the creature, Selena learns that Viktor killed her family, & the final battle ensues.

","Underworld, is a standout film by director Len Wiseman. Although the story is somewhat uninspired, but this can be forgiven because every other element was top-notch. This includes the proper casting and performance of the main character Selene, by relative newcomer Kate Beckinsale, who dons a spectacular looking costume - she is now guaranteed to be forever immortalized as a toy figure (like the Star Wars characters before her)! Considering also that this film was made for $22 million, I'm really amazed how well they used the budget to make this film look like $50 million at least (sadly, the sequel Underworld: Evolution will have a budget of $50 million yet look just as good as this film). The filmmakers were really innovative with this film and made this into a gem. Definitely worth watching at 8 out of 10 (watch out for the uninspired sequel though)."

You don't have to be a nerd or a lover of Ms Beckinsale to watch this film, you don't have to be a fantastical admirer of the myth about vampires or werewolves to want to watch this film - you want tongue in cheek poke at everything that comes before it? You want a totally different take on the differences and grievances that have been told countless times from cartoon to cinematic experience about the distrust between vampires and wolves? Then watch this film - it has everything from the one-liners to the deliberate over the top action scenes that just states cult from start to finish. This film tackles the myth issue that a certain other film trilogy (ahem - blatant plug for Blade) dared to tackle - yeah it is that obvious that while production for Underworld 2 is in progress, you either know that the current director or somebody under them is already planning the third and final instalment!

The premise was similar to Underworld in that there was a battle going on between two factions of vampires and a group of werewolves. Babylon 5 fans will notice it was written by J. Michael Straczinski who also wrote the majority of RGB episodes and some of the best ones I might add.

In this particular vision of the world - a vision that brings to mind some RPG's games - a vampire agent (played by the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale) falls in love with a human (Speedman) just to find out that he is a member of the Lycans tribe. In this point, the movie works out with the old theme of a impossible love story but never misses its bull eye: a good action movie. ""Underworld' is not a classic of the genre. There's no term of comparison with some classics as 'Dracula'(1931), 'Werewolf,The' with Lon Chaney or even 'Interview with a Vampire' directed by Neil Jordan and starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.

","I only read through about the first 20 comments, but there must have been 5 references to vampires not casting reflections in mirrors. That's not a true piece of folklore. It comes from the later period in Eastern Europe, when the Church was branding Vampires as Satanic. Mirrors, at the time, were commonly thought to reflect the soul rather than a physical image. Vampires were Satanic demons, therefore they had no souls, and therefore no reflection. But in most modern vampiric lore, notable the Vampire: The Masquerade RPG so many have mentioned in relation to this film, vampires do indeed cast reflections in mirrors.

","Being a fan of White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade I was looking forward to watching this movie.

Still, it was an entertaining movie that I enjoyed both times I watched it.<br/><br/>The main characteristic of the film is STYLE. Everything was stylish, sometimes even at the expense of other aspects of the film, like the action or the story. The atmosphere was very good, a gothic, underground feeling was apparent through the whole film. The action was good and well choreographed. The music was ok, nothing special. And the story was interesting but I feel it was not used to it's full potential. A little more character development and more attention to the details would have made this a far better film.<br/><br/>******SPOILERS****** There were two major mistakes I noticed. 1)When Selene tells Kraven that the Lycans were after a human, he says that Lucian would never be interested in a human. But Lucian is supposed to be dead (only Kraven knows he is not). Oops! I guess he gave that away. 2)When the captured werewolf tells Selene and Viktor about Lucian's plans he mentions that they need the blood of a descendant of Corvinus that is untainted (meaning that he must not be a vampire or werewolf) for the merging of the two species to work. Yet Michael is bitten early on by Lucian thus becoming a werewolf (and becoming tainted). I guess they forgot about it. *******END OF SPOILERS******<br/><br/>To sum it up, this movie has some problems but it still manages to be entertaining. Let's hope they get it better on the sequel.

The special effects are convincing, the theatre is only so much overdone as to fit in with the goth setting and yes it is a flick you can watch a second time. Especially Kate and Scott are very sleek. This is much more a drama or a love story than it is a horror flick. If you have to compare it to something, compare it to X-Men. I am a big Buffy fan, so if you imagine going out to your regular dance hall, this flick is more like going to your first goth party compared to that: little conversation, lots of show, much darker, some obvious shock effects, no humor (in the acting), bits of gore and loads of sex appeal. But it has a some parallels as well: a very high soap level, a female lead character and a ""comfy"" setting, even the bits of flesh lying around after a grenade explosion are stylish. The most blatant rip off is the moment where Michael pins Victor to a wall (wolverine in x-men comics), but I don't care, Underworld is truly delicious in its obviousness. I do not tire from watching it. To be honest, I do not understand its low rating. I believe that you are meant to see through the obviousness of the movie and just get into it, something which would be impossible to do with, for example, Van Helsing. But Underworld takes itself seriously at the right levels and is damned sexy."

","I went into Underworld hoping to see a great, classic match up between werewolves and vampires, and instead got an annoying bore fest. Hardly passes as an action movie, as well... or at least that's what Blockbuster likes to classify it as. <br/><br/>The werewolves looked... well, they didn't even look like werewolves. I can recall the director saying on the DVD commentary that he ""aimed for the muzzles to look cat like,"" which was an obvious mistake, in my opinion. I mean, come on... they are werewolves, lycans... not werecats.<br/><br/>
As for the vampires... they were displayed as what seemed to be helpless throughout the first half of the film, which really tended to get on my nerves if anything.  And just for the record... vampires are NOT supposed to have reflections.  Big no-no.<br/><br/>In closing, Len Wiseman attempted to give the world a new, updated look upon vamps and wolves, and ultimately failed. I give Underworld a 5/10 for the mere fact that no CGI was used on the lycans, it was all done with costumes and wires.  That certainly is a plus, I suppose.  =P"

","I've always liked Kate Backinsale. I think it's something about Brits in Hollywood, plus her mother was an actress in British medical drama 'Casualty', one of my great obsessions. My mate works at a movie theatre and gave me the movie poster which sits proudly on my wall. I never saw it in the cinema and it took me a good few months to finally see it after it was out on DVD. I didn't have very high hopes for it, I was expecting something similar to 'Blade' (I'm a big action fan, and a bit sci fi fan, but I'm sorry, it sucked!)<br/><br/>Underworld, unlike Blade, doesn't rely solely on CGI and stunt work (Which is fabulous anyway!) The storyline is really intriguing. It had me hooked right from the start. I'm always weary of films that try and combine 2 different well established, for want of a better word 'worlds'. Both the vampires and the werewolves were portrayed in a way I've rarely seen before, you get a real sense of history between the two groups.<br/><br/>The storyline I didn't find at all predictable as I do usually and I was pleasantly surprised that the 'romance' I was dreading between Selene and Micheal (Scott Speedman) came to nothing more than a kiss, and one with ulterior motives at that. The acting by Kate and Scott made their relationship strong enough that you didn't need to see them rip each others clothes off to understand their connection. It would have been out of character and I'm glad the writers didn't stoop to the 'sex sells' level that so many do nowadays.<br/><br/>I'm rambling on rather a lot, but I think you can tell that I loved it! I'd never heard of Scott Speedman before I came across an article in SFX magazine about this film but I'd like to see a lot more of him.<br/><br/>A highly underrated film, deserves twice the hype than 'Blade' got, considering it's 4 times as good.

","I was first intrigued about Underworld when Paula called it the 'Romeo and Juliet of the gothics'. That's Paula Malai Ali, the greatest VJ in the world, for the uninitiated. The trailer seemed cool enough but still wasn't sure if it was a movie for me. But yesterday seeing the choices that I had, I picked it up. And thank God that I did. Cause I really loved the movie. Its awesome. It really is. I mean if you are into that goth blue and black, total dark thing, you'll love it. The story is fluent, action fast and acting sharp enough.<br/><br/>I am so totally into that blue darkish movies that there is no reason for me NOT to love this movie. The war between lycans and vampires is a story line that pulls one in. The story has love, anguish, fear, betrayal, death and vengeance. And I'll swear, half way through the movie you WILL change your allegiance. That the movie concentrates more on the storyline than mindless action sequences is one of its definite plus points. Another thing I loved about the movie is that the two lead characters don't fall upon each, groping. There is only one very brief almost kissing sequence. That's pr√™t cool cause its not much of a war if the characters start getting all hot and sweaty in between. The CGI doesn't try to go overboard and does a splendid job.<br/><br/>Underworld is basically Kate Beckinsale all the way. She talks in this darkish kinda way and kicks some heavy metal butt. And I can't even imagine any other actress doing her role, that great Kate Beckinsale looked as Selene, the vamp-ire. <br/><br/>Glitches? Well, black trench coats should really go out of fashion. Both vampires and lycans have one thing in common ¬ñ either they have long hair or shaved heads. I mean, can't you qualify to be a vampire or a lycan without the hair attribute. Speedman spends most of the movie being just a pretty-boy hustled around. The story leaves behind a lot of unanswered questions. What the movie really needed was some more time. For the story to develop even more and for some more war sequences between vampires and lycans. The story had potential if only things didn't happen too fast. The slicing of Victor's head is a scene that has been liberally 'borrowed' from Resident Evil. That could have been avoided. But all said and done this is one of the better dark movies that have come along in a long time.

The plot is perfect, but the movie did not do the best it could for the plot. It's completely unbelievable that humans would have no knowledge of a battle that has been going on for hundreds of years. Even though this is an action adventure movie, the element of believability still needs to be there in order to make viewers feel connected to the characters and the movie.

The only good thing about this movie was Bill Nighy as the ""boss"" vampire (Viktor). He was the only actor who acted a little over mediocre. The rest sucked. Including the main character Selene (Kale Beckinsale). She was cute to look at in her latex costume, but nothing more.

I think it's a splendid hybrid, much like the Blade films.  I dug it.  And I appreciated the fact that they attempted to do most of the effects the old fashioned way.  The CGI was kept to a minimum...believe it or not.  Too bad most of what gets remembered is the bad CGI.  Everyone knows the plot by now: vampires vs. werewolves.  It's a set-up that I'm surprised hasn't been used more often. When I first heard the announcement for the movie I was rooting for the werewolves.  They are my favorite classic monster and the ones in this film look very cool.  The vamps are no pushovers either.  The film had a lot of actors I didn't recognize and a director I had never heard of.  So I didn't know what to expect from those departments and was also pleasantly surprised.  Despite all of this, it's the movies' mythology that made me like it so much.  The history between the lycans and the vamps was just too good.  It gave me a deeper appreciation for the film.  My favorite scene is when Raze (who is given story credit and has an amazing voice) is running towards Viktor and he grabs his throat and stops him like he was a paperweight.  It was awesomely shocking.  I'm looking forward to a sequel and maybe even a prequel if they should decide to make one."

","Underworld is a movie that probably should be dubbed a Matrix wannabe.  The look and feel of the two movies are very similar, however where Underworld differs is that the Matrix has a very complex story underneath the action. Underworld is filmed in a gray tone which lends a creepy air to the environment, however, seeing vampires and werewolves battle it out with futuristic machine guns and other high tech weaponry makes the story seem a bit odd and distinctly unbelievable.  The plotline and story are very poorly defined until nearly the end of the film and only then does some redemption come for the whole film.  For the first ninety minutes of the film we are left watching basically one futuristic gun battle after another with little snippets of conversation pertaining to the ongoing thousand year war, There is hardly any attention spent giving the audience any indication of why these two species of legendary creatures are at war in the first place.  The revelations of the roots of the war at the climax of the film feel out of place and seem to not really explain why the war would rage for as long as it has.  You also are left switching sides as to who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys"" in the film which I think was intentionally done by the creators of the film to keep the audience off balance.  This only intensifies the confusion of the audience as to why this war is so important to these creatures and why it is taking place in the first place, and why for that matter are we as the audience witnessing it at all. <br/><br/>The special effects and creature creations for the movie are really exciting to watch, however there is so much human type of violence in the movie that it seems extremely hard to believe that aside from pointy teeth the vampires have throughout the movie that these creatures are really vampires and werewolves.  Overall, there were alot of opportunities wasted in making this a really good horror flick, opportunities that could have elevated this movie from the modiocre, run of the mill shoot em ups it is right now. Hopefully the producers see some of the negative comments like this and make a better film for the sequel, as this one is only so so."

","When I saw the teasers for this movie, I started looking forward to it. The idea of vampire and werewolf characters suggested that the film would have action scenes which might rival the Matrix, simply because the characters are supernatural creatures and probably capable of extraordinary feats. However, the choreography was one of the worst I've ever seen. I particularly recall a fight between a vampire and a werewolf - the vampir took out two rather impressive-looking metal whips and started showing off with them, and I thought, now it's going to get really, really impressive. The disappointment that followed was worse, because you only ever saw one of the combatants on the screen at a time. There were no martial arts anywhere. There was showing off on one side and a werewolf getting a whip in the face on the other. It's one of the worst ways of screening a fight I've ever seen, and unfortunately much the same is true for the rest of the movie. The fights never get enthralling because they stay single-character affairs, there is no sense of struggle because you don't see struggle. One of the great disappointments of 2003."

","When I first saw the trailer of Underworld I thought: that will be one to look forward to. Now, I've finally seen it and I must conclude this is a disaster of a movie. But then, the story is quit promising. I mean, you take a bunch of vampires and werewolves who have been fighting a war with each other for hundreds of years, and then the fun can begin, at least that's what I thought. <br/><br/>On the contrary, the story turns out to be very boring and totally stereotyped. It was like I've seen the movie before. Every plot was so predictable and so clich√©. Every time you hope they surprise you with an unexpected event that changes everything. But no, after half an hour you can turn the movie off, and think for yourself how it will end. Because at first you already know how it will end, and second it will be much more exciting because you're imagination will produce the story much better then the guys of the special-effects studio did. <br/><br/>Such a shame, because the actors don't do such a bad job. In fact, they deliver a quit impressive performance. You can't really live in to a bad story, it requires talent to do so. The cast of Underworld showed me that a bad movie doesn't always mean bad acting. <br/><br/>But what's really a shame is that the story of Underworld, what contains so much potential, is totally wrecked by the movie makers. I simply don't understand how the movie turned out to be so long. As a fantasy/horror/thriller/science-fiction/action lover it is hard to understand that Underworld even made it into the cinema's across the world. This film contains nothing new, no spectacular action, no impressive fights (and I would say you may expect that in a movie what goes about a war between werewolves and vampires), a lame an unimpressive story, and the special-effects are totally disappointing for a movie made anno 2003/2004.<br/><br/>
Underworld is entertaining to watch, it is not that bad you desperately want to turn it off as soon as possible, but it could have been so much more. It just is to standard and too much off: Like we did not have seen that before! Even the good performance of the actors can't change that i rate this movie a 5, and that is particularly because of the acting."

","A dark vampire action thriller - these are always appealing to me. Something about the lives of vampires is extremely enviable - all the sex, drugs, rock and roll with lashings of blood somehow seem *very* seductive.<br/><br/>Underworld is the first one I've seen in a while and fails to entertain for much of its duration, which is unfortunate, as usually the mere 'atmosphere' and 'look' of these type of films is enough to grab my attention. Here those aspects simply serve as a platform, and don't particularly draw you in. Kate Beckinsale is Seline, a vampire who's part of an ongoing war between her kind and the Lycans, (Werewolves) a war whose origin is not made clear till later on. Kraven is the leader of the vampires, but Seline despises him and hankers for her dead mentor, Vincent, the former leader, which alienates her from her ilk. However, things get dangerous with the emergence of Michael, a mortal who the Lycans appear to be after, for reason the vampires must find out.<br/><br/>This sets the pace of the movie, the story essentially evolving around him.<br/><br/>The main problem with this picture is the acting is appallingly banal and lifeless, with absolutely cliched characters because none of the actors are capable of making their part their own. Mundane dialogue with insipid delivery serves to bore rather than grip. The only actor who breaks this chain is Bill Nighy, who commands the screen every time he appears. He's not even that outstanding but the feeble competition makes him look so.<br/><br/>The second problem is drab direction. At no point for the vast majority are we made to feel part of what we're watching, because it fails on so many levels to suck us into its world, which is essential in any good film, especially one with such a distinct theme. The action itself seems to be going through the motions too, with decidedly uninspired gunfights and slaughter scenes.<br/><br/>However, amazingly, the last reel is actually rather good. Without giving anything away, obviously events come to a head and for once, the acting is tolerable and the plot genuinely gets interesting. The final action sequence isn't *overly* breathtaking, but it's reasonable, and finally the film pulled me in.<br/><br/>Just a pity it took seemingly forever to get there."

If memory serves, there were a total of 2 werewolf transformations in this movie, and it was the same character both times. Even the leader of the werewolf clan never got to show his stuff.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale provides some sexy eye candy (even if her entire outfit is ""borrowed"" from Trinity of ""Matrix""), but her character's extremely underwritten. She's a vampire, but we only see her using her fangs once -- and that's to SAVE the life of a character. Does she have no bloodthirst? Do any of the vampires?<br/><br/>There's a bit in ""Matrix Reloaded"" where the character Persephone explains that ghosts and monsters are rogue subroutines in the Matrix.

The one dimensional characters were flat and hollow, although the story helps to fill some holes later (too little, too late).   The actors presentations were terrible.  The only one that really added anything extra was Michael Sheen (Lucian).  The writing was awful and better care should have been taken here.  ""Leave us!"" is used a bit too much.  The vampires use of guns got tiresome.  The vampires really didn't do anything to impress me at all, but this film is worth seeing for the special effects on the werewolves alone.  The job done by the crew is fantastic.  Watch the extra dvd footage for some of the behind the scenes magic.  -  6 of 10"
"colin_mcelhatton","Null","0","0","3 March 2004"," A classy movie showing technique and skilled use of animatronics
","To be quite frank I was first led to look at what lay beneath by the poster featured in a pop-up add. Since then I was totally hooked by the storyline, the characters and the new twist to an old tale.<br/><br/>The notion of Lycans (werewolves) and Vampires fighting it out in a modern day metropolis was indeed intriguing to say the least. The initial clash between Selene's (Kate Beckinsale) ""Death Dealers"" and Lucian's Lycan warriors was intriguing in that while it was evident they were following a human it did not reveal an inch into the intricate plot that follows.<br/><br/>To begin we are led to see the current strife through Selene's eyes that is of a human turned Vampire by one of the most powerful Vampire elders to ever stalk the earth (Viktor). We never for a moment stop to consider the Lycans as being the misunderstood Good guys and the Vampires as conspiring villans.<br/><br/>
We arrive to comprehend and sympathise with her as he revives her maker believing it to be the best course fo action in order to save the coven. For her the current interim leader Kraven is more of a bearaucrate than a warrior and therefore he can never understand the threat she perceives as coming from the Lycans.<br/><br/>The story gets more complicated as you go along and climaxes with the realization that the Vampires are really after a specific human (Michael Corvin) a direct decendant from the one human that originated both the Lycan and Vampire breeds. The aim of the lycans is to create a Lycan/Vampire hybrid with which to win ultimate victory against the Vampire covens and their Elders.<br/><br/>The animation effects were great and the use of animatronics and prothetics was something I had not seen in a while. In recent movies we have seen an increased usage of CGI graphics but these always come across as too perfect and lack a serious ""reality"" factor that can only be obtained from ""real"" movement. For instance the Lycan animatronic heads were extraordinary in both range of movement as well as realism. You seriously start to believe that if werewolves were real..they would look just like that!<br/><br/>At any rate I am REALLY eager to see whether they do come up with a sequel. The subtle innuendo at the end of the movie was that the Elder Marcus (the only other direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus) is tainted by the blood of a dead Lycan which poors into his tomb and that he too now possesses the hybrid power shown by Michael in is battle with Viktor. I would really be curious to see how it all turns out and whether a new coven / faction would arise under the command of Selene/Michael or whether they would both still be outcasts by both groups.<br/><br/>Definitely one of my favourite movies."

","This movie is so awesome. I would recommend anybody to watch Underworld. And what more can you ask for it's a battle between realms. Vampires and Werewolves. A good selection if you ask me! And just to say I was cheering for the vampires. I would rate this movie 9 out of 10. The visual effects were great and there was a storyline in this Horror / Action movie. Many time movies like this have no storyline or it is so weak that it gets lost in the action. The acting was good as well. I don't think that this movie could get any better, but I still thing that Dracula 2000 was the best movie ever made. I really enjoyed watching this movie. If you want to watch this movie rent it or buy it."

","I just got finished watching underworld and i think it was underrated just because every one was comparing it to the matrix and blade. The movie has great special effects and sexy vampires exspecially Kate Beckinsale hot hot hot!!!! The story was good too, about a war raging between vamps and lycans (werewolves) AT first they dont really explain why these two foes are fighting one another but as the movie goes along its all revealed and makes sense finally. Blood shed and hot babes makes one hell of a movie threw mine eyes. So i recomend this flick to any horror/action buff and any fan of Kate Beckinsale in black leather like my self. Oh and one more thing i left out and the only bad comment i have for this movie was the chemstry between Scott Speedman and Kate Beckinsale was just horrible there was nothing there between the two of them it was like they were both talking to brick walls for god sake. Besides that little flaw of the flick do pick the dvd up its worth buying but rent first just in case."
"pixelmixer","Null","0","0","21 February 2004"," A good romp.
","I'm sometimes sceptical about watching movies of this nature.  The Blade films didn't really do it for me.  I'm not sure why - I think I just prefer the way Underworld is shot.<br/><br/>I really liked Kate Beckinsale in this.  It's so far beyond the characters she portrays in Shooting Fish and Pearl Harbour and proves she's incredibly versatile.  I think she would have made a great Lara Croft, although I'm glad she didn't because it may have wrecked her career (I have a low opinion of the Tomb Raider genre).  She wears leather/PVC and motorcycle boots throughout the movie and looks fantastic.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see Robbie Gee in this.  His role in Snatch was a comedy stance so I found it a little difficult to take him seriously because of this, but he pulled it off well.  Bill Nighy was a surprising choice but he played his part convincingly.  I look forward to him in The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy though.<br/><br/>The plot started to get a bit confusing, but after watching the entire movie, it made sense and I understood who everybody was and where they stood within the story. It's probably worth a couple of viewings, but that's it.<br/><br/>There's always a danger that movies of this kind are thought to be cheesy and clich√©d.  It's hard not to produce a movie that isn't.  It's not supposed to be believable - it's supposed to be convincing for a couple of hours - then you're back to reality.<br/><br/>I thought Kevin Grevioux's voice was modified, but after listening to the DVD commentary it turns out that it's his ACTUAL voice.  Unbelievable!  He was ideal for this role!<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it.  It's a good romp, everybody's got a good screen presence and it's well shot - using the usual unsaturated gothic look.  Beckinsale is set for future success, with a couple of movies out in 2004.<br/><br/>I give it 7/10.  Could have done with a better soundtrack."

"karl-booth","8","0","0","19 February 2004"," Great visual treat, showing traditional film techniques at their best
","Underworld is a film that unfairly draws comparisons with other films; the matrix, blade etc... In my view it harks back to the good old days of story telling, using CGI techniques only when completely necessary. It is very stylistic from the start, brooding, dark ... but not too dark, I can't be doing with films that make it so dark you can't see what's going on. The heroine (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire warrior, caught in a battle between the decadent world of the vampires and the rough and ready world of the werewolves. The stereotypes of the vampires and Lycans (werewolves) are a little galling and I'm sure neither would have any trouble identifying each other. The Lycans all look like Sabretooth in X-men and the Vamps, Lestat in Interview with a vampire.<br/><br/>The plot is good and I feel directorially, for a debut, it was outstanding. Should I hear of any other films by Len Wiseman I would definitely watch them. Without giving too much away, the plot follows Selene, the heroine, and a human that holds the key to the futures of both Vampires and Lycans. It neither acknowledges nor discredits any other films that might be drawn into the genre, treading its own path in an entertaining enough way. It draws the viewer to make assumptions that will later be challenged as the well weighted plot unveils.<br/><br/>Lucian (The leader of the Lycnas) plays the obligatory English baddie (Well Welsh actually) and does it very well. He oozes a charisma I wasn't expecting to find, and to be honest didn't find in any of the other cast members. Kate Beckinsale (Although absolutely stunning) doesn't make you believe she is a vampire warrior.<br/><br/>The special effects are good. Traditional methods, such as wire working and makeup are done to great effect. Stunts are effortless and add to the films overall ambiance.<br/><br/>Overall this is an entertaining, well put together film which's draws the open minded intelligent viewer in and engages them in the dark world of god damn s*** sucking vampires. (I had to get a lost boys quote in). I cannot finish without mentioning the PVC suit Kate wears.......hmmmmm"

"bbbl67","Null","0","0","21 February 2004"," great werewolves, wimpy vampires
","They did a great job with the special effects surrounding the werewolves (lycans). The Lycans pop out of their skins turning into snarling dogs. Why didn't they come up with something equally impressive about the vampires? The vampires are wimps, you wonder how they are on the verge of eliminating their enemies the lycans when it's obvious that the lycans are much stronger physically. Apart from the head vampire Viktor, who was quite a bit stronger than any of the lycans, all of the rest of the vampires wouldn't be anywhere without their guns and whips. It sort of reminded you of Blade II, where the vampires were basically marine commandos hunting an even more powerful predatory force. Also the two movies were filmed in Eastern Europe, so they had a similar dark iron-curtain feel to it. <br/><br/>Another problem with the movie was that there was so much double-crossing and double-dealing going on, it was hard to follow who was who. Also in many scenes where you got armies of vampires and lycans going against each other, it just turns into a ball of confusion as to who is getting shot by whom. But I guess it really doesn't matter, just as long as there is a lot of shooting going on. <br/><br/>Just a few of the nits about this movie. I liked it otherwise. It doesn't do much to advance the story about vampires or werewolves. Like you don't watch this movie and find out that they have some cool new powers that you never thought of before. In fact, the vampires seem to have less powers than they do in other movies."
"clydestuff","6","0","0","19 February 2004"," Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee
","In the opening moments of this film we get a voice over narration by Selene played by Kate Beckinsale.  It's a nice looking well photographed scene, and it grabs are attention.  Unfortunately, in this opening monologue, we also get a lot of vague mumble jumbo attempting to explain who Selene is, what she's doing and why.  By the time the narration is finished we don't have anymore of a clue as to what's going on then we did as we entered the theater.  And that as just about how it goes for the entire length of Underworld.<br/><br/>Don't fret though, eventually you'll discover through a certain amount of diligence that this is the story about the Vampires and the Lycans, or werewolves if you will.  Think Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee and you pretty much have the picture.  We also know that the Vampires have spent years trying to do in the Lycans and have been quite successful at it.  It seems that Selene discovers the Lycans are after a certain human named Michael Corvin(Scott Speedman).  They need to mix his blood with theirs for reasons that are never quite clear.  It also turns out that after tracking down Michael on her own, Selene finds herself attracted to him.  We know this only because of the way the plot develops, not because of any kind of emotional response offered by Selene.  Of course she is a vampire and chances are she isn't supposed to have any romantic notions, but if she doesn't have any emotions....well, I don't want to convolute an already polluted film any more than it is.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of other stories told to us during Underworld.  There are more monologues in this film explaining background and motives than any film in recent memory.  My best advice to you is if you watch this film, be prepared to draw a chart as these many explanations are rattled off because you'll sure need one.  There's a story about why and how Selene became a vampire, there's a story about why Michael is being hunted by the Lycans, there's a story about why two vampire leaders sleep for years and only one is awakened at a time, there's a story about why bullets are taken out of the Lycans and put back in.  After a while I felt like I should go to the book store and buy the Cliff Notes.  There are so many stories and so many explanations, and most of them are so convoluted and long winded that it's impossible to follow this film without being overcome by long periods of boredom.<br/><br/>A lot of what is on the screen looks good.  The battle scenes between the Lycans and the Vampires are all well done and interesting to look at.  The sets are adequately foreboding and photographed in the kind of prevalent bluish haze that seems to have overtaken the film world in the last few years.  We do look at the battle and attack scenes in a passive kind of way because Underworld has complicated it's plot and background to an extent that we really don't care about who the good guys are or the bad guys are or whatever.  We are never given a chance to be drawn into this story and none of the performances here help.  I don't care if this is a film about the supernatural, there is not one performance in this film that is more than one note.  Beckinsale certainly looks OK in her leather outfit, and she performs the action scenes well enough, but does nothing at any point to make us care about her or help draw us into her story.  Speedman's human character of Michael is no better.  We don't feel any sympathy, fear, or anything about him because after two hours you won't know him as a person any better than you did when he makes his first appearance. <br/><br/>
If you take the time to watch Underworld, you might appreciate the action scenes, the dark settings, and several scenes of modern day werewolves and vampires battling it out.  As for myself I've only got one thing to ask, ""Where's my copy of Dracula vs. The Wolf Man?""<br/><br/>My Grade: C-"

","Too many people have made inconclusive parallels between this movie and films like blade and the matrix. Yes, it has fighting and shiny PVC, vampires and action a plenty - it also has an interesting storyline and some emotive acting. Films such as Equilibrium also seem to suffer with too many comparisons being raised and in doing so viewers miss the point of the movie itself. Watch this movie with an open mind and I am very sure that the tension, action, excitement and the rather attractive Kate Beckinsale leaping around in her skin tight PVC will change your mind and allow you to enjoy one of the more underrated movies of 2003."

"Adrian-34","10","0","0","9 February 2004"," Great! [SPOILERS]
","I think this movie was just GREAT!  The story was solid and interesting though not excessively complicated or intrguing.  The jist of the story is that a 1,000 year plus war has been waged between vampires and werewolves. You really don't find out why for sometime so you'll need to be patient. It's the best vampire movie I've seen in a LOOOOOOOONG time!<br/><br/>That's not to say it was perfect.  On the contrary, it certainly could have used some polishing.  One thing that annoyed me about this movie was that everyone, and that means 99% of the cast, wore black or red even the vampires home was all black, red and white.  The flashback scenes were annoing but tolerable for most.  I don't like some of the techniques used today so most won't have a problem with it.  Beckinsale was great in the role but I think the character needed more developing.  Her rough, ""I've been so hurt"" edge made her look emotionless, cold and for the most part disinteresting.  You walk away feeling you never really knew the character at all.  When Selene and Michael fall in love the first thing you wonder is how?!  He certainly could not know much about her especially at that point. In fact you are not sure how Kahn, who seems to be her closest friend (which is not saying much), became her confidant at all.  The romance of Selene and Michael is not buyable and almost suffocates the love story of Lucian and Sonja's love tragedy.  The latter probably being one of the film's redeeming points albeit a brief one.<br/><br/>Some people complained about the fact that they had no idea where the tale takes place and that werewolves can climb walls/ceilings, vampires can see their reflections, etc.,  This didn't bother me but I don't see a need to assume folklore must be adhered to in a movie.  They were not killed by traditional means either.  It's thereby safe to assume that these vampires, whether other worldly or not, are simply not of the same variety that we know.  I don't think it is that big of an issue or a deal.  The one thing along this line though which did trouble me was that with the strengths and powers of the vampires compared with that of the werewolves it is simply amazing that the previous survived as long as they had as it seemed the werewolves had the out ranked in abilities.<br/><br/>Still, though it may not sound it, I genuinely loved it and highly recommend it to any horror fan.  I'm praying for a part two!"

","***Spoilers ahead****<br/><br/> I have to admit, I was bored and quite aggravated with this movie within the first 10 minutes.  I thought it'd be another substance-less ""shoot 'em up with some lame-o excuse reason"" action flick.  I was ready to turn it off and return it to the video store, but I figured, ""Hey I'm paying $3 for this, might  as well see the whole thing.""<br/><br/> I'm pretty glad I stuck with it.  The storyline finally grabbed my attention - too bad it happened 1 hr and 30 min. into the movie.  Before this point, I kept asking myself ""What's the deal with Michael's blood?"" and ""Why do the vampires and werewolves hate each other so much?""  among other questions.  It's good when movies have this particular element of suspense/questioning where the viewer is left to try and fit the pieces together or, in this case, wait until the plot is revealed.  Unfortunately, this movie waited too long to do that.  For the viewer who does not find much pleasure in the underlying thematic issues of a movie, this movie is not for them.<br/><br/> I was not particularly impressed with the action nor the ""stern-faced Trinity-like"" demeanor of Selene and the filmmaker(s) kept dragging on the hidden secret surrounding ""Michael"".  However, once the reason for the war was revealed, I realized that this movie is a commentary on an actual struggle that has existed for centuries in multiple societies.  That war is between the haves and have-nots, the upper class and lower class, Whites and Blacks, etc.  I especially saw the likeness to U.S. slavery when Lucian said lycans used to be the servants of vampires.<br/><br/> In the beginning the filmmaker set it up as if we should be on the vampires' side through the use of various character visuals (e.g. we tend to associate the bad guys as unkempt-looking characters - all of which the lycans embodied).  The beginning of the film is  also mostly told from the vampire perspective so we might tend to identify with them.  However, once the crucial fact of Lucian's lost love and Viktor's aversion to species-mixing was revealed, I was completely rooting for the lycans by the end. The movie does a  brilliant job in allowing the viewer to switch allegiances.  I was involved in the story.<br/><br/> Point blank, Viktor was the head racist, like a Hitler or KKK member. Using the example of US slavery, Viktor could be seen as the White slaveowner who would rather kill his daughter than accept that she is in love with a Black slave.  I appreciate the end of the movie when the species-mixing finally happened:  Something incredible can occur when you combine two supposed opposites.  Similarly, many people who are the children of parents of different ethnicities are some of the most beautiful people, i.e. Halle Berry, Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey.<br/><br/> Overall, although the action was not very impressive and the moodiness of the film was annoying, I took great delight in the social commentary aspect of the film.  I don't know whether it was intentional in this case, but it's always great when an action film can provide some food for thought."

","The movie tried much too hard to be cool. The relentless black, tight leather, the constant blue tint of the cinematography, and the total lack of humor made this movie rather 2-dimensional. Variety is the spice of life and this movie was bland. However, at least they did pick an appealing visual style to overuse--after all, I would rather look at stoic people running around in black than country bumpkins running around in trousers and straw hats. I also thought it was odd that the movie saw vampires in the light it did. Normally, they are portrayed as guiltless killers, but this bunch acted appalled at the idea of drinking human blood. In my opinion, this was somewhat of a cop-out because the movie used all the nice aspects of vampires (their cool look and brooding style), but conveniently left out all of the more morally troublesome aspects. This seemed a little cheap to me."

There are tons of missing points, they didn't portray characters deeply enough. The first Blade movie had some glitches due to budget constraints as well BUT it gave a generally better feeling to viewers, UNDERWORLD is missing the point here and there, it seems that the director and the production get lost in something bigger than themselves, something that they can't manage properly. CGI effects are not top-notch, they look cheap many times.. and I wonder why it always happens to movies co-produced between many countries, if it was a US only production I bet it would have been much better overall.<br/><br/>A sequel would be cool but the director has to be changed, the whole production has to be switched over to someone that can do horror movies better. Sony did a great job with Resident Evil and they should put that production in charge of any possible Underworld sequel.<br/><br/>Underworld would be a top-notch movie if properly developed and putting right people on the project might give sequels very high-ratings. This one it's just and average movie with a very good script that hasn't been correctly portrayed on screen, unfortunately."

","I don't know why someone would say not to bother wasting your money on this movie. I am a horror movie fan, a fan of vampire movies and all that go along with that genre. I seen Underworld here at the Toronto Film Festival back in September 2003 and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD so I could add it to my collection. This Vampire/Werewolf film is unique as it doesn't use the typical setting of Los Angeles for everything. Seems so many of these types of flicks always have to deal with Los Angeles. Fianlly this time the scenery is more along the lines of what this type of film should look like. Gothic. And instead of everyone walking around in regular everyday clothes like people of L.A. the characters are dressed in black PVC and leather. Hey maybe it is me but I think if this flick had been done with the setting of the TV series Angel, it would have been pathetic. I like Angel but too many movies with Vampires will seem to show them as regular people and that has been done too much. Kate Beckinsale is great as the lead, she speaks with her natural British accent instead of the fake American one we have been so used to her using in films. This whole movie has the right feel and setting, and it shows the vampires in a luxury life like they do live in when we read back about them. Werewolfs are underground, more of the ""lower class"" looking. The rules are followed so well for a flick about both fan favs and it works like a charm. Sure someone mentions about the American accents, big deal, I guess in the Czech Republic (where this was filmed) there are no Americans over there? Just like there are no Czechs in America? I believe that true fans of Vamps and Werewolves will be impressed with this flick. Also I think Vampires and Werewolves were not created or set in America like so many characters and movies ""Have"" to be. I mean come on, Fredy, Jason, Micheal Myers, Pinhead and Leatherface all are popular horror characters that seem to originate in America.<br/><br/>Come on people put aside your usual criticizing,  this is not a boring Tom Hanks ""true story"" film, it is make believe, about two types of fan fav characters that are popular in todays times as well as say 50 years ago. No different than withcraft."

","I'm not a huge fan of the vampires and werewolves universes. Though, every once in a while, I can enjoy a vampire or werewolf vs. human picture, particularly when there's a siege situation. Not being a fan of the myths, it's easy for me to identify with the fellows in trouble. If the approach to these legendary themes is easy or mockingly I can let myself go without major tribulations. UNDERWORLD takes itself too serious for its own good.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is that it is a story about vampires and werewolves, nothing more, a battle between both clans. There's nothing here for people who don't love vampires and werewolves. Although the special effects are pretty impressive and Len Wiseman's direction is technically flawless, it came a point in the movie where I couldn't identify with any character, thus the movie became boring and extremely overlong. The action sequences weren't enough to lift up the movie because I just couldn't care about the story. Therefore, the special effects and fight sequences had a void, meaningless effect in me. The same is true for the nice, dark cinematography and the rich, gothic set design.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, since I can even recognize this movie had a good premise: a legendary battle between vampires and werewolves. But if it weren't for the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, in non-sexy mode here, probably I wouldn't have paid half the attention I did to this movie."

","(WARNING SPOILER: has nothing to do with the plot, really, but its sorta the end of the movie, so reader beware)<br/><br/>Good movie, on the whole.  Other then the ""Sliding head"" effect that has been too over done in recent years, it was decently done and if nothing else the whole ""waking of viktor"" thing is enough to make it worth renting. Glad I didn't see it in theaters though.  My biggest peeve with it though is the end.  You would THINK that after years and years and years (and years and years) of putting to sleep and waking back up these elders that they would have learned to seal the little coffin things they're in.  At the very least you don't want mites getting to your sleeping vampire corpse.  And with all the sliding and turning and swishing that goes on when one is open it sounded pretty air tight.  But...if it's air tight...doesn't it mean it's water tight too?  And blood is thicker then water and yet it seeps in. They didn't HAVE to have him wake that way (not that I know how he's going to get out) for the sequel.  It just bugged me, that after all this time they couldn't seal a tomb right.  But, if you can suspend disbelief (and don't mind a few rather strange errors (vampires walking through, an standing in sunlight, even in the sewers?!) and are a vampire fan, you'll like this, and it has a rather strange twist at the end.  Ignore the lack of a good air tight seal and you'll like this movie, for a little entertainment at least."

","Vampires vs. Werewolves. What could be better for a fan of either or a fan of both? Unfortunately, this movie does not deliver in what could have been, and should have been, one of the coolest vampire/werewolf movies ever made.<br/><br/>The whole movie seemed to meander, even in the action scenes. I think there wasn't enough time dedicated to the screenplay, though it seems like the storyline and backstory had been well thought out. This led to the feeling that a lot was implied but left out.<br/><br/>Beckinsale looks great in her catsuit and cape, the sets were simple and stayed in the background, but the special effects left a lot to be desired. The werewolf transformations were terrible, and not much more advanced than those in ""American Werewolf in London."" I think they should have sped it up just a little bit more and that might have passed muster. I think it was silly that the professional vampire ""Death Dealers"" would stand around in the middle of a fight and wait a few seconds for their opponent to transform into a werewolf. It would have been better to have the transformation occur in the middle of combat, allowing the editor to cut a lot and break the special effect up into more believable bits.<br/><br/>I recommend that if you are a vampire and/or werewolf fan, go ahead and rent this move, but please don't spend $20 on it, or you will regret it."

Overall, the movie holds the audience's attention primarily because the movie has some interesting twists and turns plot and story wise moreso than because the movie was captivating.

It combines elements of The Crow, Blade, The Matrix, Anime, Interview with the Vampire, Queen of the Damned and Equilibrium. Some people have some problems with Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) using guns and cell phones and cameras etc etc. After seeing this movie again on DVD (bought it the day it came out) I gotta say this movie is fast becoming one of my more favorite movies. Sure the romance angle is not really realized on screen. That's the same thing I could say about Star Wars Ep II. So what? I don't go to a movie to see romance or exposition or crying or self-actualization or anything so blaise or cliched. No no no. I go to see costuming, set design, effects and direction. This movie delivers that in spades. The costuming, set design and production values alone make this a pretty cool movie. A little tip - try watching this movie with the subtitling on. There were lots of things that I missed in the movie due to some dialogue being difficult to hear. As for thie movie being derivative, c'mon people. It's NOT POSSIBLE to make an original vampire movie. It's been done to death. Besides the best vampire movie of all time is the so bad it's freakin cool LIFEFORCE. lol. That movie rocks. This movie is like watching a graphic novel on screen. Exactly what I wanted to see and I liked this a whole lot better than some far more expensively produced drivel like DAREDEVIL or THE HULK.

","Many questions arise when watching Underworld.  (1) What are lycans?  (2) Who are deathdealers?  But most confusingly, (3) who in the world is Scott Speedman??!  Underworld answers some of these questions and reveals the plot way too far into the movie.  The first two-thirds of Underworld is devoted to shooting, killing, biting, and some chitchat that makes little sense because none of the plot is revealed.<br/><br/>For my father, and I think for many moviegoers, Underworld takes so long to make sense that there's little reason to stick around.  However, I toughed it out, and after about 90 minutes, I saw a glimpse of a story unfolding. The story is fairly interesting as we're told how this whole mess started, but it took way too long to get to that point.  The actors were unrecognizable before and after this movie (except it was fun to see Kate Beckinsale in that leather outfit).  The action sequences were commendable, but may be a little overkill (especially the ending with a very silly death of one of the main characters).<br/><br/>Underworld reminds me of the time my friends dragged me to see Blade 2.  I had no real interest in seeing that movie and am really not a fan of vampire/werewolf movies.  After seeing Blade 2, I was not swayed, but my friends seemed to enjoy it.  I think Underworld will do the same for fans of those types of movies.  However, for the average, recreational moviegoer like myself, Underworld is just going to fly over your head.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 5/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: C+ (Flawed but Worthy)"

"Timescrew","6","0","0","10 January 2004"," Underworld was sadly overrated.
","Underworld. overrated. The movie inspired me as a gamer, filling my head with fantastic scenarios of werewolves vs. vampires. However, this `Romeo & Juliet' simile lacked a well-constructed storyline. The plot was interesting, but it just did not seem to flow with the events in a satisfactorily way.<br/><br/>We begin with a brief introduction narrated by the protagonist, Selene (Beckinsale) a vampire `Death Dealer' charged with the task of hunting werewolves into extinction. The narration explains that this millennia long war between the two species has been raging on unbeknownst to the world of mortals, fueled by loathing and anger. On one particular hunt, she discovers that the werewolves are stalking one human, Mike Corvin (Speedman) in particular, but not to feed on him. Intrigued, she searched deeper and became involved in inner house politics and a personal turmoil between saving Corvin and dishonoring her clan. Later, Corvin is turned into a werewolf, forcing her to reevaluate her priorities between species, house, and heart. Nevertheless, she cannot turn her back on Corvin, because he holds the key to possibly ending the war and bringing about a new age for vampire and werewolf alike.<br/><br/>For some reason, we are expected to view Selene as a `good guy' even though she is still a blood-sucking vampire, although she looks extremely hot, and I am a big fan of eye candy. Beckinsale shares a lofty position with Jolie's Lara Croft and Barrymore's Dylan Sanders in my list of `favorite-brunettes-in-tight-leather.' However, I could not sympathize with her character. I actually rooted for the werewolves throughout the whole movie. We see some good performances by some of them like Michael Sheen, my personal favorite in this movie, and a deliciously dark and intriguing performance by Bill Nighy as Viktor, the clan's reigning vampire awoken from hibernation by Selene. I must say, though, that Shane Brolly was not the right person for this role. Maybe it is the character, or maybe it was just him, either way, the movie was hurt by his performance, or lack thereof.<br/><br/>The movie has several good points, ranging from stunning visual effects and props to having a dark quality to it like so many horror/adventure movies that are gracing our decade. As for bad points, I can reference the lack of storyline development again, but the biggest disappointment comes from the lack of character believability and development. They were either blank and mundane, or inexplicably passionate. Perhaps the prequel that is rumored to have been green lighted by Screen Gems will clear the air on this. I was also unimpressed with the lack of werewolf/vampire combat interaction. Obviously, we see that vampires do not stand a chance against werewolves in toe-to-toe melee, but just when the wolves descend on the bloodsuckers it cuts to another scene. I am sorry, but I am a huge fan of gore, and I would have loved to see a vampire be torn apart in rage.<br/><br/>What I would really like to see though, is a Blade crossover. Imagine the greatest vampire hunter since Van Helsing teaming up with a vampire with a conscience (read: soul), a werewolf, and the provocative monster that this movie has (omitted for non-spoiler). It could be a real topper for the genre. Blade III: The Underworld."
"Rooster99","8","0","0","7 January 2004"," Terrific action picture!
","I can't believe they were able to put this together for only 23 million. Puts many movies with vastly superior budgets to shame!  (someone actually okayed the 120 million for Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle, perhaps the worst action movie ever made).  Great special effects, good action sequences, a story that moves at a smart pace (though is occasionally predictable), and a thoroughly enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>********MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****************<br/><br/>There are some aspects of the plot which may require reflection however. For instance, the vampires seem ridiculously easy to kill (like in Blade), whereas the werewolves appear to be immensely difficult.  Even after being shot in the head 3 times with silver bullets, Lucian does a lot of flexing and simply pops them out (how many times do you have to shoot them to kill them then?).  The werewolves (Lycans) use ultraviolet bullets against the vampires, however when Selene sets out to kill the lead vampire, she merely slices a good chunk of his head off.  She doesn't even use some sort of garlic/holy/ultraviolet blade, it was just Viktor's personal sword...  If it were that simple, why wait until the 21st century to invent ultraviolet bullets?  Just walk around with a bunch of swords a la Highlander, remember this war has been going on for over 1000 years!!!  Also, when Selene finds out that the werewolves were not responsible for the war (or at least it shows her having doubts), she still arrives with a large force and proceeds to eradicate them.  When it helps the plot, the werewolves seem to succumb fairly easily to her bullets, but when Lucian needed to survive, he proved much more difficult to kill.  Finally, the fact that vampires fear light was not explored at all.  The city they were in appeared to be in perpetual darkness.  Selene never had to wait before zipping off in her fancy automobiles, it was always conveniently night.  And the moronic Werewolves, who can waltz around in daylight, don't seem to see the advantage of attacking the vampires during the day....<br/><br/>However, those are just minor points.  After all, it's a vampire movie, I did not go see it expecting Gone With the Wind.  It's very stylish, I thought it was great the way the vampires in the coven all acted like some sort of landed gentry.  They don't do much in the movie other than look half-dead and elegant, but it was a good contrast to the more earthly werewolves.  I also didn't expect Viktor to be a Nazi-like vampire elder, unwilling to countenance the mixing of the races, even to the extent of burning his own daughter at the stake (with sunlight, she's a vamp after all).  She does wake him to save the coven from Kraven's treachery, but is taken aback when Viktor does not side with her.<br/><br/>All in all, a great action movie.  It rivals Blade and Equilibrium for enjoyment.  I think the naysayers on this board just like to diss a good film because people are talking about this one like it had cult status (it's cooler to be negative).  If you like vampire/werewolf movies, this one is terrific.  Sure DVD buy.  8/10"
"aldenbach","8","0","0","6 January 2004"," Light on gore, good character development, consistent story
","Putting aside all of the rhetoric about realism, Matrix rip-offs, and vampire/werewolf lore consistency, this movie stands as a rare gem because it is both intriguing and consistent unto itself.<br/><br/>The film is light on gore (only two moderate scenes) with heavy action sequences using submachine pistols and rifles.  Don't expect to see vampires and werewolves ripping apart humans (thank goodness...)!  Both species are more concerned in killing each other, and humans are just collateral damage.<br/><br/>This film (thankfully) generates its own refreshing ambience and lore concerning the origins and lives of vampyres and werewolves (a.k.a lycanthropes).  For example, vampires live under a code preventing the consumption of human blood, with livestock blood being the acceptable entree.  Thus, the reason why we (that's you and I) don't see or read about people dying from bite marks on their necks.<br/><br/>The acting was quite acceptable, with the exception of one of the main characters (Michael Corvin) who either had a bad script, or just can't act. I actually don't like gore/horror movies at all and had no plans to see this one until I read a review which described the film as more of an action/intrigue flick rather than a lunch tosser.  What a pleasant surprise it was to be able to view this movie 4 times and still be learning interesting details about the storyline.<br/><br/>If you liked the ambience of the Matrix, and are tired of the same old boring vampire/werewolf storyline, then this movie should be high on your list.  Otherwise, if you're seeking a gore/blood splatter flick then look elsewhere."

","This was a decent and ambitious movie by a first time director of a full length feature movie.  Wiseman needs to work on making the tone of his movie consistent throughout the entire movie. Wiseman was very fortunate to have veteran actors in his cast who have the talent to connect their characters to the atmosphere of the movie themselves. Their talent keeps the movie from being completely bad. I enjoyed the dialogue between Viktor and Selene. Also, I thought the parts of Lucian and Michael were well cast.  I think a big mistake was the casting of the actor who played Kraven. I don't like to trash actors but I think the part required more depth.  As a whole, the movie was okay. It worked and was a good showcase for Beckinsale in an entirely different role were she proved to be believable. I also thought that Bill Nighy brought a lot of presence to this movie.

","Think about it. All you need to do with a Cup O' Noodles is add hot water up to the cutoff line, stir it and let it sit there for like two or three minutes. That's how simple it is. Sadly, Underworld is a Cup O' Noodles that was prepared really wrong.<br/><br/>Underworld, if handled by the proper people, could've been a great Cup O' Noodles. I mean, for the love of Mike, they had everything they needed to make this. A war between vampires and werewolves raging in the streets, just under view of the public eye. Listen to the way that sounds. Now if you're like me, that's enough to make you drool with the possibilities. Okay, maybe not drool but you have to admit that it's an idea that just sounds good. The first I heard of this movie got me excited and the trailer looked promising enough. <br/><br/>So why is it that while I'm watching this movie, I feel like doing bodily harm to someone? Why, I'll tell you! This movie bites, pun fully intended. This movie is really, really bad. There were moments in the film where I did my best Dwayne Wayne impression with a big, ""Huh?"", unintentionally. The story makes little sense and seems to be more interested in subjecting the viewer to ""highbrow"" dialogue, that is actually a lot less intellectual than it sounds, than what said viewer most likely wants to be subjected to: satisfying action. But I'll save that little detail for last, the whole problem with the action in the movie. I have other bones to pick first. The acting sucks unfortunately. I was able to stomach Kate Beckinsale but I think that was mainly due to her looking damn tasty in those leather outfits. Not to say her acting was bad which didn't but she was sadly and criminally wasted in this movie and it makes it even worse to think that they could not pull off such a great premise with this girl in the lead, who was pretty much pitch perfect. Everybody else in the movie delivers blandly, especially the jerk who plays Craven. Boy, was he horrible. I wanted to slap him with a wet sock the moment he delivered his first line. Why he was cast is a question that only the director will probably ever know. Unless he was a nephew of one of the gaffers or something. Then maybe you could ask the gaffer if you ever get to speak to him. Special effects? Terrible. It was hard not to laugh when I saw the first werewolf transformation in the movie. I managed to hold it in, at least, until the second transformation happened. The werewolf transformations look absolutely horrendous. It almost looked like they took some Pop Rocks and fed it to someone's German Shepherd, slowing the film down so you could catch every little flesh shuddering crackle and pop. Think about this: An American Werewolf in London came out back in 1981 and the werewolf transformations in Underworld come nowhere near the quality of Werewolf in London. This in 2003, when effects are supposedly at an all time high. How sad is that? Very, if you ask me. The movie looks great which is really just another sad casualty in this film. There's something about a movie with wasted cinematography that just drives a stake through my heart. <br/><br/>And this my friends, is where I tell you what the biggest problem with this movie is. Originality. I read a review of this film upon its release that summed it up perfectly. I don't remember the exact quote but it touched upon the fact that there is almost nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before or done better. I couldn't put it any better. The action scenes are just bland and it's obvious that somebody watched and tried to rip off Blade prior to filming this movie. Speaking of Blade, that particular film was ransacked for ideas for this movie. If you know your Blade movies, you will feel a sense of deja vu watching this. This film is reason enough to question the validity of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. There are moments in this film that are blatantly ripped off from some pretty recent movies. To give you a perfect example, there is a transition in the film where the camera goes into what is on a computer monitor. Not only does this scene rip off a very similar transition in the first Matrix movie but they even had the gall to use the same weird trademark sound effects that were used in the Matrix in that same scene. Shameless.<br/><br/>They had the premise, they had the look, they had the heroine and they just had to blow it. I don't understand how they could have fudged it. How hard could it have been to pull something great out of the idea that they had? My guess is that somebody didn't read the recipe on their Cup O' Noodles container. A sad experience which I have no desire to relive.<br/><br/>

","Spoilers <br/><br/>Both Matrix Reloaded and Underworld start with the heroin, clad in body-tight leather, leaping from a height. The landings however are markedly different. Carrie-Anne Moss's landing is the stylish Yuen Woo-ping choreography, with left leg completely bent and right leg fully stretched, cushioning the impact of the touchdown, and ending up in a cat-like posture and frozen for a moment. Kate Beckinsale's landing is effective and down-to-earth, with both legs just slightly bent to a semi-crouching position, and immediately standing up and walking. This right away sets the tone for the movie: down-to-earth, no-nonsense. One other thing is that while attires are strikingly similar, with Beckinsale it's an infinitely lovelier countenance which, nonetheless, commands no less respect.<br/><br/>Most impressive however is the integrity of the plot, which is unravelled skilfully throughout the movie. The following synopsis does not completely follow the sequence in the movie.<br/><br/>(start of synopsis)<br/><br/>The Vampire world is ruled in rotation by three powerful leaders, with two sleeping at any point in time while the third is ruling. At the start of the movie, however, all three are temporarily sleeping, but Marcus is due to be waken in two day's time (we end up never seeing him). Kraven, temporarily in charge of the clan, oversees preparation for the waking ceremony which will be attended by a neighbouring clan led by Amelia (we end up seeing very little of her). It is generally believed that the Vampires' arch-enemies, the Werewolves, are close to extinction after their leader Lucian was killed six hundred years ago. Vampire Selene (Beckinsale), the top Werewolf hunter, stumbles into a plot involving Michael, a human. She then discovers that Lucian is not dead and, what's worse, has traitor Kraven working for him. In desperation, she wakes her mentor Viktor (out of turn) who had rescued her just after her entire family had been butchered by Werewolves. Lucian is on the move, first biting Michael to turn him into a Werewolf and then engineers an ambush at the train station and massacres Amelia and her entire consort. Next will be an all out storming of the Vampire stronghold.<br/><br/>Things however are not what they seem. First, we learn that Michael is descended from a line of humans with a rare genetic makeup. Unlike others who will die upon acquiring both Vampire and Werewolf bloods, he will instead become immortal. The most convoluted twist is that Lucian turns out to be more of a victim than a villain. Once a servant of Viktor, Lucian dared to love his daughter Sonja. Upon learning that his own daughter was bearing a child with pure Vampire blood `contaminated' by Werewolf blood (sounds familiar, doesn't it), he killed her right in front of Lucian, who then escaped. The plot comes around in full integrity when Selene falls in love with Michael, who has become a Werewolf after Lucian's biting. In an exciting final skirmish, we first see Kraven fatally wounding Lucian before escaping. Lucian, in his dying breath, reveals another twist (which is quite predictable): Viktor, not Werewolves, was the real murderer of Selene's folks. He also bids Selene to bite Michael to infuse him with her blood, thereby completing a Vampire-Werewolf union. So the finale is the show down between Michael and Viktor, but the final blow of vengeance is dwelt by Selene.    <br/><br/>(end of synopsis)<br/><br/>The movie is well paced between action and story telling and there is a lot of story to tell, even looking at the already simplified synopsis above. As to action, except for the finale, the action is mostly in shooting. Beckinsale's twin pistol is mostly John Woo style and her execution is effective and convincing. There is firepower galore from both sides, complete with updated technology as Q would have provided James Bond with. The Vampires has improved on silver bullets (which the Werewolves can extract, albeit painfully) to silver-nitrate bullets that immediately get into the Werevolves' bloodstream. Not to be out-done, the Werewolves have bullets infused with sunlight, and I don't need to explain how those affect Vampires. For those craving for more brutal, close-up action, the final series of consecutive fights should be satisfying, displaying various deadly devices including fists, claws, twin whips, bites and swords. One final thought: there is nothing more different between Beckinsale in Seredipity and Beckinsale in Underworld. Yet she is just as captivatingly charming in both."

","What a great storyline and what great potential!  They almost got it right too!  Unfortunately, it got messed up from page to film.  The Vampires are horribly weak and wimpy.  The Lycans are just beastly monstrousities. What could have been an epic battle of mankinds two favorite nightmares ends up being a silly romp into an underlit world of urban chaos.<br/><br/>As for the answer to my ""one line summary"" stated above?  Well if you haven't figured it out by now, for shame!  Kate Beckinsdale is achingly gorgeous and has a sultry pout on her lips for the entire film.

","Underworld is becoming my favorite movie. The concept for Underworld makes sense. The special effects are really cool. These are Vampires and Werewolves as they should be.

I can't wait for the sequel, which was quite evident that there will be one. There better be a sequel or I will be upset.<br/><br/>There was another post about the film in which the author mentioned the nickname for the Werewolves, (Lichen).

","Yes this movie had some faults but overall I Thought it was good I liked how for once we had a woman main vampire that kicked butt also i liked how different this movie was from other vampire movies (you know like seeing them feasting on humans)I also like the whole idea of a thing(hybrid) stronger than a lycan and a vampire put together.Another really cool thing was the winding road it took from viktor being this saint to becoming the bad guy.And I loved how you got to know lucian and what he was about from his memories. But a big problem in this movie was the ""romance"" between Selene and Michael they said it was supposed to be like a Romeo and Juliet trapped in this chaotic setting  but really i saw that they showed very little attraction toward each other (fine example of this was the ending where you see Selene and Michael she looks back at him and just walks off you know they could have maybe hugged to show that they were going to survive this war or even a nod would have worked  but no Selene looks back at Michael with a look that shows little or no emotion and just walks away and Michael just stands there with no expression on his face and follows Selene)  so they kissed I am sorry but you can just put a kiss in a movie and say there is a romance in it but still i thought they would have played out the romance a little more than they did and i thought they could have explains things a lot better in the movie like who's blood could be used to make someone a hybrid PS trust me i am not trying to tick anyone off here I enjoyed the movie I am just showing it's faults"

","I was late at the theater to watch a different movie, so I settled for this one. I must admit that my expectations were low, given this movie's lack of highfalutin ratings. Well, so much for ratings ! This is a well conceived movie.<br/><br/>The storyline is compelling and not obfuscated like some of the submoronic action flics I've watched this summer. Vampires against Werewolves with the enthralling twist of forbidden love. The action is well choreographed, not over the top, and certainly not beyond the pale, notwithstanding a modicum of plagiary from ""MATRIX"" and perhaps ""BLADE"". I just wish that they had done more with the climatic fight sequence of the purportedly invulnerable and resurrected vampire overlord, against the much extolled Werewolf/Vampire super Hybrid. I felt somewhat cheated here, that the director failed to invest a few more blows on this fight. Nonetheless, this movie entertains, and that's really the bottom line. Go see it !"

","Personally, i thought this movie could have been much better, as do the majority of people who commented here, but basically, for what it's worth it was a good action flick.<br/><br/>I had some plot troubles.<br/><br/>*Here be spoliers*<br/><br/>Such as why didn't the wolves use the UV bullets more often? You never see them get used, only see them put into the guns.  Also, the vampires themselves reminded me of decandant children who's parents are away for the weekend and they're throwing a goth party... Gee, that's a sight to inspire terror.<br/><br/>The acting of the hero(?) Was good, and i'm not talking about Selene, i'm talking about Micheal, i think this was his first movie? But it was good, and in regards to the main comment about this movie, LICHEN are moss, and Lychan are not.  Put's the movie in a completely wrong state of mind for people who going to see this.<br/><br/>If you're going to see this movie, then don't expect lots of deep introspective scenes, accept it for what it is.  A hollywoods director chance to make money by cashing in on the Matrix and Blade, after all, this movie is little more than a mixture of them both surely.<br/><br/>There were a few problems in the beginning, i firstly thought ""Bland bland bland""  and then started to like it.  I loved the wolves, thought they were interesting, and the directors even tried to make the vampires more human by *only* drinking Animal blood, but then again, guess that didn't work in the case of Selene's family huh? I'm guessing with all the effects from the wolves the directors didn't have much money left over to change the vampires! But it was a good change, they at least got the teeth right...<br/><br/>But in general, i liked the story. It could have been SOOOO much better, but it was a good story line i think, secondly, i think the acting, while slightly over done in several cases *coughVICTORcough* it was good.  The main characters were good and convinced me that they earned their salary, considering the story they had to deal with they should off.  And finally, all that science stuff, call me a skeptic but tracing a pure family line from over 1400 YEARS ago?  Slightly hard.<br/><br/>But i enjoyed it, would recommend it to those kids who have goth inspirations, and more importantly, would tell them not to expect the matrix with fangs, or blade with bullet time.  It tries to be one or the other, but it doesn't quite meet it...<br/><br/>I liked it, shame that's as far as my emotions strech for it.

","One day has passed since I watched this film. And I can't help wanting to go back and watch it again. But doing so wouldn't give me what I'm looking for. In the movie Reign of Fire, we're given a great movie but with not enough info. I felt the same way watching this. Vampires and Werewolves at war. Great plot, great story, great acting except for Shane Brolly, but I'll get into that later*. The movie starts off pretty well with a one sided story and action within the first 15 min. So far so good. We then go into a drama between the Vampire community. Things aren't looking too well within the ranks and there is a love quarrel going on that's about annoying as hell. The leader Kraven is in love with Selene and she want's nothing to do with him. I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Although Selene did seek him out, the two main characters Selene and Corvin are ultimately thrown together and have to try to survive against incredible odds.<br/><br/>Corvin is being hunted by the werewolves for a specific reason and is eventually bitten by one. From then on out he's on the run with only Selene to help and explain things to him.<br/><br/>I just want to get this out of the way, Kate Beckinsale is hot. Ok? A complete change from Pearl Harbor. I thought she looked plain in Pearl Harbor, fantastic in this.<br/><br/>Back to the story. Let's see...<br/><br/>What I expected: Vampire powers for one. No mind rolling, no flying, no mind reading, not even between other vampires, nothing like I expected. Sure they can land on their feet and are pretty strong but none of my favorites were shown in this. The werewolves got to show off more powers than the vampires and all they could do was change shapes. There were more gun fights than actual fights showing off the force of both of these unnatural creatures. If any of you have read as much on vampires as I have you would know that vamps are extremely fast, as well as werewolves. If they were going to show these two fighting they would have to slow the film speed down in order for us to watch it. The way the film showed it they were fighting like a normal human would if he was just really strong. The end battle showed the speed of what I expected from everyone. The fact that the vamps were always running from the werewolves when one got too close was just sad. From what I've read a vampire would be equal in strength in hand to hand combat with a werewolf and would also be able to use his mind power to overcome his adversary.<br/><br/>
If you get scared easily and have trouble holding your own in a scary situation, I'd advise you not to watch this.<br/><br/>I just wanted more out of this movie and was just a little bit disappointed at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave it 3 1/2 out of 5.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Also, you know that snippet of sound from the Matrix where the green font is scrolling down the screen and it sounds like violins out of tune? Well they stole it and put it in this...<br/><br/>*Shane Brolly cannot act mad or enraged or anything to this extent. He just sucks at it.<br/><br/>Robbie Gee: I'm glad to see him in another good movie. I first saw him in Snatch and thought he was a good actor. Hope to see more of him like Jason Statham."

Be advised I give away some of the storyline in this post, so if you haven't seen it skip the next two paragraphs.<br/><br/>In the end, I gathered it to be not only ""Romeo & Juliet""-esque, but also to be a bit of an allegory for racism. The werewolves started out as slaves for the vampires, watching over them during the day and whatnot.  One slave fell in love with the slave master's daughter, and a child was conceived (and dubbed an ""abomination""). When said slave master, Viktor, was ""awakened"" from his slumber, he even seemed to talk with a bit of a southern accent. Anyway, slave was whipped, daughter & baby were killed in front of him, the slaves rebel and a war starts when the vampires start hunting them. And lynching them with silver bullets.<br/><br/>And it turns out that they all had a common ancestor, and their condition was a mutated plague virus. So, they were the same, but different.<br/><br/>

I think the name horror/thriller is a little bit exagerated because there's no real ""scare"" factor, just a lot of (good) action. The only things that bothered me in this movie were the little mistakes. The vampire-myth says that vampires have no shadow or reflection whilst in the movie, selene is looking in the mirror... The entire movie there are guns, guns and more guns, with specific bullets to kill the other species ect... but at one fight between a vampire and a wearwolf, the vampire suddenly takes 2 whips.

","Underworld has a few things going for it:<br/><br/> 1. Kate Beckinsale is better looking in black latex than the entire cast of The Matrix. 2. The special effects are quite well done for a movie with a fairly low budget such as this. 3. The basic storyline, handled by professional writers and a seasoned director, would make a great movie.<br/><br/> However...<br/><br/> A. You can barely see either 1 or 2, because everything is shot at night with the lights off and the lens cap of the camera on.  There is a grand total off one shot of daylight, a rip-off of the lock-the-vampire-in-a-room-with-a-hole-in-the-ceiling-so-they-die-at-dawn scene from Interview with the Vampire.  This is the darkest film I've ever scene, and I don't mean in plot or mood-I mean it's like watching a blank screen half the time, with a blur here and there for you to squint at.<br/><br/>B. You know there will be dialogue and chemistry problems when the three credited writers have a grand total of one writing credit between them (an TV episode of the remake of The Outer Limits), and the director is a first timer as well.  The plot, if written down on paper in a summary, would look great-but this screenplay needed a freshing up by somebody who knew what they were doing.  Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman had very little chemistry together, and when they kissed, you could almost hear the writer go, ""Well, the movie's half over, so they kiss now,"" with almost no lead up to this rather important moment.<br/><br/>C. What country is this movie set in?  It looks like Eastern Europe somewhere (since it was filmed in Hungary, this makes sense), but all the characters speak English and all the signs are in English (and the character's accents are all over the planet).  It's clearly not America, because the cop car looks European too, with a long European style license plate (with no country listed on it, of course).  The movie is set in Movieland.<br/><br/>D. There are a grand total of *two* humans that have speaking lines (Micheal Corvin and his coworker at the hospital).  What's worse, other than the crowded subway station at the beginning of the film, there aren't even any human extras-the (very dark) streets are totally deserted-except, again, in the opening scene, where they are very crowded, because the plot demands it. When a group of werewolves tear up an apartment building (the one Michael lives in), followed by Selene shooting a bunch of holes in the floor (the scene in the trailer), you would think the commotion would cause somebody to scream or call the cops or SOMETHING.  There haven't been streets this deserted in an action film since The Avengers movie with Uma ""Will Kill Bill"" Thurman.  Combine C and D, and you get a strong unpleasant sense of artificiality."

But then you have to ask yourself, just what has not been done about vampires in films in the past 15 year?  How many Romeo & Juliet remakes can be made. Somewhere in his grave, Shakesphere is trying to coalesce and scream to screen writers to become origional and to stop using his ideas.  I'm sure if there actually were vampires in this world, they'd be so upset that their kind is getting ripped off as uncaring, overly romanticized euro monsters.

Why oh why do vampires prefer skin tight leather, oh wait, nevermind, Bekinsale was supremely gorgeous in her jump suit.  The story was a little different from what i expected, surprise always a good thing, interesting ideas on evolution of ideas, even for immortals (mankind will forever equate evolution from now on as to how better to kill your enemy i fear), the acting was not horrible, but nor was it award winning, and the sound could have been done a lot better, but saying that, any film w/o Yoda's force at Skywalker Sound has challenges in the accoustic department.

"rparham","5","0","0","11 October 2003"," Emotional dead zone
","One part The Matrix, one part Blade, Underworld is yet another modern take on vampires that bypasses the traditions of the genre (black cloaks, castles, striking male vampires with Eastern European accents) by embracing what are quickly becoming a new set of traditions of the genre (black leather, spandex, low lighting, lots and lots of automatic weapons) and failing to make any of it the least bit compelling.  Underworld is just dead space, a well-polished engine that goes nowhere fast.<br/><br/>The initial premise sounds very promising:  Vampires and werewolves have been engaging in a secret war for thousands of years, with the aristocratic vampires holding the upper hand.  That upper hand are ""Death Dealers,"" elite werewolf-killing assassins, who approach their job without remorse.  Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one the best Death Dealers, living for the thrill of the kill.  Now, however, her world is threatened by a new element:  a human named Michael (Scott Speedman) who the werewolves, referred to in the film as Lycans, have their eye towards, for unknown reasons.  Eager to find the answers, she defies the leader of her coven, Kraven (Shane Brolly), and begins conducting an investigation, finding herself falling in love with Michael.<br/><br/>Despite the possibilities the setting provides, Underworld does very little with it.  The film is basically one long set of shoot outs and fight scenes, all well-choreographed and photographed, but there is no real substance to anything.  It doesn't help that the main characters, Selene and Michael, are completely empty of any development.  They have seemingly less dialogue than the supporting characters, and neither is well-developed by the screenplay at all.  We get a hint of background for Selene, but it is too little too late, and Michael is a cypher, lacking any significant backstory to his character, and barely a handful of scenes, it seems.  The romance of these characters is supposed to draw us in, but I couldn't have cared less. The romance is without an semblance of interest or emotion, leaving the film without an emotional core to hang our interest on.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, especially Michael Sheen as a lead werewolf, are far more interesting than the leads, but the script proves rather thin.  The plot seems rather half-explained, not to mention underdeveloped.  When the big ""surprises"" of the film are revealed, it elicits a ""So? That's it?"" response.  The film is also hampered by Shane Brolly as Kraven, the only character who could classify as a villain.  His performance plays as if he is reading his lines off a teleprompter, and his melodramatics remind you of a high school play.<br/><br/>Director Len Wiseman is a former art director for several major films, including Stargate, and a director of music videos.  His film does indeed look gorgeous, but that is all there is to it.  The meat is missing, it's just the fancy packaging that is left."

","Underworld can only be described as a modern day vampire story bringing together the success of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a few fresh ingredients and producing the intriguing end result of a classic combination of Blade and The Matrix.  The film centres on the conflicting battle between the vampires and the lycans (werewolves.)  The two species have been locked in a pact to destroy one another for hundreds of years and the vicious lycans are planning a final assault to wipe out vampires completely. Naturally it's down to beautiful vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsdale) to save poor student Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who is caught in the crossfire. Being the action film that it is, Underworld has no shortage of flashy direction and skilful battle scenes, although at times I couldn't help wishing the filmmakers had decided to indulge in more martial art fight sequences instead of the bland gunfire stunts, which never really seem to capture the same appeal.  Also for an apparent horror film, there seemed to be a surprising lack of actual horror and the entire film lacked any moments of real suspense.  Even though the plot itself is full of engaging twists, characterization is kept at a minimum and even the obligatory Selene/Michael love plot never really seems to go anywhere.<br/><br/>Overall although the film admittedly is fun to watch and I did enjoy seeing it, I won't be forking out of my money to buy the DVD any time soon."

","This is an idea whose time hadn't yet come and quite possibly, never will. It seems to be a sort of blending of ""West Side Story,"" various Hong Kong kung fu movies and the old Universal horror classics of the thirties and forties.  But it doesn't jell into anything at all.<br/><br/>The film is apparently set in modern times and centers around a blood feud between vampires and werewolves,  or lychin as they are called here.  Not much point in saying more, because there really isn't more, despite what could have been an interesting idea.  Instead, the storyline just seems to be one endless set up for an endless string of chases through dark, narrow tunnels or dark narrow streets.  But the odd thing is that both clans seem to rely on good old fashioned gunfire rather than sucking blood or ripping each others throats out, making the fact that they are supernatural beings almost irrelevant.<br/><br/>It's as if the filmmakers wanted to make a horror movie, but kind of wanted a martial arts movie, too, and yet, just to hedge their bets, decided to make it a gang movie from the hood. So they wound up with nothing, just a sort of low budget Matrix that neither frightens you nor makes you sit up in awe over the special effects.<br/><br/>If the special effects from martial arts films aren't there and the old fashion thrills and chills we expect from vampire movies aren't there, what is there?  The characterizations you might think would spring from some writer's mind if he were going to turn vampires into a centuries old clan complete with mansions and intrigues and waring factions within factions? Nope.  Again, they sort of tried, but not very hard and came away with next to nothing, no characterizations, no interesting sets or costumes or customs.<br/><br/>Lastly, one has to look at the acting.  Scott Speedman, late of ""Felicity,"" plays a human caught in the middle of this horror show ripped from Universal studios one sheets of the thirties.  And since the movie is painfully underwritten, he is given almost nothing to do, something that only emphasizes his rather dower personality.<br/><br/>The real shame, though, is Kate Beckinsale.  This was a vehicle for her and perhaps designed to make her into some kind of rival for Angelina Jolie, who rose above ""Lara Croft"" making it into at least a little something.  But Beckinsale complete misfires here, just as she did in ""Pearl Harbor."" She's proved before she can handle dramatic material and recently was quite good in ""Laurel Canyon."" And perhaps her best performance to date in an American film was in ""Last Days of Disco."" But here she spends an entire movie wearing the exact same expression, something of a cross between annoyed and perplexed, as if she's trying to figure out how she got herself into such a stinker.<br/><br/>Not a good effort from Kate, or the people who put this one together.<br/><br/>Don't bother."

Also everyone was very serious, I mean they took themselves WAYYYY too serious in this.  Having read the comments made, previously, I find it rather worrying that someone who has seen this film feels a need to explain it,this is not an attack on the contributor of the said comments, but on the general lack of ingenuity of the story line itself and the set up of the movie.  I found the whole thing disjointed and at times found myself thinking ""oh for goodness sake get on with it.""  Ms Beckinsale looks cool, and very Carrie Anne Moss (should have copyrighted all those moves NEO and co).

","First of all, I want to get this off my chest. I don't know whether anybody else commented on it, but I don't care. It's ""Lycan"" not ""Lichen""! As in Lycanthrope, which is the particular term for a Shapeshifter that Werewolves are.<br/><br/>Second of all, the underlying story of the way Vampyres and Werewolves came into being is an interesting and novel approach in this day and age of genetic mutations and human genome projects. So is the classic story of love unrequited that is the start of the war between the two species.<br/><br/>The movie fails however, by being more about the visual than substance. When I begin the movie (watched with a theatre full of Seattle Goths), I am willing to suspend disbelief and follow where the director takes me. And moody cinematics do not automatically throw me. However, when the climatic scenes has the whole theatre laughing instead of cheering (especially since this is not a comedy!), something is terribly wrong.<br/><br/>I'll use Viktor as an example. For the whole movie, up to and including his revival, we (the viewers), are quite willing to believe his strength and power. Right until we see it in front of our eyes and find it comical. His end at the end of a sword in some sort of samurai-ninjitsu (was that A-B-F on the PS2 controller?) move and his head sliding off like the climactic scene from the highlander movie (There can be only one, movie that is, all others shall be purged from our collective consciousness...).<br/><br/>Anyway, the true test is whether I felt cheated by paying full price. And I can say, sort of. Will I see it again, no. Will I own it on DVD? Probably not.

","This is one movie where I can frankly describe as simply stupid and dumb, yet the superficial beauty that was presented right before my eyes covered almost all what was there to hide. The point is, despite its being dumb and stupid, the lack of intelligence was made up for by presenting the whole thing with style and energy in such a way that I found it quite enjoyable. I will say that this is a film which has the number of blood and gore inversely proportional to that of the brain cells required to fully appreciate it, but one that still manages to entertain nonetheless.<br/><br/>I've always thought of werewolves as interesting creatures even when I was a child. They didn't scare me because they interested me, and thus I have several story books about them. On the other hand, vampires have always been presented as romantic figures who even appeal to a mere mortal even if they have evil agenda which makes them scary, but they are still interesting. This is how the movie's premise got... nay, grabbed my attention. The good news is that it met some of my expectations. The bad news is that there's a lot more I wanted that wasn't met.<br/><br/>Directed by first-timer Len Wiseman, the movie has no really interesting plot other than a gothic sort of ""Freddy vs. Jason"", where vampires and werewolves (okay, lycans) are to engage each other in a massive battle. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire who dedicates her life into killing lycans - an ancient form of werewolf, a clan of whom her own kin has been at war with for centuries. When she discovers that the lycans are on a track of Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a mortal medical student, she senses danger ahead and awakes Viktor (Bill Nighy), the most powerful vampire of all, to battle Lucian (Michael Sheen), the leader of the lycans. That is the plot, or should we say an excuse to execute action scenes with Kate Beckinsale on a hot leather outfit.<br/><br/>""Underworld"" tantalizes with some interesting ideas, but whatever interesting premise it had was lost along the way. The idea of vampires and werewolves as completely different species was interesting and was a bit like a ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the underworld (which incidentally, was one of the film's working titles). But the filmmakers did not fully develop the idea and character development so viewers don't really have a concrete idea of whom should they root for. Granted, the action scenes were good, but I felt cheated as it seemed the director was creating a plot for it, instead of the other way around. The result is, ""Underworld"" runs out of ideas for what story it has to tell. The final showdown between the vampires and lycans had a visual punch, but was not entirely satisfying.<br/><br/>And the other hype surrounding the film, that Kate Beckinsale stars in an action movie? It's interesting, all right. But so was Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler in a movie. So was Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny deVito, Steven Spielberg, Britney Spears, and John Travolta all crammed in cameos for ""Goldmember"". The point is, a great premise doesn't necessarily mean a great movie. The movie has to work its way around the premise to meet the expectations of the audience. Sure, Kate has an imposing presence onscreen but if that's the sole reason to like this movie, then it would have been better to just stare at the movie's poster for five minutes.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Underworld"" doesn't amount to much. I said it was dumb and stupid, but it occassionally entertained me. Alex Proyas' ""The Crow"" still remains at the top of my list as far as gothic movies are concerned. Not since this late Brandon Lee starrer have a gothic movie been so intellectual and represented a change. But for the meanwhile, while the longing for a film as good as ""The Crow"" continues, ""Underworld"" somehow quenches the thirst... even for just a while.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","""Underworld"" under the direction of Len Wiseman is an action Gothic romance set in the world of the House of the Vampires versus the House of the Lycans. This is novel translation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" in the realm of vampires and werewolves. Oddly enough, this is not much of a stretch of the mythic imagination-- which is a good thing. The strong and stunning Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a Vampire Death Dealer-- a vampire warrior who hunts down and kills Lycans (Werewolves). She is very good at what she does. Her cause is the genocide of the Lycan race. This war has gone on for almost the last 1000 years. In this mythology, the vampires are the aristocracy, and the Lycan are the indentured-- serfs for the vampire during the daylight. Over 500 years ago, the Vampire gained a decisive advantage with the murder of powerful Lycan leader, Lucian (a very good Michael Sheen), at the hands of the current Vampire Leader, Kraven (a somewhat effective Shane Brolly). <br/><br/>In the slick opening action sequence where Selene and her group of warriors battle the Lycan in a public subway station, signatures of the Vampire and the Lycan race are distinguished. The Vampire are lean, strong, quick, smart, and skillful. The Lycan are loyal, cunning, savage, and possessing great brute strength. This is a cultural war. Through the narrative we learn that the Vampire and the Lycan originated from the the same bloodline which were the original immortals, the Corvina's. The Vampire and the Lycan were the result of 2 different viruses infecting the original bloodline. Selene discovers that the target for this Lycan attack is a human, Michael Corvin (a bewildered Scott Speedman). Corvin is of the Corvina bloodline. The legend is that he can merge both bloodlines and be stronger than either Vampire or Lycan. Selene also begins to suspect that Lucian (Sheen) still lives. So she brings back a trusted Vampire Elder, Viktor (Bill Nighy). But in doing so she uncovers her own past betrayal. <br/><br/>Wiseman unveils the Vampire/Lycan mythology with style and expedience. Unlike ""The Matrix Reloaded"", the mythology is not talked to death by it's characters, rather it is unraveled through the plot of finding Corvin, and the attraction between Corvin and Selene-- the star-crossed lovers. The genesis of this war (which does not really give away anything) was a tragic similar romance a 1000 years ago. Wiseman and screen writer Danny McBride, create a fascinating world and an almost timeless tale. Kate Beckinsale in a real departure from previous roles is an awesome action hero. She plays it smart, intense, and charismatic. She performs the action sequences with a sleek, compact, theatric style. And she is always wearing a body formed leather suit-- another good thing. Scott Speedman is solid in support as Michael. The other person who really shines is Michael Sheen as Lucian. There is a sheer kind of joy in Sheen's controlled evil, and dark presence. He is excellent. <br/><br/>Credit Wiseman, Beckinsale, and cast in surprising us with some thoughtful entertainment all in an action movie that puts a new spin on the old Bard's classic star-crossed romance."

The mood is dark and the music is upbeat, and the story is quite good. Kate Beckinsale looks good in black leather, whilst 'Erika' looks even better in more traditional vampire gear. There are so many noteworthy unintentionally funny bits in this that when you see it for a second time, you can't help laughing when you spot them. This is definitely not for feminists. How many times are the women told to 'Leave us' so that the chaps can have a proper chat?! The voice of the big dark werewolf sounded like he'd swallowed ten sheets of sandpaper and washed it down with a jug of rusty nails. I'm sure you can spot the rope attached to the flying 'Michael' in one scene. And those doors....if you thought that Nicole Kidman's job was a difficult one in 'The Others', then she'd have a nightmare if she had to follow behind this lot. I've never seen so many door-opening scenes. I guess the Director likes to create dramatic impact in moving from one set to another, but this was like watching 'Alice in Wonderland' on speed. Kate Beckinsale really does pick them. The diabolically bad 'Pearl harbour'; the tame 'Serendipity'; and the boring 'Golden Bowl'. I've yet to see her in a good movie, but she always looks very nice. I suppose this was never going to be my kind of movie, but it was worth seeing just to count the number of doors being opened. I guess that's the reason behind the shooting the hole in the floor scene. Maybe Kate said to the Director: 'If I've got to open one more of these doors, I'm quitting'.

I could have done without one or two (or five or six) of the gun battles, as more hand-to-claw combat would have been much more satisfying. I'm also a tad tired of seeing characters (vampire or not) dressed in black leather. That whole clich√É¬© has really worn out its welcome. So, for that matter, has the ""gothic, rainy city"" locale.

It was intense, fun, even scary at times. I was also VERY pleased to see such spare use of CGI. Other than the scenes of the werewolves scurrying down walls (since when can werewolves defy gravity) or transforming, most of the werewolf effects are done with make-up and prosthetics.

","Take a dark, gothic world, where vampires have been fighting werewolves (or lychens, as the movie insists on calling them) for hundreds of years and humans are merely bystanders caught in the cross-fire. Throw in the outrageously beautiful Kate Beckinsale dressed in skin-tight PVC, and the potential for spectacular special effects offered by werewolf transformation and vampire/werewolf battles, and surely you have a film that can't fail?<br/><br/>Well, no. Director Wiseman is clearly a fan of genre/comic book movies, but has apparently seen too many of them, as his movie slavishly copies what he liked about these films, and never finds a style of its own. Stylistically it is a blend of The Matrix and Blade, with occasional hints of Batman, and this only serves to highlight the fact that Underworld is not as good as any of these films. (It even directly rips off many shots from The Matrix - check out the aerial shots of rainy streets and down a square stairwell, for example.) The plot is revealed far too slowly, and feels rather muddled, mainly because the minor characters are so one dimensional. It is difficult to tell the lychens from the vampires, let alone the minor vampires from each other.  The plot, such as it is, revolves around the lychens attempts to track down a human (Speedman), Michael Corvin, who carries in his blood some unspecified something which will allow the two races to blend, and the attempts of the vampires to stop him.<br/><br/>Along the way Selene (Beckinsale), a vampire warrior dedicated to slaying lychens, and Michael, who has been bitten by a lychen, fall in love. How or why this happens is never made clear, as Beckinsale and Speedman have zero screen chemistry, and the characters never share a moment that leads you to believe that they have bonded emotionally, so it just feels that the only reason that Selene and Michael have a connection is because the plot requires that they should.<br/><br/>A first glance would lead you to think that archetypal english rose Beckinsale would be miscast as a vampire warrior - and you'd be right. She looks the part (although she has inexplicably borrowed her outfit from Trinity in The Matrix), and she handles the guns ok, but she never changes her expression, and she delivers her lines in a manner that suggests she has just wandered in from a Merchant Ivory film being made next door. Shane Brolly's Kraven can't seem to decide which side of the Atlantic he comes from, as his accent is all over the place, and Speedman and Michael Sheen (as Lucien, the lychens' leader) might as well not have turned up for all the imapct they make. Bill Nighy's vampire leader Viktor is rather fun, but not enough to save the film. The fight scenes aren't cool enough, and the final battle is forgettable.<br/><br/>A good idea, that needed 4 things to make a great film<br/><br/>1. A production designer with the talent to give the film a distinctive look of its own.<br/><br/>2. A director who knows how to do action scenes.<br/><br/>3. A witty and coherent script.<br/><br/>4.

While I understand the need to show violence as intristic to the situation, it contributes very little as the near invincibility of the creatures and their intristic violence makes harder to sympathise and pity their injuries , especially as the narrative is rather stiff - cold as are all the vampires, and thus we are alienated by it.<br/><br/>Showing vampires as cold blooded 'cool' creatures as seems to be the current fashion is contradictory to all the underlying emotion - which was so often suggested but ultimately underdeveloped.<br/><br/>This is one movie where excessive styleization and a great concousness of genre stereotypes manages to ruin the potential held in a good story, script and actors."

"cyberc0y0te","8","0","0","30 September 2003"," A fun movie
","I'm absolutely amazed at the negative criticism this film is getting. The points that are spat upon by the bad reviews are best addressed by another review I saw above, but a short summary is included herein anyway. I think the biggest problems folks have with this movie is their predetermined expectations versus what it really is.<br/><br/>This is an action movie, through and through. Instead of gun slinging madmen and unerring good guys you've got Vampires and Werewolves. They make the gray areas some films try to create with questionable cops and criminals with some good intentions even more gray by using two 'evils' as the characters. Maybe that's what drove these critics 'batty', the fact that who is in the right is entirely up to the viewer, the film makers haven't really chosen a side, they merely show the story from a choice few perspectives.<br/><br/>Also, just pretend you don't 'know' anything about werewolves or vampires when you go into the film. These are not classic renditions of the two creatures as presented in other books or films, they are new angles on both, and you'll have to watch the whole movie to get the over all truth behind their legends. I've seen people complain that vampires don't get to turn into bats and that they cast reflections...so? This is not Dracula or Blade, this is Underworld. It is it's own story. With some simple dialogue the entire history, both myth and 'real', is set for the audience. If you never heard of either creature the movie explains what they are to you within the parameters of the film.<br/><br/>The action sequences are a treat, the unbelievable stunts pulled off by the characters easily acceptable as they are far from human. In MI II or Charlie's Angels it's just silly or an insult to your intelligence as the characters are supposed to be 'real'. These are not humans and the wild line work mixes well within the physical limitations that are set for them.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue is not any worse than any other action yarn, actually sitting much higher in my eyes than performances in embarassingly poorly acted blockbusters like 'Spider-Man'. I found the plot twists well done, and the slight love story which is a reflection of one of the story's plot bases well done.<br/><br/>Another thing that impressed me about the movie was the lack of cartoonish CGI effects. SpiderMan, Hulk, Blade, even sometimes the Star Wars flicks had some computer generated character animations that were so poor one wondered why they were included. Maybe because they were on a limited budget the Underworld producers did more of the work 'the old fashioned way', and it came off well.<br/><br/>If you expect twelve Oscar nominations from every movie you see, then don't bother. If you want a fun ride with well done photography, a thumping soundtrack (David Bowie's in there!), near non-stop action, and bestial werewolves that fear next to no other denizens of the night, then check it out. Oh, the story was pretty good too."

The sets were brilliant - Gotham City before Joel Schumacher jazzed it up - dark, rain-filled, huge old buildings and narrow streets.  The plot was surprisingly complex for an action film: I had to concentrate to keep up: a lot of mythic elements and some interesting twists.  Kate Beckinsale was perfect for the role: slim, sexy and with an attitude.  Just a pity all we really saw of her was her face and occasionally neck and shoulders!  I wasn't expecting to see Bill Nighy as the head vampire, being more used to his domestic dramas on UK TV - but he was good.<br/><br/>On the negative side, too much action, too much violence, and too little dialogue.  And too geared to a sequel.  But generally well worth watching!"

","I was not rabidly excited about this movie before it came out, but I was interested in seeing it as a horror/action/romantic film. After seeing it I can say...What a Disappointment! The story is unoriginal, the script is melodramatic, the effects are not done well, and even the people I've talked to who like it more than I admit it was, in a word, ""Cheesy.""<br/><br/>All of it's flaws can be overcome with a good execution. Lack of storyline can be made up for with brilliant performances of the material available, a low budget can be made up for with clever execution, and something redundant can  be given a new spin, or a different feel. Underworld had none of this either to save it. The lycan effects, although much better than 'An American Werewolf in Paris', were not all that great as they looked in the trailer, and they were also underutilized. The rest of the effects and fights felt like Matrix Rehashed. The story, what there was of it, was not only not original, but it made no effort to be, which disappointed me. Perhaps biggest in my complaints is the lack of attention given to any development of the werewolves, either as respectable villans or anything more than big furry primitives. It was also scripted like a Halloween episode of 'Days of Our Lives'.  As for acting, several people have remarked to me that their favorite character was Kate Beckinsale's costume. These actors have all done good work in other films, they just don't have a lot to go on in this movie. If you are looking for an over sexualized, weak storied  action movie that requires no thought whatsoever but tries to utilize high concepts of love and equality so you can feel intellectual while you watch Beckinsale bounce around shooting the scenery and reciting lines that belong in a 14 year old's diary, this is the film for you!! Otherwise, skip it."

","This movie had a few rough edges in the plot, but still gave good entertainment. I liked this movie immensely, it reminded me of the vampire books that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has written. If you have not read any of her books and you like vampire stories I recommend you look for her books. The movie was a little bit too gory for my taste, but the fighting choreography made up for that. The actors/actresses performances were very well done and the casting was perfect for each character. The effects could have been slightly better, but were still good. The darkness and rain in the movie really set the mood of the movie. This was one of the best movies I've seen this year. Also one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen. The camera angles were perfect. It was easy to feel like I was in the movie.

","When I first saw the preview for this movie I was very excited. I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy genres, and the thought of vampires fighting with werewolves was very appealing (not to mention a very sexy Kate Beckinsale in very sexy tight leather). I was not at all disappointed with this movie, but I was left with a sense of, ""No, that can't be the end of the movie."" I feel there were too many loose ends to tie up, and granted they were shooting for a sequel, they could have done more to keep me from hanging.<br/><br/>For those people who feel this is a cheap rip-off of The Matrix, I feel sorry for you. If you are going to compare every sci-fi movie against The Matrix, you will not enjoy many movies. The Matrix was a phenomenon, and will not likely be challenged for entertainment value any time soon. However, if you go into this movie and just try and enjoy yourself, you will have a nice time.<br/><br/>*Possible spoilers* I enjoy vampire films, and I truly enjoyed this one. Although werewolves are also very cool, the appeal of vampires is much greater for me. It is refreshing to see some new ideas and concepts in vampire lore. I do think Viktor should have sent Selene and Micheal fleeing though, and returned in the sequel. Viktor was the epitome of a good vampire: entirely evil, ruthless, without remorse. I would have enjoyed seeing him in the sequel. I'd say this is a solid 4 star movie (out of 5 of course)."

It had a great blend of action, horror and visual effects, with the beautiful Kate Beckinsale as bonus.<br/><br/>Underworld was easily far better than most of the Summer 2003 releases: - Matrix Reloaded (not bad, but really not that good) - Extraordinary League of Gentlemen (fell way short of its potential) - Charlie's Angels (so much candy I got a toothache) - The Hulk (story aims for serious, progressively gets stupider)<br/><br/>If you like the Blade movies you should find this one enjoyable as well."

","This isn't much of a movie.  Nothing too innovative.  Special effects are mediocre.<br/><br/>The premise doesn't make much sense, but suspending belief is all part of the game for horror fans.  Not a whole lot made much sense, actually, but this movie put more premium on action than logic.  Unfortunately, even the action was too phony. The many (many) gun battles were bizarre.  When you've got 4 guys with automatic weapons blasting at somebody six feet away, you'd expect them to hit the target once in a while. Plus, since the wolfies developed some pretty effective vampire bullets, it didn't make a lot of sense for them to spend so much time biting and howling.  Good fun for them, I am sure, but a nice ultraviolet bullet between the eyes would've been much more practical.  Nonetheless, they managed to rip apart a goodly number of vampires as silver bullets ripped into their fuzzy little hides.  As I surveyed the carnage, it became apparent that immortality is not a big impediment to dying.<br/><br/>
The movie is obviously setting up one or more sequels.  They will stink, too. Ironically, the thought of a second one is scarier than seeing the first one.<br/><br/>As it was, I left the movie feeling drained.  Drained of money.<br/><br/>I'll give this a six just because it didn't drain me of lunch (if you know what I mean)."

","Today, I went to see this movie, lured by its mix of romance and horror. Alas,despite its exciting sequences, including the opening shot, "" Underworld. "" is a movie which is unable to maintain its balance; there is never a explanation of why Selene wears leather or why Erika, Selene's rival, is not as aggressive as one might expect in a love triangle since their chieftain, Kraven, desires Selene more than her. Baskindale is pretty good as the vampire warrior Selene; like Catherine Anne-Moss(Matrix), she makes her performance the focus of the film. In fact, one of the most surprising things about this film is the "" mortality "" of the Vampires; they do not change into bats, hypnotize people or wear capes, the traits of vampire lore. Selene's black leather outfit, despite its seductive look, does enable her to blend in with the humans, track down Lycans, and find the human doctor who is linked to the eternal war between the two races of monsters. Overall, this movie is a good draw, but only if you are familar with the Hammer Dracula films. Otherwise, you just might want to come for Kate Baskindale, a very sexy and impressive actress.( Can't wait to see her in Van Halsing.)"

","Believable.  Go into this film with an open mind and you'll enjoy every minute of it.  Is it the greatest movie of all time?  No.  Is it one of the best vampire movies ever put to the screen?  I say ""Yes!"".<br/><br/>
What makes this film refreshing is the perspective of the story.  You may not realize while watching, but there is very little ""human"" involvement in the story.  Because of this, the characters involved become more ""human"" and their story becomes more believable.<br/><br/>Particularly believable is the embedded explanation of how vampires and werewolfs came to exist.  Backing the modern era conflict with those historical facts is important to the plot; it is the foundation on which the story is built.<br/><br/>Another huge aspect of the film that leads to believability is that the characters are free to express emotions.  Vampires that cry, werewolfs that grieve -- anger, vengence, love, integrity, all contribute to making the ""monsters"" more ""human"".<br/><br/>C'mon, to say Kate Beckinsale is ""hot"" in this film is an insult.  Kate is absolutely sizzling!  The role of Selene is so contradictory to anything that Kate has done thus far.  The fact that this was not a stereotypical role for her, made Selene a flawless character.<br/><br/>Twists in the storyline will keep you intellectually challenged. What you believe at the start, you will challenge yourself to believe midway through -- your attachment to the character Lucian will prove this to be true.<br/><br/>
Don't get hung up on spoilers.  So vampires aren't supposed to be able to cast a reflection. Says who? Humans?  Well humans didn't know there was an unground battle raging between to non-existent species for centuries.  The casting of a reflection (Selene in the mirror) is important to the story. For you hardcore vampire enthusiasts, let the story challenge your beliefs and accept that perhaps things are not as you have come to believe.<br/><br/>
Let it go and enjoy the film for what it is -- a high impact, action filled, Romeo and Juliet-ish, Matrix-like, portrayal of humanity from a non-human perspective."

"edwardlryan","Null","0","0","28 September 2003"," Style over Substance works for Underworld
","Underworld has great style. From the film stock used, to the lighting and wardrobe, it just looks cool.<br/><br/>Also, hearing and seeing Kate Beckinsale as our lead ""death dealer"" doesn't hurt matters. She looks and sounds amazing, and you'll be itching just for another opportunity to get a glimpse.<br/><br/>The story is fairly trite and typical, with lore and history thrown in to justify character actions; some of the interchanges assume knowledge we, the audience, just don't have, and other interchanges assume feelings the characters don't exhibit -- except in that forced ""we're supposed to kiss in this scene"" sort of way. *Thankfully* the film doesn't devolve down this spiral, but it does succumb to the pull on occasion.<br/><br/>Editing is generally tight, with good shot composition, but the occasional, really embarrassing edit here and there -- both film and sound edit. One such scene hits about 20 minutes into the movie. It only lasts about 30 seconds, but definitely spoils the ""reality stops here"" line when you walk in the theatre.<br/><br/>Beckinsale delivers a solid performance. She's perfect for this role -- sexy, strong, empathetic and quite impressive.  Even in the unreality, you believe her. Michael Sheen as Lucian also delivers an excellent performance. Kudos also to Bill Nighy as Viktor, creating a strongly stoic, traditional Vampire Lord we expect (not like the wimpy lord in Blade 2).<br/><br/>Scott Speedman as Michael Corvin was forgettable...really, anyone could've done this role...<br/><br/>Except the truly noteworthy Shane Brolly, as Kraven. Brolly so completely overacts the part of Kraven that his presence was laughable. Seriously. From his first scene, it was so terribly apparent Brolly belonged in an acting class -- and NOT on film. Kraven was sorely miscast.<br/><br/>All in all, Underworld is a fun ride. If you like vampires, the lore, the look of the film, and Beckinsale (and if you don't, there's something wrong with you), you'll enjoy this flick even though it is style over substance. Let's hope director Len Wiseman can pull together a tighter story in the proposed sequel(s), and really make this a worthwhile franchise."
"greenejam","9","0","0","27 September 2003"," A bit lacking, but stylish and fun
","Well, I was super-hyed for this movie, so I was glad it wasn't TOO much of a letdown... *cough cough* like ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico""... worst movie ever *cough cough*.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale is the hot'n'sexy Deathdealer (although she looked better in Serendipity... unless you're into Goth chicks), Selene. Very stylish, very stylish.<br/><br/>Not sure whether it was intended or not, but I honestly had no idea who was on which side in that first shootout until later on (minus Beckinsale being a Vampyre, of course). This kinda disappointed me as I like to know what the Hell is going on *cough cough* ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" fails again *cough cough*.<br/><br/>So anyway, I liked Beckinsale. She does a good acting job. Scott Speedman was... eh... subpar, as you can pretty much always expect from a TV actor trying to make the leap into film these days. Their romance was TOTALLY underplayed (hey, much like Kevin Smith, I'm a sucker for chick flicks).<br/><br/>In one comment, I saw a point brought up about Michael still not being able to beatdown Viktor after becoming the ""√ºber-powerful"" hybrid Lycan-Vampyre, but this was because he did not obtain the blood of the Ancient Ones like Lucian had planned (thus why he had the current ruling Elder Vampyre, Amelia, drained of her blood on the train). Selene's blood was of MUCH weaker potency as she was not a purebred Vampyre.<br/><br/>I found the part of the plot relating to the Vampyre Elders rather fascinating, so I which they would've developed it more. Viktor TOTALLY reminded me of Kain from ""The Legacy of Kain"" games. If you haven't played these games and have a game system that can play all of them (i.e. PS2), I highly recommend them. They're awesome.<br/><br/>So, uhh, to summarize, I liked the movie a pretty good deal. It basically just needed at least one part (romance, history, etc.) of it to be developed upon more to give the movie more of a definitive stance on something. Without such, it just seemed a little weak in overall direction.<br/><br/>Anyway... a fun flick. 8/10 for style and concept, albeit underdeveloped."

","Skin-tight PVC suits and long leather coats are back in fashion in this stylish, gory and action-packed vampire vs werewolf horror flick starring Kate Beckinsale, Bill Nighy and Scott Speedman.<br/><br/>Perched upon the roof of a gothic-looking building in an unnamed city, Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire ""death dealer"" who hunts lycans (that's werewolves to you and me) in an age-old feud between the two species which has been raging for hundreds of years. The film moves quickly into top gear, and within minutes of being provided with this information from a rather helpful voiceover, the action immediately takes off in an extended sub-way shootout involving Beckinsale, werewolves and a hapless human called Michael in the form of Speedman.<br/><br/>In between much muttering concerning covenants, covens and ""awakenings"", we slowly learn that Speedman is the descendant of some common ancestor between vampires and werewolves, and that his blood is the key to uniting the bloodline and ending the bitter feud between the two species. What follows is an endless series of gun battles and an orgy of mindless violence in some very dark places, as the two warring factions battle to gain control of Speedman and his precious blood. But as the body count begins to rise don't expect to see many wooden stakes and silver bullets in this modern day horror flick. We've moved on since the days of Hammer Horror stars Cushing and Lee, and bullets filled with liquid ultraviolet light and silver nitrate are conveniently provided by director Len Wiseman to dispatch the hordes of vampire and werewolf cannon fodder required for the many bloody action sequences. Well, it's more efficient or didn't you know that?<br/><br/>What you probably did know, but which Wiseman forgot or just plain ignored, is that vampires cast no reflection, and yet there are several scenes where they clearly do so. Maybe it was a gaffe. Or maybe Wiseman just didn't care. Quite frankly you won't care either, as the near relentless action makes the 121 minute running time simply fly by, and is more than sufficient to compensate for this minor deviation from vampire lore, and the other obvious imperfections in the film.<br/><br/>Plotwise, there's also a tepid, and entirely predictable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale, which seems strangely out of place amongst the unrelenting carnage and testosterone-charged atmosphere of the largely male supporting cast. However, given the uncharismatic performances of the two stars, mercifully this is not pursued. The non-stop action effectively puts paid to any real suspense, but there are sufficient twists and turns in the plot to maintain interest right up to the end, and the final good vs evil showdown between Speedman and the vampire leader, Viktor (Bill Nighy).<br/><br/>Thankfully for a horror flick the special effects are well up to par, and the bone-crunching werewolf transformation sequences compare favourably to those seen in An American Werewolf in London. For added good measure we also get to see inside a body during the werewolf transformation - an interesting, yet revolting novelty, all the more so for the rather disgusting, stomach-churning noises which accompany this process.<br/><br/>Beckinsale (perhaps best known for her work in Pearl Harbor) wears her skin-tight suit well enough, but on joining the ranks of the undead seems to have forgotten how to act, and gives a performance so wooden that you could make a dining table and chairs out of it and still have plenty of timber to spare. If she wants to make the Hollywood A list this is not the way to do it. Speedman is hugely disappointing and not at all convincing in a rather meaty role which gave him a great opportunity to really shine. He clearly lacks the screen presence to take the male lead, and on this performance seems destined to remain as a Hollywood also-ran for some time to come.<br/><br/>On the plus side Shane Brolly hams it up nicely as the traitorous, vampire big-whig Kraven, while Beckinsale's former off-screen boyfriend Michael Sheen enthusiastically gives his all as Lucian, the wild-eyed, messianic leader of the werewolves. Nighy, looking like a shrivelled prune, rasps and wheezes his way through his lines but, given the weight of makeup he was obviously wearing, makes a decent job of playing the arch baddie in the film, and he clearly takes the acting honours from a largely undistinguished cast which has a strong Hollywood B list look and feel.<br/><br/>Lacking the genuine horror in the vampire movie Near Dark, and with acting as wooden as it gets without sprouting roots, Underworld is nevertheless an entertaining horror flick and well worth a bag of popcorn and a bottle of your favourite fizzy to wash it down with. The teeth are nice, white and very sharp. The female vampires look pretty enough - just like Hollywood likes them, the action is unrelenting and gory, and the werewolf transformation sequences are far better than you might expect from a film with only a $20 million price tag. If this movie sounds like your kind of thing then there is even more good news - a satisfying climatic battle is followed by a closing sequence and narration from Beckinsale which strongly suggests a sequel is already on the drawing board. Silver nitrate suppliers everywhere must be rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of it."

","""¬ÖI've never looked back,"" says Selene, the protagonist of this story when explaining the origins of who she is at present. The same could be said about the mood of 'Underworld.' Almost right away, it hooks the viewer with action and proceeds to further examining the current situation of the story, taking little-to-no time for humor and other distractions while pursuing its goal -- which is to present the audience with a very engaging movie. It's a mission that's very much successful. As the film progresses, we watch Selene bust some skill as she hunts, investigates, and narrates, all while fighting on the side of her fellow vampires in the (seeming) final days of a very long conflict between them and the lycans (a clipped form of lycanthrope -- or werewolf). She's a highly determined and highly aware soldier who's got the attention of several members of her kind, and gradually gains the sympathy of the viewer by staying logically open-minded and having a heart that seemingly defies her cold exterior -- to an extent anyway. Watching Kate Beckinsale (who gives a great performance) long enough in this movie, it becomes kind of funny and weird to remember that this is the same woman who once played the far different Ethel in 'Royal Deceit.'<br/><br/>But it's not all about action, nor is it all about Selene. Between the ambitious Kraven, legendary Viktor, reserved Michael, and mysterious Lucian, there are several diverse are entertaining personalities in this story, and when one character claims to have taken a lot but given so much more, it serves as an example of the self-delusional excuses one can always find to defend selfishness -- or in other words, an example of how the vampires and lycans can't entirely escape their humanity.<br/><br/>There are several others. As the background plot begins intermingling with hints dropped in the foreground, 'Underworld' reveals itself as a fairly emotional picture, with several much-appreciated close-ups of Beckinsale's dark and brooding good looks (and when considering those, it's rather charming to recall that she and the director reportedly became romantically involved).<br/><br/>Here's the thing about the ending: in films, the anticlimax is something that's perfectly respectable if the story isn't over when the movie is. But in the case of 'Underworld,' it's a little difficult to know how to feel about this, since there's no guarantee that the tale will get a chance to continue (Hollywood economics, of course, will probably always come first). Hopefully the rumors of a sequel or two are true, though. This is a mix of quality storytelling and cool special effects that's very deserving of a follow-up."

Underworld shows us exactly how bad the Matrix might have been.  There isn't a single compelling person, event, or idea in this movie. Not one.  It's almost baffling - it's marketed toward the gothy set, but contains no dark dialogue at all.  The firefights are listless - they're almost like filler between... nothing.  The acting is beyond awful - Carrot Top could have done a better job than almost anyone who appeared in this wreck.  God - I hate it when I agree with critics, but this movie just SUCKED.<br/><br/>It was almost as if someone had dared the writers/director to create a movie entirely based on previous films, BUT without using a single compelling actor, or topic, or anything.  It wasn't even entertainment - I LOVE mindless garbage movies, but the effects in this movie were minimal at best and boring at worst.  I YAWNED THREE TIMES DURING THE FILM.  I wasn't tired. It was that bad.<br/><br/>I rated it a 5, since of course there were a few special effects, including the UV bullets that kill vampires.  They used this effect ONCE.  I swear to god - they showed this effect 3 minutes into the movie, and then forgot about it.  I saw several people in the theater giving the screen the finger after the movie had ended.  That's pretty much how it left you feeling.<br/><br/>Do not see this film.  It will fail any minimal expectation that you set for it.  It's the first time ever that I've wanted a refund after a movie. Well, second - I was forced to see Star Trek V once..."

","Yet another action based vampire movie.  Yet again, enjoyable to watch but very shallow in execution.  Yet again, a new director who shows promise in being able to pull a professional film together but who's ability to direct is obviously immature.<br/><br/>I just read Roger Ebert's review and he very accurately likened Underworld to a porno.  While there is no sex to speak of.. and hardly an ounce of eroticism (save the 'gothic requisite' abundance of tight fitting leather), the movie flows like a porno in many respects.  Ebert left the analogy at the opening and closing of doors, but I believe much more was implied. The dialog is minimal and purposeful.. like a porno's.  The action is abundant and full of cliche.. like a porno's.  The scenes between action are merely showcases for the characters to posture themselves as objects that we should feel drawn towards.. you guessed it.. just like those of a porno.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but unfortunately for this film, an otherwise half decent story is drown out by too much action, a tad too much posturing, and way too little characterization.<br/><br/>Ebert managed to get a key element of the plot completely wrong (did he walk out halfway into the film?  seems like it) so I'll try not to harp on his other criticisms.  If he'd paid attention he might have awarded this flick another half star.<br/><br/>The use of CGI in Underworld seemed constrained to advancing the story line by showing us the internal transformations of creatures into and out of their human forms, and moves such as impossible jumps and creatures running on walls.  Many of the scenes could have been made more cheaply with loads of CGI instead of live action costumes and I applaud the move by the director/producers to keep as much live action in front of the camera.<br/><br/>If poor acting was this flick's worst bramble, Shane Brolly (Kraven) was it's biggest thorn.  I kept expecting to see some inner conflict that might round out his character and allow the audience to second guess his next move.. but from the very first word out of his mouth, to the last, we know he's the antagonist Kate Beckinsale (Selene) will need to keep her eye on. A good villain is someone the audience can mutually feel at odds with and understand... we never understand Kraven.  We get a hint at his motives, but they're too briefly bothered with for us to give him any consideration.<br/><br/>The short of it is: were they to make a special edition of this film.. cut out some of the gratuitous action (yes, there was too much for even an action flick) and insert some well acted dialog and character development.. they might have a cult classic on their hands.  As it is.. it's merely a shallow summer movie wearing goth clothes.  Speaking of.. Selene's character is enough to make even a preppy dude like myself wish he had been lost in the goth crowd (maybe some of the posturing worked it's magic on me).<br/><br/>The attempts at making suspenseful, horror film-like scares were disappointing.. or maybe I'm just jaded.. several did incite some laughter from me though.  Seemed like whenever things got quiet you could count to 5 (not unlike the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch) and something with fangs would hop into view accompanied by a very loud noise.  I couldn't make a scary movie if my life depended on it.. so I digress.<br/><br/>I give it 6.5 stars out of 10 for the excellent costumes, makeup (including the very sexy teeth), set design, use of both a Maserati and Bentley (hard driven, too), lots of eye and ear candy and intriguing storyline.  It loses massive points for the overdone action scenes (mostly the finale), poor acting and lack of character development.<br/><br/>I've been reading a few user reviews and keep seeing Matrix comparisons. That's funny, because the Matrix's best scenes were copied from a vampire action film.  You'd think the Matrix was the only movie many of these folks had ever seen.  If the Matrix had never been made, I believe this movie would have ended up very much the same.<br/><br/>**spoilers**<br/><br/>An interesting bit of trivia actually.  The name Selene is from a Greek word meaning 'moon'.  This brings about an interesting fateful dynamic when you consider Scott Speedman(Michael Corvin)'s ability to be 'struck' by her as quickly as the full moon itself.<br/><br/>With the realization that the Lycan were once slaves/daytime-guardians to the vampires, did anyone else find it a little over the top when the silver studded bullwhips (wielded by a lithe white vampire) were used on none other than a muscular black man (errr.. werewolf)?  I had flashbacks to Kunta Kinte learning his name.<br/><br/>Plot hole...?  UV light bothers/kills the Vampires and not the Lycan.. why on earth didn't the Lycan use a few readily available gro-lites here and there in their ""den""?  I can't think of a better security system against vampires.<br/><br/>Ohh.. Has anyone yet mentioned how good Kate Beckinsale looks in this film?"
"filmbuff-36","5","0","0","25 September 2003"," Action monster movie with lots going on, but nothing happening
","Is it just me, or are vampires not  allowed to be monsters anymore at the cineplex? Tortured souls longing for some form of salvation? Yeah. Entrepreneurs with an supernatural edge over the competition? Sure. Members of extended clans and families that spawn across the ages, hidden in secrecy in order to survive? Absolutely.<br/><br/>But vicious, bloodthirsty demons who seek to corrupt the world with cheap promises of pleasure and who feed off the fear of others? Not likely. I suppose we have the success of Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"" series to thank/blame for this, and with it the new mind set that being a vampire, although having a few drawbacks, is still pretty cool.<br/><br/>Although it never verbally acknowledges this, that statement seems to be present in every frame of ""Underworld."" Vampires live lives of exorbitant wealth in gothic mansions, wearing full body leather suits and driving fast Mercedes Benzes. No more lurking in drafty castles for these creatures of the night -- if it doesn't have a multi-million dollar ballroom full of vampires seemingly just lounging around all day, then it can't be home.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a member of a special class of vampires known as ""Death Dealers"" whose job is to hunt down and terminate werewolves with extreme prejudice. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting for centuries it seems, and Selene enjoys her job of taking out the competition. Fighting has severely decimated the werewolf ranks, which is fortunate since the time is drawing near to reawaken a noble vampire who will seemingly bring about the final destruction of the werewolf race.<br/><br/>Trouble soon arises however when Selene discovers her lupine enemies are shadowing a seemingly normal human, hospital intern Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). She soon intervenes, taking Michael hostage after saving him from the werewolf's leader Lucian, who is supposed to be dead. Selene's quest to discover the truth about Michael's role in the werewolf plot places some of her already shady superiors in an even more suspicious light, and puts both Selene and Michael in serious danger.<br/><br/>Whoa! Catch all that? Don't worry, you won't have to worry about plot all that much. What people really came to see is Selene whipping out dual 9 mm automatics and emptying countless silver-tipped rounds into her werewolf adversaries, which happens in abundance in this film. The werewolves also pack heat that bears ammunition with concentrated ultraviolet light inside, and since vampires and sunlight don't mix...<br/><br/>For those hoping for a film featuring werewolf/vampire hand-to-hand combat, however, prepare to be disappointed. The modern day Nosferatus and wolfmen are all trigger happy gunman, relying mostly on firepower instead of brute strength to do battle.<br/><br/>That perhaps speaks the most about ""Underworld"" and films of its kind. This is not a horror film, rather it's an action movie with monsters in it. There are definitely some gross werewolf attacks with horrific mutilations and the like, and the monsters definitely look intimidating, but scary? Hardly -- and for a supposed horror film that can be the unkindest cut of all.<br/><br/>""Underworld"" is a comic book style movie heavy in the film noir, with all the characters inhabiting some unnamed gothic city shrouded in darkness and gloom. It looks like the filmmakers watched ""Blade Runner"" and ""Dark City"" numerous times prior to filming, and the result is a story that takes place in a murky and depressing universe where happiness seems neither available nor desired.<br/><br/>Beckinsale makes a sexy femme fatale but she can't quite bring her character Selene to life. She's all presence but no sympathy; a woman trying to invoke all the cool scenes from ""The Matrix"" while lacking the human core. Speedman also goes through the motions as Michael, a man thrust into the middle of a centuries-old blood feud and forced to just nod in agreement or turn his head away in disgust whenever some other character on screen speaks. His purpose in the film is only cursory. He's a living MacGuffin for the vampires and werewolves to fight over.<br/><br/>First time director Len Wiseman films ""Underworld"" like a music video, with stylish slow motion shootouts, pulsating generic techno music and wardrobes seemingly thrown together from an Armani fashion show. The result is too much leather, gun blasts and needless eye candy for the brain to comprehend.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie is two hours of unappealing characters snarling and fighting over who should rule a dreary and lifeless world -- something that might work as a video game scenario, but throw it up on the big screen and the pointlessness of the whole enterprise shines like a beacon.<br/><br/>This movie a least proves that bloodsuckers and lycanthropes are still staples of the horror genre, but I suggest you watch ""Near Dark"" or ""The Howling"" if you want to see novel presentations of the vampire and werewolf communities. Here they're just members of rival gangs fighting over turf, with very little imagination thrown in to make the story unique or interesting.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 stars. The movie is all dressed up with nowhere to go."

","Beautiful sets and cinematography, directed with an in-your-face directness that lends it that RUN, LOLA, RUN quality. Like the lesser THE BREED, UNDERWORLD is flash and sizzle and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. (It's good, from time to time, to be able to just sit back and relax and enjoy the ride. Even if you already know where you're going.) Vampires and werewolves have never looked so good. (Well, there WAS Ingrid Pitt in THE HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD and THE VAMPIRE LOVERS and...) The one and only thing I'll harp on is the ""history"" between vampires and werewolves.

","Well, what's good about ""Underworld""?  The direction is solid, the cinematography is excellent, and the sets and costumes are well-conceived. This is basically glossy pulp that doesn't pretend to be more than it really is; filled with visual flourishes (borrowed from ""The Matrix,"" a movie I hated), it doesn't make too many worthy demands of the viewer to keep up with the story (a war between vampires and werewolves, and the possible cross-breeding of the two), which is fine by me.  The acting meets the standards of the genre, and the dialogue--as silly as it sometimes is--is kept to exposition and exclamation.  The CGI transformation effects are wisely excuted partly in shadow or darkness, making them somewhat effective. However, after the first two exceptionally strong acts (where I was fully prepared to dub this film the most fun I'd had since seeing ""Ghosts of Mars"" in the theater), ""Underworld"" devolves into a final sequence in which the film's credibility is worn thin, as vampires and werewolves run down corridors firing weapons in every direction, so much so that I found myself forgetting what their actual objective was.  Basically, the movie could've been 90 minutes and a cult masterpiece, but at two full hours, it's simply overextends its welcome.<br/><br/>6/10"

","For those of us who have long watched and loved vampire movies, from the sublime to the ridiculous, now we have Underworld.  It seems to have been shot entirely in Hungary, or otherwise eastern european location, giving it a lovely, gothic look, as well as a neutral setting. (My only gripe here would be the product placement for Bacardi! How does that fit in with this crazy flick?)<br/><br/>A convoluted plot posing vampires against werewolves in an eternal battle between races of immortals greets us here.  The action is fairly well staged, and the VFX, while maybe a little cheaper than what some of us are used to, nevertheless gives the movie a style and look that many more expensive pictures miss out on.  The acting is a little ropey sometimes, as is the slightly bonkers script, but overall the movie works - and Beckinsale holds things together when it seems all is lost.<br/><br/>If you like Blade, Buffy and The Matrix, then this is a fine way to spend the evening.

","Note:  This movie may contain spoilers so you have been warned.-<br/><br/>Underworld in my opinion is one of the most original movie up to a certain point that I have ever seen.  Most of the time that two of the most immortal beings (vampires and werewolves) usually destroy humans.  No so in this action-filled movie that has Kate Beckinsale who plays a warrior vampire who must destroy the werewolves who supposely killed off her family.<br/><br/>Miss Beckinsale must protect a supposely human (Scott Speedman) who is one of her enemies, a werewolf.  During this time frame she has feelings for him and which turn brings a manhunt to capture Mr. Speedman from Miss Beckinsale character's enemies.<br/><br/>This movie from the very beginning has some good points.  One such good points that racism is everywhere even though they may look human they are truly not because of their differences of the two clans.  Another good point is that Mr. Len Wiseman brings everything on the table with so much action as well as drama as Miss Beckinsale character tries her best not to slay the person who is the enemy but also saved her life.<br/><br/>This movie has already made its budget and a possible sequel is in the works.

","I was excited about this movie when I first saw the previews, from what I had seen, the action sequences appeared to be quite interesting and I have always been enthralled with vampires and werewolves, especially them battling it out.  I usually do not expect much from movies from this genre nowadays, but I would have been a lot more dissapointed by the quality had a I not read some rottentomatoes reviews previously.  Did not make me not want to watch the movie, but I took it with a grain of salt so to speak.  Now I enjoyed the movie, but I was not exactly 100 percent sober, so that may have helped me through it somewhat, but I am sure I would have enjoyed it at least minorly otherwise.  But I went in there to see an action, vampire versus werewolf type thiing and that is what I got.<br/><br/>But the acting, EVERYBODY'S acting was horrible.  Kate Beckinsale's fans seem to want to exclude her, or think her looks make up for the lack of talent she displayed in this film.  Now I am not saying she is not a good actress, but she does not have the capacity to play a somber, lonely, renegade vampire well, she, just like EVERYBODY else in the movie were doing some serious overacting.  Especially Kraven.  At first I was just annoyed, but eventually I just had to laugh at how bad of an actor he was, and how he acted the exact same in every scene, there was no flexibility in his ""talent"".  Terrible.  Lucien at first was not doing too well either, overacting it up, but he seemed to warm up to the role towards the end, and Viktor, for the same amount of time he was on screen, did a good job as well in my opinion.<br/><br/>The fight scenes had some cool parts, but it also had some really contrived cheesy parts.  I cannot even begin to explain how cheesy some of the stuff was, you just had to see it.  I was annoyed by how many vampires wanted to take on a werewolf head to head, unarmed.  They actually thought they had a chance.  In the first fight scene, the vampire sits there hissing and hissing, while the changed werewolf is growling and looking much more sinister.  I was expecting the vampire to display some sort of strength, even if the werewolf is physically superior, the vampire should still be able to hold his own for awhile.  And this is what any viewer would think, considering the vampires absolutely annoying, I could even call it sissy-like hissing.  But with all the hissing, the werewolf merely walks up to him and that was the end for that very silly vampire who did not even put up a fight.  And I thought that would be the end of that but my favoritest stupid scene had to be the second vampire that ran out of ammo and finds himself head to head with a werewolf.  But wait, this vampire is armed, with...(if you have never seen the movie you will never guess it)...with...with two metallic whips!  What the hell was that all about? I did not know there were some lion taming vampires out there, but this one really took his whip wielding very seriously.  This scene was by far the cheesiest, hilarious because it was so pointless, and what made it worse was the people who shot the scene, thought it was cool, at least I thought that was evident.  And he had like a routine, he was not even trying to hit the werewolf, he was just wielding them in a circular motion...Why?  And it was so unexpected when the werewolf walks up to the ""cool"" vampire and kills him right away.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie had to be spoonfed.  In the end when Selene cuts Viktor, the audience was left to believe that it was possible she missed, because Viktor was still standing.  Countless movies have done the same, and then the head falls off (I say countless, but I know that is an exaggeration, because right now I cannot even think of one).  But that was enough, she is standing there, and so is he, would it not have been enough just to show the slice of head fall off?  Like somebody said about the music, the music should fit the scene, not the other way around.  The score in this movie was trying to make you feel a certain way, surprised or scared.  Selene lifts up her sword and we see the blood on it (she DID cut him!) and the music tells us we are supposed to be surprised.  I thought that whole shot was laughable, annoying actually, unnecessary as well. There was just no chemistry between Selene and Michael, none whatsoever, I never sensed like the two had any feelings for each other, so that Romeo and Juliet thing was out the window.  Also, Romeo and Juliet's families were trying to keep them apart, while the werewolves wanted this union to occur, in the end when Lucien is coaxing her to bite him.  I was also very disappointed that Lucien did not get to see the vampire/werewolf hybrid, and that he went out so easily, and stupidly, turning his back to a traitor after having talked to him like he was an idiot.  I was also very disappointed that they ended it to be continued.  I did not care about Selene, if she died or not, the movie would have probably been more interesting had she died.  The vampires just seemed to me like some coked up humans, never were they frightening.<br/><br/>Although the movie disappointed me a little, I still enjoyed it.  Someone was saying they could not understand why people were laughing, they were just not taking it seriously.  None of the scenes in there had any comic relief, so they were laughing at the stupidities of the movie.  Unless they were supposed to be expecting an Oscar winner, I do not understand how that could baffle anyone, laughing at silly scenes, well, I guess unless you paid nine dollars to see it expecting more, I did not spend that much, and I wouldn't, I recommend this movie on video if you feel like you have to watch it.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"

Kahn was great, perfect for his part. Kraven was an annoying little whiner, which he was cast as, but I can see how having him as the vampires' leader is a little unbelievable. Victor is pretty awesome, perfectly cast. Selene... is just... perfect. I mean, it's not the sex appeal (despite what I've been hearing, c'mon guys, grow up a little.), it's like everything about Beckensale works for this character.  I was talking to one of my friends about it the other day, and he picked up the same thing.  For him, it was that opening sequence (also in the previews) where she jumps from the railing and starts walking... he thought it was like, the perfect walk, and I agree.  Now I can't for the sequel.<br/><br/>The only real flaw I saw in the movie was the final battle (**Possible Spoiler**)...<br/><br/>First off, he (Michael) looks essentially retarded.  Wouldn't you expect the spawn of a vampire and a werewolf who is supposed to be stronger than both to be a total badass?  No, he's like a scaled down hulk.  Then, he gets destroyed by Victor... what?  I would expect a long hard fight with Mike coming out on top, not Selene bailing him out.  Speaking of Selene bailing him out, how dumb looking was that decapitation thing?  Total weak sauce. Nonetheless, these are minor details that come at the end of an awesome movie."

The fight scenes unfortunately follow the pattern of being tediously matrix-esque yet again but it is hard to avoid a good gun fight without the bullet time technique and the thousands of bullets being fired with approximately 1 or 2 hitting the target.<br/><br/>Overall this film was reasonably entertaining.

She'll be close enough to hock a loogie on someone and miss them entirely. I totally got that scene where she shoots a circle on the floor and falls through. Best not to waste any bullets shooting at a target of any kind.<br/><br/>-Why do the werewolves have to get buck naked to fight anyone? You would think after a millenium of knucklin' up someone would have discovered sweatpants or at least boxer briefs.<br/><br/>My absolute, hands-down FAVORITE cheesy aspect of the movie was the ""cracked out peter pan"" landings from high places. When speedman jumped out of a window, got ""that wolfie feeling"" in midair, and landed smoothly, was crying.<br/><br/>I'll concede to some plot points I found plausible: I'm not sweating celine's gear: If you live long enough and your financial planner happens to be a vampire you accumulate a nice stack of cash. If they can produce futuristic weaponry, I'm sure she can make the odd trip to paris for slinky fetish gear.<br/><br/>Viktor didn't really become plausible to me until he smoked that werewolf with his bare hands. Then I was like ""yep, he's the leader."" That Highlander-esque tendency to pull his sword out of apparently nowhere did crack me up though.<br/><br/>I'm sure we all agree this movie was silly, but it was kind of silly that requires the snide attention of a Mystery Science Theater Episode. I would totally see it again, if for no reason than the knee slapping hilarity of it.

Sort of dissapointed that the vampire side seemed almost as a fragile as any regular human out there, and also dissapointed how they didn't explain or at least visually show some aspects of the character traits, such as a vampire healing from a shoulder wound. But the action sequences where amazingly well done, as fast-paced as Blade ever was, and they did make a good effort to show which was the driving force behind each character and what consequences their actions brought about upon the main plot of the movie. Saying that this was a rip-off of other movies because of any slow-mo image capture effects and the like is similar to saying that any movie in which there was sound is a rip-off of the very first movie produced with sound, as new video editing features and special effect actions are created in the movie industry, the more they'll be implemented, and shouldn't be expected to be restricted to just the original movie they were shown in.

"formicidae","6","0","0","23 September 2003"," Lower your expectations... considerably
","Underworld is visually impressive: the dark brooding mood of Burton's ""Batman"", the detailed sets, and the very fetching Beckinsale make the movie appetizing to watch. Unfortunately, beyond the eye candy buffet, there is very little else to consider good about the flick.<br/><br/>   Some specific disappointments:    1. Beckinsale's character Serene is a ""death-dealer"" vampire whose task is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (werewolves). After watching a few shooting scenes, I sincerely felt Serene would have lasted only a couple of days on the job. She can't hit a thing, despite spraying hundreds of rounds at large targets only a few metres away. It's hard to buy into a hero who can hit marble busts in the shooting range, but misses three large bodies in a small hallway.<br/><br/>   2. The love story is weak at best, or maybe I'm inattentive. With a minimum of dialogue between the two, the relationship between Serene and Michael (Speedman) seems based on looks and looks alone, but apparently a strong and almost unshakable love bond has developed by the end of the movie. I don't mind surprise endings, but the depth of emotion here seemed an afterthought.<br/><br/>   3. Shane Brolly (who plays Kraven) is pretty brutal. I'm sure he's a nice guy, so I don't want to diss him personally, but every scene he's in is a major distraction from the film. His sneering, spitting delivery is utterly unchanged throughout the movie, to the point where you wonder if he is capable of any other emotion beyond rage or disgust.<br/><br/>   4. Goofy stuff that just seemed weird: Serene's idiotic driving everywhere and nowhere at breakneck speed (solely for product placement?), the Lycan's apparent refusal to actually use the deadly ammunition they've developed for the vampires, the inherent lack of logic of the war (why didn't the Lycans just kill all the vampires during the day?), and the avoidance of acknowledging that daylight is gone, etc.<br/><br/>   Maybe I'm being petty, but with a movie that's taking itself this seriously, and with the amount of effort that obviously went into making it look good, I expect some consistency and development to the overall story, too. With a little consideration, it could have been a much, much  better movie.<br/><br/>   Perhaps the sequel will redeem this one. 5.5/10"

The new film UNDERWORLD plays like the appendix of a novel.

Selene job in her vampire clan is to kill said Werewolves, she's known as a death eater.  You see there is a war brewing between the werewolves and the vampires.  It's kind of an undead Hatfield and McCoy story.  <br/><br/>Or is it? UNDERWORLD suffers from an intriguing concept and little substance.  There is this huge back-story, that finds its way into the movie and I bet it's figured out pretty concisely.  There talk of history, and legend, and generations of vampire's and werewolves.  But that's all. Compelling characters take a back seat, to loud and almost obnoxious action sequences and subplots running left and right with nowhere to go.<br/><br/>In fact the only reason the film focuses on Beckensale is because she's the big name star.  She comes and goes at the whim of the screenplay.  In fact I think there was a 20-minute segment near the end that she isn't even in. The major plot of this film plays like an overlong subplot in a much more epic film or maybe even a two-part episode of a fantasy television series. <br/><br/>
In fact that's the only way a film like Underworld can work.  The film is crying out for some focus.  There's a story dying to come out.  It's right there on the surface, and instead of focusing on Selene and her fight to save Michael.  It is bogged down by this silly and overdeveloped history of the war between vampire's and werewolves.  You know what.  This movie would make a great television or comic book series.  It just doesn't work as a stand-alone film.<br/><br/>And yet I can't say I hated UNDERWORLD.  It looks too good.  Its visual style lies somewhere between BATMAN and MINORITY REPORT.  It's set in one of those futuristic cities that are dirty and disgusting, and full of horror. A city where the sun never shines and humans are food for the children of the night.  If you like really neat eye candy this is the film for you.<br/><br/>It seems like the filmmakers took the lets see how much cool stuff we can jam into the film approach, and most of it works on a purely surface level. It's only after you realize that if you removed most of the cool scenes you'd have nothing worth watching and that's when the Action sequences begin to grate on you.<br/><br/>I longed for a much better, more fully realized picture than I got with UNDERWORLD.  I wanted cool action sequences, but I also wanted some compelling characters and interesting story developments.  All of which fall flat under the weight of an unfocused and overly melodramatic story.  Do yourself a favor and skip UNDERWORLD.  But as consolation may I suggest you give EQUILBRIUM a try?<br/><br/>**1/2 out of 5"

","Beautiful sets, great atmosphere, nice uniforms, pretty people, but then that is what you would expect from this film's director, who was the art director for the movie Stargate.  Never during the entire film were we encouraged to really care for any of the main characters. Whenever Selene or her beau would get into danger, my immediate response was ""Oooo... pretty, but who cares?""  The film is comprised of visuals and action, a plot that could have used some more attention, and characters as shallow as a piece of cardboard. Whoever played the villain, Kraven, acted like he was on a Mexican soap rather than in a movie. I never once believed this guy would be in charge of a the vampire valet parking lot let alone a whole coven. What a whiney bad guy! Ick.  Kate Beckinsale did a fine job acting, but then again, the script didn't have her act very much. She broods well, but the lack of substantial character development outside of flashbacks meant that I couldn't really feel for her character at all. If you mute the sound, you'd get just as much out of watching this flick. Hence, this movie would be excellent projected on the wall of a noisy Goth club or behind a Goth band during a show.  You could easily turn it into a drinking game. Chug every time someone kicks in a door!  See the movie and you'll understand the joke. Better yet, wait for it on cable. Better yet, wait for it on TBS.  It will be on after or before the next Witchblade marathon."

","I was already hesitant to see this movie, but the user rating here was just too high to pass it up. Unfortunately I didn't have time to read the reviews, as we had decided to go see it quite suddenly. The choice was betwixt this and Secondhand Lions. I wish we had seen the latter.<br/><br/>
I know, I know... vampires can see in the dark, and sunlight is, um, ""unpleasant"" for them. And I know that werewolves can see in the dark as well. But, we are merely humans, and we CAN'T see in the dark! If there were any immortals in the audience I am sure they had no trouble, but I did. If I had been able to tell who was who in the initial sequences I might have been a bit more interested, but they lost me right there. Mood can be conveyed with good dialog and acting, not just with dim (dare I say DARK?) lighting and a blaring score which tried to force my attention upon a scene. I don't like being forced along by music... I like for it to accompany the action in a way that feels smooth. The music in this film seemed overly dramatic with its tolling bells and crashing crescendos. The little bit of rock music they used actually worked far better, in the two scenes in which they employed it. It seemed more fitting to the film than music which was so very serious.<br/><br/>And you know what? There is only so much back-and-forth superfast gunplay I can stomach... it gets very redundant and I definitely have gotten my fill elsewhere. At least the werewolves took the initiative at times and kicked some proverbial arse the old-fashioned way. I was also pleased when a sword was FINALLY brought into play. It was about time, and could have been employed more.<br/><br/>Also, if I had cared the least bit about any of the characters, I might have enjoyed it more. But I didn't, no matter how many times they showed Selene looking thoughtful and pensive and pained... even during her contrived-sounding speech which detailed the night she became a vampire. No offense to the actress (she has done some fine work), but she just does not seem ""Death Dealer"" material. Her seriousness bordered on being laughable, especially when she had to deliver some of those stiff lines. The only characters I was even interested in were Michael and the lycanthrope Lucien (Lucian?)... and only because I could identify with Michael because he was human (and confused as I was at being thrust headlong into the chaos of this war), and I knew there would be more to Lucien than met the eye. He was actually a fairly believable character. I was rooting for the werewolves, actually, the poor sewer-dwelling fellows. Talk about the short end o' the stick! But I was hoping they'd win only mildly... I found myself not caring in the end and just waiting, hoping, wishing, that this movie would end.<br/><br/>
My husband fell asleep at the climax and when I woke him he replied he didn't care and would rather get the sleep than see the ending. Not a good sign, especially since he really enjoys role-playing games (which this seemed to be based upon). As do I. And we usually like the dark genera (we have Blade #1, The Crow #1, and The Matrix #1 on DVD), and I read horror and also specifically vampire novels. This movie felt as if they had just jumped ahead and made the bad sequel (like the sequels to the afore-mentioned films, which were all unpleasant).<br/><br/>This movie was nothing special, and not worth our admission price and time. My husband mentioned that he had worked for one hour to earn the admission price, and then worked two hours to sit through it. He invested three hours then, plus driving time. This was something I might have watched on television if I was bored, but it was a poor choice to see in the theater. It felt as if I had just read a long but poorly penned book... a little cheated and wistful that I could have been doing something else, like taking a nap. Not that it was awful... it wasn't quite that bad. And many will surely love it, and good for them. The sad thing is that it could have been far better, given some good writing, better lighting (ANY lighting!), and a better delivery by the majority of actors. Too bad."

","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>
I got my $6 worth(matinee).  I felt that since I was entertained and said ""man that is cool"" more than once the production was a success. I was sold on the concept, and was not suprised by its delivery. Gritty, insanely loud and intense action scenes, and that great feeling in your gut when you know you're about to see something cool.  There were a few problem areas that limit my ability to recommend this to everyone.  I am a story first kind of guy, and when tackling subjects with such a long and complicated history it seems so bizarre that the rules of these vampires/werewolves were not set early on.  I think this was the first vampire movie I have ever seen were a human wasn't bitten by a vampire...   Doesn't happen.  Only after M. Corvin is infected with the Lycan virus is he bitten by Selina.  As a result of which I found it harder to look at them as Vampires, because they were all so human-like.  Very emotional, and actually quite whiney.  You would think that immortality would bring with it wisdom. Craven bugged me from the start.  Here is a guy who's over 500years old, and rules all the vampires, yet not one point during the movie did I feel one ounce of respect for him, and certainly not his leadership ability.  I mean.. he just kind of complains a lot and fly's off the handle at the most seemingly mundane thing, like a teenage girl. It was laughable.  I also found it funny that every single vampire enters a room by opening both doors in epic fashion. Like a cowboy.  The tide of drama threatened to drown the audience and spill over into laughter on a few occasions.  It was saved by the performances of Scott Speedman and Kate Beckinsale, plus a few others.  Notably talented was Lucien, the head of the werewolves, played by Michael Sheen (Beckinsales real-life beau).  Very likable, and helped me to side with the werewolves, if not morally certainly because they were less bitchy. I also had a hard time with the back story.  How can you convince someone of the death of a werewolve by showing them 2 square inches of skin...  ???  I mean.. How do you buy that if you're fighting a war.  If we found Osama's kneecap, would we give up?  Certainly not.  Also the idea that you can kill these beings with special bullets is just... well.. kind of anticlimactic.  I was not astounded by the abilities of these immortals, which is absolutely necessary to be enthralled.  Otherwise its just a bunch of people shooting at eachother.  However with that aside, I found that the part of me that told me to see this movie was very well satiated by the intensity of the parts of the story that they did care to tell.  The vamp-wolf combo thing was most interesting.  He looks like night crawler a bit.. I haven't seen that tackled before and if it wasn't for this possibility of a new potential beast I would find this movie lacking.  I also felt that Kate Beckinsale's acting job was... very good.  Even though she was dark, quiet and seemed very simplistic on the surface I had the feeling that she was a deeper character regardless of the lack of evidence.  This can only be done by the actor/actress.  She still seemed to have a tortured soul.  I think very few people could pull that off. Praise to the craftsmen who worked on this movie.  The effects, cinematography, sets... all absolutely top-notch.  There was a lot of thought put into this movie, and some very talented people are out there in the industry.  They borrowed heavily from Celtic designs and took advantage of the locations very well.  If they do a sequel I hope they pull back from the grand scale and focus more on just a few characters so we can have answers to the questions that arise.<br/><br/>Remember, whenever you pay to see a movie you're voting for movies like it to be produced in the future."

","I have watched a lot of vampire movies, and the sad thing is that most of them are pretty bad. There hasn't been a decent vampire movie since Blade (1998), and I am not of fan of mixing genre themes (i.e. vampires, werewolves, etc.), so I was skeptical about Underworld.<br/><br/>However, I was very surprised and elated when Underworld far exceeded my expectations and turned out to be one of the best vampire movies to date. It integrates the werewolf theme in a sensible way with the war between the vampires and ""lycans"" as the main plot of the movie. The depiction of the vampires is very well done, and director Len Wiseman actually gets the vampire bite scene right. So many directors manage to mess up ""the bite"" making it look cheesy and fake--and this alone can ruin a vampire movie. Kudos to Wiseman for recognizing the importance of doing it right.<br/><br/>I've noticed a few complaints about Underworld being a Matrix imitation, but I think anyone who says this doesn't understand film direction. Wiseman has done an excellent job of borrowing the best elements from the classics, such as, the gothic atmosphere of The Matrix and the bullet time effect that has since become the standard for fight sequences. Wiseman also pays homage to classics such as An American Werewolf in London (1981) and the vampire film tradition in general. And the movie is true to the literary folklore of the vampire and werewolf mythology.<br/><br/>Finally, Kate Beckinsale as the vampire warrior Selene is TOTALLY HOT!!! She alone makes the movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>Whether you are a fan of vampires, werewolves or both, I highly recommend this movie."
"The_Fold","Null","0","0","23 September 2003"," Enjoyable, but slow to get going
","I went into this film after reading a fair few bad reviews in the UK tabloids about this movie, but seeing as I have this week off work I thought I'd go check it out.<br/><br/>--- The film starts off with a good action sequence showing basically how tough both the vampires and the lycans (werewolves) are but these sequences are few and far between, although all of them are great to watch and certainly get the adrenaline going.<br/><br/>The story itself revolves around an age old war between vampires and lycans which has been fought for the best part (if not longer) of 1000 years. There has been a lull in the past few hundred after vampire disciple Kraven defeated the leader of the lycans Lucian.<br/><br/>The vampire covenant are gearing up for an awakening ceremony which will see one of the vampire elders brought back to life after centuries of slumber. However, the lycans have other plans.... ---<br/><br/>The film is completely set at night which gives a really dark look and it is always raining whenever any of them venture outdoors. The leather-clad Selene (Beckinsale) does remind you of Trinity from the Matrix, but she looks hot all the same. There is a very gothic look about the vampires from their clothing down to their mansion and general demenour.<br/><br/>The are only 3 things I can get picky about with this film. Firstly, the film is slow to get going, for the first hour or so the film opens up so many questions you're left thinking ""huh?"", but soon after this the rest of the story and more action kicks off which keeps you in your seat for the remaining hour. Secondly, the vampires all seem to have reflections. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but vampires don't have reflections?? But sure enough in every glass window and even a mirror, they can all see themselves. Lastly, the lycan transformation from human into werewolf is quite impressive looking, but when they are pounding about on the walls and floors, they look a teeny bit tacky.<br/><br/>All in all, I was a good fiver spent for 2 hours of gothic action which had a pretty good storyline and an excellent twist which I never would have seen coming....go see it!!"

","This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was painfull watching this movie. I am a big fan of Vampire movies and I was excited to see this one but I must say I was horribly disappointed. The trailer was cool but that was about it.<br/><br/>Writing: Atrocious. The dialogue for Underworld was hokey and contrived. It felt wooden and did not inspire any emotion. It tried too hard to be ""cool"" and failed miserably. This was not cutting edge this was cutting room floor. The Vampires were retarded parodies of what has become the stereotypical foppish Anne Rice, ""look at me I'm so cool"" vampires. The Werewolves were even worse. The werewolves were written to be like a oncoming tide of lame creatures for the main characters to kill. Not once was I afraid of them.<br/><br/>Directing: Other than a few well composed shots this movie lacked a style of it's own. Okay tight vinyl...seen it. Okay slow-mo action shots...been there. Okay Gothic sensibilty and ambiance...can't mix it with the slow-mo and over priced effects. This movie lacked ""The Crows"" grittyness and didn't perform like ""The Matrix"" in the action department. This director obviously knows a bit about artistic sets and shot composition but he has a lot to learn about script and actors. Which brings me to my next and biggest bone to pick...<br/><br/>Acting: Kraven...wow man...terrible. I haven't seen this ""silly"" a vampire since Leslie Nielson played Dracula in his spoof. Viktor, just cough it up already I'm laughing every time you try to battle your condition. Grevioux sounds like a muppet, which is sad because I thought he looked very intimidating. The werewolves are like over-actors and the vampires are like over-actors and everyone else is like...you guessed it...an over actor. Ever heard the phrase ""Chrewing the furniture"". The only two people who were semi-watchable were Beckinsale and Speedman...but even they had the crappy script as material.<br/><br/>Overall: 3/10. Don't pay to see this in the theater but if you are bored and want a good laugh rent it on video."

","Its been awhile since the latest installment of a vampire/werewolf movie has been attempted at the box office.  This one is surely one of the finest I have seen.<br/><br/>  The movie centers around the ongoing war between vampire and lycans (werewolves) and persistent power struggle to terminate the members of the opposite bloodline.  Much unlike the user who reviewed this on the front page, I feel the storyline is very solid.  The main character is played by Kate Beckinsale, who does a very stoic and realistic portrayal of a vampire named Celine who fights to avenge the brutual slaying of her family by the lycans when she was young.  <br/><br/>  This movie is filled with action and there are VERY FEW moments when something isn't going on.  The mood set by the movie makes the war and its participants very believeable characters if you are able to let your mind free and try to imagine what it would feel like dealing with feelings that have lasted for thousands of years.<br/><br/>  This movie is not about bloodsucking and killing of humans (although some humans do die, although more of a result of being caught up in the war) and lycans are more than just being that howl at the moon during a full moon. The storyline is very solid and even contains a few twists which go along with the plot very well.  <br/><br/>  One of the only flaws of this movie is that most characters are not developed to their potential, then again this movie is not about getting to know a character;s personality and background, etc..   There are a few characters that you dont really know what their role is, but overall this is an excellent movie.   <br/><br/>  For the type of movie this is, Underworld met and exceeded expectations. The writing is very solid and the special effects are very good.  Beckinsale adds a no-nonsense female role that plays the part well and really gives Carrie Ann Moss a run for her money in leather.<br/><br/>  If you can stomach the blood and have an open mind, you should be able to appreciate this movie for what it is-- A top-notch look into the UNDERWORLD!!<br/><br/> 9/10"

","Take typical vampires as aristocrats and make their enemy a very neglected movie monster, the werewolves, set them in modern time and that is underworld.  A good movie for those who like the dark atmosphere of films like blade and matrix.  At first, I thought the trailer gave too much of the film away in terms of discovering the plot.  After seeing it, I was wrong. Underworld has a deep storyline if one pays attention to historical information presented by the characters and leaves a lot of possibilities for graphic novels and decent off shoot movies or sequels.  If you ignore the plot and just watch the action, Underworld doesn't rise above in that area but it doesn't fall off the ladder.  For vampires vs. werewolves, the powers each are known to have and have in the film aren't used often. The war could very well be between two races of human beings and the same footage could be used."

If you couldn't handle the never-ending gunfire in ""BlackHawk Down"", stay away from this one. It's loud, raucous, and is about the most violent mainstream film that you'll see.

None of her previous work would give anyone a clue that she could play a Carrie Ann Moss character like this. The sullen, moody look works, as does the hairstyle and outfit.

","Is this what passes for entertainment these days? This was a bad movie, for several reasons- which I will explain: 1) The movie had plenty of style. It looked good, and the actors looked good (when they weren't spouting out cliche' dialogue). But once again we are treated to enormous amounts of gunfire and explosions, instead of a story. The movie was so loud I had a headache by the end of the first act (was there a first act?) 2) Since when do vampires and werewolves need machine guns?? Vampires are supposed to be sexy, stylish creatures of the night, who get by on their wits- and their teeth. Werewolves are men by day, beasts at night. I thought it was ridiculous to see these two creatures fighting each other like they were modern day gang members. 3) This movie is so cliche'. Did anyone catch the direct Matrix rip-offs? Why can't the filmmakers create an original movie? Do they have to copy other successful films (that actually have a story) because their movie has no real backbone to it? This really bothered me. Be original people. 4) The first act was all violence- I had no idea what was going on, until the end of the second act, where the exposition takes place. It is long winded, and heavy handed. 5) Nothing is explained very well- if vampires can live forever, then why must the elders be put to sleep for centuries, then reawakened? Why can't they always be awake?? Where are these creatures living? Are they in Europe, with American cops? Wherever they are, the sun never shines- it is always dark (not even England is like that!) 6) The original idea for this movie had potential- but it was not executed or told very well. There was no intrigue, and no mystery. All we got for two hours was Kate Beckinsale blasting away her automatic weapons while wearing tight leather outfits, and pouting. It was like a video game. I didn't care much for any of these characters- they all seemed bad, and when it finally ended, I was thankful."

The dialogue was pedantic; but in the mouths of the actors the cliched words found greater impact. I did not expect much from Kate Beckinsale, based on her earlier work in Serendipity and Pearl Harbor. I was pleasantly surprised by her ability to carry the dark and gothic cool of the vampire Selene. I also feel, however, that the central romantic storyline had room for development- a lot of room. The cinematography was amazing, the fight scenes were visually intense, and the mythology was complex and for the most part held up under closer scrutiny. This was a fun action movie- with an extremely hot female lead in tight, black leather clothing the entire time. Not a FILM by any means- you will not see this movie up for any academy awards or golden globes. However, that does not mean this movie was not extremely enjoyable and I feel my 9 dollars, yes, 9 dollars, was well spent. The movie left a definite opening for a sequel, and I, for one, am looking forward to where they take the characters and mythology they have created."

","That question among others came to mind during long stretches of ""Underworld"" when not much was happening and there was time to appreciate the dark gloomy visuals.  (I'm a sucker for these Euro-filmed neo-noirs like this one and ""Feardotcom,"" et al.)  I liked how they established the contrast between the elite, effete vampires (although one of them, the only black vampire, sports a Cockney accent) and the lumpen-proletariat werewolves.  The vamps hold posh parties with fancy wine glasses and everyone dressed to the nines; the ""lycans"" hang out in subway tunnels watching slash-matches a la WWF fans.  But they don't seem to have any women on hand.  How have they reproduced over the centuries, just by biting people?<br/><br/>A movie can succeed in one of two ways: we take the premise seriously, or we don't.  At the outset of  ""Underworld"" it seems we're invited to take it seriously, partly due to the heroine's sonorous narration.  Then when Kate Beckinsale and her partner casually leap off the tall buildings, bounce off the sidewalk and go strolling into the subway after their targets, we're all set for a nice juicy nightmarish thrill ride. Next thing we know, everybody's pulling out automatic weapons, complete with endless extra ammo clips; everyone's blasting away at everyone else without hitting much of anything.  The ""civilians"" scatter, the police never arrive and the combatants slip away.  We're asked to believe this sort of thing has been going on for decades and earlier for centuries before guns were invented. The attention of human society, apparently, has been largely elsewhere. One can imagine a local TV news broadcast:  ""In our top story tonight, Hungary defeats Germany 3-2 in the World Cup semi-finals; in other news, another skirmish between vampires and werewolves results in delays for many evening commuters, stay tuned for details...""<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I often found myself enjoying this movie on it's own terms, Romeo-and-Juliet-rehash and all, but the script kept butting in with details demanding I take them seriously, even if they made no sense. There's a certain young-rock-star-looking dude in whom all the night folks are interested; he's human but he has werewolf blood but they have to bite him but they want to preserve him so they can draw blood samples but they also want to kill him but they want to devise some new species, or something to that effect.  (It seems the full moon is still a factor, along with all the syringes etc.) There's palace intrigue amongst the vamps.  There are double- and triple-crosses involving both sides.  There's back-story and blurry flashbacks and subplots.  In some scenes it's difficult to discern who's trying to kill whom, and why.  Maybe some of this was deliberately meant to invoke the chaos of a wartime situation.  The script was co-written by one of the actors and by the director, who's also Ms Beckinsale's fiance; maybe there was too much going on to make it all coherent and cohesive. But unlike the recent and equally chaotic ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico,"" at least there we knew we were watching a live-action cartoon.   ""Underworld"" looks and sounds like it's supposed to be ""Schindler's List.""<br/><br/>Still and all ""Underworld"" is worth a look for the acting, atmosphere, art direction/set decoration and flashes of morbid humor; just resist the temptation to take it as seriously as it evidently wants to be taken.  If there's a sequel, as the ending promises, I'll probably go watch it, especially if Ms Beckinsale is in it; I have the advantage of not having seen her before, so I have no reason not to buy her as Selene.  But she could use a co-star with some pizzazz.   Hey, I think James Marsters is free nowadays....<br/><br/>Best line: the werewolf boss to his unruly brawling minions:  ""Put some clothes on, please...""<br/><br/>BTW I seem to recall from ""Interview with the Vampire"" that a human child who becomes a vampire stays a child forever, yet Selene, who was ""turned"" as a child, still managed to ""grow up.""  Who gets to write ""the rules"" these days, anyway?  The ""godfather,"" Bram Stoker, made most of it up himself...."

Some critics tore into the story, but I found the story to be WAY better than the first Blade movie. Some of the fight scenes were cool (the one with the whips, at least at first), but most were disappointing (too short, too much guns or fangs). The creature effects too, seemed a few years behind the times. (They also kept the creature effects budget low with lots of darkness.) I would have liked to have known more about Lucian and Kraven and their whole thing, and more flashbacks with Selene's story and Viktor would have helped give that more life, too. I thought Kate was great. However, it was tiring to see her in the same rubber suit scene after scene after scene. Now, for Scott Speedman, he was a surprise. I knew he looked familiar, but it wasn't until I was able to look him up that I realized, ""Holy crap, that's the guy from Felicity????!"" He looks SO much better with the long hair (he looks good with close-shaved hair as well), and he's bulked up a bit in this movie. Overall, quite the hottie. His role wasn't fleshed out very much (they never explained any of his personal life), but he did OK with it. I enjoyed this movie and would like to see more of these characters."

","Vampires are cool. They are beautiful, ageless creatures that are both immaculate and terrifying due to the threat they pose. No one can deny the distinct sexual tension when a vampire seduces and bites one of its victims, because nine times out of ten, the victim kinda wants it.<br/><br/>
The vampires in `Underworld' don't do this however. They might as well exist in the Matrix, shooting at everything that moves in stylized poses with weapons that slide and click against each other all the time. Where `Underworld' lacks originality, it makes up for in noise, noise, noise. I guess that's supposed to be scary. <br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a vampire warrior always clad in tight leather. Her clan of vampires have been hunting down a clan of werewolves for the better part of a thousand years, and yet both clans have retained pretty sizable numbers. In the progress of the movie, she encounters Scott Speedman's doctor-type who's werewolf bite could result in some hirsute nights when the moon is out. They fall in love, kinda, but only to fulfill the Romeo and Juliet allegory/rip-off the producers were aiming for.<br/><br/>
The special effects for the werewolves never really come full circle. When the beasties are realistic with digital effects, they look like cartoons. The practical effects just look like people wearing werewolf costumes. Neither creation seems to move in a realistic, animalistic way.<br/><br/>
The vampires all look the part, but that's a little easy. Make'em look nice and pale, slap on some fake teeth and employ some wire effects. But these vampires certainly don't act the part. They're all very whiny people for immortals. There's a bizarre love quadrangle as the head of Selene's cult swoons after her while some other vampire chick swoons after him all the while Selene's making the sweetie eyes at the werewolf doctor. Honestly, who cares? <br/><br/>Does a movie like this need so much plot? There are really only three scenes big enough to considered action scenes. The opener and the finale are so overlong and overdone, the audience gets bored. The third is so inconsequential, why waste the film stock? The rest of the film is all double and triple crosses, convoluted plot points and flashbacks of why the war started in the first place. <br/><br/>Had this film had half the skilled visuals of `The Crow,' `Blade' or `The Matrix,' it might have been a standout. `Underworld' is more like a stand still."
"bd74","Null","0","0","22 September 2003"," An engrossing gothic flick
","I heard about this movie sometime last year, while it was still in production, and I was really looking forward to seeing it. The whole concept of a movie featuring a group of black-clad gothic characters appealed to me. Well, I went to see this movie on opening day, and it did not disappoint me at all. This is a movie about a centuries-old feud between two mythical creatures of gothic lore: vampires and werewolves. It stars the alluring Kate Beckinsale as a vampire that hunts werewolves with the intention of exterminating them. It also stars Scott Speedman as a human who happens to provide a link between the feuding vampires and werewolves. Michael Sheen plays the leader of the Lycans--the werewolf clan which lives in the bowels of the city. Sheen's performance is clearly the best performance in the movie, and his appearance (long hair, goatee, and alabaster complexion) suits his werewolf ringleader character perfectly. The werewolves' meager existence among the city's ""underworld"" is contrasted by the aristocratic vampires and their opulent Victorian trappings. The movie's dark and mysterious sets are top-notch, and the movie itself was filmed in the beautiful European cities of Budapest and Prague, adding more of a gothic atmosphere to the film. The action sequences are amazing--in particular, the opening sequence is astonishing. This movie is everything that a gothic movie should be like, especially since it combines fantasy, action, suspense, and horror. I actually felt scared during some parts of the movie. The only thing that I disliked about the movie is that some of the actors who play vampires had to wear a pair of cheap-looking blue contact lenses. Other than that, everything else in the movie is wonderful. The movie turned out to be much better than I expected it to be, and I'm thinking of seeing it again. The ending of this movie serves to indicate that there will be a sequel...and I will definitely go to see the sequel."

No, Underworld is not like any of those movies and I have never checked out The Masquerade (unfortunately) card game that this is supposedly based on.<br/><br/>There are many deep meanings people are drawing from this film, but the fact is I think they are looking a little deeper than intended. The movie makers have touted this as FINALLY the two species battle for the first time in decades, but they really don't. Not just that, but the genres have been thrown out. Vampires toting guns instead of any kind of traditional battle is a slightly disappointing. I really wanted this to be better as I thought we'd have a new series to embrace instead of the all-action Blade-type flicks. I wish Mick Farren would make some movies with his Renquist character or even a Halford Colony movie.<br/><br/>I may have to see it again.

","It's funny how one or two bad performances can drag the whole thing down. Kraven (Shane Brolly) didn't even fit in with the rest of the strong performances - strong given it is a special effects soup that defies the rules of both vampire and Werewolf ""accepted lore"" for no real effect.  Even if you buy the bio-engineering medical technology portion, there is no possibility in any tradition that I am familiar with that the dead can get pregnant.  Maybe I'm a purist, but that bothered me.  And the instant healing is getting a little crazy - The whole highlander x-men thing is getting out of hand.  I think the point has always been that Vampires and Werewolves can eventually recover from anything if they don't lose the will to live.  But instant healing is a little too far out there even for me. Beckinsale is easy on the eyes, but I had hoped for a little more range of emotion.  Sheen and Speedman do remarkably well with what they had to work with and Nighy is wonderfully over the top as the king of the hill should be.  My last gripe is that not enough was made of the vampiric speed.  If they are not going to be shape shifters (as some are and some aren't depending on the movie) then the speed has got to be there.  They started to touch on it with the ""super being cross breed"" in the final show down with Viktor but then they just glossed it over.  Plot point deductions drag this down for a high eight in my way of thinking to a low five.  That being said I might watch it again and see if I feel the same."

","Let me get the quick part over with. Kate Beckinsale is attractive and fights against the tide to give her ""character"" some depth. But even Kate, surrounded as she is by some of the worst acting since Tim Burton's misbegotten Planet of the Apes, and some of the lamest dialogue since Terminator 3, can't keep from drowning in this swampy, dark, and silly mess. It really is that bad. I took my thirteen year old, a sophisticated fan of gothic horror and anime in his own right, and he wanted to scream at all the plagiaristic mangling that goes on this movie. That's right--they steal from many sources, from the Matrix dress code to the bullet spewing bits from X2 to a head-splitting straight from one of my son's favorite Japanese vampire stories. They steal and then the destroy. Nothing that's borrowed is used to good effect.<br/><br/>Believe or not, that was the good part. Now onto the remaining 99% of the movie. (Oh, and by the way, the fact that Underworld topped the box office its first weekend is--hopefully--a testament to the nicely edited trailer. I can only hope that it plunges into the underworld itself after people start hearing just how bad it is. One can hope, right?)<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie is the ""acting,"" although it's hard to dignify it to that degree. One character, Kraven (ain't that original?), is so awful, so bad, such a putrescent poser, that he single-handedly ruins any chance of the movie pulling you into it's own, dark little world. He is a laugh-out-loud bad actor, and it is a real commentary on the director that he didn't fire the guy after the first day on the set. That is, he's bad if Kraven wasn't meant to be a dumb, goofy, air-headed male model type. But maybe that's what they were striving for. Kate Beckinsale is okay in her role. She's pretty and has a nice screen presence. But, as I noted up, that isn't enough. Everyone else is mediocre. Even the ""look"" of all these extras (they look like goth accountants and hair dressers) is just plain silly. The Matrix trenchcoats are a riot.<br/><br/>The script is an awful mishmash which spins an entirely silly and ornate (not in a good way) tale of battle between vampires and ""lycans"" (oh my, isn't that a cute nickname for lycanthropes!). Throw in a scientist who looks like an escapee from the Boys from Brazil, sets that look like a seventeen year-old interior designers idea of a library (with old, musty books arranged just so) and castle, a blaring and derivative soundtrack (with sampled ""sounds"" that go back to the mid-eighties and blaring intercuts designed to instill shock where the story can't), and this dark, dank atmosphere that is reminsicent of that hideous dragon movie that came out last year (god, I can't bring myself to recall the name). This movie is crap from one end to another.<br/><br/>So, avoid it, tell others how bad it is, and hope for better. Maybe Mel Brooks will take a shot at spoofing this dark barrel of detritus."

","The typical comments from people who have only seen the trailers bear true here, to a degree. This premise had a lot of potential, and when it focused on that potential, it was a good film. Unfortunately, the filmmakers too often tried to exploit obvious cultural trends in movies like ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade,"" and that's where they tripped up. This was especially true in the action scenes, where an obscene number of bullets were fired for no other plausible reason than because that's what they did in ""The Matrix."" There was also far too much black with blue filter, again seemingly because of ""The Matrix"" and ""Blade.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, discussing the ""good parts"" means discussing the original parts, which means discussing spoilers. To tread these waters without diving in: The movie relies on its own mythology for both werewolves and vampires. This might annoy some vampire purists, but I found it a fairly interesting and convincing mythology. Logic holes? Sure. What the heck, it's a movie, people. Nothin' but a show.<br/><br/>There's social commentary in the movie, too. Vampires seem to be a recurrent metaphor for some social ill or other (usually bloodborne illnesses, as in Stoker).

","Three words/phrases to sum up Underworld?  Modern, action-packed, and BEAUTIFUL actress! While Underworld started out not so different from other modern action films, I was immediately subdued into this world of Selene (Kate Beckinsdale).  At first, her sheer beauty in black captured my breath, but her character also plays a huge part in the film.  Whether it be a close up of her or an elaborate fighting scene, she shows an amazing performance in this movie, capturing the strong willed vampire that she is. The first half or so of the movie was simply various action scenes and scenes which set up the elaborate background of the vampire/werewolf war. Along the way, many twists and vague depictions are clearly confronted and efficiently carried out.  The movie overall did a great job of leading us to the end, the end where all the pieces fall into the ""final"" showdown. Underworld's interesting storyline definitely made up for any disappointments apparent in the modern aspect of the movie.  But then again, the modernity itself represents a major role in the movie and is often useful in appreciating the story. I'd say the final half hour or so alone is definitely worth the money, but all in all Underworld was no disappointment.  Plus Kate Beckinsdale is beautiful in black!"

","Before I went to see Underworld I had heard it received poor reviews from the moronic critics, as most movies of this type do. But in my opinion Underworld was a great flick.  It's difficult to make a Vampire movie that is appealing to everyone because not everyone's depiction of a Vampire is the same.  In Blade, Vampires were dark, deadly, killing machines void of emotion.  In Interview With the Vampire there was little violence other than the occasional feeding but the characters were complex and interesting. Underworld finds a pleasing median between the two. Selene, the dark and cold-hearted death dealer, is fighting a war against Lycans. And while she shows off her moves in the fight scenes and shows a hard exterior she still displays that she has feelings with a passionate kiss with Michael Corwin. She is both a lover and a fighter and very rarely do you find a Vampire portrayed in such a manner and I personally found it quite appealing.

Too many people have compared this to the Blade series. This is unlike the Blade series in many ways. Can Blade take Selene? Well can Sylvester Stallone 'take' Bruce Willis? Who knows and who cares. These are characters in movies who have their own place, strengths, weaknesses, etc. in their own worlds. This movie was not about the violence and action itself but about the struggle for survival between two rival paranormal species. The Blade series was about an evolved vampire eradicating the world of vampires and the like.<br/><br/>The existence and battle of the vampires and the lycanthropes is quite similar to the Laurel Hamilton ""Anita Blake"" series of books or even the survival aspect of the Christine Feehan ""Dark"" series about the Carpathians.

It held up both the action and the fantasy aspect of its classification very well.<br/><br/>I would like to have seen more character development on the lycanthrope side. I think the vampire side was heavily presented but the werewolves only seemed to focus on Lucian and Michael, who for all intents and purposes was not really a full lycan.<br/><br/>All in all I thought this movie was very well done and lived up to its previews. I'd like to see more movies along this line by these same creators. Not necessarily saying a sequel would be in order but the story can be even more fleshed out as time progresses."

","Controversy and lawyer bait aside, this film pulls on every cliche in the books and fails to bring anything new to the genre.  Beckinsales' character is hopeless as the poor little rich assasin.  Even before the 'revelation' about her hatred for lycans (?) comes out, a seasoned cornball junky will see the scene coming and probably even guess the words - never mind the 'twist' at the end.<br/><br/>Wolf effects are good, vamps seem to be portrayed as gun totting goths with huge clothing budgets - nothing new or imaginative is added to one of the most intriguing horror characters in history.

"Shok","Null","0","0","20 September 2003"," Dark action vampire & werewolf film/ music video worthwhile on the big screen
","This evening we caught the 10:10pm showing of the new film UNDERWORLD, which opened today. We went to see this at the Lowes Theatre at City Walk in Universal City's City Walk. The film begins with a near rip-off subway system scene recalling a certain MATRIX movie... complete with double-gun holding, sunglass wearing, trench coat / black slick attire. The film is shot in a similar manner as Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow in the washed out color and the dim lighting.<br/><br/>The sound was so loud, however it worked well. I noticed all foley/ sound effects and music had a much higher volume setting thsan the rest of the audio track and this was a great emphasis on the action of the story. Once the movie went beyond the Matrix parts and the typical plot set up, the movie became interesting since at first I was feeling dis-satisfied.<br/><br/>The music, which was supervised by Danny Lohner of Nine Inch Nails and composed by Paul Haslinger of Tangerine Dream, set the film on an excellent path and perfected all of the transitions and nervous energy perfectly!!! The music featured within the entire soundtrack blended so well with all incidental / background sounds and effects that it did not come at you off-base or thrust you out of the film to think about it for too long.<br/><br/>
HOWEVER... the sets, costumes and hair were so perfected... 125%, that your focus shifted from the story and onto how dressed the sets were or how the hair was or the attire. Less is more sometimes even when you have to ""go all the way"". I did enjoy the mood it created, but just a pinch off may have worked more in their favor as well as the lighting, that I mentioned above, may have taken away from the spilled blood and its possible contrasts or the furnishings of the dwellings.<br/><br/>Underworld is the directorial debut feature film for Len Wisemen, a music video director, who wrote the story with Kevin Grevioux, who played the character, Raze in the film and Danny McBride, who also wrote the original screenplay. I hope this team works together again... and I just have a tiny feeling they are in the midst of working on something new very soon!<br/><br/>If you are looking for an action film with a bit of vampire and werewolf business, and you enjoy films such as The Matrix, Blade and the look of the Nine Inch Nails video The Perfect Drug, this film may just be up your dark alley!<br/><br/>(It gets quite a few so-called goth points as well!)"
"DrDawg","Null","0","0","20 September 2003"," Good AND Bad -- Here's the skinny:
","My film-going buddy and I saw this last night and we really liked it. Just like others said, it's a mix of The Crow, Blade, The Matrix, and The Howling. And, yes, some of the acting is embarrassingly bad. The lead antagonist played by Shane Brolly was awful -- half of the problem was that he insisted on using an American accent. Bill Nighy did the same thing. If both had stuck with their respective native accents (Irish and English) the film would have been much better.  Beckinsdale pulled off her best performance thus far, and Scott Speedman actually pulled his own weight as the reluctant hero.<br/><br/>One thing I would add that I haven't seen mentioned is that this film plays like a moving graphic novel. If you are fan of the graphic novel format, you should really like this film. Also, if you think of it in that sense, then all of the other complaints about story, scenery, character development are moot because it does the job at least as well as the best graphic novel.<br/><br/>Here in NYC we payed $11.50 (including Fandango charge) to see this film and we agreed that we would pony up at least as much to see a sequel.<br/><br/><ul><li>Dr. Dawg (B.A. in Film, Bard College, 1991)</li></ul>"

","** some spoilers** My wife and I are werewolf and vampire fans, and this film delighted us both. most films of these types (Blade, Interview with a Vampire) take a character and build a story around them. In this case, the characters were developed around the story, which allows for a much deeper film.In the end, after Victor has been defeated, it shows a lycan's blood feeding(and thus awakening, if there is a sequel) Marcus, who also posseses the gene that Michael has. One can only imagine what a battle between two hybrids would be like. As to any parralells with ""Blade"", the producers of ""Blade"" could only wish to have 1/2 the depth of this film."
"egirard-2","8","0","0","20 September 2003"," Considerably better than expected, if you are familiar with the genre...
","This is another perfect example of a film where generally the critics just don't get it. This was definitely made for a certain audience, probably familiar with a certain type of modern-Gothic vampire lore, and agreeably with elements taken from recent films and a certain unnamed role-playing system (shhh, don't want a lawsuit).<br/><br/>Statement of Fact: Every film borrows elements from some other film. No one can deny that. Just because the elements borrowed are trends in other recent films, popular, profitable trends mind you, it's not wrong to borrow a few of them. It's because they are new, and fresh in our minds that people call them ""rip-offs"". To the people who say that the film is Blade-like and/or Matrix-like, yeah, sure, you'd have to be delusional not to see that. Of course, you should also be raising up arms about every war film that involved an in-plane cockpit scene, or every police drama where an officer was a corrupt puppet of some crime lord. Nothing new about borrowed visual and plot ideas, it's just O.K. in these circumstances because ""that's normal"", or maybe because the original film/stage play that first used that concept has been lost in time. For those of us who do like to see those derivative elements reappear in film again and again, we don't have any problem with it.<br/><br/>Also, the movie does possess a sub-plot which is quite intricate, and not revealed to the viewer in one big easy to understand lump. For those of us who like to lose ourselves in the details of a movie, and not just in it's visual drama or catchy one-liners, and can bend ourselves into the world that is being presented to us, this movie is all about that. Many complaints about this film deal with the non-typical plot mechanism where you aren't really presented with stereotypical ""good-guys"" or ""bad-guys"" to become comfortable with and root for. Honestly, I think that was my favorite part of the story itself, and how it was slowly revealed itself to the viewer.<br/><br/>Of course, many people are not interested in delving into a fantasy world as this, or familiar with the rules of the genre. Those people I can see are going to lose interest in watching the film, and be more aware of the films shortfalls, which there are a few (guns firing more bullets than it's clip would suggest. A somewhat overdone ending battle. And it's never daylight, yet the film eludes to more than one day going by. Thought we wouldn't notice I guess). I can understand their viewpoint, and I'm sorry you wasted your money. But for those who do enjoy this kind of thing and appreciate it, it does a very good job of keeping ones interest.<br/><br/>And for $23mil and a two-month shoot time, I'd have to say they did a pretty darn good job..."

","Vampires. Werewolves. Kate Beckinsale in tight black vinyl for boys. Scott Speedman without a shirt for girls. This is Underworld, a tale of warring creatures that culminates at present day. The bookends of the war involves a man and a woman from each species falling for eachother...which is forbidden. Selene, played by Kate, is part of a clan of Vampires that is central to the vampire side of the war. Lucian is the alpha male of werewolves on the other side who have some twists of their sleeves. Theoretically this is a genre fan's dream come true, but unfortunatly it doesn't live up to it's mind blowing potential. I'll start by telling you guys what is exceptionally good about it, then bring on my gripes.<br/><br/>The setting of the film is a very dark, blue hue (the whole film is in blue tones) that serves well concerning that in many cultures, the color blue represents death, and Vampires are of the undead. The color palette was appropriate. The entire Vampire cast is exceptionally attractive, especially Selene and her blonde ""rival"". The costumes the vampires wear are elaboratly rich, but not obvious (aside from the black vinyl). They are of a higher society, which can be good or bad, but with the plot elements in this film, it's good. See, in mythology, werewolves were kept as servents for vampires, and Underworld helps elaborate a little more by vampires referring to them as ""daylight protectors"" while they sleep at night. These creatures are at war, but werewolves are still kept more so as bottom feeders, living under the streets in sewers in large packs. The werewolves, or ""lycans"", wear ratty and tattered clothing, lots of heavy jackets with hoods that can be easily discarded so they can transform without ruining anything. The lycans looks dirtier, grittier than the clean cut and porcilin skinned vampires. The differences are clear, for that part anyway.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good. I didn't expect much from Speedman considering that he was a WB actor, but he did quite good amongst the more colorful cast. The man who plays Lucian is charismatic, considering his long hair, beard, and dark beedy eyes. Craven was a winer vampire, complaining too much because he is ""more beurocrat than a warrior"" to be a leader, and the actor pulls this off convincingly. The true elder of the Vampires, Victor is vicous, and deceptive. Most of his screentime, he had a lot of make up, and screw Ken Kirzinger, this guy can ""eye act."" The only flaw out of the actor's I'd have to say would be the large ""michael clark duncan"" replica. It's not that his performance is bad, it's his voice that sounded like it was straining too hard to be deep and imposing. I tried not to giggle when he carried conversations with Lucian. But when he got physical, and began yelling, he redeems himself.<br/><br/>The pacing builds like any pace for a film should, which is move smoothly and gradually to a powerful climax. The climax is where all the action is. There are peaks and valleys in the pacing that feels comfortable. After one tense scene, appropiately there is a calm scene that comes after to let the audience simmer down.<br/><br/>I do love the homage to the werewolf howl in An American Werewolf in London. It's still to this day the creepiest howl created, and they used it here in spades.<br/><br/>Now my gripes:<br/><br/>Where are the humans? Other than the opening 10 minutes, Scott Speedman's character, Michael, and his friend, there are not people running around town. There seems to be no traffic. I know it's everything takes place at night, but I have not seen any metropolis that sleeps at night. When there are werewolf raids going on in apartment complexes, how come the nieghbors don't complain, or even get curious? I know that a plotpoint in the film is that Vampires have begun cloning blood, so they don't have to prey on humans, but come on! Werewolves prey on them too!<br/><br/>Vampires, other than Kate's character, seem to be very lazy creatures. Most of the film, most of the vampires are seen sitting in fancy eurotrash clothing drink what we can only assume is cloned blood. The soldier vampires seem to be afraid to step into combat with the werewolves, other than Selene, who does a fair share of booty stomping.<br/><br/>Werewolves are seen too rarely. For once, I'm not bothered by the CGI shapeshifting. I was expecting bad rendering like in An American Werewolf in Paris, but instead we get was Hulk's transformations should have looked like. But, when there are werewolves on screen, you barely see them, there are too many quick cuts. But here's the worst part about the werewolves: their design. Their faces look great, but can they move their necks?<br/><br/>Their necks and heads are so bulky and Hyena shaped that it makes the werwolves look like a highschool mascott. The lighting hides the limited mobilty of it's face, but it doesn't hide the fact that these aren't werewolves, but in fact were-hairless-hyenas. Seriously, these are suppose to be wereWOLVES, as in those hairy dog like creatures! I'm sick of these hairless werewolf designs. My roomate said a few months back that they don't have to have hair because they don't have to hide flaws in their FX. I looked at him like he was an idiot. In the past, they didn't design the werwolves with hair so they can hide flaws in their special FX, they put hair on them because they are WEREWOLVES! Argh. This was a setback for Dog Soldiers and Ginger Snaps as well.<br/><br/>
I'd also like to know why there were not any female werewolves in the film. There was not one in any long shots of the werwolves in their dens. In every pack there is an alpha female and several (forgive the term) bitches. Just curious where they were in this whole thing.<br/><br/>****tiny but unimportant spoiler*********<br/><br/>Biggest flaw: Sunlight bullets? That was retarded. Period. The silver nitrate was cool, but that ultraviolet light bullets was just pretty stupid on the writer's behalf. But besides the sunlight bullets, there was too much gun fights over all.<br/><br/>*****end tiny unimportant spoiler********<br/><br/>If I was a werwolf, I'd much rather tear my enemies apart tooth and claw, than whipping out an oozy filled with sunlight bullets.<br/><br/>Sheesh. There are times the werewolves drop their cloths and go at it, but the vampires still gunfight against them.<br/><br/>
That's it for my gripes, which from what I said, isn't too much of a biggy, but enough to tarnish it from being a really great genre film. Don't expect too much horror, because there isn't any. This is strickly an action thriller that uses horror creatures. When I review, I try not to give much plot away, so if you find that I dont explain the plot in a straitforward manner, remember I intended it that way. I hate it when reviewers spoil things for you, even if they don't give away the surprise ending, but they'll say there is one which makes you try to think of what it is before it's there. I tried not to do that.<br/><br/>

The action sequences were quite good, and the look and feel of the movie were outstanding, which in my opinion has some cinematography that is oscar worthy.  Don't listen to others when they say this is a matrix rip off.  Just because you have people wearing tight leather outfits, doesn't mean they ripped off anything.

"mrwarmth","Null","0","0","20 September 2003"," Dark Shadows
","What a huge disappointment!  This film had so much potential, yet squandered every bit of it.  The movie, instead of being a spine-tingling horror-adventure ride, is instead a ponderous, painful machine that grinds down everything in its wake, including the viewer.  Everything about the movie is assaultive, including the overbearing sound-design.  This is one of those movies where one of the actors scratching his ass sounds like a nuclear bomb going off. Even the production design, on which clearly millions has been lavished, misfires.  Instead of being evocative and powerful, the sets wind up looking like relics from some 80s Bauhaus video. I kept expecting Peter Murphy to show up and start singing.<br/><br/>
The film has no sense of rhythm, pacing or tone, and is utterly clueless about how to build and sustain suspense.  The director thinks you create suspense by having lots of people firing lots and lots of bullets at each other all the time.  The film begins at a fever pitch, and because of this has nowhere to go.  All the characters are pumped up on adrenaline all the time, all they do is scream at each other all the time or hysterically fire bullets at each other.  It's totally boring after five minutes.  And the film inadvertently makes both groups seem pretty dumb.  I mean here you have to societies of immortals, with limitless time and money on their hands, with the wisdom of the ages theirs to command, and they can only think to fight each other in the most primitive way imaginable.  I would expect more from such creatures.  Blade's depiction of vampires was superior in every respect.<br/><br/>There is something of a plot which every once in a while peeks through the mindless carnage, but no one has cared enough about it to make it intelligible.  There are major continuity gaps that are surprising in such a large production.  For example, the film makes no attempt to define where the action is taking place.  There is no sense of place at all.  Most of the actors speak with British accents.  The physical setting is clearly Budapest (at least that's what I gather from all the signs in Hungarian).  Yet one of the main characters works at a hospital where everyone is American.  OK, so what is going on here?  The movie never bothers to explain.  It has to hurry to the next scene of people screaming and shooting at each other in low-light situations.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem with the movie is that its makers never seemed to understand the central problem they would have to overcome in realizing the film's premise.  Vampires and Werewolves become scary and ghoulish when they are fighting humans, because, in relation to them, they are fundamentally other, fundamentally different.  This is why vampire and werewolf movies are so popular.  Yet when vampires and werewolves fight each other, they cancel out each other's weirdness, the otherness and terror of each nullifies the otherness and terror of  other.  Which is why, even though we are looking at vampires fighting werewolves, they primarily fight one another with human weapons, in a human way: guns and guns and more guns.  There is nothing supernatural or horrific about how they relate to each other at all.  This makes the premise of the movie utterly mundane and without interest.  What is the point of having supernatural creatures battle each other, if they just wind up looking like human gangs fighing?  No point at all.  Which is my point.<br/><br/>Clearly there will be a sequel.  I hope they get someone on board who understands the kind of movie they are trying to make."

","Hmmm... the trailer for this film would have you believe that this is an action packed, intense, gripping story about vampires and werewolves.<br/><br/>Yes, it's action packed.  Yes, it has vampires and werewolves.  However, the story, such as it was, was only mildly intense and completely failed to grip me at any point.<br/><br/>A large part of the trouble with this film was that some of the lines were just too forced.  Two of the principal characters (Kraven and Lucien) were portrayed by actors who looked too much like they were trying to be Alan Rickman.  Sadly, although they could (just about) manage the creepy, angry or just down-right ****ed off looks, they fell very short of the mark with their deliveries, which were just too... choppy.. in places, and just flat in others.<br/><br/>Many of the characters fell pray to the choppy speech problem, although even if they hadn't, the dialogue would still have been pretty low on the interest meter.  Lines like ""find him!"", ""Kill him!"", ""find him, then kill him!"" etc. are fine once in a while during a film, but every 10th line is pushing it a little.<br/><br/>The film is also exceptionally dark.  I do understand that vampires have some issues with sunlight, but could they not afford lightbulbs?  There could have been some really interesting stuff going on in there, but it just couldn't be seen.<br/><br/>They also seem to have skipped on some parts of vampire lore, specifically the whole ""no reflection"" thing.  Supposedly, one of the ways to tell a vampire is that they cast no reflection in a mirror, yet at several points in Underworld, we see vampires clearly reflected.<br/><br/>Although the film had a couple of good ideas (the customised ammo each side carries, for example), its only real ""selling point"", such as it is, is the prospect of seeing a nice lady in a tight outfit (which even for me is not quite enough).  Granted, many people said the same about Charlies' Angels, but at least they managed to include a plot.<br/><br/>Best avoided."

","`But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.  Rise up, beautiful sun, and make the jealous moon invisible.'<br/><br/>One of the most popular of Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet, has been transformed into many different feature films; some good (the 1968 version) and some bad (the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio). But the main point is that this enduring tale of two star-crossed lovers (which, in reality, Shakespeare ripped off) has been able to stand the test of time, be passed on to future generations and has been embraced as much as it has ever been. Now a more different (really different) version has emerged with werewolves and vampires taking the place of the feuding families the Montagues and the Capulets. But Screen Gem's gothic take on the famous tale is much more loosely based then previous versions. How loosely based? At press time there was already talk of a sequel. William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave right now.<br/><br/>Underworld is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet with werewolves and vampires, two feuding clans, battling for supremacy. Selene, a vampire, is a `Death Dealer', an armed assassin who hunts down the Lycans, also known as werewolves. For centuries the war between the vampires and the Lycans has been raging on outside of the knowledge of the human race but that may all change with new rumblings in the underworld. Selene soon becomes infatuated with a human named Michael, who becomes the focus of a secret plot by the Lycans to resurrect their dying species. Why is this such a big deal? The integration of these two rivaling species is strictly forbidden but such an event could end the war. Why would anyone not want this? Selene believes that there are secrets within both clans that push the classic theme of appearance vs. reality. The story of Underworld is intriguing to say the least but gets too caught up in itself to make truly any sense. There are many surprising twists and turns in the plot but so many that the feature becomes bogged down and just plain confusing by the end of its two hour run. And talk about being `loosely' based! The filmmakers claim that Underworld is based on Romeo and Juliet with two members of feuding clans coming together in blissful love but outside of that, the similarities end pretty quickly. And even that similarity isn't well based with any romantic interests between the two main characters being pretty flat and disconnected.<br/><br/>The cast is full of wonderful actors and actresses but few famous faces to bring in even a built in audience. Kate Beckinsale, who saw her star power rise dramatically after her role in the 2001 hit Pearl Harbor, is obviously the main focus of the feature and does a wonderful job with her time in the spotlight or lack of light. Beckinsale gives an uber-sexy performance as Selene that may give another leather clad actress, Carrie-Ann Moss, a run for her money in that area. The only problem with her character is that little detail is given to her character's past and even when those details are available, they aren't explored in flashback sequences, which would have relieved some confusion in the plot. Scott Speedman, best known for performance on the late Felicity series on the WB television network, does a best a performance as he can give but as important as his character is to the plot of the film, he really isn't given anything to show off his true acting chops. Bill Nighy, who plays the ancient vampire leader Viktor, gives an entertaining performance that was still quite interesting despite the fact that he doesn't appear till relatively late in the film. The only upsetting fact of the character is the way he dies, which seemed like a slap in the face to the fine performer who worked so hard to set up an engaging character only to be kicked down so quickly.<br/><br/>Overall, Underworld is an insult to the famous play on which it is based, no matter how loosely it is. Poor William Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave! The idea seemed to an interesting one, so what went wrong? A lot of things. Despite having a decent two hour time length, Underworld becomes too bloated by the midway point that by the end, it just gives up and rolls downhill. The plot has too many twists and turns to get a clear understanding of what is going on and ends with more questions then answers. How did the vampires and werewolves start out? How were the werewolves able to evolve so that they could change at random? Why is it the werewolves and vampires seem to have this all out war against each other going on for centuries without the knowledge the human race? Some of those answers may be present in the feature but the main focus becomes so confusing that anything else is pushed out of your mind to even ponder. And even though this is a horror/monster film, Screen Gem could have taken the blood factor down a notch or two as there were too many unnecessary squeamish moments for some to take especially after gobbling down a full bucket of popcorn. The action sequences are well done, though the filmmakers seem to borrow too many elements from The Matrix series to make them even slightly original. So despite an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale and well choreographed action sequences, Underworld comes off as being too long, grim and confusing to recommend above superior fall fare like Once Upon a Time in Mexico.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C+)"
"bdavis-5","8","0","0","20 September 2003"," It's 1980s B Movie!
","5/10. Never mind any positive reviews to the contrary, this is not a good movie! It is better than, say, ""Red Sonja"", but not by too much. I don't have the time to describe everything that is wrong about this movie, and I'm only writing this much because I am shocked at the amount of positive response on this site to date. The biggest problem with Underworld is that not enough is done to establish sympathy and interest in the characters, apart from Selene. The premise of the conflict is set forth, the scenarios and fights are played out, the twists and secrets are revealed, the climatic fight is staged - and I barely care, apart from Selene. Even then, I only except Selene because of Kate Beckinsale's striking allure that stems from her combination of sultry beauty, fine intelligence, and faultless acting. She actually has little to do in the way of emoting, but she does her emoting well. It isn't her fault that there is almost no indication of romantic interest from her or Scott Speedman until the script calls for a kiss to establish it. It isn't her fault that this is a continuous melodrama with no significant break for comedy or romance. (Then again, she lacks enough taste to be engaged to the director of this dog.) My friend Katja put it this way: she has seen better character development in video games. And the score was inconsistent, loud, and mostly lousy. The trailers for this movie are indeed far superior to the product they have been promoting. This is not surprising after one takes a look at the director's resume on this very site and considers that the producers of the trailers probably have more filmmaking experience than he does. And there are plenty of other problems, but, as I said, I don't have the time.<br/><br/>However, I'll admit that there are other good things about it. Bill Nighy as Victor was impressive. Victor's awakening may have supplied one of the most memorable scenes in vampire movie history. And the Budapest Fire Department are real heroes for staying up night after night to supply the film crew with rain water for every single scene in the movie. (It's a gothic, 1980s B-movie, after all.)"

","The movie isn't bad, which is also to say it isn't great.  Somewhat better than the average offering in the sub-genre.  Maybe it's that it tries too much to blend the gritty-city sets of the Nicholson-Keaton Batman, with the sexy vampires of the Anne Rice trend, with all the cool gadgetry of the Blade series.  The story does add some nice twists to the usual bland perspectives on the beasties, and it certainly doesn't hurt to have Kate Beckinsale running around in patent leather, butt-hugging pants.  So it's down to goth/s&m vampires versus the lycans (simply because it is too much effort to say ""Lycanthropes"").  I sided with the Werewolves early on, and it was nice to see them lauded for technological inventiveness, even thought they managed to do their fair share of dumb things.  The casting had some shiners and a few stinkers.  The costumes and sets were great.  The script may have *ahem* bitten off too much for a standard movie length.  Worth seeing, but only once. So the real question becomes: Will this movie make it trendy~cool to be a werewolf now? Gothlings and vamp-wanna-bees beware, there's a new big dog in town."
"TheNorthernMonkee","7","0","0","19 September 2003"," Matrix's Style x Blade's General Theme = Underworld
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I confess that so far this year, few films have really kept me interested from start to finish. ""Terminator 3"" was acceptable but it's best bit was it's end, ""Matrix Reloaded"" was a poor sequel obviously building up towards an ending (which will probably turn out to be disappointing as well) and ""The Hulk"" had a nice twist on the Superhero Genre, but ultimately was a bit slow at times. ""Underworld"" however, reminds us that perhaps there is life in this new stylish approach of Holywood's. The leather is there, continuing on from so many other films, and by no means is anything to do with Vampires or Werewolves a new angle, however this film combines the two in a stunning visual experience, which, unlike other leather clad films of the year (no names mentioned) has at least some understandable well constructed plot.<br/><br/>In ""Underworld"" we're introduced to Selene (Beckinsale in a new lease of life having shifted, at times ineffectively from the innocent British Rose) a hunter of Werewolves who spends all of her time attempting to wipe out this mongrel race for past crimes against her. Eventually we encounter different Werewolves and Vampires (incl the marvellous Sheen as Lucian and Nighy as Viktor) on our way to a typically brutal ending and an even more blatant ending. Truth be told, whilst parts of this film were obvious at times, the almost cliffhanger conclusion was a bit of a surprise to me (weird since Holywood seems obsessed with series of films nowadays), but looking back, no real alternative ending could be considered.<br/><br/>This film is a mindblowing piece of cinema with clever Matrix like styling, but with an element of Blade like vampires. Whilst I confess I do prefer the Vampires in ""Blade"" to the ones here, the Werewolves are powerful sturdy, graphically beautiful creatures with whom you can almost consider our animal instincts coming to life.<br/><br/>If your more of a fan of the more thought provoking, more realistic films based around the 60s or 70s, then why are you reading this review? If you are however an enourmous fan of watching vampires and werewolves cutting shreads out of each other in a modern day, leather clad, pool of violence and intrigue, watch this. Maybe not the best film of the year in Holywood's mind come the next Oscars, but a cult movie (on the scale of Bladerunner) in the making, and definately the pick of the last few months. This is how the Holywood Blockbusters should have been made. Enjoy."

Master vs. Servant!  Father vs. Daughter!  Oh, the drama! How can they fit all this into one movie!  Easy, Underworld leaves out any sense of character development and relies on convoluted and cliched story lines.  But there is plenty of fun action to distract you from remembering you don't give a lick about the leading characters (what was Kate Beckinsale thinking?).  It's like eating Twinkie.

","This is a great movie that depicts the tale of blood feuding rivals meshing modern and gothic times with age-old folklore of Lycans and Vampires. Underworld is not for the timid of heart or squeamish with the perhaps its excessive depiction of violence between the two foes in the combat scenes; then its great score, which at times is a bit more powerful than the movies itself.  These two minor faults bar not any reason for one to see this film. I enjoyed the viewpoint of the storyline told by the younger, more curious mind of Selene trying to understand the struggles and history of her kind; only discover the truths, which have been carefully hidden and unfolds through building ties to Michael.  This tale combines an articulate mix of tragedy and romance, strange allegiances and carefully crafted deceptions. The story leaves the viewer with a desire for a prequel to define the ancestry more and rise of power of the `elders' (Viktor, Marcus and Amelia) and with the obvious ending alluding to a sequel.<br/><br/>I eagerly await both.<br/><br/>(viewed at Toronto Film Festival)"

***** MAY CONTAIN LETHAL DOSES OF SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>
Like most of the abominations that come out of Hollywood in this day and age, this one was heavily promoted. The official posters, overdramatized beyond Sillyness as the custom bides, appear regularly in my morning paper. I say this because the poster for this film was particularly bad.<br/><br/>Now, I did not want to see this movie. I wasted 1 hour of a quite lovely evening watching it together with friends before we in unison decided to skip the rest. Tooold yooou.<br/><br/>Someone on the forum claimed the story was supposed to be located in Budapest. That would make a lot of sense since having vampires in England with fake english accents(THE HORROR) is on the verge of rude. Yes, having hungarian vampires with fake english accents(THE HORROR) is so much more original. In fact, that would make this film so much better. Considering that the legendary vampires actually hail from Romania.<br/><br/>Now, why is this movie so bad then?<br/><br/>1) The bad acting. It wasn't outrageous, and it wasn't every actor. But some, like the antagonist vampire whose name I can't be buggered to remember, really didn't pull what little weight they should have. But what can you expect from movie actors these days?<br/><br/>2) The plot. Oh the plot. Not a single tiny piece or feature of this film is original in any way known to civilized man. The ""antagonist-turning-out-to-be-allied-with-the-enemy-OH-NOZ!!1"" makes me want to break down and cry. In a manly way.<br/><br/>And our heroine so decisively going against said antagonist for no particularly obvious reason except we know he's a right sod and she's TEH BABE.<br/><br/>The whole gimmick with some tech/science bi-person developing custom-made weapons and gadgets for the main characters.<br/><br/>And I dare you to get me started on the shallow and quite life-drainingly bad story-introduction.<br/><br/>Actually, I lied. Leaving out every single religious aspect IS original.<br/><br/>I suspect why though, and it's not very clever. Or interesting.<br/><br/>3) Well, the bloody rest. Curse you Matrix. The whole pathetic setting. Goth. Vampires. Cathedral. Darkness. Rain. Black leather clothes. The chic car. THE CLICH√âES. OH DEAR GOD THE CLICH√âES ARE DEVOURING MY SOUL. Where was I? Ah yes. The busts/statues at the shooting range. The ridiculous shooting scenes. The train fight. The misuse of antichristian creatures.<br/><br/>This could be better but I'm now tired.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 2/10 because I have seen worse films. Can't remember any right now, though.<br/><br/>Observe how I without shame review this film without seeing the second half of it. That is only because I am better than people who would, potentially, disagree with me. And I'm not joking around here.<br/><br/>If you liked this film you will not like The Fearless Vampire Killers, Dracula - Dead And Loving It or Hellsing(anime)."

","I blame the Wachowski Brothers. Ever since The Matrix re-awakened male interest in good-looking, gun-toting laydeez in skin-tight outfits, there's been a stampede of producers looking for a viable geek-porn franchise.<br/><br/>Underworld is one of many sub-Matrix beasts. Kate Beckinsale's Selene dresses in Trinity's black latex cast-offs and uses guns for every conceivable purpose apart from brushing her teeth. The 'Secret War, Searching for The Chosen One' plot ticks a few more Matrix boxes and things are rounded off by some gravity-defying stunts.<br/><br/>I have to admit that Selene's casual leap off a 100ft ledge, landing like a cat and calmly strolling away is a nicely-executed piece of stunt work, but there isn't much else to recommend this movie.<br/><br/>Um, apart from the Lycans. The werewolf makeup is fantastic and the effects really bring these mythical creatures to life.<br/><br/>But now, the downside. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful to look at but she is in a state of perma-sulk all the way through Underworld. One day she'll wake up, look back on her movie career and realise that she never acted at all. Admittedly, there isn't much call for serious dramatic acting in a film like Underworld, but that doesn't stop veteran actor Bill Nighy from giving it a go. Bill and Kate are polar opposites in this movie. Nighy manages to present Viktor as a multi-faceted character, so there's a real sense of drama when it's revealed that he's not as honourable and charitable as you first thought. Beckinsale's Selene just pouts and poses her way through the script, woodenly unconvincing and about as sexy as an action figure of herself.<br/><br/>Miss Beckinsale is not alone. Scott Speedman, the token American, matches our Kate splinter-for-splinter in the wooden department. Wearing a stock 'Confused' mask for most of the movie, he has all the screen presence and charisma of a wardrobe. At the end of the movie his character is transformed into some sort of uber-vampire-werewolf hybrid, but he still fails to raise any hackles and is acted off the screen by Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film, but the sort-of-intriguing plot ended up being subsumed by poor acting and an over-abundance of gun play and dodgy martial arts. Apaarently there's a sequel - that'll be staying on the shelf at Blockbuster the next time I pay a visit."

","Essentially this is a Romeo and Juliette story with vampires and werewolves (imaginatively rechristened ""death dealers"" and ""lycans"")and they use guns instead of swords. The vampires are still dressed like leather bar hookers and the werewolves, excuse me, ""lycans"", look like homeless derelicts on steroids - ""urban feral"" if you will.<br/><br/>For some reason, vampire clans always seem to lounge about in palatial, Gothic mansions and sip wine or blood or what the hell ever, and just generally do their best to impersonate French nobility with their idle chic. These vampires are no different, despite the fact that there is a rabid army of computer generated dog-men out there wanting to tear them to ribbons. One vampire, played by Kate Beckinsale, (I'm tempted to call her ""The Littlest Death Dealer"") sees that an eternal life of posing awkwardly on baroque furniture is going to get them all killed for good and does her best to warn the predictably disinterested elder of her clan that something bad is about to happen.<br/><br/>One, two, skip a few, there's some twists and turns, people get betrayed, love is found, blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>All in all, the whole thing is uninspired. The art direction is stereotypical. You've seen the Gothic mansions, the gooey sewers, so forth and so on before and better in other movies. The acting is not horrible, but how good does it have to be when all the actors do is howl or bare their fake looking fangs? The action scenes - typical MTV, quick edit, see nothing sequences. The wire work is laughably bad and should really be accompanied by a badly synched dub-track. The direction is a pitiful mess. While Len Wiseman may have been trying to capture the dark, Gothic feel of the Underworld, I think he probably should have listened to his cinematographer when the gentleman said, ""We're gonna need more lights."" Of course, maybe Len was hoping that if we didn't see anything, we wouldn't realize just how bad it is.<br/><br/>I give it 2 out of 10, because the ten year old inside of me keeps chanting, ""But vampire fighting werewolves is COOL!""

Enjoyable film and very entertaining if you like this kind of picture, which is must better than the old Vampire Films."

","With its leather-wearing heroine and eternal, blue-filtered night, it's obvious that Underwold is desperate to be cool. Sadly, desperate and cool never go together. Cool movies are those where the director wants to say something in an interesting way, and is enamored of a certain slick style. It's not that cool movies aren't consciously cool, but that they are interested in more than just being cool. In the Matrix the directors were desperate to be profound and say something about the human condition, whereas Tarentino's films are informed by his desire to keep himself amused. Not that I'm a fan of Tarentino by any means, but in his glib way he does have a sense of cool.<br/><br/>But Underworld is just an empty vehicle for slick posturing. It's not just that the movie has nothing profound to say (The Matrix only wanted to be profound, it didn't actually succeed), it's that the movie has nothing to say at all. It exists entirely as a vehicle for the lovely and talented Kate Beckinsale to posture and snarl some forgettable dialog. Even the film's somewhat interesting revelation in the last quarter feels not like a result of deep conviction but simply like something clever the script could toss in.<br/><br/>While the movie is weak in almost everything, it has a workmanlike competence that keeps it watchable. You never connect with the characters, you are never enthralled by the story and the fight scenes aren't especially good, but nothing is really bad enough to stop watching, and the movie is a perfectly acceptable way to kill a couple of hours.<br/><br/>But what it is not is cool."
"Leiten","9","2","5","1 May 2005"," So many fangs I didn't know where to look.
","Ah, vampires and werewolves (aka Lycans). Here we go yet again... Or so it would seem. This movie takes the general idea that randomly seems to hang in the air about these creatures and turns it into the closest thing to reality. The plot is fantastic and gives a great structure for the actual movie. Unfortunately, the script is not so hot. Although most of the time it builds suspense, sometimes it is charged with passion and at others provokes strong emotions from the audience, there are several occasions where it flags a little to say the least and you get a little distracted by something else, such as searching for the already half-empty vodka bottle. There are some lines and, (I hate to say it), mainly during Kate Beckinsale's monologues where you just think 'Get to the point already'. Otherwise, the movie keeps up a great, energetic pace most of the way through.<br/><br/>Other than her monologues which leave much to be desired, Beckinsale's performance leaves you blown away and it perfectly complemented by Scott Speedman's. (Um.... Does anyone else think he has a weird kinda squeaky voice?) Sophia Myles was at her usual average standard and Shane Brolly was fantastic as the wonderfully evil, Selene-obsessed Kraven.<br/><br/>I was however, disappointed at the ending which was, for want of a better word, to put it simply :lame. Really, really lame. I know that its practically the law that every single movie MUST have an ending that allows for a sequel but come on... A little originality please! Overall, mainly due to an almost brilliant script writer and stunning costumes, I gave this movie 9 out of 10 but I don't advise it if your not a vampire movie connoisseur."

","A comic book Gothic horror adventure film with a sort of a female version of Blade clad in leather.

Selene (Kate Beckinsale) a vampire death dealer hunts Lycans and is attracted to a human called Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who the other Lycans are looking for. It seems he is a descendant of the head of the werewolf family and the Lycans want to use Micheal to create a vampire- werewolf hybrid.<br/><br/>This is a shallow stylish film but entertaining with enough action and at least a backstory which gives it some interest. Some hammy acting from the vampires who do not have a decent script to get their teeth into."
"jimbo-53-186511","4","2","6","3 June 2017"," A lot of flash and bang, but it's horrendously underwritten, far too serious and as a result of all this rather dull
","Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire warrior who finds herself slap bang in the middle of a war between werewolves or Lycans and vampires because she falls in love with a human host called Michael (Scott Speedman). But it isn't only Selene that is in the middle of this war it turns out that Michael is part of the war too and he is seemingly an integral part of the battle between the Lycans and the vampires....<br/><br/>First things first this is a stylistic triumph and it's fair to say that it's hard not to be blown away by the visuals and the whole style of the product. Whilst this has a lot of the Matrix style choreography and impressive visuals what it doesn't have is a particularly impressive story or engaging narrative....<br/><br/>There is a war brewing between the Lycans and the vampires and Michael (a human) is unfortunately caught up between the two rivalling factions. Ordinarily, the idea of two warring factions and one man/person being caught in the middle can present itself as being an interesting idea, but with Underworld the whole concept is so poorly conceived and developed that it gets to the point where you find yourself rather indifferent to everything.<br/><br/>The film's true shining glory is in its style and presentation; it's clear that director Len Wiseman has watched the Matrix and other Wachowski films as his approach here feels very similar; eye-popping visuals and impressive choreography, but the narrative feels hollow and underwritten and as a story it never really engages.<br/><br/>The performances are a mixed bag and whilst Kate Beckinsale is absolutely gorgeous she is very bland in the lead role (and it really pains me to say this as I was a big fan of her late father when he was in Porridge). Her supporting cast do fare better with the likes of Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill Nighy all of whom put in solid supporting performances.<br/><br/>One other thing working against the film (other than Beckinsale's performance) is the unrelentingly drab and gloomy tone. The whole tone of the film is way too dark and coupled with a weak and underwritten narrative it also feels quite boring and it's fair to say that the two hour running time feels at least 50% longer than the actual run time.<br/><br/>Underworld will undoubtedly impress younger viewers who may get taken in by the garish visuals, but for mature audiences or for anyone with half a brain the dreary tone and weak story are going to serve more as an annoyance and make one wish that they'd left the Underworld well alone."

","The entire concept of vampires and werewolves (lycans, yeah whatever) in a long suffering feud was a great idea. Even the idea of one of the races trying to make a hybrid of the two was intriguing. But instead of developing the characters, making them likable, or even interesting, everything is coated in shadows, everyone looks like a perfect goth caricature, and no one shows genuine emotion. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous, even appropriately sullen, but she isn't given much to work with dialog-wise while Scott Speedman is boring and unconvincing and it's sad to see the initially great-sounding plot ultimately take a backseat to tired over stylization and done-to-death action sequences."

","Out of the blue, a hunky average-Joe hospital intern named Michael (Scott Speedman) is targeted by beings who turn out to be ""Lycans"", or werewolves. It turns out that there's been a war waging between Vampires and Lycans for centuries, and Michael's caught up in it because the Lycans have taken a keen interest in him. The Vampire who begins protecting Michael on a regular basis is the tough-as-nails Selene (a black leather clad, super sexy Kate Beckinsale). She also must deal with the traitorous Kraven (Shane Brolly) and Lycan head honcho Lucian (Michael Sheen).<br/><br/>Admittedly, some of the gadgets here are cool. Each side has devised special bullets guaranteed to mess up opponents badly. Director Len Wiseman serves up a lot of fast and furious action, and the kind of rapid cutting common to so many modern films of this kind. Beckinsale looks exquisite while kicking ass, and Speedman is sure to get plenty of hearts fluttering himself. All of that said, it's hard to care very much about the characters for quite a while, until Wiseman starts giving the actors more dramatic moments. Even then, the film looks and feels drab, with characters struggling to keep their emotions in check. The heavy reliance on digital technology, unfortunately, turns too many of the effects into cartoons. (Not that this is surprising; ""Underworld"" was obviously done to have a comic book sort of approach.) The werewolves, in particular, look pretty bad. This is dark, rainy stuff with atmosphere to spare (this was filmed in Hungary), slick to a fault, but never very involving. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the ""things are not as they seem"" plot twist, although some viewers may charge that they saw it coming well ahead of time.<br/><br/>Beckinsale and Speedman are nicely supported by a talented bunch of actors. Sheen is charismatic, Bill Nighy has excellent screen presence as head Vampire Viktor, and Sophia Myles has plenty of sex appeal herself in the role of Erika. Brolly isn't so hot, however; his reaction to hearing some ""shocking"" news is priceless.<br/><br/>Screenplay by actor Danny McBride, with story credit going to McBride, fellow actor Kevin Grevioux (both of them also have roles in the film), and director Wiseman.<br/><br/>Followed by three more ""Underworld"" features.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

","Title: Underworld<br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: A war between vampires and lycans has been raging for thousands of years. A deathdealing vampire is trying to find out what the lycans want with a human. <br/><br/>Notable Acting: This is one of those films where I feel like they hit the nail on the head with every casting call, having Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman as your lead roles gets your attention and keeps it throughout the movie. The secondary characters such as Michael Sheen and Shane Brolly are great actors as well. Everyone played their part greatly <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: Classic and simple action movie range of shots, focusing more on the framing of the shot than the angle or camera work of it. <br/><br/>Graphics: Be it the CGI that is used to show what happens to a vampire once they are shot with a UV round or what happens internally once a lycan changes, the CGI is of a really high quality in this movie. The CGI for the lycans when they have changed is one of the best that I have seen in a long while, there will not be another good movie involving good CGI werewolves until some time past 2014, as the other good movie with CGI werewolves was a year before this movie. <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: Silver nitrate doesn't look like a silver liquid, it is generally a clear liquid. The bullets in this movie wouldn't have anywhere to store the gunpowder as the clear casings for the UV and liquid silver nitrate show only the liquid and not enough of the shell for gun power to be stored. If the weapons were using compressed air, that would make this acceptable, but seeing as they are not. They say Viktor is the oldest and strongest of the vampires, but it is then later established that he was turned by Marcus who was the first vampire and is still living, this contradicts itself. <br/><br/>Overall Feel: This is franchise has answered the question fantasy and mythology nerds have been asking for years. ""Who would win in a fight? A vampire or a werewolf?"" This movie and franchise has basically been answering that question since 2003. In 1998 we had blade and other similar movies which had a man fighting vampires, but this movie went a step further. The movie strikes the dark Gothic tone that a movie like this needs and the level of gore is at a good level with there not being too much gore that you become desensitized by it and not too little that you are left disappointed."

The plot and the stories with sequels and prequels aren't all that bad, even though highly illogical. <br/><br/>The writers could, though, have scored a few pointers in studying fairy-tales somewhat closer. What really makes this series of films interesting is the religio-philosophical and allegorical idea that lies behind. <br/><br/>Now, I will not go deeper into this realm in this review, lest I open the door to a Dantean inferno that I am not willing to enter, nor let others enter into. Thus I will just leave it to others there. <br/><br/>Maybe others are willing to pilpul the matter further, and deeper - and end up with some kind of final halakha at some later date in the future.

Summary of the story is that you have a guy who is destined to become a werewolf (lychan is what they are called in the movie) and for some reason Kate's character takes a liking to him.

","...making a hamburger while I missed out on a great Vampire-Lycan movie that stars Kate Beckinsale as the Vampire Selene. I took the disc out and inserted it again while my sister was telling me that I suck sh*t. The movie was great, it had plenty of action, scares, fights, and great special effects. Bill Nighy gives the best performance in this movie as he portrays a Vampire that goes by the name of Viktor along side his Vampire-daughter Kate Beckinsale A.K.A Selene. Scott Speedman could have done better but he was still alright while Sophie Myles sucked big turd. Vampire lovers will definitely like this movie and the same with Lycan (Werewolf) lovers. It tells a story of a war that has raged on for centuries between Vampires and their one-time slaves the Lycans. The battles are brutal, hardcore, full of energy, and very stylish. I have to give two thumbs up to the special effects guys and the makeup artists. The Vampires need to be all white and cold and the makeup artists have done that really good. The special effects guys were really neat when the humans change into Lycans and they looked cool and Lycan-like. Len Wiseman has directed a great movie with some flaws that get bigger and bigger as the movie progresses. The picture for Underworld looks really creative because you can see Selene (Vampire) stand on the ledge and in the background you can see a Lycan (on the moons surface. The film has a dark atmosphere that engulfs you and gives you a great good movie type of feeling. I strongly suggest that you don't eat popcorn during the movie because you will likely throw up at the person nearest to you and vice versa.<br/><br/>Selene, a Vampire, fights Lycans through night like many other Vampires. It's when she meets Michael, a hybrid of both species, and falls in love with him and later she struggles to stop the unnecessary war. Fighting through her own kind as well as Lycans, she has to protect Michael from dying because he is the only one who can settle this.<br/><br/>The battles are purely fantastic and it never disappoints. The sound through the battles are amazing and they make the battles a little bit better. The story is excellent but sometimes is a little tiny bit slow. The battles that are the best are in the end with Michael in his hybrid form fighting Vampires. Surround sound will make the viewing a little bit better. Don't think about buying this because you won't watch this everyday, renting is much smarter. Underworld is great and the sequels are necessary but the third one is totally a waste of money. We know what's going to happen anyway because they tell us this in this film. Underworld is so good it will have your blood boiling to maximum temperature (am I exaggerating?). The script is pretty exceptional but a little bit more work could have been done on it. Overall, this is a enjoyable film that will work for some and not so for others. As I said, Renting will be better."

","I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. After seeing other vampire films like the Blade trilogy or 30 days of night I was really disappointed with them. It was hard for me to find an enjoyable vampire/werewolf movie until this came along then I decided to give it a shot. I was happy with it, I really liked the idea of vampire vs. werewolves. When I saw this film I had no interest in Kate Beckinsale what so ever although she was fun to watch kick butt on screen. Unfortunately there were some problems that I had with her character Selene and Scott Speedsman who plays Michael Corvin, which I will talk about momentarily. I was more interested in the characters Viktor (Bill Nighy), Kraven (Shane Brolly), and Lucian (Michael Sheen). Lucian was my favorite I sympathized with him way more than any of the other characters on screen. Even though in the beginning of the film we get the impression that Lucian is the bad guy; as we get further along in the film you begin to realize that he is in fact the hero and a victim. You understand his reasons for doing the things he does. I was really interested in learning more about Lucian's past so I was really happy when Underworld Rise of the Lycans was released but thats another review.<br/><br/>Now here come the things that I hated. First off let me just say that I absolutely can't stand when the writers of a film try to force a relationship between the two main characters in a film. I can't stand it. A perfect example of this would be Neo and Trinity from the matrix films and this one. Usually when I watch a film and the writers decide to throw in a love story I have to ask myself this one specific question What are the characters reasons for liking each other? what do they mean to one another? If this question isn't answered then we have a problem. The relationship between Michael Corvin and Selene in this film was so rushed and forced that I didn't believe for a second that these two were so into each other not to mention the character Michael was so undeveloped it was ridiculous. it was hard to even call him a character he was more of a plot device, there was nothing to really like about him. Michael and Selene fell in love because the plot needed them to, there is no attraction between these characters. Having the two main characters pointlessly hook up only gives the writers the excuse to write a pointless sex scene in the sequel(see Underworld Evolution).<br/><br/>Other than this I thought this was a really good film. Its a movie you would watch on a rainy day when there's nothing else on TV."

","Not usually being a fan of horrific and gory vampire/werewolf sagas, i began watching Underworld with some apprehension. However, 5 minutes in I had already realised how much i would rate this movie by the end. The setting was dark enough for there to be a sombre, threatening atmosphere, and although, like many films of the genre, the plot line was a little self-indulgent, Beckinsale carried the film with style.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was also excellent, but Beckinsale is clearly the star of this movie; her character's 'girl power' attitude and fondness for jumping off tall buildings in magnificent black stilettos satisfying many female viewers (the stilettos demand respect, even if the jumps are computer-generated), whilst her aesthetically pleasing figure permanently clad in black leather adds to the enjoyment of the male audience - if they weren't already satisfied with vampires, werewolves and guns.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this to blood-sucking gore junkies, as there probably isn't enough horror to satisfy you, but if you're looking for a punchy, well-executed, enjoyable film and you don't shy away from small amounts of blood or horror then this may be for you."

","being a movie about leather-clad vampires fighting werewolves with guns, underworld will never be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and brilliant work of art, but thats not what it wants to be in the first place. it wants to entertain, and while doing so, it manages to be a surprisingly good movie too.<br/><br/>no, underworld hardly breaks any new ground. and yes, it has its flaws. the limitations of the budget show throughout the movie, the action scenes are quite unspectacular for an action movie, and Shane Brolly is just terrible. but the rest of the cast does pretty well. especially Kate Beckinsale plays the lead character to perfection and she has great chemistry with romantic interest Scott Speedman and father figure Bill Nighy. the Gothic set and costume designs are beautiful. the most surprising thing, however, is how well constructed the story is. this kind of action/fantasy/sci-fi movies often have terrible plots, but underworld is built on a story that actually makes sense, comes with a decent twist, and even resonates emotionally. while its not as good as matrix, its much better than van hellsing, catwoman, aeon flux, ultraviolet, or about any other movie of this kind."
"quatermax-1","7","1","2","8 February 2008"," Target audiences and horror fans will love it...
","This movie has had some bad press, so, as you can imagine, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying it and actually wondering what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>Underworld, as a little too lengthy a prologue tells us, is set in a world where humans unknowingly share the planet with two other warring species ¬ñ the Vampires and the Lycans (Werewolves). The war has lasted for centuries and the Vampires are winning ¬ñ or so they think. The Lycans have got a few little genetically modified tricks up their furry sleeves and some moles in the Vampire camp (now it's not often you can string that kind of a sentence), and when a romance starts to develop between a Vampire and a prospective Lycan, all the old wounds are opened - and eagerly chewed at. Sorry.<br/><br/>The plot is reasonably, but not too, complicated and has a few nice twists. The imagery is suitably dark and Crow-like (Brandon, not Russell) and being mostly filmed in Budapest the architecture is decidedly Anton Furst/Gotham City Gothic.<br/><br/>The action too is derivative of many other films: there's plenty of John Woo double-fisted gunfire; Lots of Matrix leaping around in long coats and tight leather; American Werewolf transformation scenes (sometimes a little jerky), and a fair share of Blade-style bloodletting.<br/><br/>And this is why I think it got the negative reviews it did. It is shamelessly derivative. Fortunately though the story and some good performances make up for this, and it's hard to see how else they could have told such a story without these style graphics, and after all, if something is proved to work well, then use it, and I think audiences have now come to expect it.<br/><br/>Also enjoyable to watch is the usually light comedy actor Bill Nighy (Love Actually) who obviously felt it was time to (literally) get his teeth into something a bit meatier, as he revels in the role of the Vampire Lord Viktor.<br/><br/>Target audiences and horror fans will love it, though there will be uproar when they see Vampires casting reflections in mirrors. But Kate does look good in that leather. Move over Trinity"
"FilmCreature","8","1","2","15 January 2008"," FilmCreature Reviews 'Underworld'
","'Underworld' is a film totally misunderstood by critics nationwide. This is not the kind of movie you take seriously. You will not weep or be shaken with emotion. Instead, with the right mindset (and surrounded by friends each with a bowl of popcorn) you might just have a fun time watching it.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale does some great work here. This is no Academy Award-winning (or even Saturn Award-winning) character play, but Selene is such a sleek, lethal vamp that we can't help but just love her to death. Bill Nighy does great things with his vamp as well; Viktor is one of those great villains that Satan would flee from (yes, I just quoted Ebert). Scott Speedman is effective but not amazing. As for Shane Brolly...just try to ignore him. And finally, the lovely Sophia Myles. I actually liked her character quite a lot; her conniving, quietly lustful vampire Erika is great, but I would have liked to have seen more of her scheming ways.<br/><br/>'Underworld' is obvious campy, but it's not boring, which is the number one thing it has going for it. Boring camp is tragic and awful at the same time, but 'Underworld', fortunately, has some nice performances and great effects, and the Gothic environments conjure up memories of 'Dark City' and 'The Matrix' in which no place is safe. Not even for a super-powered vampire princess.<br/><br/>3/4"

Sheen is an excellent actor with an impressive list of diverse roles including recently portraying Tony Blair in ""The Queen. Sophia Myles is currently playing in ""Moonlight"" a vampire series on CBS, I guess the genre fit her. Bill Nighy who has popped up in many movies lately, in Pirates of the Caribbean and Love Actually.

"zardoz-13","8","1","2","29 July 2007"," ""Underworld"" is still a good horror thriller that you can sink your fangs into and enjoy for its vitality.
","Synthesize elements from famous film franchises like ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade"" to forge a bullet-riddled, revisionist vampires-vs.-werewolves urban war epic, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect from the exciting, new, fantasy chiller ""Underworld"" starring ""Pearl Harbor"" beauty Kate Beckinsale. This supercharged but synthetic British horror thriller with R-rated heaps of blood & gore and a touch of Shakespeare plays fast and loose with vampire lore. Not only do the vamps refrain from shape shifting into bats, but also these pale-faced bloodsuckers can stare at their reflections in the mirror! Were that not enough these fangsters don't have to shack up for the day in their caskets. On the other hand, rookie director Len Wiseman and stuntman-turned-scenarist Danny McBride adhere to the lycanthrope legend with no radical departures. <br/><br/>Action-packed from the outset, this darkly-lensed, tragic melodrama laid in a rain swept contemporary setting provides enough different things along the way with a couple of major plot revelations to boost ""Underworld"" above its formulaic origins. For example, the vampires load their automatic weapons with silver nitrate slugs, while the werewolves pack cartridges filled with ultra-violet light to literally let daylight through their sworn enemies. The special effects sequences that depict the transformation from man into werewolf look cool, and the sight of these scary creatures hauling butt on the walls in pursuit of their prey make for memorable images. One especially clever scene shows a werewolf as he uses his bodily powers to pop the bullets out of his wounds.<br/><br/>Although it runs a little over two hours, ""Underworld"" maintains enough momentum in its melodramatic narrative and features strong enough villains that it entertains you without giving you nightmares. Surprisingly, though it looks like it should have descended from a graphic novel, ""Underworld"" boasts no previous source material aside from an original story penned by black stuntman-turned-actor Kevin Grevioux, former ""Stargate"" art director Wiseman, and McBride himself. When the bullets aren't thudding noisily in your ears, ""Underworld"" features a deafening, industrial-strength, orchestral soundtrack written by ex-Tangerine Dreamer Paul Haslinger with songs written by David Bowie and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciate.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale plays a leather-clad vampire warrior named Selene who cannot kill enough werewolves to satisfy her thirst for revenge. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a no-holds-barred war from centuries, and the vampires finally appear to have gotten the upper hand over the Lycans. According to Selene, these hideous Lycans wiped out her entire family and would have killed her too had it not been for vampire elder Viktor (Bill Nighy of ""Hitler's S.S.: Portrait in Evil"") who saved her life and turned her into a vampire. Meanwhile, as Viktor rests in his tomb, his hand-picked prot√©g√© Craven (Shane Brolly of ""Impostor"") appears to have turned traitor to his own kind. Secretly, Kraven has been negotiating a truce behind the scenes with the Lycans who are trying to develop a serum which will enable Lycans and vampires to mate. Naturally, when Selene awakens Viktor and reveals Kraven's insidious plot, all hell breaks loose. Furthermore, it doesn't help matters that the apparently whipped Lycans are far from whipped as Selene learns in an opening shoot-out in a subway tunnel. No, human society doesn't know about the millennium war happening right under their noses, because the vampires and werewolves conceal themselves so well. In fact, the vampires maintain their own blood bank, so they don't have to bleed humans dry. Once a rebellious Selene resurrects Viktor to punish the treacherous Kraven, the action really slams into high gear. Despite Kraven's assurances to the contrary that the werewolves have been eliminated as a threat, Selene sets out to convince Viktor that the werewolves are staging a comeback. Nothing can stop our hardnosed heroine from proving her point, even if she must turn against her own breed. Apparently, the Lycans have found a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman of ""Duets"") who can assimilate both vampire and werewolf DNA so as to reproduce. Complications arise when Michael saves Selene's life, and she finds herself attracted to him. In ""Underworld,""<br/><br/>Director Len Wiseman, who served as art director not only on the theatrical ""Stargate"" but also ""Independence Day,"" makes the most of his threadbare $20-million production so that ""Underworld"" can compete with the films that inspired it. Set amid gloomy, Gothic castles where the elitist vampires huddle in their fight against evil, ""Underworld"" stresses adrenaline-laced action with just enough time out for the exposition to keep audiences on track about who's who. While the characters aren't as substantial as they could be, each shows a different side as the plot approaches its climax. Selene changes from a mindless werewolf killer from the get-go when she learns the truth about her family and the heroic vampire who saved her from sure death. Tucked away in the flashbacks is another story that revolves around the villainous Viktor that explains his hatred of all things Lycan.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, for a British-produced movie, ""Underworld"" ignores sex, nudity, and romance in favor of bloodletting and mutilation. Although it cannot compare with ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld""manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production. The fact that the Brits were able to produce their own variation on these popular, special effects laden spectacles is reason enough to watch it. Unfortunately, like the vampires here who refuse to countenance interspecies breeding, nearly 90 per cent of American film critics have staked out this well-made thriller because they feel it offers nothing new and lacks the polished production values of those other film franchises. Truth is that getting a large scale action film like ""Underworld"" made in England by Englishmen amounts to something like a miracle. <br/><br/>While it doesn't look as polished as ""The Crow,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Blade,"" ""Underworld"" is still a good horror thriller that you can sink your teeth into and enjoy for its vitality."
"nichomach","8","1","2","28 June 2007"," A rattling good yarn...
","Strong performances, a taut storyline and well-handled direction make this an excellent action film. Beckinsale shines as Selene, and Nighy's turn as Viktor has me halfway convinced that he actually IS a creature of the night. The effects are thorough without being intrusive, and there's no sense of ""CGI overload"". Scott Speedman handles the role of Michael well, conveying the character's disorientation and confusion excellently, as well as bringing real presence to the d√©nouement. I'm going to mention Beckinsale again, because she's simply fabulous; coolly distant one minute, furiously impassioned the next, she brings a welcome range and depth to a role that could so easily have been botched (sorry Alba, there's only one Dark Angel, and she drives a Maserati... *grin*). A film that doesn't pretend to be anything other than excellent entertainment, and it doesn't have to. Thoroughly enjoyable throughout."

"gerardowmby","10","1","2","12 November 2006"," A Great Spiritual Movie and Sequel
","These two films measure up with the great epics like The Mahabharata, The Ramayana, or The Odyssey, where victims slay the demons released into the world. In defense of the violence in both Underworld I and II, even the ancient classic epics were filled with violence -- and for a good reason: Good must overcome evil. Then there are the heroes. Selene is only superficially a monster. As a child, she is victimized by Viktor. After his resurrection, she follows him, idolizes him, seeks his help, and after learning the truth, that he killed her parents and turned her into a vampire, kills him. Michael is also victimized when he is bitten, and though they are monsters, this victimization allows us to sympathize with them.<br/><br/>Both Underworld and its sequel take place entirely at night, where the dark forces thrive. In the end, after the main characters kill the most powerful of the demons (both vampire and werewolf), the rising sun, the first light seen in either film, illuminates the world as the heroes celebrate their eternal life and love, and we are left to wonder how they will spend their eternity together. The Light has finally overcome the darkness. I am astonished that Underworld is Len Wiseman's directorial debut. To accomplish these two great works of art so young in life is a testament to his genius.<br/><br/>Now for the bad news. The Extended Cut version ties for first place with Three Burials of Marquiades Estrada for worst DVD commentary of all time. The director and his lovely wife crack jokes and throw popcorn during the entire flick. The boredom is occasionally punctuated by Scott Speedman popping up with ""I did not!"", squealing like a girl. I learned nothing from it, and neither will you. Don't spend the extra money for the Extended Cut. Even the other features are not very good.<br/><br/>Three Burials? The commentary is given by two Joneses and a Yoakum. The movie was C- and the DVD commentary was unbearable. Tommy Lee Jones, January Jones, and Dwight Yoakum sat in near silence during the entire movie and made inane comments now and then. One example: After another period of about five minutes of silence, I snapped out of my nap when January Jones popped up with, ""Tommy, wasn't that your barn?"" Tommy: ""Yeah, that was my barn."" Good to know! And Dwight, I love you, but stick with music."
"The_Void","8","1","2","18 January 2006"," Entertaining action fare...
","Vampires and werewolves in a Romero and Juliet style story? When you think about it, Underworld really should have been great; but despite being disappointing on the whole, special effects guru turned director Len Wiseman has still managed to turn out a good film. In fact, he's done quite well; as when you consider that Underworld is a story of a century old war, a love story, a Matrix-style actioner and sees the creation of a 'new' monster, it could have been a hell of a lot messier than it is. It's clear that Wiseman thinks this movie is better than it is, as it constantly takes itself too seriously and the frequent attempts at storytelling try to hard to create a story around the vampires and werewolves; but on the other hand, the mythology is well done and I'd rather Underworld be too serious than a complete joke. The plot, as mentioned, follows a war between vampires and werewolves. It's been going on for ages, but there's been a new development in the form of Michael; a 'carrier' who could become the link between the two warring sides.<br/><br/>Visually, the film looks great. It can be said that it looks a lot like a music video, but the slick dark visuals bode very well with the action set pieces, and music video or not; at least the style suits the film. The star of the show is very much Kate Beckinsale. I like her anyway, but she looks far hotter in this movie than in any others I've seen her in previously or since. The movie makes the best of having this fine lady wearing a tight cat suit and long leather coat, and although it does this so much that a lack of other ideas becomes obvious; I really aren't complaining. The rest of the cast is mostly made up long haired, ""European"" men, with only Bill Nighy standing out among them in his role as a vampire elder. The action set pieces are way over the top, yet always entertaining, and since vampires and werewolves don't really exist...they can be forgiven for going overboard. The special effects are pretty good too, considering they're CGI. They're almost always shown in darkness...but I prefer dark and good, to clear and rubbish. On the whole, this really isn't great. The romance is hardly touched on, there's better action in The Matrix and it's a little messy; but I really enjoyed it, Kate Beckinsale is awesome and it's entertaining on the whole."

","This movie surprised me. I first heard about it through a friend, but I never really went to see it in theaters. I finally saw it in July of 05 with a friend, and it was after I had read the novelization with Greg Cox.(which happens to be way more Goryier and it has way more plot)I thought the plot spanned to more than just Matrix/Romeo & Juliet W/ Vampires & werewolves. It had a bunch of subplots and sometimes they confused me. I thought that the best performances came from Kate Beckinsale as the Warrior Selene, Bill Nighy as the Head Honcho Vampire Viktor, and Michael Sheen as Lucian, the presumed Dead werewolf. Scott Speedman did an alright job as the human Michael, who get's caught up in the mess, but sometimes, he just looked like a wounded puppy. What really annoyed me the most was the way Shane Brolly(Kraven) who kept switching his accent from American to Irish. But other than that, the movie was pretty good. The cinematography was really cool, and the werewolves were pretty good for non CG. I would have liked more back story though, like what happened to Michael's Girlfriend, even though I had already seen it in the book. Oh well. That's what the extended version is for, right?"

","As far as action horrors go, Underworld is only really topped by a few A* grade movies like Versus and Aliens. The combination of intricate Hollywood style gunplay and a crazed drive-in style story about a war between vampires and werewolves goes down an absolute treat as far as I'm concerned. Add into this great turns from all of the cast, and the movie starts to fly just as a concept.<br/><br/>The execution lives up to the idea for once. Bullets fly, werewolves leap and vampires wail with both great energy and solidity. Underworld has a real grounded feel that helps avoid it losing its way in self parody like the painful Van Helsing. It also looks gorgeous, all washed out blues and Gothic architecture, managing to be both convincingly urban and thrillingly dark at the same time.<br/><br/>It's had more than its fair share of detractors, but personally Underworld is one of my favourite action/horror films, and it's never a chore to watch it, despite it's somewhat indulgent length. If you haven't seen this yet, you're missing out."
"jiujitsu_jesus","6","1","2","20 April 2005"," Not bad, not great either
","UNDERWORLD is a hybrid horror movie, a cross-pollination of genres containing elements of action, fantasy drama, and good-old-fashioned chills and thrills. It tells the tale of a war amongst the supernatural underbelly of a city, in which a clan of Vampires is pitted against that of the Werewolves in a savage guerilla war sparked by an archaic feud between the two races. While this rather interesting concept sets the stage for what looked like a decent horror film, the ungainly, confused script, overdone visual effects and a few rather grating performances let the entire movie down into the depths of mediocrity.<br/><br/>The basic thematic premise of the film - that is, that the viewer must ultimately choose which side, the Vampires or the Lycans, is in the right- is very interesting, but unfortunately, the poorly-planned and unbalanced plot doesn't give us much room to manoeuvre. For starters, the central character, Selene (an aesthetically appealing but often emotionless Kate Beckinsale), is a Vampire; as a result, we are given a fairly one-sided view of the action for at least the first half of the film. The plot would have been much more balanced if the key protagonist had therefore been Michael Corvin, Scott Speedman's character, a human with the potential to resolve the conflict. Through his perspective, this film would have unfolded much more coherently - however, with Selene dominating the film, the result is that the Vampires have much more screen time.<br/><br/>Then again, this may not matter, for another flaw in the plot is that, in the end, we aren't given any scope for a moral choice between the two sides - and one is much more appealing than the other anyway. The Lycans are excellently presented, well-acted, and the scariest and most interesting characters in the film;while they don't exactly turn out to be in the right, so to speak, they come off with the moral high ground. The Vampires, on the other hand, are mostly boring and poorly acted, too similar to ordinary humans to be remotely frightening or interesting,and come through as a bunch of hedonistic toffs in Matrix-style leather; furthermore, their leader, Viktor (played by Bill Nighy) turns out to be a fascist old viper who instigated the war between the races in the first place. As for the war itself, while the action scenes are well-planned and blisteringly kinetic(particularly the fight in the subway), it simply doesn't try hard enough to frighten you. It may say ""Horror"" on the video case, but don't expect nightmares from UNDERWORLD.<br/><br/>Presenting this interesting but half-baked plot is a mostly skillful cast, who have been held back, if at all, by their overdone and unconvincing dialogue. Only Michael Sheen and Scott Speedman shine, putting on masterful and appropriately Gothic performances, and respectively providing some of the rare, genuinely frightening moments in the film. Bill Nighy is too brilliant an actor to ever come off badly, but he doesn't seem to be exerting much effort in this characterisation; Shane Brolly is stomach-churningly woeful, with his ""acting"" consisting primarily of scowling and muttering through clenched teeth; and Robbie Gee, while his delivery is good, is failed by his ridiculously corny dialogue.<br/><br/>The visuals in this film are its major saving grace. The cinematography is fluid, atmospheric and energetic; the sets are intensely Gothic and hauntingly beautiful; and, while the graphically-depicted blood and gore gets a little tiresome towards the end of the film, the special effects are otherwise dazzling, particularly the transformation sequences, which are the best I've seen in a long time. While the Vampires' leather and the martial-arts antics of the Lycans remind us, not fondly or amusingly, of THE MATRIX and THE TERMINATOR, they fit in surprisingly well with the strong Gothic ambiance.<br/><br/>UNDERWORLD is a brilliant concept that was failed by its script; it is a beautiful piece of film-making that doesn't quite have the substance to fill its beautiful sets. Lakeshore have doomed this one to mediocrity- but it's worth a look if you stumble across it as you rummage in the bargain bin. 6/10."
"philip_vanderveken","7","1","2","8 April 2005"," A nice mix of old and new styles
","In recent years there has been a boom of comic book and fantasy movies and to be honest, only a few of them was really worth my attention. On the other hand I must say that I like (good) vampire movies, so that's why I gave ""Underworld"" a try, even though I have to admit that I didn't expect too much about it.<br/><br/>This movie is more than a vampire movie, because the creators have added another mythical creature to the story: the Werewolf. The Vampires and the Lycan (that's the name of the werewolves) are in a war that has been going on for centuries, but that has never been seen by humans. Until now, because the Lycans have found a human that can bond with vampire blood and Lycans blood at the same time and they want to use him as a secret weapon to exterminate the vampires. Selene, a beautiful vampire warrior, uncovers the plot that could prove fatal for her entire race and shadows Michael, the Lycan's supposed human target. She falls in love with him, but doesn't know that he was infected by the Lycans and therefor means a thread to her and the entire convent...<br/><br/>What I liked most about this movie was its mix of old and new. This movie has a very Gothic setting (even though some parts of the city are modern) and the vampires still look like ancient aristocrats, but they use advanced weapons and even drive fancy sports cars. Normally I wouldn't really like the mix of those styles, but this time it did work pretty well.<br/><br/>Of course this movie is full of action scenes, but there has also been enough attention for details like clothing and make-up and decors. The acting was OK and the story looked a bit as if it was influenced by ""The Matrix"", which isn't a bad thing. All in all this is a decent modern vampire movie that will be loved most by the fans, but that is certainly worth a watch, even when you don't like the genre all that much. I give this movie a 7.5/10."

","First of all I am a vampire slash horror movie fan. I am and I'm proud to admit it. And I loved this movie, even though it's not horror. Horror movies are a dying breed. They are being replaced by gore/gross movies, that are not scary, they just make you sick. They are also being replaced by fantasy movies like this one. You can hardly be scared by this movie, but you can be fascinated. It is a nice mix of fantasy, action and special effects, so very popular these days. Usually I'm not a big special effects fan, in my opinion they mostly spoil movies, making them one big special effect with no room for a good plot that can unwind nicely (this is the case with Van Helsing, another movie starring Kate Beckinsale). In Underworld they fit nicely, the movie would probably work with less, but I have no great complaints about that and the plot works. <br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale gives a great performance (she was probably really sick or something when they were shooting Van Helsing) It is a movie worth seeing in a movie theater. There is no point in writing about the plot, so in short it's vampires fighting werewolves. It's nicely done (possible SPOILER) and there is no absolute bad guy (end Spoiler). You know how in movies they can come pretty close to what a vampire looks like in your head, but they can never come close to what a werewolf should look like? Well here they almost make it. Almost for me, maybe they look exactly like you picture them in your mind's eye.<br/><br/>I was fascinated by the movie even though at first they called it a Blade rip-off. In my opinion it's better than Blade (I'm very sorry if you're a Blade fan) and I kind of like Blade. The only thing that was similar was the way the story is ""told"". No vampires lurking in dark corners, preying on people, but vampires fighting one thing or another, no human vampire hunters with wooden sticks...you get the point. Vampires (and werewolves) in modern world using modern technology to aid them in their fight."
"kenhe","7","1","2","10 December 2004"," Too much action, not enough horror
","I suppose it's my own fault that I had such great expectations from this movie, I had hoped for a standard horror thriller, with innocent human victims preyed upon and devoured by vampires and werewolves in the course of the conflict. And indeed, that is how Underworld started out, but quickly this movie transformed itself into a routine, and not particularly exciting action flick. In my opinion, in horror movies the supernatural antagonists have to inflict their savagery on relatively defenseless victims, victims who ultimately conquer and kill these predators by some clever and unexpected ruse. <br/><br/>In this movie, first of all, both vampires and werewolves are equally unsympathetic to humans since both use their formidable powers to prey upon their unaware,unsuspecting and usually defenseless victims. Secondly, both of these groups of supernatural creatures were equally powerful, having achieved what could be called a balance of power in terms of their pretty standard weaponry. Thirdly, and finally, both sides got so tied up with their fantastic martial arts, their pistols, machine guns, and magic bullets, and even their car chases, that I soon forgot that they were supposed to be supernatural creatures of the night at all and they simply turned into Matrix wannabes. <br/><br/>I felt that the sets were suitably eerie, the costumes beautiful, the acting better than average, and the plot of the film, when it was finally made clear at the denouement, quite acceptable. In fact, I feel that had the script been tweaked just a little, making one side somewhat more unfairly devious and even a little more powerful, that as a viewer I might have enjoyed an effective horror film, rather than a run of the mill action thriller, with vampires and werewolves in place of van Damme or Stallone. <br/><br/>I can still recall, and relish, the rather ancient horror thriller of Frankenstein meets the Wolfman as managing to effectively coordinate fear, horror, and a pretty good fight scene without sacrificing the basic intent of the film."

With these prejudices I was quite hesitant to watch the movie and skipped the opportunity several times... Until I now decided to give it a chance.<br/><br/>And I was AMAZED! The main part of any movie should be the story being told. Many movies draws your attention by use of the main character's bulging attributes (i.e. Lara Croft) or state of the art digital special effects. In this movie the story IS the centre of attention. Special effects are awesome, but not exaggerated. Kate is beautiful, but modest. The story is generally true to the idea I myself have of werewolves and vampires, but a bit twisted and modernized which makes it even more interesting. And the musical score is vowen nicely into the movie, not standing out but rather adding the appropriate atmosphere to the experience of watching the movie.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for those whose interests in movies generally focuses on ""eye-candy"".

","This movie is one of the best horror films of recent years that I have seen.

The actors are great, the characters are enigmatic, the plot is constantly taking twists and turns and it never becomes dull or boring for one second. It mixes the action, the drama and the setting to provide a very interesting story that makes you wish for it to continue past the ending scenes. There must be a million vampire/werewolf stories out there, and I certainly don't pretend to know about all of them or most of them,but I would have to say that, with my limited knowledge, this is an original idea and it worked great in this movie.The dark, florescent type of cinematography that accompanies the sets and scenery only contribute to the dark mood of the underworld that the writers wanted to capture.I loved every minute of it!

","Whenever I watch movies of this sort, I'm always afraid that I'm going to watch a special effects extravaganza that's all style and no substance.  I honestly feel that a great film can be made without flashy f/x, but as long as the whole feature is not merely a showcase for those f/x, I don't have a problem.  That was the case with ""Underworld.""  Along with the fast-paced action sequences is a well-written story that develops nicely throughout the course of the film.  It is an original spin on the age-old vampire tale.  As one of the co-writers pointed out in an interview, the film is based more on science than folklore.  Therefore, don't expect your usual wooden crosses and stakes through the heart.  The director's intention was to create an action film, only featuring vampires and werewolves (referred to as Lycans). Personally, I still think it falls into the horror genre, but it doesn't follow too many of the cliches of its genre.  The story is hard-to-follow at times, but that's part of what I liked.  I like when a movie challenges me to pay attention and use my brain, rather than insult my intelligence.  So those who are expecting wall-to-wall action, blood and gore might be disappointed.  I think the film's rich storyline is what made it a success. I was impressed to find out it was made for a little over 20 million.  As the director pointed out in the DVD commentary, the budget for this movie is half of what is costed to make the chase sequence in ""Matrix Reloaded.""  So I can't classify this as high-budget trash, because there wasn't even a high budget.  But it's not low-budget trash either.  It's funny how I just read a review complaining about the film's cheesy ""CGI effects.""  There was hardly any CGI!  Most of the effects are practical, which is refreshing in a day and age where directors seem to live and die by CGI (hey, it rhymes!).  Kate Beckinsale makes a great heroine, and brings a nice element of class to the film.  Plus, seeing her roam around in a tight rubber suit didn't cause any complaints on my part.  Boy, is she beautiful!  And for the ladies, there's Scott Speedman who brings a nice vulnerability to his role.  It's a lot more impressive than his flat performance in ""Dark Blue.""  I loved the whole look of the film.  It almost appears film-noirish.  If you want to see a horror movie that delivers and isn't full of cliches, you'll be in for a treat.  (7 out of 10)"

That's because Kate's leather-clad form and pale, gorgeous face is about all the entertainment value there is in this incredibly derivative Goth-kid's wet dream.

","Movie Review: Underworld<br/><br/>Directed By: Len Wiseman<br/><br/>Written By: Kevin Grevioux, Len Wiseman and Danny McBride<br/><br/>Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly and Bill Nighy<br/><br/>As soon as you have seen the first five minutes of Underworld, you realise that this is a film that owes The Matrix and Blade a huge debt.  While this should have been immediately obvious from the trailers and movie posters featuring Beckinsale in skin-tight PVC, twin pistols and a Trinity style haircut, it is also in the mise-en-sc√©ne and execution of the cinematography.  All out gun battles are frequent, and all that is missing is the bullet-time.  This raises the question: why have vampires and werewolves fighting, and then have them firing guns at each other?<br/><br/>
The fact that this is a fictional world (allegedly of its own devising, but I will come to that), is a plus in many ways, but it hits a trap that many fantasy/horror/sci-fi films fall into in.  The director and writers are obviously well at home with the world that they have created, but they rarely (if ever) take the time out to explain this world and its apparently complicated political situation to the audience.  This is a major flaw, and it is not until almost halfway through the movie that the audience has any idea what is actually going on.<br/><br/>Apparently, the writer saw this movie as `Vampires and Werewolves do Romeo and Juliet'.  Let me state right now that this film bears little resemblance to the Shakespeare play, and that it is only the `Star-Crossed' lovers that remain.  A tarnished representation of one of the greatest love stories of our time, perhaps.  However, the romantic sideline seems crammed in somehow, as though the filmmakers realised that there needed to be some substance to pace out the next confusing gun-battle.  A major flaw of which is that the vampires and werewolves look virtually identical, so that it often hard to see who is shooting who.<br/><br/>What is interesting is that the role-playing games company White Wolf Inc. attempted to sue the film for copyright infringement.  There certainly is a striking resemblance to Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The Apocalypse.  Don't worry, any knowledge you may have of the games' setting won't help you any, through the mysterious plotline.  That said, if they had just got the licence and made a Vampire: The Masquerade movie, the film would likely have been immeasurably superior.  That could have become/been a high class cult-movie.  Underworld, however, looks destined for the ¬£5.99 rack.<br/><br/>Overall, Underworld is a flawed, if enjoyable, action-romp.  Probably best enjoyed when in a no-brainer mood.  Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and the promise of her in a PVC suit is probably the major incentive for teenage boys to watch the film.  There are several nice action set-pieces throughout the film, but the overall effect is confusing and disjointed.<br/><br/>
STORY: 6/10 DIRECTION: 4/10 PERFORMANCE: 4/10 OVERALL: 5/10<br/><br/>RECOMMENDED TO: Teenage Goths, people who play White Wolf RPGs and drunken twenty-somethings bored in Blockbuster.<br/><br/>DON'T WATCH WITH: Mum, Werewolves or hardcore White Wolf gamers."

","A fun popcorn movie, by keeping your expectations in perspective, you can look forward to the sequel and purported prequel. The story line has great potential but the director seems content to revisit action sequences seen in the matrix, highlander, and blade, etc.  Kate Beckinsale's Selene gives Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity a run for her money in the black latex department and essentially saves the movie despite its somewhat abrupt ending. Great foley effects keep you in the middle of the action and the the blue grey tones maintain the 'underworld' environment that the characters thrive on.

","A no-brainer, but a FUN no-brainer, so that's all right.<br/><br/>I think I saw this movie three times in the cinema within the week of its release, and every time I watched it I came away thinking that, despite the fact that it had obviously sucked in places, I had still seen a good film.<br/><br/>So what made it such a mixed bag of emotions for me? If you look at it one way, you have a well-paced modern action film that pays some very obvious tribute to American comic books, Japanese Anime, and The Matrix. If looked at in the other way, however, you find you have a sloppy Matrix clone that's just recycling stunts and tricks from older, better films. Part of the problem is that the supporting evidence for each argument can easily be applied to the opposition as well.<br/><br/>In the end, I say that the best thing to do with this film is to just sit back and enjoy the ride. Give in to your shallow values and just admire all those gorgeous vampires. When it gets right down to it, there is nothing wrong with admiring Kate Beckinsale's body at all, and that alone is almost enough to carry this movie off."

"mgriego007","Null","1","2","20 April 2004"," It's just allright for me
","Underworld is one of those movies you want to see but dread mainly due to the cover on the box.  It shows Kate Beckinsale all decked out like Trinity ready to leap through the air with the help of wires and special effects. The movie's problems are not that it steals from the Matrix, but are more basic.  The plot had the chance to really lure us in with an almost Romeo and Juliet type romance, but sadly it doesn't get enough attention. Selene is so rigid, you expect her to snap in two every time she walks.  Michael Cravin comes across as a na√Øve child who will believe anything and sympathizes immediately with any sort of sob story.  An attempt at an end reel plot twist falls flat on its face because instead of the twist anchoring our emotional hopes on one side or another, it introduces yet another side and makes us dislike two characters we already mistrust even more.  The one actor who's the saving grace in this film is Michael Sheen who plays the part of Lucian, the big dog of the werewolves.  His eyes convince me that he is not doubt a were-something and if I saw him coming after me, I would wet myself and then run.  We are given five whole minutes to understand why Selene fights the werewolves (brought about in the clich√©d why are you fighting them dialogue) with such a passion and in those same five minutes realize her love for Corvin.  Of course Selene wasting six werewolves single handedly immediately follows that.  The movie has little emotional attachment from its audience.  It's entertaining and the vampires and werewolves are very modern.  The vampires take on more of an Anne Rice-like portrayal sitting around drinking blood that looks like wine in an extravagant old house.  They dress pretty and could pass as fashion models for Old Navy commercials if they weren't dressed in black all the time and got a little more sun.  The werewolves are fast and agile but they don't look quite right to me, most of them look like blue chow-chows, not werewolves.  The whole look and feel of the movie is of course very gothic, as we wouldn't expect anything else.  My biggest pet peeve in the movie is that we are supposed to believe that Selene is a killing machine yet whenever she fires a gun it flails in her hand as though it was a salmon out of water.  I don't know how she manages to hit anything at all and I wonder if it's too much to ask Hollywood to train actors to look like they know what they are doing when they use firearms.  Not a bad movie, rent it sometime if they are out of what you really want."

","For centuries, the vampires and lycans (werewolves) have been at war, unknown to humans. No-one knows how this war started, only that the lycans made the first move. Though the war is far from over, the vampires seem to be gaining the upper hand, and some have decided to sleep for centuries on end. While the aristocratic vampires inhabit a gothic mansion, the lycans are forced to live in the sewers. Special vampire warriors called the death dealers, assigned to take the lycans out, one-by-one, prowl the streets at night. One of these death dealers, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) discovers a lycan plot to kidnap a young human medical student, Michael (Scott Speedman), and decides to take action. When she gets no help from the coven leader, Kraven (Shane Brolly), who seems to be more interested in Selene than disposing of the lycans, she awakens Viktor (Bill Nighy), the most powerful vampire ever to walk the earth, and sets about protecting Michael herself. But soon she finds herself falling in love with Michael, and risks everything protecting him, even betraying her own kind, and also finds out the true reason behind the Lycan's interest in Michael, a plan which could tip the war in the favour of the lycans.<br/><br/>When the trailer for Underworld was first shown, it seemed like a bad rip-off of The Matrix, but I am pleased to say that this is far from the truth. Though it borrows a few elements from The Matrix, it still sets its own standard. The special effects are amazing. I wasn't so sure about watching another werewolf (sorry, lycan) film after seeing the wolf effects in Dog Soldiers, thinking that they couldn't get any better, but I'm glad that I gave Underworld a chance. The lycan transformation scenes are simply brilliant, especially Michael's change at the end, and the Vampire effects were stunning. One performance stood out more than the rest, and it wasn't Beckinsale's or Speedman's. It was Bil Nighy's. He was perfect as the vampire elder Viktor, making him seem real, and not another dracula rip-off. Another graet performance was that of Michael Sheen, who plays the lycan leader Lucian. Though I am not a big fan of the genre, Underworld impressed me, and I can't wait for the sequel.<br/><br/>***** out of *****"

The cool thing about Vampires and Werewolves is that they are supernatural creatures with preternatural abilities. They have claws and teeth and they're very strong and move very fast, no? So it makes sense that they use those abilities to shoot at each other how?

Underworld fails to deliver anything worth your time except maybe looking pretty slick. The shoot outs are uninspired and poorly conceived. The fight scene at the end of the film when the filmmakers at long last whip out with some decent action, was too little too late. The Romeo & Juliet plot arch is slapped on and so trite it will make you wince. You will be required to sit through long scenes which establish How Vampires Work, because you've been bad and the filmmakers mean to punish you.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie - this is not an exaggeration, I honestly did this - I called everyone I knew and advised them not to see it."
"karl-booth","8","1","2","20 February 2004"," Great visual treat, showing traditional film techniques at their best
","Underworld is a film that unfairly draws comparisons with other films; the matrix, blade etc... In my view it harks back to the good old days of story telling, using CGI techniques only when completely necessary. It is very stylistic from the start, brooding, dark ... but not too dark, I can't be doing with films that make it so dark you can't see what's going on. The heroine (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire warrior, caught in a battle between the decadent world of the vampires and the rough and ready world of the werewolves. The stereotypes of the vampires and Lycans (werewolves) are a little galling and I'm sure neither would have any trouble identifying each other. The Lycans all look like Sabretooth in X-men and the Vamps, Lestat in Interview with a vampire.<br/><br/>The plot is good and I feel directorially, for a debut, it was outstanding. Should I hear of any other films by Len Wiseman I would definitely watch them. Without giving too much away, the plot follows Selene, the heroine, and a human that holds the key to the futures of both Vampires and Lycans. It neither acknowledges nor discredits any other films that might be drawn into the genre, treading its own path in an entertaining enough way. It draws the viewer to make assumptions that will later be challenged as the well weighted plot unveils.<br/><br/>Lucian (The leader of the Lycans) plays the obligatory English baddie (Well Welsh actually) and does it very well. He oozes a charisma I wasn't expecting to find, and to be honest didn't find in any of the other cast members. Kate Beckinsale (Although absolutely stunning) doesn't make you believe she is a vampire warrior.<br/><br/>The special effects are good. Traditional methods, such as wire working and makeup are done to great effect. Stunts are effortless and add to the films overall ambiance.<br/><br/>Overall this is an entertaining, well put together film which's draws the open minded viewer in and engages them in the dark world of god damn shit sucking vampires. (I had to get a lost boys quote in). I cannot finish without mentioning the PVC suit Kate wears.......hmmmmm"
"soydog","10","1","2","11 February 2004"," Remarkably Excellent.
","Forget the fact that it doesn't adhere to the Vampire and Werewolf legends. Who cares, really.. They could have evolved from then on. And for whoever said that it was disgusting that Vamps and Lycans could run only as fast as normal humans, must be insane not to have seen the scene where Lucian ran as fast as the car, then jumped atop it.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie, and if those complainers out there just forgot that it had anything to do with traditional Vamps and werewolves, then they'd seriously enjoy this. Now, I was not a horror fan, in fact, I have always been quite intimidated by the blood, gore, and that kind of stuff in horror movies.. Well, this one is definitely a horror, but I wasn't the least bit scared through-out the entire, bloody thing. Being a mere recently-turned-13-12-year-old, the video store owner was a bit apprehensive of renting me an R-rated movie, so I don't know about younger audiences and such.<br/><br/>Great acting. It blew me away how well Kate Beckinsale, Michael Sheen, and all of them, in fact acted.. The only actor I lament being used, is Speedman. It's either him who's annoying, or his character. I think they could have cast Michael better, 'cause I see absolutely no way that anyone like Selene could ever fall in love with him.. And the romance is quite non-existant, I find.. All it is really, is Selene sort of kissing him, mainly to cuff him to that chair.<br/><br/>And I absolutely love the setting, the long coats, and the double-pistol shoot-out with Selene... Totally awesome. There is little about it that really resembles The Matrix, I find, another great movie. Maybe the leather, and the action-sequence style, but other than that, I can't wait for the sequel, and the 3rd to come out!<br/><br/>10/10 No regrets."
"Sisiutil","5","1","2","8 February 2004"," Promising, but ultimately disappointing.
","Underworld's one of those films that had a lot going for it only to collapse under its own weight.<br/><br/>Underworld's greatest asset is the stunning visual work. The film's world is gloriously dark and gothic, with almost no sunlight depicted--appropriate, given that most of the characters are vampires. The fight scenes are beautifully shot as well, and Kate Beckinsale and her stunt doubles are entrancingly graceful as bullets zip around her/them. (And, yes, she looks great in pleather or whatever that skin-tight outfit was made of.)<br/><br/>The premise is promising--a war between vampires and werewolves, the former's erstwhile slaves and now deadliest enemies. And the filmmakers do a good job of gradually revealing the war's history and, as a result, shifting your sympathies from the vampires to the werewolves as the backstory unfolds.<br/><br/>BUT. Like so many recent Hollywood action movies, this film sacrifices character to action. Fight sequences should always be relevant to the story and the characters, but as usual, they're just eye candy here way too often--F/X porn.<br/><br/>As a result, much-needed character development is sacrificed and a talented actress like Beckinsale is largely wasted. The worst example of this: her love for Michael, a new werewolf. Apart from the fact that these people are both good-looking, why are they attracted to one another? We never find out.<br/><br/>
Frankly, the conflict between Viktor and Lucien--the leaders of the vampires and werewolves respectively--had more teeth (heh, get it?). It should have been the A plot, with Selene and Michael's snoogins relegated to a subplot.<br/><br/>
A couple of other complaints: first, the tone was unrelentingly grim. This is an action flick, not Ingmar Bergman. How about a few one-liners to lighten things up, gang? Second, more than once, vampires cast reflections in mirrors. Okay, if you're going to muck around with a well-known element of pop culture mythos, EXPLAIN IT SOMEHOW OR DON'T BOTHER!!<br/><br/>Disappointing for a movie that seemed to hold so much promise. 5/10."
"CoastalCarolinian","10","1","2","6 February 2004"," DYNAMIC!
","I found the movie to be extremely entertaining, full of fresh new material. I certainly hope that the movie spawns a sequel, indeed, a whole franchise. I'd also like to see a book series developed.  The plot was enticing, the action entertaining, and the characters engaging.  I loved the organization and sophistication of the vampires, but my sympathy made me side with the lycanthropes."
"PatrynXX","7","1","2","9 February 2004"," Not perfect but a fun movie.
","(spoilers?)<br/><br/>Loved the trailer so I had to give this a go.  Not too bad.  It's not perfect and could have been better.  I must say I am a vampire fan.  So was a bit disappointed they painted Victor out to be the bad guy.  But Kate's supposed to be the renegade.  Should make for a wonderful sequel.<br/><br/>And Kate certainly is hot in this movie.  Certainly nothing like Pearl Harbor.  (ie Pearl Harbor she didn't know what the heck she was doing.)<br/><br/>Alot of movies though today (including this one) certainly enjoy providing clean cuts.  Resident Evil provided a black man being cut into squares and now we have a vampire getting his brain chopped clean.<br/><br/>Anyway, I loved the movie.  I think anyone who's into Vampires and Werewolves will like it.  <br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Quality: 6/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 10/10"
"dollardollar","7","1","2","2 February 2004"," 8/10 - Good action/story mix
","I think this movie is worth watching it, especially if you are an action fan. After the trailer I wasn't too sure about its quality because this black/blue style seemed quite boring to me. But in fact it perfectly supported the atmosphere. The best feature of this movie is the balance between action and story. There are good action scenes (although the fights were a bit short) and the story has some interesting turns. Matrix Reloaded concentrated too much on dialogues and philosophical crap. On the other hand, ""Swat"" was a pure action movie and the sole purpose of the story line was to connect the action scenes. In my opinion, ""Underworld"" found an almost perfect balance between those extremes. I missed a bit some special abilities of the vampires, but this is only a minor complaint"
"sunsetb423","8","1","2","28 January 2004"," Great flick
","I loved this movie.  I thought it was a very new and different way to spin a classic tale.  I thought the costuming was great, the sets were very well done.  It had twists I wasn't expecting and a story that kept me intrigued. The acting was well done. I thought Kate Beckinsdale was beautiful and kick-a** at the same time. I only wish we could have gotten alittle more romance, I mean, can I get a kiss or a hug or something!!!!!  All in all it was a very good movie."
"brennerl","7","1","2","22 January 2004"," Like watching The Matrix with vamps and werewolves
","While certainly not the best or the worst of its type, Underworld borrows a great deal from a number of other recent sci-fi and horror flicks -- costumes and action sequences from The Matrix, scenery and set design from Batman, and the not-so-original story pieced together from any number of romantically-influenced action/drama films (think Baz Luhrman's version of Romeo and Juliet after you substitute vampires and werewolves for most of the otherwise human cast).<br/><br/>On the other hand, production qualities are very good, and the reasonably talented and mostly believable cast is not entirely unknown.  Besides, watching the very attractive Kate Beckinsale parade around in a series of leather and latex outfits is not a terrible way to spend an evening.<br/><br/>Traditionalists may be offended that the writers have taken certain liberties with the usual vampire and werewolf ""rules"" (at least direct sunlight still fries the vamps), but I believe most supernatural monster fans (including myself) can just let these things slide, and enjoy the movie for what it is."

"Jksk7376","10","1","2","14 January 2004"," Great movie!!!
","This is probably the best Vampire movie of all time, for me at least. Sure it's not your typical Vampires are bad guys, get your garlic, holy water, and sharpen your stakes type deal, this film is fresh, and unique. It is a refreshing new and unique look to the Vampire world. I recommend this film to anyone who is either a Vampyre or a Lycan (Werewolf) fan. The two sides duke it out battle after battle, and it has an original, and somewhat realistic origin of how Vampires and Werewolves came to be.<br/><br/>The two best things about this movie, besides the action, is the Storyline, and the special effects, which are done traditionally, no fake looking CGI here. You'll have yourself rooting for one side the whole movie,and then the tables will be turned, and you won't know whose side you're on!<br/><br/>Great, fun film! -Can't wait for the sequel, or prequel!"
"simon-trek","Null","1","2","23 January 2004"," A dark, Gothic, action packed spectacular!
","I'll admit it: I'm not a fan of horror films, but this film interested me for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>1. I have likeness of female characters.<br/><br/>2. Selene looked so cool in her black leather suit.<br/><br/>3. The film had a lot of great action (gun fights).<br/><br/>4. The story of vampires at war with werewolves sounded interesting.<br/><br/>Anyway this film is certainly more of an action film than a horror movie. I also found it very intriguing that vampires and werewolves were using both science and modern kinds of weapons against each other. To me it was almost like a human war. Besides this war there is also a lot of twists, lies and conspiracies in both the vampire and werewolf clans, or was it just the vampire clan I couldn't quite tell. So in some ways this film was also like an average thriller/mystery film. <br/><br/>This film also has great some great visuals. Especially the fighting scenes and the views of the dark and Gothic looking city which this movie takes place in.<br/><br/>I liked the heroine of the film Selene the best. She is cool, sexy looking, was willing to risk her livelihood to uncover truths. <br/><br/>So Underworld is certainly a great movie that I recommend to anyone."

Any time a movie can take a traditional genre or sub-genre and put a new spin on it without falling into the same old cliches of movies past definitely gets the nod from me.<br/><br/>It seems that so many vampire and werewolf movies for the last several decades is just cut from the same old cloth of the orginal movies and books that started the whole horror sub-genre of undead creatures (the exception being An American Werewolf in London).<br/><br/>The storyline is fantastic, although it might be a bit confusing in the beginning (as a friend of mine said as we were watching it). Just stick with it and it'll all make sense. Think of it as not only a horror movie, but a mystery as well.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is a must-see."
"AmericanIdle","10","1","2","11 January 2004"," Greatest movie ever
","Okay, that's a lie, but not much of a lie.<br/><br/>This movie being rated 6.4, that's a lie.  Calling this movie anything less than great, that's also what you'd get if you were telling a lie. However, the opposite of this, the truth, that's what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>If you like movies, you like Underworld.  If you like talking trash about every movie you see, you hate Underworld.  It's simple.  This movie is a brilliant work on many different levels.  First off, the writing.  What most people notice.  Dialogue, all that stuff.  It's not forced, it isn't pretentious, it isn't a let down at all.  The only downside as far as that field is the fact that several important plot points are delivered by a guy with a nearly unintelligible accent.<br/><br/>Now, the plot.  The plot is nice.  There's actually a very well delivered twist that I didn't catch onto until immediately before it happened, and I'm the guy that ruined Fight Club for himself be figuring out that Jack was Tyler.  Still a great movie.<br/><br/>I digress.  Onto the directing.  The style was eerily reminiscent of Fincher, his work previously mentioned.  Several shots seemed lifted straight from a Fincher work, while others paid great homage to the Wachowski brothers, but that was no surprise.  The surprise was the influence garnered from old Hong Kong action flicks.  Great gunplay.<br/><br/>Other crap, they used animatronics instead of CGI, which is always a plus. Blah blah blah, watch the damned movie and like it."
"tweaky_bunny","10","1","2","10 January 2004"," solid comic-genre movie, great casting and direction
","I thought this movie was really great.  If it wasn't under the shadow of the continuing Matrix trilogy I think it would have done a lot better in the box office.  This was definitely more of a comic/graphic novel movie along the lines of the Crow than a horror/fantasy movie.  I can see how die-hard goths and horror folks would have problems with it, but I think the detail, acting, sets, etc. all make it a really solid movie.  Kate B. is a great heroine, strong and still feminine. More science-based than myth-based, I like the deal that vamps and lycans have viral blood diseases and aren't of magic/mystic origin.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the action is really gun-heavy.  I would have liked to see more of the natural talents of the vampires used (if any). Lycans seem really strong and go through a dramatic physical transformation, but aside from a few hints of enhanced strength, vampires seem only to have fangs and blue eyes when angry."

","Yes this movie is very unique, and there is no movie like it. It is set in a beautiful, dark and gothic world, with well detailed sets, and even though it takes certain elements from the Matrix, and Blade, it is unique in its own way. First off, the budget was only 30 million. After watching the film, you would think its more like 80 million. The costumes, sets, great stuntwork, wirework, its all here. I also was very impressed by the acting here, especially the beautiful Kate Beckinsale, I hope she is Hollywood's next 20 million dollar actress, she is so talented. I also would like to mention that there is no CGI !! very little Cgi is used in this film. I thought the werewolfs looked great, If your a fan of Aliens, and Pumpkinhead, then take a look at the werewolves in this film. The vampires in the movie appeared to be very weak, and do not follow their legend at all in that they do have reflections, and do grow older in appearance. But hey every vampire movie has its own mythology. I hope They make a sequel to this film, the end shows you that they might make one afterall. I think if they boost the budget a little, a new masterpeice will be born. *** 3 stars out of 4."

"pc_dean","7","1","2","7 November 2003"," A-Vamping We Will Go
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but a good while ago, vampires stopped being hideous corpse-rats and aloof Mitteleuropean aristocrats with funny accents.  In many cases, they even stopped being bad guys.  Your average vampire these days is slick, sexy, and angst-ridden, living an eternal Gothic bacchanal.  What, precisely, is so inherently sexy about a reanimated corpse has always escaped me.  I blame Anne Rice.  Or maybe that Keifer Sutherland movie.  Anyway, that particular strain of vampire fiction has always impressed me very little; nothing wearies my patience quite like some pretentious navel- gazing twit done up in black, pausing to murder a cute starlet before whining about the dreariness of existence.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody hand me a wooden stake.<br/><br/>That said, I have to admit that `Underworld' is a pretty decent movie.  It treats its vampires vs. werewolves war scenario with a trifle too much seriousness, and borrows heavily from other movies in its visual vocabulary, but it throws enough talent at the problem on both sides of the camera that it pulls through. Besides, it can't help but be better than the leaden, preening `Interview With the Vampire'.<br/><br/>Our bloodsucking heroine is Selene (Kate Beckinsale, very fetching in a patent- leather bodysuit), who is a `Deathdealer', one of the leather-trenchcoated button men of the vampire world.  The Vamps, we learn, have been duking it out for centuries with the Lycans (a fancy name for your garden-variety werewolf). Throughout, the human race has been oblivious to the fighting, which apparently means ignoring a couple of gory firefights a week.  The exact casus belli here is unclear for much of the movie, and even the characters don't really know since, as Selene tells us, researching history is forbidden.  Boy, that's never a good sign.  The war is as much a conflict of dueling fashion sense as anything else: the Vampires are sleek dilettantes who loll around on vintage furniture in grandiose mansions, sipping blood from crystal goblets and exchanging sardonic smirks, while the Lycans are hairy and unkempt rowdies who live in the sewer and amuse themselves by beating the snot out of each other.  The Vamps dress in fancy evening gowns and tailored leather; the Lycans' idea of high fashion is an old Bundeswehr jacket and no shirt. The Vampires have guns with lots of polished chrome compensators and electronic doodads stuck all over them (they do target practice on Renaissance busts); the Lycans are fond of AKs and oversized Desert Eagles.  Interestingly, the Lycans all appear to be male.  Can't imagine why. Anyway, while out snuffing a couple of Lycans, Selene notices that they seem to be following Michael (Scott Speedman), a medical intern at a local hospital, and also discovers that the sneaky wolves have developed special vampire-piercing bullets made with irradiated liquid sunshine.  She decides to check into Michael more closely, over the opposition of her vampire colleagues, and discovers not only the roots of the war, but also that everything she has believed all of her undead life is, er, inaccurate.<br/><br/>The movie is set in a Stygian and rainy City With No Name, located somewhere in eastern Europe (`Underworld' was shot in Budapest and Prague). Director<br/><br/>Len Wiseman films the place with a lot of gray filter and shadow, which gives all the characters the wan, ashen appearance of the walking dead.  The atmosphere is a definite plus for the movie, though it's hardly original. If vampires were real, this is where they'd live - they wouldn't stand out for not having a tan. Kate Beckinsale gives a subtle and effective performance as Selene, though I'm not sure if it is the one intended.  She seems to be written as a steely warrior, but Beckinsale comes off too delicate and waifish for that.  Frequently in her combat scenes, she looks disconcerted, uncomfortable, and a little scared.  She's competent but not confident, and seems like something of a shyly charismatic tomboy who's a vampire but isn't really into it.  When she walks through the grand hall of the vampire hangout, the in-crowd vampires just stare at her with what might be disdain, and she doesn't give them the time of day (well, night I guess).  Selene is, essentially, an orphan a couple of times over, and Beckinsale's performance gives a definite sense of the vulnerability this entails. Frankly, I thought all this made her a more interesting and appealing character, whose courage comes from control of fear, not absence of it, but I'm not sure it's what the creators had in mind.  And you do sort of keep expecting other characters to put their arms around her and say, `There, there, Sweetie, werewolves aren't really real, they're just make-believe.' Wiseman selected quite a good cast for the movie, even in small roles, and this helps immensely in making `Underworld' entertaining.  Speedman is fine in his secondary role, though he and Beckinsale's inevitable romantic bonding is a little unconvincing.  As the Lycan boss, Michael Sheen creates a compelling portrait of ferocity that becomes oddly sympathetic, particularly when his grievance against the vampires is given an airing.  The only weak spot in the cast is Shane Brolly, who plays the cowardly but devious vampire chieftain Kraven (the legendary vampire warrior-king he is playing Prince John for is called `Viktor'.  Such is `Underworld's idea of symbolism).  The fact that Kraven is something of a sissified drama king does not excuse Brolly's hyperventilating all his lines like he's climbing Everest or something.  Viktor, incidentally, is revived as a desiccated mummy in the course of the story, and Bill Nighy plays him with eerie, amoral dignity even through many layers of prosthetics.<br/><br/>The ending leaves room for a sequel, as is increasingly common among action movies, all of whom have decided to at least leave the option of creating a franchise.  I mean, pretty much everything gets a sequel these days.  And you could do worse, I guess.  After all, how many books did Anne Rice write?"

You can grab them when you see the movie: Matrix (customs, scenery, locations), Lord of the Rings (flashbacks), Hellraiser, The Howling, ...

","Being a huge Kate Beckinsale & Scott Speedman fan...I seriously enjoyed Underworld because it has alot of action and excitement in it. But there is more to it than action and excitement...personally I thought it was a love story.<br/><br/>I mean to say the whole reason behind the vampire vs werewolf war is all because Sonia (Victor's daugther) and Lucian fell in love with each other...since werewolves were the servants and lower class to the vampires...it is forbidden for servants to get intimate with the masters & mistresses. And to make matters worst Sonia was carrying Lucian's child which made Victor really ticked off and he wouldn't allow her to have a half breed (half werewolf)...I guess in a sense victor was prejudice gainst the werewolves cause he had his daughter burnt alive by the sunlight as poor Lucian watched...chained down to the floor like some dog...man my heart went out to him...So, I do not blame him for wanting revenge on Victor for killing his lover and unborn child<br/><br/>So, that is why I think behind all the action and excitement lies a beautiful but very sad love story but also there is another story goin on there...story of betrayal of trust...Victor lead Selene to believe that a pack of werewolves brutally murdered her family when in truth it was him who was behind it...I mean damn...that is really evil right there...I guess it is obvious that the only character that I truly hate out of the movie was Victor cuz man...he is evil!!!!<br/><br/>But seriously...this movie is a damn good movie!!!! I mean if you have not seen it...you have got to go and see it as it is a MUST SEE!!! I know it look alot like the Matrix and all that but trust me...is nothing like the Matrix or any other vampire/werewolf movie out there for this is one of the best vampire/werewolf movies I have ever seen in my life!!!<br/><br/>And Kate Beckinsale as a warrior vampress...omg!!!! She totally rocks as a vampress!!!! Seriously!!! I hope she does more vampire roles in the future and I also hope you guys make a sequel to Underworld cause this movie truly does ROCKS!!!<br/><br/>I cannot wait till it come on DVD cause I will be one of the first to pre order or buy my copy of it on DVD!!!!! Great job on the movie!!!"

"scolwick","10","1","2","1 October 2003"," It is entertainment
","As a fan of the genre, I have to say that Underworld is on of the best vampire movies that I have seen in a long time.  There actually is a multi-layered plot that unfolds as the movie progresses. I look forward to the sequels that are currently on the drawing board for this film due to the room left in the story by the writers. The violence and action are not over-done or full of gore.  The look of the movie is simple and clean while at the same time remaining dark. The film focuses more on the scientific rather than the fantastical elements of vampires. If you are wanting to see a film that is excellent example of the genre and highly entertaining, then I would gladly recommend Underworld."

","I went and saw this movie Sunday night with five of my friends and we all thought it was Freakin' Awesome! Beckinsale was amazing and I totally hated everything she's done before. Scott Speedman who has really only done the Felicity series (sad) was also a surprise and unbelievably hot. The werewolf transformations were totally believable and they didn't stick with Hollywood stereotypes when it came to the vampire and werewolf way of life. I thought it was great-the soundtrack kicked arse- the action was violent but smart-and the story had real feeling to it- it rocked!!!!! My unbiased opinion of course!"
"trnovice","10","1","2","29 September 2003"," Much to enjoy and I look forward to a sequel
","Up front I should say that I really enjoyed this film. It had many flaws, some cinematographic, some heresies (if that can be the right word in the circumstances) visited on the traditional `lore' of vampires and werewolves and some very dodgy physics to boot (bullets filled with liquid light - hmm???), but I think it's worth remembering what movies are meant to be about, i.e. entertainment. This was very entertaining. Sometimes I when I go to the cinema I want thought-provoking, sometimes moving, sometimes intellectual stimulation, but sometimes also just fun. It's rare to get a single movie which combines all of these and I guess scoring well in three out of four categories tends to lead to a classic. Underworld was undeniably light on the first three, but made up for this by being heavy on the fourth. Yes, it was a bit silly sometimes, no it won't make my all-time movie top 20, but it was worth seeing and I'd watch it again.<br/><br/>Criticism here (and elsewhere) seems to be focussed on the following: -<br/><br/>1. The acting was wooden<br/><br/>2. The plot was incomprehensible<br/><br/>3. It was just a rip off of The Matrix / Blade / Insert random vampire movie here<br/><br/>4. There was no regular vampire stuff - turning into bats, lack of reflection, crucifixes, wooden stakes etc.<br/><br/>5. It was not very scary for a horror movie<br/><br/>6. There was no sexual chemistry between the leads<br/><br/>Here's my take on these: -<br/><br/>1. The acting was wooden<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but when was the last time that that an action movie had oscar-winning acting as its main prerequisite? Write down a list of the great action films and a second list of the great actors - how many of the second appeared in the first (yes I know there will be some cross-over, but hopefully you get my point)? Personally, while the acting was not sensational, I didn't feel that it detracted too much from the overall experience. As for trashing the actors, I think that maybe the script was more to blame. It's difficult to make a silk purse out of a sows ear (I exaggerate somewhat here), but I thought that Ms Beckinsale did her best. I found her character credible and even moderately complex at times. Perhaps this sounds like a get out, but maybe vampires express emotion in different ways to humans. I found the slow development of these emotion in Selene interesting. Speedman was rather wooden, but then his character was meant to be rather carried along in the torrent around him and maybe a degree of stupefaction on his behalf was consistent with this (OK I'm probably being too kind). Brolly, Sheen and Nighy acted solidly enough for my tastes, allowing for the perhaps unavoidable hamming associated with the genre.<br/><br/>2. The plot was incomprehensible<br/><br/>I have seen three professional critics say this - I can only assume that they must have been distracted by something during the film. I thought that everything hung together pretty well - loose ends were generally cleared up in the next scene, or the scene after. Not sure what was so difficult to follow.<br/><br/>3. It was just a rip off of The Matrix / Blade / Insert random vampire movie here<br/><br/>Well it was about vampires and the protagonists did wear rather a lot of black leather and / or PVC, much of which was skin-tight. Aside from this, I don't think it was any more derivative than any of the films it was meant to be plagiarising. Because a film has some elements of some other work doesn't mean that it has no creative merit of its own. Humans have been around rather a long time and it would be pretty difficult to pick any wholly innovative film (or book, or painting) - I suspect in fact that such a thing has never existed. Seeing a woman in skin-tight black shiny garb and assuming that they must be Carrie-Anne Moss seems rather superficial to say the least. I thought that Underworld was a lot more interesting and innovative that The Matrix Reloaded if it comes to that.<br/><br/>4. There was no regular vampire stuff - turning into bats, lack of reflection, crucifixes, wooden stakes etc.<br/><br/>So it was a new take on the myth - keeping and accentuating bits and dropping others. Seems like a fresh approach to me. Not sure that vampires are some immutable part of our culture that are off-limits to all reinterpretation. To me, these modern vampires and werewolves were actually rather interesting - more superhuman than suprahuman, more like us than say Christopher Lee in a cloak and tuxedo. Perhaps the director didn't have the budget to suppress reflections, or didn't realise that vampires aren't meant to appear in mirrors. More likely he didn't think that this device would add very much or further the plot - I tend to agree with him. I think the mirror stuff comes from an age where mirrors themselves were see as either rather high-tech or even magical - maybe the lack of reflections in them characterises the humans of the time rather than those around today.<br/><br/>5. It was not very scary for a horror movie<br/><br/>No it wasn't, but then I don't think it was meant to be a horror movie. Think of it as Aliens rather than Alien. The earlier film was a work of suspense and a great film (IMO). The sequel was more of a shoot-em-up with less of the interesting ideas of the first film and less of the suspense - it was a good film rather than a great one. In short Alien was (at least in part) a horror film, Aliens was an action film and so is Underworld.<br/><br/>
6. There was no sexual chemistry between the leads<br/><br/>Maybe not - but I'm not sure that this was the main point. Rather I think the issue was more to do with Selene's dawning realisation that the world (and it's inhabitants) were not as she had always assumed them to be. Michael was only part of this - maybe even just a metaphor for it. Anyway I thought that there was enough sexual chemistry between Selene and the camera to make up for what might have been missing between Beckinsale and Speedman.<br/><br/>Finally - judged as an action film, I thought Underworld it did an good job. It looked great (as did Ms Beckinsale), it hung together and the director didn't lift his foot from the pedal for very long at any point. The SFXs were good without being ends in themselves or distracting from the narrative. I enjoyed the mix of old and new with the vampires and werewolves and found Selene's torn loyalties and heightened emotional state central rather than a distraction. I thought that Selene herself was a credible, interesting, rather different and reasonably well-acted (script-allowing) creation, whom I hope to see more of in the rather telegraphed sequel."
"losing_grip_n_america","10","1","2","27 September 2003"," An Alright Movie
","First off let me say, I love movies of this genre. Just thought that I should clear that up before I start...<br/><br/>This movie was nothing like I expected it to be. The action was wonderful but mostly everything that we had all already seen in previous films the last couple of years. But to its advantage this movie was better than most of the genre. At least it knew what it wanted to be and do and done it. The characters were well thought out and the actor's portraying them done really well.<br/><br/>But the problem I found was that the film was to long. Do we really need this much drama in all the in between times? By in between times, I mean the sometimes dragged out drama in between all the action scenes. Some drama is fine, but I thought there was too much. I dont know I could be wrong, of course everyones opinions are different though. Maybe I should give this one more viewing. Maybe then I would see it in a different light.<br/><br/>2 out of 4 stars"
"Geff","10","1","2","28 September 2003"," Gripping, dark, medieval, unique birth of a new creature
","This film has it all. Good story line, action, great special effects, and a good cast. It really scares you, and the adrenaline rush is real. It's gripping, dark, medieval. There are no good guys; each character is more evil than the next. The creation of a new super creature makes this a classic in the tradition of Dracula. The film has the promise of sequels. I wasn't bored for a second, and the story line was solid, contrary to what I had heard from the intellectually challenged. This film has great sound effects, too. The werewolves are the best they can be, and one attack made the audience cringe in their seats. This film sets the standard for werewolf films from now on. A classic. 10"

","This was one hell of a great movie, I loved every minute of it, of course the visual effects were a little facky, but hell I didn't care. There was one mistake in the movie and I don't know if anybody else caught it or not, the fact that in the movie the Vampires had a reflection, but we all know that Vampires don't have one, but other than that it was one hell of a movie, go and enjoy."
"WangChung","10","1","2","22 September 2003"," Cool movie, great visuals.
","I won't waste time summarizing the events of the movie.  Let's just say that in the packed theatre I was in, the audience was enraptured for the entire length of the film.<br/><br/>The vampires were represented well, particularly Selene (Beckinsale) in her death dealer outfit.  Whatever the designer was going for, she came up with a costume that looked good, but at the same time looked absolutely functional for Selene's particular line of work (Killing Lycans.)<br/><br/>
Character development could have been a little stronger, but was still good, considering how many secondary characters were used besides Speedman and Beckinsale.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10/10."
"EmmaFrost","Null","1","2","20 September 2003"," So bad it's spiffy!
","I'm kinda irked by the fact that I paid 10 bucks to see this movie (I'm a destitute undergrad in one of America's most expensive universities), but given that I've never laughed so hard in my life, I think I'll let that slide.<br/><br/>Did no one see this movie after it was shot? As in, while it was being edited? The whole thing feels as if it was put together by a man both deaf and blind. The plot is seriously contrived, at times downright confusing, and the acting is deliciously bad. Antonio Banderas in ""Assassins"" bad. Vincent Perez in ""Queen of the Damned"" bad. Hayden Christenssen in anything-he's-ever-done bad. I certainly got Episode II flashbacks watching poor Kate Beckinsale going at it ala Natalie Portman. They should definitely start a support group.<br/><br/>And speaking of Attack of the Clones, the artiste who penned Kate and Scott's romance in this movie makes George Lucas sound like Shakespeare (and that's *definitely* saying something). Scott's (or rather the screenwriter's) idea of a come-hither utterance to his beloved sounded like the kind of thing a child would say if it needed a diaper change. 'Course, it's kinda hard to tell who exactly is at fault here: the writer, or Scott Speedman, whose SAG card should be turned into confetti and subsequently burned.<br/><br/>The movie does have its moments. The fight sequences were good, and the costumes, sets, and cinematography were hella tight. And this is definitely the kind of movie I would rent, or play a drinking game to (""take one shot if the actors start taking themselves waay too seriously,"" ""take two shots every time Euro-Trash-y villain comes on-screen"").<br/><br/>All in all, I had a pretty good time.

"wild_guy2005","10","1","2","21 September 2003"," Could have been better.....
","I don't think I have ever seen a movie that starts off with a bang within five minutes so fast. ""Underworld"" does not explain much from the start; I wouldn't have known half of what was going on if I hadn't read about it first. Explanitory things means everything. Second thing, this movie didn't really make you want to root for either side, Lycans OR vampires. The lycans are just egomanic psychos and the vampires are all arrogant traitors. Too bad they didn't all kill each other. On the other hand, the graphics were nice, interesting and vivid (although they didn't have to make so many 5-story window jumping scenes....). Selene(Beckinsale) made a very sexy, slinky vamp. What can I say? I love females who fight. They make the battle more interesting. I think this movie would have been a LOT better if they had explained things along the way. And the ending needed some help as well. Overall, it was ""OK"". Not something I would pay to see again though.<br/><br/>B-"
"caged_insanity","10","1","2","21 September 2003"," No bullet time!!!!
","My god, an action film without bullet time?!?! Could this be? Filmakers not copying the matrix fight scenes? WOW. When I saw the trailer I was expecting another run of the mill matrix copy, but imagine my surprise when there was not a bullet trail in sight! Although they do wear leather trenchcoats and catsuits etc, which is a bit matrixy, the film itself is in fact quite original. They try to stick to a storyline but they also weave the action into it very well, creating a nice cinematic experience. The idea of modern day vampires, which although is not new, is very cool and it is in my opinion much better than the age old rubbish vampires that were killed by wooden sticks, and were scared of two pieces of wood stuck together in a cross shape.<br/><br/>A very nice part of the film is the fact that kate beckinsale is in it, therefore making the film much better :D heehee...<br/><br/>But seriously, I think this film is very good, bu for those of you expecting a bloodbath, you're going to be disappointed."

I thoroughly enjoyed the depth and history to the story, and it goes to show that this is not a cookie cutter film. The style and cinematography is reminiscent of Matrix, yet the brooding ambience and dreary gothic locales reminded me of something out of The Crow or Bladerunner, yet it still retains enough original creativity to make it something new and fresh instead of a facsimile of other films. People looking for another ""Blade"" movie will be disappointed as this film has much more depth and complexity. I loved the movie, and have seen it twice over the weekend so far.

"Dan1863Sickles","Null","1","2","25 December 2003"," She's The Black Knight -- He's the Damsel In Distress
","Let me start off with the negative. It's not hard to see why UNDERWORLD only did so-so business at the box office. Fans of traditional horror were really offended by the idea of vampires and werewolves spraying each other with machine pistols like LA gangs of the Eighties. The lighting of the film was so murky and blue that it was impossible to see anything, and the attractive cast looked much uglier than necessary. And the fight scenes were just not good enough for an action adventure audience to stay interested in such a long, involved story. <br/><br/>But the love story between vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and gentle human Michael (Scott Speedman) was much more satisfying and rewarding than most screen romances. This has nothing to do with the supernatural elements, but rather with the way gender roles are reversed in a very provocative and sophisticated way. Kate Beckinsale is quite literally the only attractive young actress working today who could have made this character work. Selene is like a classic gunslinger, or like the Black Knight of fairy tales. She has no time for love. She's so angry she doesn't even realize how hard she's trying to fight off her attraction to the gentle, demure Michael. In every sense things are turned around here -- the woman is strong and brave but not able to express her feelings, while the man is gentle and supportive but unable to protect himself from the cruel underworld. <br/><br/>Each encounter between the two is elegantly underplayed, but deeply erotic. Note the scene where strong, silent Selene takes confused, frightened Michael to a ""safe house"" to hide for a while. She wants to leave him there while she hunts for the people trying to kill him -- but he says, ""I want to come with you!"" Notice how she uses this moment to steal her first kiss while at the same time clinking chains onto his wrists so that he will stay put while she goes out to fight. It's just what the mysterious black knight would do to protect his damsel in distress. On the other hand, Beckinsale's acting is so rich that you can wonder whether Selene is really stronger than helpless Michael or perhaps more frightened than he is of actually falling in love. <br/><br/>The story goes on too long, there are too many characters, and the heavenly love story does not get all the screen time it deserves. But the attraction between these two is truly intriguing and electrifying."
"Fluke_Skywalker","6","2","7","22 June 2015"," Monster Soap Opera
","Vampires vs. Werewolves is a basic premise with lots of potential, but despite an admirable attempt to create a thorough but easily digestible mythology, 'Underworld' takes itself so serious that it snuffs out any fun before it even begins (though the soapy house politics and intrigue did help glue it all together, however tentatively).<br/><br/>Meandering around for a nearly interminable two hours, the story is bloated and moves at a snails pace. When there is action, it's of the stylized, post-'Matrix' variety, but without any of the latter's flare or drama.<br/><br/>Like its star Kate Beckinsale, it's certainly nice to look at, but even her beauty isn't enough to put this 'Underworld' over the Top."

One woman is a vampire but she falls in love with a werewolf who just wants the war to end.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people really like this movie but I really don't.

","I can't put my finger on why I was so bored during 'Underworld' (2¬Ω/5 Stars). Sure, there's a lot going on, a lot of pretty good FX ‚Äì EXCEPT for the laughable werewolves (I refuse to call them the 'L' word; call them what they are!) ‚Äì and mystery aplenty, but I've always been left unsatisfied with this movie. For one, I do like Vampire stories (again, EXCEPT the faux pas vampire story in 'Twilight') but I like the werewolf lore more. This one was supposed to be a blending of both, but get real; this is a 70/30 Vampire/Werewolf story. I guess that might be a good thing considering how horrid the CGI werewolves look. Anyways, the movie's real highlight is the extremely strong character, Selene, played with an excellent performance by Kate Beckinsale. Without her, I doubt I'd have much interest in continuing with the series. The movie obviously directly steals from 'The Matrix' and that's a huge deterrent, as is the constant bending-the-rules for plot development and weighs more heavily on the ""mystery"" of the war between the beasts than character development. It also screams sequel ‚Äì literally. Unless you name your movie ""Episode #"" then it shouldn't be so blatant. Barely recommended."

But why?<br/><br/>There's a LOT more going on there but I'll let you find out for yourself. Basically this movie is VERY loud, full of ferocious gun fights (don't ask me why the wolves and vampires fight it out with guns--it just works and Beckinsale looks GREAT firing off a gun in each hand), washed out color, dark atmospheric sets, tons of fog, loud music on the soundtrack, plenty of blood, a very deep plot (for a horror film), some scary looking werewolves that can run along the walls and ceilings (!!!) and all done at a breathless pace. The damned movie only stops occasionally for the plot and then zips ahead full speed.<br/><br/>The acting doesn't really matter--this movie is all about violence and visuals. That being said, Beckinsale (and the other vampires) look great in leather and I LOVE the long leather coats they wear when going to battle. Speedman is bad but, seriously, the poor guy has NOTHING to work with! The only other notable is Shane Brolly who basically sneers his way through his role...but it works.<br/><br/>Next to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" this is one of the best horror films released this year. It looks like a masterpiece compared to crap like ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Cold Creek Manor"". Also there's a thankful lack of humor and camp in this film. It takes everything dead serious and plows ahead. I sat there totally engrossed during the entire film and grinning like an idiot because it was so GOOD!

","For starters the movie is too dark, and that is a literal dark. It sort of seems like a teenage band that can't really play and compensates by hiding behind the feedback. Underworld is that type of dark, the type where it seems like its done to hide flaws rather than because it's a movie about vampires and they live for the night.<br/><br/>Think Highlander II sort of too dark.<br/><br/>And then I can only imagine the pitch for it. ""It's the Matrix with vampires...all the PVC and black leather you could ever want in a movie."" You know it got the green light on the PVC alone.<br/><br/>Actually no, that's mean, Vampires V Lycans is a pretty solid idea for a plot-line. It seems like fun.<br/><br/>The thing is, the execution failed. Any movie that relies that much on an opening narration to fill in the plot is sort of lacking. At least tie it to a montage so we don't get the feeling that Selene has the oddest thought process in the world.<br/><br/>But otherwise, Black leather and PVC, club wear and machine guns. Slow motion and wire-fu....honestly just watch the Matrix movies, they have more of a plot."

","Ugh...I've seen this movie in the cinema yesterday and I still feel dirty. The first thing that went through my mind when the end credits rolled was: suckfest !! I'll stick to that thought...TOTAL suckfest !<br/><br/>
You have to know, I'm a real sucker for werewolves and I've been waiting since so long for a new good movie about them reaches the theaters. Ginger Snaps and Dog Soldiers were decent films but they never made it to the big screen ( at least not here ). So, Underworld contains the first cinema-werewolves since ages but it's pure crap. The best way to describe Underworld is : Blade meets The Matrix with a slice of The Hulk near the end. In other words, this means : too loud, way too much over the top and far from original ( although it pretends to be very original ). I may be a very old-fashioned person when it comes to matters like this but in my humble opinion werewolves and vampires are ancient, mythical creatures with a long history behind them already. Showing these icons as futuristic, multi-armed warriors is despicable and can be described by one single word : BLASPHEMY !!<br/><br/>I guess we can point our finger to ""director"" Len Wiseman...Not in ONE part of this movie, this guy proves that he surpasses the level of an average videoclip director. The entire finished product looks like a publicity stunt for MTV or something and above that, Wiseman seems to be proud of that. Oh well, I guess he was to busy thinking about going to bed with Kate Beckinsale instead of filming a good movie. Speaking of which, I honestly have to say I never heard of Kate before this film. That's not a surprise actually, since she starred in Pearl Harbor before this and I'm trying to avoid that movie as much as I'm trying to avoid Leprosy ! The rest of the cast is not worth a mention...I only liked Lucian ( the √ºber-Lycan ) up till a certain level.<br/><br/>I'm really annoyed by the plot idea of this movie. In case you don't know: Underworld tells the story of a war that is going on between Vampires and Werewolves for centuries already. Although Wiseman claims it to be creative and innovating, it falls into the same old clich√© ***SPOILERS*** the origin of the war was a passionate matter ***END SPOILER**** ... I hate people who claim to be original while they're in fact telling the same old story in another form ! And here's another provoking aspect : why are, during the whole movie, werewolves shown as the inferior species ?? Correct me if I'm wrong, but in this movie the vampires are merely shown as lazy and irritating creatures while the ""lycans"" are far more motivated and dedicated ! Is it because the star herself is a bloodsucker, perhaps ?<br/><br/>
No, all together, it may look promising and fascinating if you're a 13 year old pimpled horror freak with giant braces in your mouth ( no offense if you are, by the way ) but if you're a bit of a traditional horror fan, this movie will leave you behind with an empty feeling."

","ah yes... yet another vampire/werewolf movie. Most of those are of poor quality, ridiculous and copy off each other with great candor. This one is different in one respect... it didn't copy off other vampire movies, it copied off The Matrix. And a lot.<br/><br/>The director seems to be an avid admirer of the The Matrix and seemed to have included a lot of its design motifs into this movie. Including a lot of actor body language, weapon usage, wardrobe, setting and even the general color scheme. It's basically The Matrix with vampires instead of machines... with one problem, it's not even a fraction as good.<br/><br/>The story itself is well documented so repeating it won't help much, but what will help is to prepare you to a somewhat low budget production (or seemingly so) with poor acting (yes, even by wonderful Kate) and uncomfortable clich√©s. The story has potential (vampires vs. werewolves) but it's hard to shake off the feeling you're watching an episode of some low-budget vampire series. The dialogs are mostly predictable and shallow, and it seems the focus of this movie is on a disappointing 'cool factor' rather than absorbing the viewer into the story.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie to hardcore (and young) vampire/werewolves fans, but they'll watch it anyway... if you're not automatically taken by that theme, stay away.

","As the sequel is just around the corner I decided to sit down and watch 'Underworld: Special Extended Edition' on DVD and then share my thoughts. Exactly what is so special about this edition is totally beyond me but it did give me an opportunity to address a couple more bugbears.<br/><br/>Slow motion. Slow-mo in action movies has been around a long time and every now and again undergoes a fresh and novel revision by an inspired director. Peckinpah made it an important way of enhancing the emotional impact of violence. John Woo made it an art form which has since been much copied but was never bettered until technology allowed the Warchowski's to take it to wholly new lengths. In it's best incarnations it has been used as a way to enhance the on screen action and draw the audience into a more protracted and intense visual experience. Who can forget the death of Elias in 'Platoon', such an influential moment in cinema it was pretty much the blueprint for the death of Boromir and will be ripped off until Kingdom Come. Then we have the slow-mo in 'Underworld' which appears to be almost exclusively for the purpose of enhancing Kate Beckinsdale's coat (alongside preposterous WHOOSHING sounds). In fact what is it about long black coats in action films theses days? I remember after 'The Hitcher' raincoats were in for at least ten years before the realisation dawned that the novelty had worn off. We seem to be having the same phenomenon now, begun by 'The Matrix', but with PVC/leather instead. Or is it just a goth thing, after all whenever there's a big fight in 'Underworld' you can tell the vampires from the werewolves not by the shaggy fur and big ears (more on this later) but by their long coats! Next for the block is colour grading. All big budget movies these days are colour graded on computers, the process by which individual frames can be altered by having colours faded up or down in the image to create atmosphere or alter the look of a scene. When one colour is brought up above all others the image is said to be colour saturated. This seems to mean that whilst some film makers will use it to enhance their movie (much like the judicious use of slow-mo), others will decide that skilled cinematographers and lighting gaffers are no longer a necessity in their movie because they can just go and fix it all in post production. Enter 'Underworld'. Overblue. Way Overblue. With a bit of green sometimes. <br/><br/>So what's it all about anyway, well I'm sure everyone knows so I'll keep it brief. Werewloves and Vampires are busily conducting their centuries long war when Selene (Kate Beckinsdale), in her stunning PVC cat-suit, stumbles across a Lycan (werewolf clan) plot to kidnap a certain Michael Corvin (Scott 'forgot what he looked like already and it only finished about thirty minutes ago' Speedman) for some bloodline experiments that their leader Lucian (Michael 'Why does an articulate skinny English bearded geek = mysterious to American audiences but = bland drama school type to me' Sheen) is conducting. Selene is a 'Death Dealer'! I groaned aloud when I heard that. It's her job to kill werewolves. Vampires tasked with killing werewolves are called the 'Death Dealers', not the 'Killer Krew' or the 'Ne'er Do Wellers' but the 'Death Dealers'. Dramatic eh? So in the line of duty as a 'Death Dealer' (I'm sorry but I think it's such a ridiculous name I can't stop typing it), killing werewolves in a generic eastern European setting, Selene inadvertently messes up Lucian's plan and Corvin escapes. Throw in some slo-mo coat action and it's all pretty humdrum so far but wait... A Lycan (all of whom up until now have been in human form shooting guns) metamorphosises quite smartly into wolfman form in a subway tunnel and faces down with a vamp, the vampire hisses, the wolf roars, this is it, this is why I watched this film, vampire versus werewolf in a melee, it's gonna be great, the metamorphosis looked cool, the wolf makeup isn't bad, I've seen a lot worse, they go at each other and... we cut away to a train! And therein lies the problem. It promises much but fails to deliver on just about every level. <br/><br/>The characters are mostly bland and forgettable, rounded out by vampire boss Craven (Craven because he's a cowardly baddie you see... brilliant) and Selene's hotty competition in the vampire clan whose name I can't remember but she's English, blonde and posh so obviously evil. I said mostly because the one memorable character is Viktor, played in a totally off the wall fashion by the eccentric Bill Nighy (Phillip from 'Shaun Of The Dead' for you American cousins).<br/><br/>None of these quibbles should really matter if the central tenet of the movie is exploited, ie vamps v werewolves but it isn't. The confrontations are just big generic gunfights between long coated vampires and short coated scruffy Lycans, in which the Lycans do spectacularly badly. They're like the horror movie version of imperial stormtroopers, completely incapable of hitting a barn door at ten dog paces. When you do see a full wolfman in action he huffs, he puffs, and that's about it, he certainly fails to blow the house down. It all eventually thunders, like an asthmatic sixty-two year old Stalingrad grandmother, to an underwhelming climax of bullets and sewers. I suppose the fact that it only took 134 minutes, and not 15 months, to get there is a small blessing."

It just didn't resonate after numerous takes on the vampire and werewolf material. Van Helsing also is included. Served no purpose other than to be purposeless. Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust I would rate above it for it has scenes that these others would not imagine about like the massive manta like creatures flying and Vampire Hunter D upon his steed flying up and hopping over these massive aerial creatures!

","During a long-standing war between vampires and werewolves, a vampire warrior (Beckinsale) becomes involved with a human who the werewolves are targeting. Beautiful to look at, all shiny and self-consciously Gothic like a Maxim spread. And in an abstract sense rather well directed, particularly in the action sequences, which are a nice absorption of Hong Kong influences. Unfortunately, though, the movie lacks an ounce of imagination or intelligence. For all of the money spent on it there's not that much by way of werewolf action or vampire action, really, for instance ¬ñ there's something really disappointing about watching monsters fighting with guns. The plot is simplistic and predictable (one of the bad guys is named ""Craven"" and he's, um, cowardly), the rationale behind what the monsters can do is fuzzily presented, at best (sometimes vampires just drain blood, sometimes they can turn people ¬ñ but they can't seem to turn werewolves ¬ñ although they can turn our superman), and on and on and on. A real pity, as there's some real talent at work here, but UNDERWORLD strikes one as all technique, no substance. You can't just watch Hong Kong Action movies and horror thrillers and think you can derive a story on that alone."

","I really wanted to like this flick, but I found myself constantly coming up with ways to make it so much better. To boot...<br/><br/>1) Get a better leading man. While Kate and Michael and Bill and Scott provided decent performances, the complete lack of talent on the part of Shane really brought the rest of the cast down.<br/><br/>2) Get a better film editor. The action sequences were remarkably uninvolving and dull. The exposition bits felt clumsy (in ways not necessarily due to acting or script).<br/><br/>3) Get a better stunt choreographer, like Woo-ping. See above statements. Plus, in the final battle sequence between Viktor and Michael, it was SO obvious that their fists were no where near contacting each others' bodies. The gunfight bits were also pretty uninteresting. This might also be the director's fault, so they should get a better director, while they're at it.<br/><br/>4) Get a better script writer. I don't have super-high expectations for this sort of film, but it still could've been far more interesting and involving. For instance, I think if they would have paid more attention to the way these Underworld creatures secretly inhabit our world, by say, starting the movie from Michael's point of view instead of Selene's. Other than Michael, his intern friend and some cannon fodder in the subway, humans played almost no role.<br/><br/>5) Give the vampires and werewolves more interesting powers. Especially the vampires. They were too wimpy. The only interesting thing the vamps could do was jump from high places, or stick to the ceiling (which only happened once). They were atrociously bad shots and couldn't even hear well (like when Selene is surprised by a speeding subway car. Even I could frickin hear a subway car coming at me!) Perhaps I'm expecting more of an Anne Rice style vampire.<br/><br/>6) More gore. I'm not a gore hound, per se. It's just that for this subject matter, it all seemed way too PG-13.<br/><br/>7) Better soundtrack. The sound design was decent, but the early '90s-style industrial metal (which I used to be a big fan of) simply didn't work. They need something creepier, more suggestive, like Einsturzende Neubauten or Aphex Twin.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, looking at Underworld: Evolution credits here on the wonderful IMDb, it would seem it's too late to take any of my advice, as most of the cast and crew is exactly the same."

","Tiny, not-really-spoiling spoilers ahead. When last time have you seen big production movie almost killed by bad acting? I can't even remember another example where almost every main actor's performance is closer to high school drama (I wish!) than such big production. Kate Beckinsale is great. As always. She suits the role and she LOOKS. Special effects are among the best I've seen - and what is most important - in most cases they look very transparent. In case of this one particular movie I really look forward for a sequel (and I hate sequels), because almost all those ""bad-acting characters"" are killed. So - unless it will NOT be a prequel and if SFX will not be overdone (like in Blade II) - it can only be better. I'm a huge fan of vampires so - still 8/10.

"Arkwright99","6","1","3","3 June 2005"," Okay but not as good as Ultraviolet. (Contains Spoilers)
","Just watched the Extended DVD tonight... as a film Underworld was alright, I guess. I liked how my sympathies changed from the Vampires' POV (mainly because you're supposed to identify with Selene initially) to the Lycans' as the film progressed. Once it becomes clear that Lucian is trying to achieve a peace between the Bloods and the Lycans, his goals become more admirable. Even Kraven, from this perspective, seems more sympathetic - although he is an intrinsically craven coward (excuse the pun).<br/><br/>On the minus side, everyone's inability to shoot straight really irked me. I mean, who trained these people? A stormtrooper? Also, there seemed to be no real world impact on this centuries-long war between Vampires and Werewolves; I was thinking as Kahn's men invaded the Lycan base: where's all this hardware coming from? How can you have a mass shoot-out in a public subway and nobody Official bats an eyelid? Everything just seemed completely divorced from 'everyday life', as though this was just a private war that didn't affect normal humans any. I mean, if you you saw some chick dressed in a tight, shiny, PVC catsuit and long PVC trench-coat would you just walk on by? In fact, the Vampires didn't seem that different from humans, except they have pointy teeth and can't go out in the day. Running water is supposed to harm Vampires, yet in UW rain doesn't affect them and Selene can survive driving her car into water. Also, I couldn't work out what the Vampires were supposed to be doing when they weren't trying to kill Lycans. What are their motivations? Just hang around looking bored and sexy? They appeared to have invented a synthetic blood stock, so they don't need to prey on humans - again another way in which the characters are 'divorced' from Real Life, it doesn't affect them and they don't affect it. Clearly there's some sort of group politics going on, mainly in the way there are two (three?) Vampire covens and the leaders (Viktor, Amelia, and Marcus) take it in turns - in accordance with the Covenant - to rule. But rule what exactly? It almost seemed like Vampires wanted power for power's sake, especially Kraven and Erika.<br/><br/>At least Lucian and the Lycans had decently explained motivations imo, the need to create a half-Vampire, half-Lycan hybrid that would end the blood feud - something that he had tried through conception with Victor's daughter and when that failed though finding the untainted Corvinus virus. He seemed almost pleased when he saw that Selene and Michael were falling in love as it meant his dream would (possibly) outlive him.<br/><br/>Watching the film I couldn't help comparing UW unfavourably with another modern updating of the Vampire legends, and for my money, the best modern-day depiction of Vampires remains the UK mini-series, 'ULTRAVIOLET'. (Check out: http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0169501 for details.) There the Vampires had much better motivations behind their actions, which made them more believable. Also, rather than resorting to 'dodgy science' with ultraviolet 'irradiated fluid' bullets, the humans in 'Ultraviolet' used carbon bullets, an echo of the wooden stake through the heart idea - and they were better shots too. :-) One of the things that makes Ultraviolet 'cooler' than Underworld is that it kept the whole 'Vampires don't cast reflections' thing, which UW junked, and also added electronic media to the mix, so Vampires don't show up on CCTV, photographs or electronic voice transmission, such as mobile phones. It doesn't have the Matrix-ish wirework and interminable gun battles that feature in Underworld, but it does have a first-rate storyline, terrific performances from the cast, a chilling score and is well worth checking out if you ever get the chance to grab the DVD.<br/><br/>Underworld was good, but imo it could have been better. 6/10"
"lemon_magic","5","1","3","29 May 2005"," Strong production values short-circuited by a script that gives the viewer no one to care about
","Right out of the gate, I will freely admit that Kate Beckinsale looks absolutely fabulous in this movie, and she almost carries the whole thing by herself. Plus, the art direction and sound design and cinematography are all top notch.<br/><br/>However, the problem is the script and the story that the movie tries to tell. The script lacks any warmth or empathy and turns the movie into a cold, sterile exercise in attitude and pyrotechnics.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around an ongoing secret race war between vampires and werewolves. But the whole movie seems set in a world where human beings barely exist. After the initial shootout in the train station, you never actually see another 'normal' human being aside from Speedman's character and his doctor friend. And Speedman isn't really 'normal', either - he's the genetic link between vamps and wolves. This gives the movie an airless, detached feel, with nothing to ground it in believability or reality. This was certainly a deliberate choice, but it has the unintended consequence of making the war irrelevant to my human perspective and concerns. Look at the Matrix films for a contrast - sure, there are superhuman fantasy forces on display in 'The Matrix', but you never lose contact or identification with the very human heroes contending with those forces.<br/><br/>Similarly, except for the fact that the beautiful and sexy heroine is a vampire, the viewer is given no real reason to care which side should ultimately win the war. The werewolves are brutal, savage, and merciless; the vampires are decadent, self-involved, and fey, with their ranks divided by internal power struggles and treachery. Neither side is at all appealing except for the juvenile desire to identify with the biggest bad-*ss in the schoolyard.<br/><br/>The so-called 'Romeo and Juliet' elements to the film which the promoters try to emphasize, and which supposedly drives the moral center of the film is barely there -it's a 'Bad Hemingway' version of a romance. As far as I can see, we are supposed to realize that the vampire ""Death Dealer"" loves the human male because she doesn't kill him. There is practically no interaction between the two 'romantic leads' until the very end of the movie. They are a couple because the movie ASSERTS that they are a couple destined to be together, but we never see any compelling reason (or evidence) why this should be the case. <br/><br/>And it really grates that the vampires get shredded so easily by the werewolves. I thought the vamps were supposed to be winning this war? What's the point of BEING a vampire if all you can do is survive long drops off a fourth story roof? <br/><br/>Again, the movie looks great; if the story driving it had been even half as good, 'Underworld' might have been the big movie of summer 2003."

","Not, mind you, that this movie is incredibly long; it's a minute over 2 hours if you include the credits.<br/><br/>No, the reason that this movie was so long was because it was extraordinarily poorly done. There were parts that were worthwhile, but they mostly fell into the eye candy category (such as Kate Beckinsdale in a PVC catsuit). <br/><br/>The Lycans, which are going to be the special effects centerpiece of almost any movie involving werewolves, looked okay... until someone decided that they needed to run along walls and ceiling, at which points they looked strained and robotic.<br/><br/>The vampires, unfortunately, seem in no way vampiric. Yes, we have one of them leap to the ceiling and bare her fangs. Yes, they jump off buildings with aplomb and flair. But, as near as we can tell, they are acrobats with bad dental hygiene. Only the Big Bad really ever acts like a vampire, but most of his blood comes from tubes in the back of his head. They're apparently allergic to sunlight, but their mansion has big, airy, windows in nearly every room. Does garlic affect them? What about religious icons?<br/><br/>As for the rest, however, it really wasn't worth the time. For example, you have Selene (Kate Beckinsdale) begin the movie with a monologue about how this secret war has been going on for ""the better part of a thousand years.""<br/><br/>And then the first step in this secret war is for people to shoot up a busy subway with fully automatic weapons. You have elder vampires ""leapfrogging through time"", but no explanation as to why, or what the covenant they keep mentioning is about. The main ""technobabble"" part of the plot is never clear... how is Michael going to unite these bloodlines? Why was Amelia's blood necessary if Selene also had to bite him? None of it is explained in a way that makes things clear and, while everything might have made sense to the characters, they're not the ones you're making this kind of movie for.<br/><br/>Time is also handled poorly in this movie, as you get no real sense of it passing between scenes. Did Michael complete the change early, or was there a day in between those two? We don't know. Time just happens, and the audience doesn't see it or know about it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the final fight, the penultimate scene, wherein the Big Bad does. not. notice. that. his. head. has. been. cut. in. half. Selene jumps, she slices, she lands. The Big Bad whirls around, shoots two short-swords from up his sleeves... and only notices that his head has been cut in half when he sees blood.<br/><br/>The premise had potential. The execution should have been just that... an execution."

The official posters, overdramatized beyond Sillyness as the custom bides, appear regularly in my morning paper.

I wasted 1 hour of a quite lovely evening watching it together with friends before we in unison decided to skip the rest. Tooold yooou.<br/><br/>Someone on the forum claimed the story was supposed to be located in Budapest. That would make a lot of sense since having vampires in England with fake english accents(THE HORROR) is on the verge of rude. Yes, having hungarian vampires with fake english accents(THE HORROR) is so much more original. In fact, that would make this film so much better. Considering that the legendary vampires actually hail from Romania.<br/><br/>Now, why is this movie so bad then?<br/><br/>1) The bad acting. It wasn't outrageous, and it wasn't every actor. But some, like the antagonist vampire whose name I can't be buggered to remember, really didn't pull what little weight they should have. But what can you expect from movie actors these days?<br/><br/>2) The plot. Oh the plot. Not a single tiny piece or feature of this film is original in any way known to civilized man. The ""antagonist-turning-out-to-be-allied-with-the-enemy-OH-NOZ!!1"" makes me want to break down and cry. In a manly way.<br/><br/>And our heroine so decisively going against said antagonist for no particularly obvious reason except we know he's a right sod and she's TEH BABE.<br/><br/>The whole gimmick with some tech/science bi-person developing custom-made weapons and gadgets for the main characters.<br/><br/>And I dare you to get me started on the shallow and quite life-drainingly bad story-introduction.<br/><br/>Actually, I lied. Leaving out every single religious aspect IS original.<br/><br/>I suspect why though, and it's not very clever. Or interesting.<br/><br/>3) Well, the bloody rest. Curse you Matrix.

Can't remember any right now, though.<br/><br/>Observe how I without shame review this film without seeing the second half of it.

","Underworld pitches dim Vampires against dopey Werewolves in a modern day Blade-like, urban (yawn) nighttime setting. I know a movie about light-shunning beasts shouldn't be particularly sunshiny, but the relentless darkness of Underworld, punctuated by cold, feeble illumination, becomes depressing, like an entire winter's blues crushed into an hour and a half.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, vampire movies, by their very nature, are sexy: the penetration of the neck is nothing if not symbolic. Shame Underworld has had every last vestige of red eroticism drained out from its twitching corpse. We enter into a sexless place, damp and sans pleasure.<br/><br/>The scenery, though limited, is gothic and elaborate: sets lit by long shadows of curved menace. Yet the script was blandly modern and functional. A vampire is told, ?you were awoken one hundred years before schedule?, or some such, as if he were being told he was early for some rainy Monday morning meeting. This vanquished any kind of spell Underworld held over me: it was as if the scri were drawn up by undead bean counters, which generally seems to be the case these days.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale is a beautiful lass, beyond the compare of most mortals. Yet here, clad in tight black leather, she seemed frigid and almost androgynous. She reminded me in many ways of Trinity ?out of? the Matrix. Trinity is a remarkably sexy woman, as one realises from watching Memento. But, in that modern way, Trinity has the sex appeal of a rat in a bin bag. Perhaps it is just me, not finding these women wrapped in black leather curiously sexless, but more likely, the fault lies with the director. Why is the audience considered by movie makers as a vacuum to be filled with violence, but not a mote of eroticism? Many modern movies, especially the specimen of a sexless vampire movie, is the modern day equivalent of the Victorians covering table legs to avoid offence. Political correctness is probably at least partially behind this malaise. Yawwwwwwwn!<br/><br/>So, there's no decent dialogue, sex, nudity or sexiness to be found here, what about action then? Again, we are given precious little gratification here. There are a few fights but they are not particularly sensational or invigorating. The fights felt false. Worse, because I didn't care about ANY of the characters, I didn't care who won. The characters of Underworld seem like hibernating cold blooded creatures; deathless amphibians. The werewolves were too poorly lit to be admired, but too blatant to be mysterious.<br/><br/>Underworld is terrifically tedious. This move is another debacle that causes one to question the recent fad with casting a female in the lead role in an action movie. The blazing Lara Croft pistols in delicate hands bullshit is really wearing thin.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that at one point the gal says, ""I've gottagettyouOuddahere!"" Groan? I was reaching for the razor blades!"

There are so many things in this movie that you've seen before that, after a while, you start to believe that you've seen the actual film earlier.<br/><br/>The movie is predictible, boring and actually not interesting at all.<br/><br/>The story behind this is good. Very good actually. And the sets are nice, even though when the art-director said ""Make it look gothic"", someone must have thought he said ""Make everything looks as gothic as you can, even the computers and cell-phones!"" It's so goth that it's silly.<br/><br/>Some of the actors and actresses have their moments. But working with a screenplay like this can't be easy. The director and the writer are clearly not movie-material people. They can't direct and they can't write. It shows clearly in the very uninspired direction, making the movie feel very flat.<br/><br/>
Where some of the film is very sloppy edited, leaving us with questions, some parts of the film is so too explanationary that it feels like they're telling a story for 3-year olds.<br/><br/>If this story had been given a better treatment from a talented writer and then that script had been given to a real director, then this film might have been really good. <br/><br/>Now, it's painfully ridiculus.

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale wears a skin tight leather outfit and kills werewolves. What more do you need? She is a death dealer, dealing death to werewolves.  The werewolves disagree with her profession. It's war. A human gets caught in the crossfire for reasons too confusing to explain. He is not important. What is important is Beckinsale dealing skin tight leather death.<br/><br/>When ""Underworld"" was first announced, it was described as ""Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves"". This description sent shivers down my spine. Oh great! They're going to screw up another horror flick! Well, thankfully the filmmakers came to their senses and realized they didn't need some love story mucking up their monster battle royale. This is the key to Underworld's success: Kill the romance, pump up the violence. I can count the amount of times Beckinsale and the human kissed on one finger. That was more than enough.<br/><br/>So Beckinsale hops in a leather outfit and proceeds to lay waste to the werewolves. The movie speeds right along and doesn't waste time with plot, romance or any other filler that takes away from slow motion carnage. Thank God. Call it a party."

","Take Blade and add most of The Crow and The Matrix and you have this. The latter two I didn't particularly enjoy and Underworld was just as dull and messy as the trailer made it out to be.<br/><br/>Amidst a clutter of cliched sets, impossible to differentiate from each other, and heavily overused lightning and rain (I'm sure there are OTHER ways of creating a gothic atmosphere) an uninteresting and meandering plot slowly fizzles to life. Apparently Vampires and Werewolves have been fighting for years but a couple of them want the war to end. But with no indication of who is good and bad and the lack of a clearly defined hero there's no way to engage with the characters and no reason to care what happens to them.<br/><br/>The SFX are of the jumping thru the air in slow motion while spinning and shooting and doing the laundry variety. Nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. It wasn't interesting the first hundred times I saw it and this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>As you might expect from a movie of this sort, the music is nothing but someone murdering a thrash metal guitar. It's just noise and chaos that matches the incoherent blur onscreen. Many elements of this film lead to exciting possibilities but they've all been thrown away in favor of easy trash. Technically efficient it may well be but Underworld is a failure on every other level.<br/><br/>And what's with the title. At no point in the entire movie is there interaction with the 'real' world. Just a load of running around in sewers and darkly lit mansion corridors. The sense of having an insight into a world that is not meant to be seen by human eyes is non-existent. Even the kidnapped human acts as if the discovery of Vampires and Werewolves is nothing to out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>Highlyclichedlookinggothicmovieworld would have been a more appropriate title.<br/><br/>The one star is purely for Kate Beckinsdale in a leather outfit.<br/><br/>I have the DTS Region 3 edition of this movie. It has a great DTS soundtrack (wow, now can really appreciate the mind-numbingly loud sound effects and awful music). And the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture is super.

","For starters, UNDERWORLD is a hugely derivative film, and that's one of the biggest things working against it. The vampire vs. werewolf plot might not be too familiar ‚Äì after all it's been a long time since those Universal monster flicks ‚Äì but most of the scenes in the film bear the influences of other, better films. For instance the vampire society/hierarchy recalls BLADE, the clothing/action recalls THE MATRIX, and even the scene in the car in which the werewolf guy is pushing spikes through the roof is a rip on TERMINATOR 2. Despite these lame moments and lapses of originality, and the fact that the film is saddled with an unlikeable heroine, UNDERWORLD ain't so bad. The story has a few interesting things to say and director Len Wiseman holds things together well, inserting lots of style into the proceedings; suddenly I'm not so disheartened about him directing DIE HARD 4, after all.<br/><br/>The film is packed with shoot-outs and battles and, while Kate Beckinsale's two-pistol posturing is frankly embarrassing, the violent werewolf attacks are cool and the silver/daylight bullets add some fun to the events that play out. The script, although derivative again, flows along quite nicely and, aside from the central heroine, there isn't really much to dislike. I found this film to be efficient if unoriginal. There's quite a decent cast here, with newcomer Scott Speedman acquitting himself reasonably well as the human caught up in the chaos, and Michael Sheen stealing all of his scenes as chief werewolf, Lucian. Kate Beckinsale is sometimes good ‚Äì in HAUNTED, for instance - but I couldn't stand her here; she's trying too hard to be 'cool' but never escapes the fact that her character is nothing more than a Trinity-from-THE-MATRIX knock-off.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Bill Nighy camps it up as an evil age-old vampire and Kevin Grevioux nabs the best character in the whole film, a hard-ass, hulking werewolf who redefines the meaning of cool. Sophia Myles looks stunning, and I couldn't help wishing that she'd taken the leading role instead of Beckinsale. As to be expected/hoped, the special effects are fantastic, with CGI work coming up trumps throughout. The werewolves themselves aren't great ‚Äì they recall the fuzzy shapes in AN American WEREWOLF IN Paris a little too much ‚Äì but the transformations are astonishing and the head-slicing at the end, while too much like BLADE, is a triumphant moment. The film is surprisingly gory for its rating/audience which is also a pleasant surprise, making it that bit more palatable for adult audiences. Followed by UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION, this is a fun flick, not a classic but a watchable film at least."
"bowmanblue","10","1","4","22 February 2015"," The dark side of Twilight
","There was a time (somewhere before 2008 I believe) where if you mentioned vampires fighting werewolves, you would instantly think of the Underworld saga. Sadly, vampires started to twinkle and werewolves used to run around topless and Selene and her Underworld buddies were forced to take a backseat.<br/><br/>However, if you're bored of vampires gazing at each other longingly and only breathing through their noses, then you may still enjoy watching the two undead races slug it out with guns. Think 'Resident Evil' only darker and better.<br/><br/>Underworld tells the story of a vampire assassin (or 'Death Dealer' as they're called) who, during her war with the werewolves (or 'lycans' to use the technical term) falls in love with a human who may just be destined to play a bigger part in both races' lives.<br/><br/>It's dark like The Crow, has fight scenes like 'The Matrix' and, if you're a guy, Kate Beckinsale running around in skintight rubber. If any of that sounds like you're cup of tea, then you'll probably enjoy Underworld. Amazingly, two decent sequels were also spawned off the back of this (and a fourth instalment that can be taken or left, depending on taste). Either way, give it a go - it's what vampires and werewolves were supposed to be before they used to go to high school together."
"the-awesome-von-grimm","6","1","4","19 November 2014"," It's alright.
","I just saw this movie for the second time. I watched this when I was 13 but I couldn't remember a lot of it. That already says a lot. I enjoy it because I love vampire/werewolf themed movies, but I have to say that it didn't trigger that much. At the end of the movie I am thinking: Okay, this was nice. But not: Oh my God, this is so good I want more and I want to buy the DVD and stuff. I think the reason why it doesn't do that much to me is that I love different characters, I love personalities and I love to get stuck in the movie. Through this whole movie you don't get to know any character that well, except for Lucian who is, because he is the only one that shows some characteristics, my favorite character. Selene is a dull, non-smiling, grumpy girl and she falls in love with this lycan-vamp hybrid guy. I don't even know why, because the only time they spent together is running away from things and being suspicious of each other. There are about 5 characters that you get to know a little, the rest are just background people that only sit around or get killed. They could have done so much more with this!<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it enough to watch the other 3 parts, but I seriously hope that there are more characters with actual emotions and stories and personalities so I can get carried away with this movie. I watched this while checking Facebook every ten minutes and when I am really into a movie the rest of the world doesn't exists for me. I love the gloomy atmosphere and I love that it is a two-sided story: the enemy can be both vampire or lycan, so you get to pick which clan you love better. I like the action in it, but at the end of the movie I think it takes a little too long and I was really itching to stand up the last ten minutes. <br/><br/>So: it's nice to watch every now and then but I don't think that it's a master piece."

","When i tried to watch this movie the first time i didn't even get past the first fight scene. I thought it felt like such a clich√© i didn't even want to see the rest. But now i gave it a second chance. And well, not as bad as i expected the first time around, but i don't know if it's that good either.<br/><br/>The style of this movie is sort of the classic ""bits and pieces"". Meaning that the director and script-writer has taken small pieces of movies they like and put it together into a movie of their own. Now and then i just felt like ""Oh, that's The Matrix"" and ""Oh, that's Blade"" and so forth. Not that there is anything wrong with that necessarily as long as you have something of your own to add to the mix.<br/><br/>So, what worked? Well some of the action scenes were pretty good. The actors took the whole thing the way they should, the acting didn't become neither pompous nor silly like it so often does in vampire movies. And admittedly Bill Nighy is always a joy to watch, as is Kate Beckinsale in tight leather (although a different kind of joy completely). Also, as someone else mentioned in their review, the lack of comic relief was very positive. Nowadays it seems nobody can make an action or horror movie without pushing in stupid one-liners and quips. Here though the mood is kept throughout, which is refreshing. And what didn't work? Well, the whole story is a bit silly really. Vampires fighting Werevolves, and nobody noticing apparently since there is no police and seldom any regular people in the city where this whole thing is taken place. Also the fight scenes again, while some of them were well done, many of them lacked the real nerve. When the fighting is done between two different kinds of monsters i want to see fierce fighting, animal rage and carnage. Here we get some sort of martial arts Matrix style mixed with a little biting. Which really takes the edge of.<br/><br/>To sum the whole thing up i found this movie to be less bad than i had anticipated. Certainly no masterpiece and absolutely not a classic, but still a decent entry into the worn genre of Vampire movies. Also any Vampire movie that excludes the whole eastern European accent thing more or less completely gets at least one extra point."

","Underworld is, as Bill Nighy once said, one of those movies that has everything in it. At two hours though, the movie is draining to watch and requires multiple viewings to understand the story and the world that is made, essentially, from the ground up by Len Wiseman himself. As a comic book fan, I enjoyed it. As a movie fan, I did not. Most of the movie speaks in riddles, and the curtain opening scene will probably lose many viewers. I really did not enjoy how it played out as a film, but there is something about Underworld that helped me watch it from beginning to end.<br/><br/>A six-hundred years war between vampires and werewolves is about to end as the final pieces of a chess game are played between its major players.<br/><br/>I think of this film as a pure urban movie. There are many guns, many players, much grit in its choreography. Stylistically, the film is perfect. It's perfect camp and once you piece together the story, it is an enjoyable film altogether. The film stays true to the whole myth of vampires and the Lycans, as the werewolves are called, are exceptionally put together. If you plan on watching the sequel, I recommend the original as a must first."

Here we have Vampires without any real strength or power, fighting werewolves who seem to be almost immune to silver. Those who only want to judge this film compared to the average action/horror flick, don't bother. The only action we see are very wussy vampires shooting werewolves. SHOOTING. As if there is a shortage of movies that contain action solely featuring firearms. And DAMMIT, THEY'RE VAMPIRES. WHY ARE THEY SO WUSSY? DOES ANYONE AGREE WITH ME? I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of real action one would expect from a movie that has BOTH werewolves and vampires. There is only one fight shown in all of Underworld. Not a good one either. The rest of the fights consisted of confrontation, 2 fighters throwing down, a close up, then a cut to the end of the fight where only one character is shown as the victor. Since I do not feel this movie had much of anything to offer besides very mild entertainment, I give it a 3 out of 10. Please take my advice and avoid it."

","I'll cut right to the chase with this one, Underworld is stylish yet forgettable Hollywood filler.<br/><br/>It features a name actor for audience recognition, particularly among the target demo of males 18 ‚Äì 30 (Kate Beckinsale ‚Äì really a target for males full stop!), an ""actor's actor"" slumming it for fun (Bill Nighy), a young pretty boy faceless enough so that every guy in the audience can imagine themselves in his place when Beckinsale whispers into his ear (Scott Speedman ‚Äì Tug's brother) and a couple of famous monster species going at it.<br/><br/>Sounds OK right? Well let me address my primary concern: the opening scenes introduce both Vampires and Lycans (werewolves), explain a bit of backstory (fight's been going on for centuries) and shows Beckinsale in skintight plastic (nice). Then the scene culminates in a fight between the two warring factions in full view of hundreds in the subway system.<br/><br/>Again no probs¬Ö until I mention it is a gunfight!<br/><br/>Wikipedia tells me that: ""Vampires are mythological or folkloric beings who subsist by feeding on the life essence (generally in the form of blood) of living creatures, regardless of whether they are undead or a living person.""<br/><br/>So a shootout seems a little dumb right? Might as well keep the title but make the combatants Babysitter vs Pharmacist.<br/><br/>Ahhh but Vampires feed on the blood of the living right? Surely that goes on? Once¬Ö and only once, and for full disclosure it must be said that a few werewolves actually do get stuck in and wrap their laughing gear around the enemy ‚Äì but nowhere near enough to say ""how about those werewolves eh?"".<br/><br/>So what we have is another Matrix rip off with a couple of decent action scenes, a pretentious backstory and a mixed bag of performances. In the main the characters a re good, but the guy who plays the Vampire leader of the day ‚Äì they favour a revolving captaincy system ‚Äì Kraven is absolutely lamentable and had me chuckling at all the wrong times for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The Lycan transformations are OK but still not in the same league as An American Werewolf in London, the politics that embroil the middle part of the film annoying and unnecessary and Bill Nighy raises his upper lip a couple times as if to say ""I'm acting!"", then goes back to sleepwalking through his hammy role.<br/><br/>I dunno really, this to me is the brethren of Resident Evil, a companion piece of inept monster related franchises. In theory I want to like both, I mean zombies, vampires and werewolves mean that the filmmakers must have the right tools surely? But alas no, for both franchises the high points mean average films, while the many lows plumb the depths of lazy commercial filmmaking.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this film marks the high point of the series, but I can't even say that it's worth checking out. Even Kate Beckinsale ‚Äì the hottest woman in the world for many ‚Äì is under-utilised in the film. For some reason they choose to try to make her a 5 foot 50 kg hard-ass instead of taking a few seconds to dwell upon her¬Ö other assets.<br/><br/>So if it's a Beckinsale gawkfest your after try google/images/yummo<br/><br/>Final Rating ‚Äì 5.5 / 10.

","I was pleasantly surprised with this film as I am not a great fan of the first two Blade films nor am I particularly enthralled with stories about vampires or werewolves. <br/><br/>There have been a lot of comments made on the subplots, production style, characters, weapons, action scenes, new mythology created for werewolves and vampires, and of course how good Selene looks in a skintight costume, so I won't add to them. It's all very well covered.<br/><br/>I do, however, have a plot question. Why does Craven (too descriptive a name?) make a deal with Lucian (turns out to be a romantic and idealistic werewolf) even if he becomes the all- powerful leader of the vampires when Lucian will be creating a hybrid werewolf/vampire creature (Michael Corwin) that will be more powerful than the vampires? And because vampires will try to kill him on sight, Michael Corwin will have to destroy them all?<br/><br/>In the real world, Craven might have been better off killing Lucien when he was supposed to, assassinating the council (ok, he did do that) and then instead of awakening Viktor and Marcus with blood, maybe pouring milk (or whatever else they have an allergic reaction to) down their tubes. Voila, all hail Craven, king of the vampires! Maybe that would be too easy.<br/><br/>That being said, I still enjoyed this movie a lot and would actively seek out the sequel. Judging from the volume of comments, I think it will do very well."

","There are some movies which have eye-widening or before-their-time special effects. There are some movies with beautifully crafted music, costumes & sets. There are some movies with actors worth watching purely for their acting ability. There are some movies with genuinely interesting story lines.<br/><br/>There are few movies or TV series which have all four in such perfect balance they could be watched over and over and you would not easily tire of them. The Matrix is one such movie. Lord Of The Rings is three. The Passion Of The Christ is one. Babylon 5 and the UK edition of Queer As Folk provide the TV offering. Underworld is also quite justifiably in this list.<br/><br/>The special effects are brilliant, but they're not the purpose of the movie - they exist to carry the plot, rather than the other way round, and they are nowhere pushed further than they need be. The CG animation of the Lycans changing, and the Lycan body-suits, are brilliant.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes are a well-balanced and sometimes imaginative blend of classic Vampire Goth and Matrix-style Cybergoth (which is probably why the film got so many Matrix comparisons - other than the set and costume design, which is inevitable with the genre, the underground station shootout is the only similarity - and unlike the Matrix, the sequence HAS to take place in an underground station for various reasons). Kraven's suit and the Death Dealer uniforms were especially good.<br/><br/>I found only one actor whose performance I was disappointed with - and he was only on screen for ten seconds, and the contribution was so minimal his part could theoretically have been eliminated entirely. Beckinsale's performance was exemplary, especially given the number of lines she had, but for acting I'd say the best were Shane Brolly's Kraven and Bill Nighy's Viktor - two of the most scheming, manipulative and yet distinctly different characters you could imagine.<br/><br/>The story line was the real gem though. Double-dealing on top of skulduggery laid over some pretty advanced genetics, all mixed with a heavy dose of romance, a dash of genocide, and stirred well by some of the best twists I've seen in a while, then set in an epic scale of events. Yet it still managed to be driven by the characters' personalities as much as the situation!<br/><br/>Anyone who doesn't mind needles, body parts, blood and some pretty nasty ways of killing people will enjoy the film. And if you're worried about nudity, don't - the furthest extent is a few Lycans in wolf-mode, a dehydrated elderly Vampire, the delectable Scott Speedman (unfortunately obscured under a load of latex and body-paint), and a couple of bloodied male torsos."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","5","2 June 2004"," Better than I expected, but considering how low my expectations were...
","Back when I first saw the trailers for this film, I immediately thought; ""Oh. Another cheap rip-off of The Matrix... and it seems like they stuck some Blade and The Crow in there, too, for good measure."" I was fairly surprised when I saw it, but it didn't really show me something that fascinated me, like The Matrix and its sequels did. The action in it is reasonably good, but several of the scenes were confusingly filmed; you couldn't really keep track of where the different characters are at any point, except for when they're on screen together. The action also almost only consists of shooting guns, which really doesn't get a lot of results in the film; I found it to be far more exciting in the rare situations where the Lycans were transformed and fighting the Vampires. The very last fight scene in the film was also great, very intense and unpredictable. The special effects in the film are very well-made, both the CGI and in general the creature effects look very good. The film somehow seemed to focus more on the plot than the action or the effects, which is a pretty big mistake with a film like this; first of all, it's a film made in a time where this sort of film is made to be bigger and better than the last, which mainly refers to action and/or special effects, second, the story isn't that great nor very original. I think they overrated how good the story is, not to mention all the unexplained new things they introduce to the concepts of Vampires and Lycans. I do think the story was fairly interesting, and it is somewhat original(I guess). I think one of the things that annoyed me the most was that a lot of the time, I wasn't entirely sure who were the Lycans and who were the Vampires, since they basically look the same, in their human form. The plot is OK, reasonably original, but the film makes a mistake in making it so plot driven instead of focusing on at least a little more action. The acting is mostly decent, no fantastic performances, but what can you expect from a movie like this. The characters are hard to comment on, since just about everyone apart from the two main characters either are jerks from the beginning, or turn out to be jerks somewhere in the film. The cinematography is nothing special, at times it's even very bad. I have to congratulate the crew on what a good job they did on the creature effects; just before writing this review, I found out that nearly no CGI effects were used at all. That's very impressive, considering how good the creatures look. Great job on that. All in all, the film does look like a rip-off, but only on the outside. On closer inspection, the film does have a few original thoughts in it. I recommend it to fans of dark, gothic films, containing some action and special effects, with a decent plot. Don't expect to see loads of great action sequences, or huge effect-filled scenes. Don't expect a great plot. Actually, about the action, if you've seen the trailer, maybe you shouldn't even bother seeing the film, because most of the good action sequences are shown there anyway. Only watch this if you *really* love this type of films. 6/10"
"rosscinema","4","1","5","7 February 2004"," Looks good but lacks convincing story
","A film about a war between werewolves and vampires and the leading character is a sexy female in leather? Can't go wrong can it? Well, while this can be interpreted as silly fun I still had to many problems with the story and it's lead actress. Story is of course about how there is a war on Earth (I think) between werewolves and vampires and this has been going on for many centuries. Kate Beckinsale is Selene who is a leather clad female vampire and she spends most of her time hunting down werewolves that hide inconspicuously in the human world. A young man named Michael (Scott Speedman) gets bitten by a werewolf named Lucian (Michael Sheen) and Selene notices that he was picked for a certain reason. Selene does some investigating and discovers that the werewolves are trying to mutate their species into a hybrid so that they can eliminate all vampires.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Selene takes the information back to her vampire brood but the vampire in charge Kraven (Shane Brolly) ignores her and has been acting suspiciously. The leader of their group is Viktor (Bill Nighy) who has been sleeping for many years and is not scheduled to awaken for many more but Selene does awaken him to seek help from Kraven's lack of support. Meanwhile, Michael is slowly turning into a werewolf or something like it but he and Selene have an attraction to each other. <br/><br/>This film is directed by Len Wiseman who is making his debut here as a director and he has been primarily known as a set decorator for films like ""Stargate"". The look of this film is it's biggest asset and he gives this film a very effective gothic appeal. Every frame is shot either in doors or at night so there is no sunshine visible at all. The costumes and make-up also are some of the films highlights and Speedman's transformation is reminiscent of ""An American Werewolf in London"". Some of the problems I had with this story is the lack of information about where or when this is supposedly taking place. Is it on Earth or one of those so called alternative universes? Also, this is the first time I have ever seen werewolves able to crawl on the sides of walls like squirrels on trees. Selene is a vampire but in one scene she looks at herself in a mirror. Is she only partially a vampire? We never find out and there are other inconsistencies in this cartoonish script. While Beckinsale is adequate in the lead role I had to ask myself if the film could have benefited from another actress known for her physical attributes like Angelina Jolie or Halle Berry. I think it could and Beckinsale's lack of conviction hurts her in this role although I do understand her wanting to show the public another side of her abilities. This film is harmless and I can't argue with anyone that finds it entertaining on a comic book level but I do wish the story has been tightened up a bit and allowed the characters to engage in something resembling an intelligent conversation. Visually striking but film fails to entertain me on both levels."

","These two never get along with each other and this was also already the case in the American movie ""Underworld"" from almost 15 years ago. The writer and director here is Len Wiseman and he also worked on all the sequels that follow up on this one, also the upcoming as this series here, in contrast to Twilight is still running and dishing out a new installments every couple years. I personally found Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen the most interesting performances and their characters the most interesting as well from this movie. I guess it was not their fault that I did not end up liking this film. One major reason may be that the (director's cut) version I watched easily went for longer than two hours. And I have to say the story material they had here, looking only at the important and successful stuff, is no more than 90 minutes. Probably less. The rest felt just like incredibly forgettable filler material.<br/><br/>That is why, in my opinion of course only, it is far from justified that this has become such a long-running series. Maybe I'm not doing the makers justice, but if we are looking at the entire franchise, they really need to step up their game compared to this one here, especially in terms of essentialism and focus. And maybe also in terms of more interesting characters as this film relies a lot on makeup and tries to make up for lack of great character development and elaborations. I will maybe check out some of the more recent installments at some point in the future and see if they managed to do so. I guess this series is only still running because people still go to the theaters to watch these films, so you cannot really blame the makers for that fact. This is how things roll today in terms of franchises that include many movies. As for how it all started, namely with the 2003 film ""Underworld"", I dish out a thumbs-down and don't recommend the watch."

All I remember are chases ... werewolves chasing vampires. Vampires chasing werewolves. In fast sports cars. In heels. <br/><br/>The pacing was as follows: Ten minutes of action followed by ten minutes of regrouping of the vampires in their ""lairs"" to plan and execute another series of attacks against the werewolves. <br/><br/>I suppose that all the fast cars and smashups and blood are supposed to give me a sense of suspense and tension. All I derived was boredom. There did not need to be vampires or werewolves in this picture. It would work nicely as a gang war movie.

Somehow I suspect that the characters were supernatural rather than human to bring in the horror fans."
"bob the moo","Null","1","6","18 December 2006"," Derivative stuff without too much of specific interest but does enough to tick the boxes for the teenage male target audience
","When their feared and ruthless leader Lucian is killed, the Lycan clan is scattered. The Vampires claim victory in the war but set out to hunt the remaining Lycans to the point of extinction. Selene is one of a group of vampire warriors grouped together for just this task. They stalk and kill Lycan but, when a simple trail into a subway station turns into a massive gun battle, Selene uncovers evidence of a possible pack living underground but, more worryingly, finds the Lycan were in the subway station to try and capture a specific human. Meanwhile Lucian is not as dead as rumoured and instead plots his next action in the war as Selene tries to figure out what the Lycans want with human Michael.<br/><br/>The trivia entry on the IMDb page for this film states that it was sued for copyright infringement just before release. It also states that a sequel and prequel were greenlit on Canadian ticket sales alone. Both these things I can easily believe because at times the film is so derivative that many different people could have attempted to sue, plus it ticks so many boxes for what the teenage market wanted that the studios were bound to come back for more as long as it sold. Of course moaning that an action blockbuster is derivative is a bit like moaning that fire burns ¬ñ it comes with the territory. The pitch about Romeo/Juliet is nonsense as the story contains very little of this and what there is is weak. The overall story is good enough to hold the action together though, even if it is nothing that clever or interesting.<br/><br/>Current Die Hard 4 director Wiseman directs well enough, capturing the Gothic feel of it while also providing all the cool things that the target audience would be looking for. So we have lots of tight PVC (particularly around the bum of Beckinsale) and lots of action to get them in. The action is alright but it does feel like the Wachowski brothers could have also been reaching for their lawyers ¬ñ particularly looking at the opening subway shoot out, which screams Matrix from every frame. The cast are reasonable good and benefit from some strange but effective casting choices. Beckinsale is in great shape and does the whole ""sexy, dark martial arts babe"" thing really well. Shame more wasn't asked of her in terms of character but it is what it is. Speedman is too bland to really write too much about so I won't. Sheen is at a disadvantage with me because the last few times I have seen him he has been playing Tony Blair to the point where I find it hard to separate them. He is quite good but it is hard not to be distracted by him playing a leader involved in an endless war ¬ñ particularly one who continues to be leader no matter what happens to his clan. Nighy was a good choice and is effective in his role ¬ñ mostly because he really fits the look. Fellow Belfast (""I'm outta here"") lad Brolly is poor. The rest of the cast features notable turns from Myles, Prison Break's Miller and Grevioux (one of the writers) with a voice so deep that I felt his lines before I heard them.<br/><br/>Overall then a typical teenage-boy-targeted summer blockbuster. Monsters, sexy martial arts girls in tight clothes and lots of bullets = box office returns and the promise of more. If you are in target audience and just looking for this then this will deliver just what you expect it to. Just don't expect the story or characters to be anything that good or for anything about it to be different or better than what you would see in lots of other films all aiming for the same audience."

","This is what you get when some genius with no talent for filmmaking cpmes up with the idea to do The Matrix with vampires. And werewolves. And lots and lots of CGI. Most of it not very impressive.
The screenwriters seem to think they don't actually need compelling characters or an involving story to have a film. Don't get me wrong: the story is there, but it's a convoluted mess that confuses the audience with endless exposition, while providing no emotional payoff of any kind. We just don't care about these characters, and frankly, we don't even know what is at stake. Who is on whose side? Who knows what? What's the motivation of the protagonists? Good luck trying to figure that out. By the way, half the film consists of annoying flashbacks that pile up tons and tons of new information. Did a vampire film have to be so convoluted? How about a simple story, but one that makes people feel something?
If someone asked me to summarize the plot in a few sentences, I couldn't do it. It's too complicated. And I didn't understand anything anyhow. And does the main protagonist have any emotions whatsoever? I have seen video game characters with a more distinct range of emotions.

","I was already starting on a bad note with Underworld, because I've never been a fan of occult creatures and magical monsters. Sitting down to a movie about a vampire who hunts down werewolves instantly turns me off. It began to win me back, though, because it has a noir vibe to the beginning, and Kate Beckinsale's character is like a detective in some ways. While I don't love the grayed-out color palette of the film, if they were aiming for this kind of neo-noir feeling, then it would be fitting. Where it falls apart is that it blends a bunch of Matrix-style action into a movie that was already trying to juggle two wildly different genres. It just becomes noise and chaos, and ruins any sense of drama or excitement when there are guns blazing constantly.<br/><br/>The one thing I do kind of appreciate about most vampire or werewolf movies is that they establish some rules about how one of these creatures is injured or killed. Yet, in Underworld they make those rules fuzzy and confusing. Sometimes the creatures are knocked down by a few magic bullets, other times they can take a million without batting an eye (which then begs the question, why are guns the chosen weapons for either of them?) I found the entire plot to be a bit convoluted and at times stupid. There were some decent casting decisions in the movie, even if it was a bit obvious where certain loyalties lied when I saw actors that tend to get thrown into the same kind of roles in every film.<br/><br/>My biggest question as Underworld got going was ""why are the vampires the good guys in this scenario?"" I kept wondering this, because both are dangerous creatures and we have no reason to take a side other than our protagonist is a vampire so her people must be the heroes. But I have to commend them, because they did address this later on in some fashion. I'll say no more, but at least they didn't completely drop the ball on motivations and explaining why we should care. So, while there wasn't much I enjoyed about Underworld, I did give it a slightly higher rating because they handled the storytelling a bit better than I had anticipated.

","'Underworld (2003)' reverses the usual 'Hollywood' gender roles in a relatively refreshing way, so it's a shame that it also conforms to the tropes of its genre in pretty much every other area, to the point that it's predictable essentially down to the letter and that some of its more extraneous plot elements feel as though they were included out of a false sense of necessity rather than out of a legitimate narrative need. Its tight, black leather aesthetic is very telling of the time in which it was made, a time when such faux 'gothic' stylings were considered 'outsider' and 'cool'. It permeates the entire piece to the point that it all feels fairly dated, though this 'sleek' style is so all-encompassing that it sort of becomes a signifier for the heightened reality of the flick itself - something that can be accepted almost as readily as its vampiric conceits - as opposed to a statement of its actual visual quality. There's enjoyment, albeit 'turn your brain off' and quite silly enjoyment, to be had during some of the action sequences and, even, some of the more high-strung melodrama. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I don't think it was ever trying to be. It's a decently enjoyable film when it's underway. 6/10"

Convinced that these werewolves murdered her family, she's hellbent on destroying the Lycans to save her covenant. It's a complicated family tree with deathly descendants and plenty of double-crossing, which does make for an interesting story. McBride's screenplay turns traditional monsters into a gritty gang war whilst embedding genetics along the way. It feels fresh, even when watching it today, just a shame that McBride's script is littered with thin characterisation and plagued with bland dialogue. Several scenes where I became disengaged just because of how tedious the story was told. Takes itself far too seriously with all the mumbo jumbo about the Corvin bloodline, lycans, vampi...yawwwn...see what I mean? What Underworld does do well is world building. The bleak underground environment and stormy weathering creates a gothic atmosphere that would suit the accompaniment of an Evanescence soundtrack (hold onto that thought...). The production and visual designs were a dark delight and certainly assisted in enhancing the world it was portraying. Acting was functional, aside from Nighy and Sheen who gave great performances, everyone else just walked around in the darkness shooting at each other. Beckinsale definitely catapulted herself into stardom though, and clearly liked wearing leather attire ever since. The minimal use of CGI was appreciated and the final act was excitingly directed by Wiseman. It is plagued with generic sound effects, y'know the ones you could find in any horror or gothic video game, which does infuriate me slightly as it just urges me to play 'Devil May Cry' again. However, Underworld is a thinly written promising start at blending action and horror together. The question is can it maintain this level of interest? Well, you'll see..."

The head of the lycans Lucian (Michael Sheen) has taken a particular interest in Michael. The movie contains some great action scenes that I remember really pleasing me when I was much younger. I always thought this movie had a great mix of action and horror tropes.<br/><br/>The plot is all sorts of jumbled picking up in the middle of a story so as to dull any sort of character emotional impact and confusing lots of different threads.

","There's guilty pleasure movies, and then there's the garbage like Underworld that take themselves way too seriously in an attempt to make silly action fun. What could pass as an entertaining and visually dazzling cable watch ends up as a confusing romp of a fantasy adventure.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale. I think when she's used right, she's of immense value to any film she's a part of. Take Love & Friendship from earlier this year for example; she was given a solid script and the room to use her British wit & charm in a rewarding performance. Sure she's gorgeous to look at in Underworld, but I can't help but think that the writing didn't allow her to truly show her chops. With that said, her ability is clearly superior to the awful supporting cast. Some of the supporting performances (Shane Brolly) are disappointingly off-putting.<br/><br/>Much like a ton of early 2000's action films, Underworld suffers from trying to emulate The Matrix too much. It's always raining, the action scenes are darkly lit, and the characters are in a constant slow motion gaze during the shootouts and fights. I can't necessarily blame Underworld for having bad action, it was simply a product of its time. In fact, there are some good looking stunts here, most of them in camera as well. That's when Underworld is at its most appealing.<br/><br/>When Underworld takes itself too seriously and the story is bogged down by exposition scenes (that actually make the film more confusing) it's no fun. The reason I went back and began the franchise this many years later is because I was hoping to have a fun franchise to go to the theaters for in a few weeks with Blood Wars being released. Whether I stick with the franchise or not, I'm not sure. But I know one thing for sure, Underworld's first film is painful to watch.<br/><br/>+Beckinsale is watchable<br/><br/>+Some nice stunt sequences<br/><br/>-Really bad script/dialogue<br/><br/>-Supporting performances<br/><br/>-Ultimately generic<br/><br/>4.8/10"

","Sometimes I think that Underworld would have made a better music video than a film. Evenescance could have wailed out a 90 minute goth number that could have just been laid in instead of audio, and it wouldn't hurt the film's narrative one bit. Indeed, you could just pop in your ear buds and and listen to whatever while you're watching it, and still pretty much know what's going on. This one is all visual flair and slick, posturing special effects that thunder along with little regard for logic, story or character development. That's not necessarily such a bad thing, as long as you know what you're going into and aren't expecting a dense, heady Bram Stoker outing. It concerns a nocturnal, bullet ridden war between vampires and lycans, known to us as werewolves. Kate Beckinsale is Selene, a front runner for the vamps, slashing and shooting her way through various stunts, shootouts and combat scenes in a swanky leather outfit. At a crucial time during the war, she falls in love with an injured lycan (Scott Speedman) and feels conflicted. As far as plot goes that's pretty much all she wrote. You're left to absorb a deafening opera of supernatural action that doesn't let up until the end. The characters tirelessly fight for a full fifteen minutes at the beginning of the movie before a single line of dialogue is even uttered. In a movie so heavily populated by sound, fury and style and so bereft of any actual weight, you better make damn sure the visual and stylistic elements deliver so you have something to keep people in their seats<br/><br/>This one makes good work of that category, it's visual aesthetic a dark Poe-esque palette, the creatures and violence memorably crafted. The vampires are sullen, nihilistic brooders who sit around in cathedral esque night clubs drinking blood from flute glasses. The werewolves are virile, primal beasts, all sinew, scruff and set - demolishing physicality. It's cool stuff, if you don't examine the 'plot' too carefully and just sit back for the dreary, frenetic, super charged ride that sometimes doesn't even know itself where it's going. But it sure knows how to get there."

","I've seen Underworld twice now, and I'e enjoyed it twice. It's got some great action bits, memorable characters, and it moves along at a great clip, what's the problem you ask? well I just feel it wasn't as good as it could have been. I've always loved the idea of Vampires Vs Werewolves and this movie was just brimming with it, I just felt disappointed by it all. The finale is a memorable one, with a great showdown between Viktor|Nighy| and Selene|Beckinsale|. The gore level is pretty decent, with some nice effects, and not an abundant amount of CGI like I expected.<br/><br/>Performances. Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous to look at, and makes for a great anti heroine. She's got the right amount of emotions, the kick ass attitude, and the proper attire to look right. Scott Speedman is decent as Michael, but not as refined as he is in the sequel. Michael Sheen is intense as Lucian, I dug him. Shane Brolly played a great, yet intense weasel. Bill Nighy stole a lot of the scenes he was in, with his frighteningly intimidating performance. His scenes with Beckinsale were endearing.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Underworld is a decent way to pass the time, but It's not as good as it should have been. I'll admit I was disappointed, but all I want from a movie is to be entertained, and for the most part Underworld got the job done on many occasions. Well worth a look.<br/><br/>6 1/2 /10"
"dmasursky","5","0","1","27 May 2009"," Disappointing
","For a movie promoted as ""Romeo and Juliet with vampires"" there is precious little romance to relieve the scenes of slaughter. This movie is well-made, with a great cast, but it's clearly intended for the 14-24 male demographic, with almost nothing to appeal to other audience members. I wanted to like this movie - I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale and I always like a movie where the women kick ass, but this was too gory and too relentless for me. They threw in some plot toward the end, but by then, I was too bored to care - how many different ways can you show a sharp implement entering a body? I know that's endlessly entertaining for some, but I expected more from this. Just shortening the movie would have helped - 2 full hours of vampires chasing werewolves, and vice versa, is at least 30 minutes more than necessary. Vampires are hot again - by not appealing to a wider audience, these filmmakers missed an opportunity."
"johnnyboyz","5","0","2","28 March 2009"," Vampires for the 21st Century, but there's not an awful lot going on here besides this.
","Underworld is the horror film for the YouTube generation. It presents two of Universal's many classical horror monsters from yester-decade and updates them for the contemporary age that is the 21st Century. Similary to the following year's Van Helsing and to quite some similar failings, Underworld presents vampires and werewolves, not as subjects of horror designed to frighten, but as action heroes fighting one another in a picture that is more akin to a war film than it is most anything else. The hybridity of the genres and general updating does not stop there, for at its centre is a strong female hero, a bringing into the 21st century for both species and an essence of noir for good measure.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about Underworld is its study of post-modern (indeed, post-classical) vampires and how now, they are all techno-literate beings whom dress in the latest fashion and carry on with a certain legacy of looking smart and always trying to remain one-up on their enemies. While all around contemporary Hollywood over the last few years, different directors explore their chosen 'types' of vampires, Len Wiseman purely updates and shifts into the 21st Century. Some examples I'm thinking of are Robert Rodriguez' Hispanic vampires in From Dusk Till Dawn; the African-American half-vampire lead in the Blade films and a more obscure example in 2001 film The Forsaken, in which you had to believe a group of relatively harmless looking bunch of teen vampires were on the brink of world domination. These ideas have continued on with films like Twilight, which places a romantic spin on the character.<br/><br/>Wiseman has taken what it was for a character to be a vampire and has purely transformed them for now: cloaks into PVC, Gothic bookcases and books into laptops and computers and has gifted them with an array of firearms. On the other hand, the werewolves or 'lycans' in this film are grotty and dirty. They inhabit grungy and filthy locations and seem to have none of the advanced ways of living their counterparts have, if the vampires are sexy then the Lycans are just plain ugly. They are additionally evil and sadistic in their procedures, taking blood from people that really don't want to be there.<br/><br/>Underworld takes place in an odd Eastern European/United States hybrid of a location and sees its female lead, named Selene (Beckinsale), go through a number of motions before she comes across a certain human named Michael Corvin (Speedman), someone whom the Lycans have targeted as part of their plans. Following Michael being bitten and Selene's determination to save him, a love story begins to bloom. The love story between two rivalling factions makes me think of Romeo and Juliet, but in another one of Wiseman's twisting of classical conventions, one agent of the party is a member of the 'enemy' against his will.<br/><br/>Alas, all the glory within this film lies in its ideas and its here we remember that the film is a bit of a dead zone, offering murky and somewhat camp entertainment (especially when Bill Nighy turns up) at the best of times. Wiseman has a strong, female lead at the centre of his film but the director conflicts his interests in the shooting of her, that being he does so in a manner in which she's rendered an object. Underworld begins in a relatively ominous fashion with the set up to do with the Lycans trying to find a descendant of a certain someone and the fact they've developed a weapon that can kill vampires a lot more efficiently than anything else that has previously been produced.<br/><br/>The film is quite good fun for about thirty-five minutes, then the charm wears off; then we recognise the all updating of the vampire conventions, etc. and get tired of it; and then it just descends into nothing before it ends. What was quite good very quickly becomes ugly looking characters standing around explaining the plot to one another when they aren't merely grumbling their lines amidst bleak and tired looking locations. The vampires spend their spare time shooting statues in the large, Gothic manor house they inhabit purely for target practise but what happens when they decapitate all their statues? They look stern and talk in gruff and ominous tones as their leader, Viktor (Nighy), who is awoken for certain reasons, slobbers and cackles all over the place in a role that on another day you might think was a pantomime performance.<br/><br/>What about the Lycans? Well, one Lycan towards the end can seemingly turn into a werewolf and back again at will, despite there not being any obvious evidence of a full moon and whenever they do come up against someone they don't like, they maul them in a series of close up shots of blood, biting and shards being extracted from bodies that are just grotesque and feel oddly out of place in what is a casual, '15' certificate, gloomy period drama for most of the time. I read that Wiseman did a lot of concept art and drawing for the film ‚Äì it shows. What also shows is his lack of attention to everything else. He's caught the 'look' of the vampires and the cinematography is relatively good but the film's running on empty. It makes me think: what else can a film about warring vampires and werewolves be about? Well, probably not much which further begs the question 'why even bother in the first place.'"

","I knew this film was about vampires and werewolves, and I knew the lead actress, but that's about it, so I suppose I had to give it a go, from director Len Wiseman (Die Hard 4.0). Basically a war rages between the vampire and Lycan (werewolves) races, and Selene (Van Helsing's Kate Beckinsale) the beautiful vampire warrior, is entrenched in it. There is a plot to kidnap Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), after he is proved to hold the key to ending the war (something to do with his blood). Selene also discovers a plot to combine the strengths of both races to create a new invincible species of predator. You find out by the way that the war started because of the death of a vampire's wife, caused by a Lycan. Also starring The Queen's Michael Sheen as Lucian, Bill Nighy as Viktor, Shane Brolly as Kraven, Erwin Leder as Singe, Sophia Myles as Erika, Robbie Gee as Kahn, Kevin Grevioux as Raze and Prison Break's Wentworth Miller as Dr. Adam Lockwood. The special effects aren't bad, but they don't really add much to the story, and it is not really gripping or interesting to be honest, it just seems too much to be copying the gun play and fighting style of The Matrix, so not the most original stuff. Adequate!"

"owen_twistfield","6","0","1","22 December 2007"," Almost campy were it not for the lack of campy dialog
","(This is a reevaluation of this movie: my revious review was more positive and gave 7 out of 10.)<br/><br/>Underworld was doomed never to be a 'good' movie. What was to be expected? A well written plot? Superb acting? Great dialog? It is simply not that kind of movie. After seeing it more than once I found that this movie get's dull quickly. It is simply a movie that has nothing to special to offer(besides kate that is) and re-uses things we have seen before(and better)in blade and the matrix. You should understand that the problem with this is not re-using things, because few movies actually invent new things. But this movie is beset by continuous re-using things that have been used before. It is like replaying a song over and over again until you get sick and tired of it. The style of this movies is at no point innovative. For sure a nice dark brooding mood pervades everywhere but is ruined most of the time by overusing items of just using strange items. When it is raining everyone unfolds the same black umbrella. Every vampire and werewolf is dressed in the same leather trenchoat. All use the same weapons(G38K) and use the same dumb tactics(running at the enemy firing their weapons). Especially bad is the music. Which yet again use no <br/><br/>Le met tell you first that I found none of the cast really bad except for Bill Nighy. Kate Beckinsale is the corner piece of the movie. She is an attractive woman who does a reasonable job in portraying Selene, a battle-hardened killer vampire driven by her hatred for werewolves. She seems to thaw somewhat when she meets the human Michael(Speedman), but not much, for you can't expect to much from someone who spends the better part of a millennium hunting ferocious monsters to extinction. At no point Selene turns into a steamy lover mainly because that would out of character. I stress this as many critics comment on the bad chemistry between Selene and Michael. But I found Michale Sheen(lucian) and Shane Brolly(craven) much more interesting. In fact probably Brolly is playing the most interesting character of all.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are acceptable. Those with kate are nice because they late her jump and run all over the place. They are well done and varied ranging of every method of 'interaction' one can think of and allowed by the tight budget. In fact is is surprising how much has been accomplished.<br/><br/>While i found underwold a nice movie to watch once, it also saddens me that so much is missing. The movie really suffers from stale dialog and music. The plot has some interesting views on the vampiric and werewolf state but fails to miss the point that vampires and werewolves are predators using humans for subsistence. As far as the movies goes, Selene is only a sexy looking lady with some interesting teeth and eyes, a fling for tight-fitting dark leather clothing, fast cars and the nightlife. In fact the only time we actually see a vampire bite someone is when Selene needs to to safe speedman(you understand when you have seen the movie). The nail on the coffin is however the lack of any spicy dialog and good music. Don't expect any memorably conversation or one liners: there is none, nothing, nada, zipp. And music. It is another soulless mix of heavy metal and eletronics. This is really bad as we all know that you can have a crappy plot and have mediocre acting, but to become camp you absolutely need to have a campy dialog and campy music.<br/><br/>I hope that the third underworld installment scheduled in 2009 will give us the proper dialog and music. Speedman should die horrible in the first scene, making Selene into an bad-dude wise cracking lady who exacts revenge on anyone crossing her path in a bloody horrible way. No further plot needed. Oh and throw in some Nietzsche: he mixes so well with vampires."

Most people say that Kate Beckinsale could be a good reason to watch for that but I think not enough.<br/><br/>It has been one week to watch it and I don't remember even a remarkable scene so this shows the quality of film. A fight between Lycans and Vampire rises and this fact is also related to mankind. Lycans follow a man who they believe him as a superior featured for Lycan race. Vampires also follow this man and want the helps of their ancestor.

Hey, let's put together some elements of matrix and blade, make just about everyone wear tight black leather, and mix together vampires, werewolves, obligatory romance, digital effects and call that a film. This one is simple the lamest film I've seen this year. Kate Beckinsale is like female Keanu Reeves - without colour, smell or taste. Seriously - what is it with being a vampire, un-nature's own Gothic killing machine and a little helpless girl at the same time. Maybe those two elements can be put together, but now it's just one indifferent mess, like 99% of the film. The romance between the main characters is unreal... maybe it's supposed to be so, with the undead and all. And the braindead who like this kind of film, in which every event can be predicted beforehand. <br/><br/>But still, it would be better to make one decent music video rather than a sequel."

","I liked this movie. The werewolf costumes were awesome, especially when you consider that they were actual actors running around in high tech werewolf suits, NOT CGI. For all I've read on the user comments board for this flick, most people must not have watched the featurettes and don't know that most of the effects in this film are NOT CGI (except for the transformations, heads splitting off and other stuff like that).<br/><br/>On to the actors/characters. The characterizations were a mixed bag, I liked some of the actors, and not others. Michael Speedman was apparently in a coma during most of this film, and why did the directors have to make Selene look like a PVC fetish queen? If she's so single-minded in her focus on killing all Lycans, why does she bother to run around in a tight uncomfortable PVC catsuit with chunky heels? Wouldn't combat fatigues or something be more utilitarial? Male fan service I guess. Kraven just got on my nerves almost immediaely.<br/><br/>On the good side, Bill Nighy was good as Victor the bigoted lead vampire. He came off as one thing in the beginning, but when the plot twist happens near the end he comes off as something else completely. Michael Sheen gave a thoughtful performance as Lucian the head Lycan. I couldn't help but feel sad at the end when you see Lucian's fate, especially after Michael's flashbacks are explained. I often felt myself rooting for the Lycans at the end. On a side note, I don't know how that one Lycan, the big black one, did that thing with his voice; sounded like it would hurt to talk like that through a whole movie.<br/><br/>The settings and the camera-work were all serviceable, nothing stuck out as bad or particularly laughable. I am starting to get sick of wire stunts though.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that it was the best movie ever made, but I have watched it multiple times on DVD and I could probably watch it again."

","""Underworld"" was made for the soul purpose of turning two icons of the horror genre, werewolves and vampires, and throw them into the action genre, along with some lousy special effects (which there are VERY few) and even worse script. Here's my take on the ""Swing-and-a-miss"" attempt to turn horror-movie creatures into action-movie stars.<br/><br/>Underworld's main character is the very 'robotic' vampire woman, Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale. Selene has been hunting werewolves (or Lycans, which is the director's 'clever' name for them, taken from a deformity in the mind that makes the person think they turn into a wolf, but anyway) and she is also on a lot of stress from her commander, Kraven, and some blonde vampire that wants to be her. One night, during an assignment, Selene discovers the Lycans (*cringe*) are looking for the ""direct descendant"" of their elder, Alexander Corvinus. But (uh oh!) Selene, seeking help, awakens one of the vampire elders, Viktor, to aid her and her kin in the stopping of this plot (which for some reason, she seem to know exactly where the Lycans (*cringe*) are going and what they're planning). Viktor gets angry. Apparently, the other elder, Marcus, is supposed to be awake to rule and not him, but he quickly forgives Selene for waking him up many centuries early when he hears how the Lycan (*cringe*) leader, Lucian (who was thought to be dead), is still alive and well and is leading the Lycans (*cringe*) to their plan.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we are introduced to Michael, the unfortunate human who happens to be the Lycans' target and while he is trying to escape from Selene, who isn't good at introductions, and the werewolves chasing him, he runs into Lucian, who bites him, and everyone knows that werewolf theory, if you're bitten by a werewolf, you become one, and that is exactly what starts to happen. Then, the action takes a long break until the ending conflict. In this time, it's all talk talk! DISCOVERY!!! Talk talk talk talk talk. Plot twist!!! Talk talk talk talk! Then, big showdown, and the movie ends as a cliffhanger to the much (MUCH) better, Underworld: Evolution.<br/><br/>During all the boring 'explaining the obvious' scenes, you are just sitting there, waiting for the action to start up, but it doesn't. By then, you'll probably turn off the movie, since the characters just becomes so lousy, especially the emotionless Selene, that you don't even care if the vampires win or not.<br/><br/>The movie is also plagued by bad planning. This is revealed in the Special Features. Apparently, the director and producer got this bonehead idea to make the werewolves look more and feel more like CATS. Do they even know what a werewolf is? What's worse, is that the director spent more money on the really cheap-looking werewolf suits then on the special effects. Maybe the director didn't get the idea that CGI gets more attention from the audience, so don't make so many horrible costumes and put some dough into the special effects so the werewolves feel realistic.<br/><br/>The vampires aren't any better. Kraven, their leader, seems to have more of a temper than brains. The whole time, it appears that he lets Selene do all the planning, research, and grunt work, while he kicks back and drinks blood from a juice box. The vampires look and feel more like aristocrats than werewolf hunters. The movie tries to explain this off, by making Selene say that most of their ""deathdealers"" (hunters, basically) have died, and Kraven doesn't worry at all about the fact that a legion of werewolves are out there and he has only one Deathdealer, and numerous soldiers who are so dumb that most of their deaths are from sneak attacks from werewolves.<br/><br/>A movie about a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves sounds like a very good movie that deserves to be at the top list of best planned movie, but the director can't pull it off and spent more time, probably, ordering Krispy Kremes for the studio than on the quality of script, the actors, and special effects. Ugh! I think my lunch almost came out from remembering this trash. Don't go buy it (HURK!), don't rent it (HURK!!), get the second one. (BLAAAGH!!!)"

Unable to figure out why leader Kravin, (Shane Brolly) doesn't follow up on the confrontation, she rescues him from a further attack by werewolf leader Lucian, (Michael Sheen) and tries to understand his importance.

The fact that it mixes so many different areas and ideas into it that it appears to be pretty clever. To be plunked down in the middle of a centuries long war between the two sides is nicely played out, and the few encounters between the sides are pretty much the main reason to see this. From the opening shootout that really goes where it doesn't expect it to go all the way to a slaughter among a train and the drag-down conclusion, there's a lot of action scenes in here. The assault at the apartment is really interesting, with some really innovative ideas and a really fun appeal. One of the main fascinating sequences is the car chase. Starting on a really interesting notion and continuing on inside the car, it's a fun watch with some really interesting and drives off enough of the action film chase scene clich√©s to get some excitement at the end. The ending is really great about it, and that features some more great parts about the chase. The slaughter on the train is really fun to see, as the overall action and high gore make it a really great scene. That also helps it out when it shows it, as there is some pretty good gore scenes in here. From being impaled with razor-bladed throwing discs, gunshots, scratched open across the face, part of the face sliced off and a very brutal bite on the shoulder, this isn't a gore-fest but it didn't have to be and has just enough for it to be decent enough and appeal to ones who'll really enjoy it. The werewolf design isn't all that terrible either, with a large imposing body, long powerful limbs with vicious claws, and a smaller proportionate head than usual, but it still somehow works for the design. Nowhere near the upper echelon of designs, but it works and that's what matters. The fact that they're actually live and not CGI is a huge plus, as they look more real and have a bigger degree of realism than other types. The all-important transformation comes back into play here, and the fact that they are also done in real time makes it all the better. It's not that terrible, and can feature some good moments when it has to.<br/><br/>The Bad News: There are several problems with the film, with the biggest one being that it's just a long bore-fest at times. Apart from a couple of scenes, there's no real action here and consists of long conversation scenes that just wear on and on. This is mostly present in the middle of the movie, which has only one action scene to break things up, and after it's over, there's a long period of discussion going on. Considering that the two sides are supposedly at war with each other, why so much time is spent on talking is rather curious, and would've been far better had this been a really all-out war. That aspect of the story isn't all that well built-up either, and rather than showing the two sides really going at each other with an intense hatred, the confrontations aren't that heated until the end and the ones that happen in between are really lackluster when compared to how a war is supposed to be. The CGI is also a factor, since it always looks so obvious and most of the time can be very noticeable. It's mostly used for what should've been big action scenes, and it really detracts from what's going on. The over-glossy look to the film is one of it's biggest distraction, and it can be a detriment since, out of nowhere, there's this incredibly stylish shot that does nothing really for the film. Instead of being of importance to the film, it's just there because it can be done. There's really no value for them being there. One of the greatest damaging factors is that, since it plays like an action film, there's very little actual horror to it. With no scares or an aura of mystery surrounding everything, it really loses on the horror aspects. These elements really hurt the film.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: There's enough here to like, but there's also a lot to really get irritated about it. If you can get around the negative parts and accept that it's a long, drawn-out action film with monsters as the two sides, it should provide some entertainment value. It's worth a watch, but it's not as great as what's been said about it.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language"
"JamesHitchcock","3","0","3","4 December 2006"," This whole City-of-Dreadful-Night thing is becoming a clich√©
","""Underworld"" (and I am not making this up) is about a war between werewolves and vampires. Apparently, the two species have been at war for many centuries, but the vampires have been getting the better of it ever since about five hundred years ago they won a great victory and killed the werewolf leader Lucian. The result is that nowadays vampires live in elegant Gothic mansions whereas the werewolves (or Lycans- presumably a contraction of ""lycanthropes""- as they are referred to) have to lead an underground existence in the sewers.<br/><br/>That, at least, is the basic premise of the film. I had always thought that vampires killed their enemies by sucking their blood and that they could in turn only be killed by a stake though the heart, but in this film they (and their Lycan enemies) have obviously acquired the benefits of modern technology because both sides go into battle with all guns blazing. Apparently they have to use some rather specialised ammunition, but the net result is that the film's action sequences look more like something out of ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" than ""Dracula"". Although the Lycans retain the power to transform themselves into wolf-like monsters, the vampires have also ditched many of their other traditional attributes. They do not, for example, sleep in coffins during daylight hours (not that they need to, because it always seems to be night-time during this film), or waste much time trying to avoid crucifixes and garlic. They don't even seem to do much bloodsucking.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly (make that extremely) confusing. Indeed, at times it seems that the plot is only an excuse upon which to hang some highly extended battle sequences. At its heart, however, seems to be a sort of Romeo and Juliet tale about Selene, a beautiful vampire girl, and her love for Michael, a werewolf boy. Except that Michael isn't really a werewolf, but a human unwillingly converted to lycanthropy after being bitten. Except that he isn't really a normal human, but someone who (if he traces his family tree back enough) has for distant cousins the Lycans on one side and the vampires on the other. Which makes his blood very useful as part of some nefarious scheme the Lycans have cooked up. Or something like that.<br/><br/>Mixed in with this is a plot line seemingly borrowed from a Cold War spy thriller. Kraven, one of the vampire leaders, is secretly a double agent, in league with Lucian (who, it seems, faked his own death) in order to help him carry out the aforesaid nefarious scheme, so it falls to Selene, as a sort of vampirical James Bond, to try and thwart him. Or something like that.<br/><br/>The film is set in an unnamed city (actually shot in Budapest) and has the sort of moody, Gothic look- all darkness and rainswept, deserted city streets- which a generation ago would have been acclaimed as highly original. Ever since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" in 1982, however, this whole City-of-Dreadful-Night look has become a clich√©. Think, for example, of the various ""Batman"" films. (Interestingly enough, when Scott's brother Tony made an urban vampire story, ""The Hunger"", the year after ""Blade Runner"", he deliberately avoided this look in favour of something light and airy). In ""Underworld"" Len Wiseman takes the dark, moody look to extremes- the colour scheme is so dominated by blacks, greys and dark blues that it might as well have been made in monochrome.<br/><br/>The best thing that this film has going for it is the looks of Kate Beckinsale in her tight leather catsuit. Unfortunately, the film does not really show off Miss Beckinsale's acting talents in the same way as it shows off her figure. She made a great start to her film career as a delightful and unaffected Hero in Kenneth Branagh's wonderful version of ""Much Ado about Nothing"", but in recent years she has made some rather odd career choices (that stuffed turkey ""Pearl Harbour"" being another). None of the other actors make their characters come to life; indeed, this is the sort of film where characterisation comes well down the list of the filmmakers' priorities (noisy and violent action being at the top). I note that there are a number of threads on the IMDb message board asking whether viewers side with the vampires or the Lycans. Who cares? As Henry Kissinger is alleged to have said of the Iran-Iraq war: it's a pity they can't both lose. 3/10"

","Underworld tells the tale of a race of Werewolves known as the Lychans & a race of Vampires know as, well Vampires & the war that has raged between the two for centuries. The Vampire race has vowed to track down every Werewolf & wipe them out, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is what's know as a deathdealer, one such Vampire who goes around killing Werewolves, it's a living I suppose. However she is suspicious that something big is going down in the Werewolf world, they seem to be after a human named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) who happens to have special blood because of someone who he is a descendant of, or something like that. The Werewolf leader Lucien (Michael Sheen) wants Michael's blood to genetically create a Vampire Werewolf cross which will be stronger than either a Vampire or Werewolf for reasons I can't be bothered to go into. It's up to the PVC clad Selene to save the day...<br/><br/>This American, German, English & Hungarian co-production was directed by Len Wiseman & I thought it was a decent film although I got the impression that I'd seen it all before & it never quite got me going. I should say at this point that there appears to be two versions of Underworld in distribution, the original theatrical cut & a director's cut & to be honest I don't know which one I saw but it felt way too long either way. The script by Danny McBride is far too drawn out & takes all sorts of ideas & themes from other (much better) films like Blade (1998) & The Matrix (1999) in particular. One big problem I have with Underworld is it's length, at just over 2 hours for the theatrical version & significantly over 2 hours for the director's cut I found myself drifting away & losing interest at various stages as I don't think there's enough going on to sustain one's interest for a couple of hours plus. The basic story is thin to say the least as it mixes the usual traditional Vampire/Werewolf film-lore together with ultra modern up-to-date elements like genetics, hi-tech weaponry & fast cars. It's a fairly good mix to be honest & the film is a good watch but just too long. The plot tries to throw in a couple of twists & turns but I found it all pretty straight forward & a tad predictable. The character's are OK but nothing special & I found the constant comic book type dialogue annoying & repetitive after a while, overall I'd say Underworld is a good film for sure but nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>Director Wiseman does a neat job on Underworld although one felt he was more interested on the visual side of it rather than the storyline, he bleaches almost all the colour out of the picture & there were a few moments where it looked liked he shot it in black and white. There's plenty of The Matrix style fights with people performing impossible leaps, lots of people firing cool looking guns in slow-motion & the like, to be honest none of the action scenes are particularly memorable & I found scenes of people firing guns at each other in slow-motion started to become dull well before the end. The film looks great being set within a cool comic book style industrial, Gothic, dark rain soaked world where everyone dresses in fetishistic rubber, PVC, leather & lace. The violence & gore was disappointing, apart from someone having their head sliced in half & some blood splatter there is actually very little of the red stuff present.<br/><br/>With a modest sounding $22,000,000 budget Underworld looks more expensive than that, it's a stylish & well made film for sure but again it's nothing we haven't seen before. The special effects are pretty good, both physical & CGI. A special mention for Mrs Beckinsale who looks really hot in her PVC outfit, to be honest I reckon she's worth the price of admission on her own as she kicks & shoots her way through the film, hey I'm easily pleased...<br/><br/>Underworld is a good film & one well worth watching if only for Beckinsale in PVC, however I felt it was too long, when you pick the bones from it there's not really much to it & it should have been more violent. Followed by the even better & totally brilliant Underworld: Evolution (2006) which I much prefer to this & the IMDb lists Untitled Underworld Prequel (2009) which I presume hasn't even started shooting yet."

","This was one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. The plot confused just about everyone i know and the actual story had potential but never fulfilled it. It was however quite funny in parts, for instance the dramatic music playing under such quotes as: ""Craven!"" ""What?"" ""Get me some coffee!"" ""Ok"" and when they descend to the library (for no reason) and start reading (for no reason), all accompanied by dramatic undertones. Basically the story failed to grip me and the acting was, in parts, horrendous. If you want to see Kate Beckinsale because she's attractive, then fine, but she actually looks better in Serendipity, which is also a much better film. Definitely put this film on your ""Don't Watch"" list."

","I did not see this movie on its first release, but have just viewed it now. I found it an odd mix of semi-high tech and old legends. It was an interesting take on the vampire/werewolf tales, though. Beckinsdale was gorgeous and the use of light and shadow made it visually pleasing. It is a near absence of color. The rest of the cast could use some more acting lessons. Although mostly unknown to me, the mostly British cast seemed to give wooden performances at best. In my opinion, the gore factor is low, but youngsters still will need parental guidance to watch the film. As horror films go, this one is more on the eerie side. The two legends mesh well, though, on the whole."

Beckinsale plays a vampire who appears also to be wearing Carrie Ann_Moss's outfit from the Matrix as well.<br/><br/>This is a film about vampires fighting for their place on earth and is connected to the mythology of the vampire line and their battle with the Lycans. All of this is explained in the movie, so I won't do so here.<br/><br/>It isn't bad, but it really isn't great. There are a couple of good action scenes at each end of the film and the whole film seems to exist in the rain in some unknown eastern European town at an unspecified time.<br/><br/>However this is thrown by the appearance of a 2003 maserati at one point! I couldn't help but thinking that Blade is just a better version of the genre, better action, better script, better effects.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of the fans appreciate Beckinsale walking around in a nice catsuit, but to be honest she looks very small with large boots, and a posh English accent.<br/><br/>If you really love your vampire films, this is a nice twist. If you just prefer decent films, watch ""Blade"" and have done with it.<br/><br/>ps Michael Sheen steals the show in this!"
"mizbara","7","0","2","14 August 2006"," A victim of over-editing
","It took me a long time to see this movie, and when I did, I enjoyed it. However, much of the plot was lost in the action sequences. However, unlike many others of its genre, I felt the action scenes were not overly done. I loved the costumes, and thought they fit the dark, surreal atmosphere well. The sets were fantastic with the dark and gloominess needed for the vampire/werewolf storyline. The filming worked really well, almost keeping a feeling unreality about every shot.<br/><br/>But I have to admit there were a lot of things I didn't quite understand or wanted more of. While the sequel answered many of those questions, I still felt something was missing. It was. I bought the unrated director's cut...and it is *WAY* better than the original. The missing scenes do a lot to fill in holes, especially Erika's motives. It's sad though that we had to wait for a 2-disc edition to fill those holes. But ""Underworld,"" like many other films, looks like it fell victim to over-editing, losing many valuable plot points and character motivations along the way.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the director's cut or if you haven't seen ""Underworld"" at all, I would recommend just skipping the original version, and going right to the director's cut. It'll make a lot more sense."
"filmfan92","5","0","2","11 August 2006"," Underworld Falls Short
","Vampire and werewolf films have been successful lately, so it was only inevitable that eventually they would go mano-a-mano in a ""Blade""-esque action/horror hybrid. Lo and behold, this film features a sexy and leather-clad Kate Beckinsale as a fanged fighter who sparks a war between the werewolves (led by the snarling Michael Sheen) and the vampires (presided over by Bill Nighy, chewing the scenery as usual). For a movie that draws so heavily from the ""Blade"" series, Underworld is fairly low on action, and high on talk, which would be fine if the characters didn't talk in ""Matrix""-like sci-philoso-babble. When, after an exruciatingly long buildup, push finally does come to shove, the action is served up music video style-fast, flashy, and utterly confusing. Though director Len Wiseman's insistence on using practical effects is commendable, the makeup jobs look ridiculous, especially those of the werewolves, who look about as advanced as 80's Yoda. This film's main saving grace is the actors. Beckinsale delivers flat dialogue (""We take the bullets out until they talk....and then.....we put them back in."") with badass appeal that transcends her tender looks. Only Shane Brolly turns in a disappointing performance, unable to settle for an American, Russian, or Irish accent, and delivering all three with equal boredom. The set design is also glorious, a convincing fusion of old and new. Underworld has potential. It fullfills some of it, but could have been so much more. I liked this one just enough to anticipate the sequel."

","This movie exemplifies the typical Hollywood ""noisemaker"", a film that emphasizes excessive noise and violence over a compelling story or interesting characters. The dark, almost monochromatic look that the film has makes it difficult to tell the two warring factions apart-- they're both draped in dark outfits and it's hard to remember who's who. It doesn't help either that none of the characters are particularly engaging-- by the end of the movie I just didn't care who ""won.""<br/><br/>My wife and I found the dialog so pretentious, and the action sequences so completely overblown and unbelievable, that we couldn't resist the temptation to point out all of the glaring faults in the film and insert our own commentary, to make the movie more entertaining. Amazing how Mrs. Beckinsale can run through subways blasting away with two pistols and nowhere is there a policeman to be found, or vampires can swoop down from the sky on crowded city streets without creating an utter panic or reaction from the ""upperworld"". <br/><br/>Not even Kate Beckinsale in a skin-tight rubber suit can save this movie from being a completely forgettable waste of time."

","If a bad film were a misbehaving pet that had just piddled on that expensive hardwood floor you just waxed to spotless perfection, the ensuing yell of disapproval would have to be: ""Bad! Bad movie!"" This is pretty much the feeling I had in watching UNDERWORLD, a movie who was there because it existed in a list of films, positioned next to be shipped to my humble abode in Jersey City, and one whom I was loathe to watch.<br/><br/>There is a fine line between a bad movie that is a hoot to watch and a bad movie that accelerates bowel movement and/or brings forth severe mental decay. I wondered if it would be better to have tapeworm cysts swelling inside my brain and giving me convulsions and glimmers of beautiful, prismatic light like Saul on his way to Damascus. At least that pain and horror would have a happy ending -- my death, or my health restored at the hands of medics -- but this was unbearable.<br/><br/>However, before watching this wreck, I thought, ""Anne Rice: eat your heart out!"" Then I quickly thought (and thus corrected myself), ""Oh. Right. She's found Christ now -- she doesn't engage in such evil, dehumanizing stories of the 'underworld' but tells happy tales of Christ as he was in life and wants us to embrace them. Now, if she'd only renege on the royalty checks she cashes in due to her globally famous Lestat stories I'd believe her total denial and repentance of such demoralizing wickedness...."" Had I not run into such hasty conclusions! Even when the movie is rife in metallic colors which apply themselves quite well in conveying Gothic gloom, the movie is so chaotic I can't begin to even compare it with Rice's potboilers about vampires. At least she took the time to make me root for her characters even though the stories themselves were ridiculous. What this is, is a convoluted, uninteresting mess that happens to go on for two eternal hours.<br/><br/>So let's see. There's a lot of stuff happening during the start of UNDERWORLD, a shoot-'em-out sequence closer to a John Woo movie than horror, vampires at war with werewolves (for what purpose? Is this a thinly disguised story of racial intolerance?), a human caught in the middle who is really more of a non-entity, a love story, cartoonish special effects, equally cartoonish action, flat dialog, heavy metal music, not a shred of character build-up, the presence of a black bodybuilder (whose already artificially low voice makes Hulk Hogan's sound like a squeak) who is prone to flexing his chest muscles instead of his acting muscles, Kate Beckinsale (reason enough not to go see a film in which she appears), some mumbo-jumbo about the origins of such animosity between vamps and werewolves... basically, enough to make you mentally sign a check releasing any responsibility in caring for the plot, popping the DVD out of your recorder, call a priest, and hope for a clean exorcism on your entertainment center. Which, minus calling a priest -- against my convictions -- is exactly what I did because I couldn't take it anymore and I'll enjoy bad movies anytime providing they give me some reason to watch and enjoy them, like FROGS, for example. But not this one -- this demanded action instead of sitting there and sitting there and sitting there. Once action was taken, my mind was restored to its former, unpolluted serenity. Until the next bad, unwatchable movie, that is."

","Noticing that the inevitable sequel to Underworld was about to be sprung upon us, I went looking for a review of it.

The critics have not been allowed a bite of the cherry before its Friday release date on 20th January.<br/><br/>This is never a good sign in my experience! It usually signifies the distributing studio is hiding the film away to the last moment thereby reducing damage to the box office figures before word of mouth spreads.<br/><br/>The first film had nothing remotely original to offer either, its story concocted to ensure every entertaining modern day piece of action was cannibalised for inclusion. Tight latex suits, twin handed gun-play, ""bullet-time"" style martial arts fights and fancy weapons (Matrix,Blade and John Woo movies to mention just a few). When I looked it up and found a rating over 6 on IMDb, I felt I had to tell it as it is! It has some okay moments and good production values, but the story is hogwash and the world they live in appears to be solely populated by vampires and werewolves!

Half of the movie took place in tunnels with two sets of people in black shooting vast amounts of various coloured bullets at each other. After a while I didn't care who was shooting at whom or why, After another while it just became boring; it was like watching someone else play a shoot 'em up and realising they weren't going to let you have a go until he'd finished every level. Like a game, every now and then there is a cut scene in which characters reveal chunks of back-story to each other - then off we go again... Blam! Blam!

Everyone in this movie snarls their lines - Shane Brolly as Kraven is particularly awful - though later in the movie Michael Sheen (Lucian the head Werewolf) does get to do some non-snarly acting when he reveals yet more back story about how the war really started and, for a (very brief) moment, we see what a really great movie this might have been. With a bit of compassion and wit and the actors allowed to act and not just leap about posing for the covers of old Marvel comic this could have really been a stand-out film. As it is it looks like a compendium of all the flashy bits of Farscape, The Matrix, various Alien movies, Blade... etc etc.<br/><br/>Wherever they shot it looks great. Though the relentless rain gets tedious after a while - curiously the second time Selene goes to the Interogation place to rescue Michael it isn't raining outside when she draws up in the car but it is raining INSIDE the building. This is either a very weird joke or a continuity error.<br/><br/>And I'm sorry to say though Kate Beckinsale is interesting as the ice-cold vampire killer she just wasn't sexy enough even with all the rubber and leather and the corsets.

For much of the film the movie wants us to see the vampires as the good guys and the werewolves as the bad ones, than vice versa and finally there is no idea of who is what and why and why not.<br/><br/>On a certain level the movie almost works, if just because it tries so hard. Everything is done with full intensity, which unfortunately is the movie's biggest flaw, because there is no coherency at all. The opening shootout in the subway is so blatantly ripped off from the same scene in ""The Matrix"" (1999) that you start looking where the differences are. The fight scenes are done with so much help of wires and slow-motion that they might as well have saved the cost for post-wire removal and could just show the actual footage of the scenes, because the tricks are so obvious anyway. The werewolves never look that convincing, neither in the make-up nor as CGI and to give us only two actual transformations is pretty poor for a werewolf-movie, especially if it's the exact same transformation of the same character, just put in the beginning and the end of the movie so that maybe no one will notice.<br/><br/>The whole ""You-betrayed-them-betrayed-me-avenge-you-reign-now-be-immortal""-plot is so irritating that I gave up following it early on because the movie does not rely on it at all. All it does is slow the movie down, so that our heroine Selene can return to the vampire mansion and escape from it for about five times; so that the poor hero Michael can be captured, released, rescued, tied up and hunted over and over again without ever having a clue what is going on; so that the (admittably great) Bill Nighy can be a vampire lord and sit in a dark room holding monologues while we can witness the slowest awakening and regeneration ever captured on film. What does the blonde lady really want? What do the two leaders of each group actually want? We never get real answers, just more and more complications and an endless repetitions of names, until we are sick of hearing Viktor, Michael, Markus, Lucian and Kraven again and again like an indoctrination.<br/><br/>The locations throughout the movie consist of the vampire mansion, the werewolf underground and the small Eastern Europe city streets where the movie was shot, everything photographed in gray and black, with rain pouring down constantly. Except for the opening scene there are basically no humans visible in that big city, which makes sense with all the monsters shooting at each other, so much in fact that even daylight seems to have decided to stay at home. Above all this there is a score which consists of two elements: electro-noise and ripoff-Matrix-score. Sometimes I wondered if the sound was broken or something, until I realized that it was the ""music"".<br/><br/>All leads up to the most incoherent, chaotic and silliest showdown I have seen in a while. For about 30 minutes we are captured in some underground location (which isn't that fascinating in the first place) and witness an endless variation of 3 scenes that are edited together without any sense of logic, orientation or suspense: people running stairs up or down; people hiding behind walls watching other people running by; people shooting at each other and getting shot. I do not believe that anyone in this basement has any clue where he (there is only one she) is going and what he is doing when he gets there. So they run and they shoot and they run by and they hide and up and down and so on. There are some hand to hand fights which, curiously enough, often end with a werewolf head coming very close to the camera, without ever showing a werewolf actually bite of a vampire's head, which seems to be what they are doing.<br/><br/>The climax is so weak in its resolution that you actually wait for more to happen, because it's hard to believe that this is it. The whole movie is building up for something happening to Michael and when it finally does, you somehow expect more than a black Hulk.<br/><br/>I am not looking forward to the sequel of this, except when it manages to answer some of the questions that continued to occur to me while watching this jumbled mess. - When exactly do werewolves die? Some seem to fall dead even by the hint of a bullet and some don't seem to be able to die no matter how much silver they have pumping in their veins. - How easy is it to hide a really big sword in your clothes and pull it out whenever necessary? - Why aren't the only two African-American actors allowed to speak normally? The black vampire sounds as if he has problems with those long teeth in his mouth, while the black werewolf seems to have a really sore throat. - Who puts up the marble statues that are used for shooting practice at the vampire mansion? - Why does glass burst under 10 feet of water, when the last time I saw something similar in a movie it was in ""The Abyss"" where they had to go significantly deeper to have glass burst like that? - Isn't a big, long, wide cape pretty annoying when you never fly but just run and jump around a lot? - Does vampire and werewolf blood function like a normal color wheel, where you just get black when you mix it all together?"

","Underworld was bad. Terrible. Even if you ignore the clich√©d dialogue, it was atrocious. The whole thing smacked of looking good on paper, but not translating to the screen. See: The werewolves doing their retarded wallrunning. I'm sure that seemed a good idea in someone's head, but it just looked silly. See: Selene escaping by shooting a hole in the floor. I'm sure that seemed cool when they stole it from Trigun, but when you think about it, you realize she could have gotten away much easier, faster and using fewer bullets just by SHOOTING the gorram werewolves. See: Big Blue Goku Immortal. Sounds nifty, but he just looked retarded. See: THe fact that Big Blue Goku Immortal, despite being supposedly the biggest badass around, goes down almost immediately, and common vampire Selene has to pick up the slack.<br/><br/>Then there was the script. Oh, the script. Every single movie clich√© in existence was used, from ""Time to Die"" to ""Leave us!""(Three times, I should point out!). In fact, I think this film's defining moment is when KravenSays ""Leave us!"", has everyone leave the room, slaps Selene and then walks out. What the heck was that? Nothing else about the movie encapsulated just how silly it was. It's either that or when they used the ridiculous bit with Victor's head sliding off. THank you for reviving yet ANOTHER horrible clich√©. That's JUST what the industry needs.<br/><br/>The action was mediocre at best, and since that's pretty much all this movie's got going for it, the whole thing was a cinematographic train wreck.<br/><br/>I'm giving it three stars. Really, it would get one or two, but it doesn't do anything to actively offend my senses the way, say, Space Mutiny or The Hulk does. It simply fails wholeheartedly to be good at all."

","Set in some timeless world where vampires rule, clans of werewolves are being hunted and killed to the brink of extinction by the vampires. A wolf hunter, Selene, begins questioning is she's taken the right side, and slowly uncovers the truth behind how she became a vampire. Now since I like to consider myself a fair critic, I'll start with what I liked about ""Underworld"". For one, the overall premise is very good. I especially like the fact that we never know when or where the film actually takes place (we never see outside the city) and the timeless feel of the film. While the acting wasn't exactly outstanding, everyone was serviceable and there wasn't a single actor here I could call ""bad"".<br/><br/>Thirdly, the creature effects were awesome. Thankfully the werewolf were usually brought to life via practical effects, with CG limited mostly to the transformation scenes (I wish these too were done practically, like in American Werewolf in London or The Howling, but I guess in a year like 2003, that's too much to ask for¬Öthat's pretty sad¬Ö). There was also a good amount of blood and gore too, thankfully this is an R-rated film that actually DESERVES it's R-rating. I also liked the ending, which in my opinion was clever and unexpected (well, as clever and unexpected as a dumb action film can be). This, unfortunately, is where the list of positive aspects ends. Len Wiseman's direction is wwwaaayyy too commercial for my taste (you know, MTV-style camera angles, slow-motion fight scenes, etc.), the music is crap (mostly rock music¬ówhat's wrong with using a REAL score these days?), the action is often unrealistic (and not in a fun way) and the CG, while not used excessively, was cheesy and unconvincing. I know that the positive aspects will outweigh the negatives in some people's opinion (in other words, I can understand why some people will enjoy this film), but for me the movie really didn't do anything.<br/><br/>Sorry.<br/><br/>4/10."

With all the flash-backs, flash-forwards and I think even a few flash-sideways, the plot boiled down to a regurgitated story about the battle between Vampires and Werewolves. The leading man would have been better off as a mute as he proves that just because you look like a rock-singer, it doesn't mean you should act. All in all, the movie reminded me of a Mariah Carey video, fun to watch but only as long as you have the TV on mute. But as bad as the movie was, I'd still let Kate Beckinsale bite me any day."

I have to say, it will never be Oscar material but if you want a wild ride and non-stop action, this is your movie. Kate Beckinsale delivers a stunning performance as Selene, a beautiful but deadly vampire who inevitably falls in love with the handsome mortal-turning werewolf. She brings a individualistic style to the movie that portrays our leading lady can kick ass like any other guy. And her stunts are all her own. That was very good to see that she gained some recognition for doing her own stunts. Most actors wouldn't want to. With awesome visuals that blow a lot of vampire movies out of the water, acting with a wide variety of actors (I.E. Scott Speedman, Bill Nighy) it was good they all had something to go for. Each character was delivered and brought their own emotional conduct to the movie's set. I thought that was very cool.<br/><br/>Over all I give it a *** out of ****"

","When I went to the movie theater to go see Underworld, I was expecting it to be a major bomb. But actually, it wasn't. It was actually pretty intriguing and it held my attention during the whole movie. At parts it was a little bit confusing, and I had to ponder something. And also the acting was not really that great. Kate Beckinsale was good ... but that pretty much is about it. But the film was important to me because it's been a couple of months since I saw a movie at the movie theater that was kind of different from the rest. I wouldn't say Underworld is really a horror film at all, but I kind of action film with a little bit of Shakespearian drama going on during it too. It is pretty much a Romeo and Juliet story with a lot of gore and supernatural events. The story is about the never-ending feud between the family of Vampires and the family of Likens - or Werewolves (remind you of something? ... The Montagues and The Capulets.) A liken assassin or as she calls herself a 'death dealer' Selene (Beckinsale) falls in love with a human who has been bit by a liken, Michael (Scott Speedman - Dark Blue). By falling in love they both try to end the long-time feud and try to figure out how far it goes back and why it happened.

","The writing team of a stuntman, a gargantuan actor and a prop assistant probably doesn't seem like a group who could lovingly craft a Gothic mini-masterpiece about vampire and werewolves, and actually get it made. But they did.<br/><br/>That team was Danny McBride, Kevin Grevioux and director Len Wiseman. They pitched the story as ""Romeo and Juliet, for vampires and werewolves"", which is interesting as the romance angle of the story is barely even existence except for a few moments here and there. What it really is would be more like ""the Matrix with vampire and werewolves"", although they're probably sick of hearing that by now. But to be honest, they don't even try to hide the similarities. It opens with a shoot-out in a subway station, almost identical in visual style to the Matrix, and for no apparent reason it even has those weird electronic sound effects. Is this movie set inside a virtual reality as well? But by copying the Matrix, it does make itself an undeniably cool action movie. Probably the best thing about it is the design of the creatures and the locations it's shot at. The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brilliant. The vampires are portrayed as a decadent, sensual race living in the lap of luxury, while the Lycans are brutal, animalistic and live in squalor -- and you don't see a single female werewolf.<br/><br/>The script certainly has it's short-comings but on the whole is fairly well-structured and intricate, with the politics and mythology of the universe coming through loud and clear (even if it is a rip-off of White Wolf's role playing games). It's all very well executed, and you can tell they had a lot of fun making it. Kate Beckinsale does give a great performance, constantly conveying emotion with the slightest of facial expressions. Michael Sheen is also notable as the lycanthropic leader, and Scott Speedman and Bill Nighy both fill their roles competently.<br/><br/>""Underworld"" wisely markets itself as an action movie rather than a horror movie. It's fun, entertaining and cool, but not a whole lot more than that. If you're in the mood for an ass-kicking, leather-clad bullet-fest, this may be the one for you."

The film's big selling point is lead vampire Kate Beckinsale (PEARL HARBOR), clad in form-fitting leather trenchcoat (no slobbering at the back there!), who holds her own against an army of monstrous adversaries. Most of the supporting characters are played in broad strokes by an otherwise talented cast, including Michael Sheen (BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS) as the werewolf leader who struggles to contain the aggressive tendencies of his bloodthirsty minions, Sophia Myles (Lady Penelope in 2004's THUNDERBIRDS) as the ambitious young beauty who struggles to emerge from Beckinsale's shadow, and sexy Shane Brolly (DEADLY SWARM) as a misguided vampire who forms a clandestine alliance with the werewolves, leading to all manner of complications. However, industry veteran Bill Nighy steals the show as a vampire-lord woken from his centuries-long slumber by Beckinsale, precipitating a violent escalation in the conflict.<br/><br/>The soap opera plot gets lost amid a string of ostentatious set-pieces, most of which involve vampires and werewolves pursuing each other through a Euro-Gothic landscape (Bruton Jones' superlative set designs are the film's trump card) and firing endless rounds of ammunition at one another, a scenario repeated (with minor variations) throughout the course of the film. It isn't frightening, or even remotely profound, merely noisy and excessive, which is par for the course these days. Production values are top-notch throughout, though the full-body werewolf suits (designed by GODZILLA's Patrick Tatopoulos) are a little too rubbery-looking, and the transformations from human to lycanthrope - though impressive - are clearly computer-generated, which rather spoils the effect. A sequel is currently in the works.<br/><br/>NB. Though credited as 'Digitalscope' in the closing titles, the movie was actually photographed in 3-perf Super 35 and subsequently transferred to high-definition video, where it was completed in the digital domain before being reprinted to 35mm for theatrical release. Sadly, Wiseman and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts don't make much use of the 2.39:1 frame, so the technology is largely wasted."

Even Bill Nighy, who has done some good things, is a bland choice for the middle-aged King of the Vamps, he looks like Mr. Greenjeans in Halloween makeup, and proves a pale shadow of the character who probably inspired his casting, Corin Redgrave in the brilliant British vampire miniseries Ultraviolet.

Please let the movie play by itself, don't take viewers out of the world you created by slowing everything down. Another grievance I had with his movie was that the characters aren't built up enough.

Unfortunately, even visually the cast was not up to the task. Kate Beckinsale was reasonably easy on the eyes, but Scott Speedman really wasn't cutting it as a lead role in a movie which should have been largely about eye-candy (cf. Stuart Townsend), and the supporting cast could not really be relied on for support in this area.<br/><br/>The visuals, however, could have been overcome, if we didn't have to pause between slow-moving scenes to recap--in painful detail--the plot (presumably for those members of the audience who had ducked out to see if anything better could be found in another theater). I found the big yellow signs captioned ""warning: plot twist ahead"", which appeared at intervals during the stilted dialog, to be distracting to the overall flow of the movie.<br/><br/>In a movie of this quality, it is always possible to regain some entertainment value in the category of ""Worse than we could have ever hoped."" I was able, for example, while watching ""Queen of the Damned"", to overlook its worst features by laughing at the recycled effects from other movies (My favorite being the left-over rose petals from ""American Beauty""). In this movie, however, the awkward pauses, and even more awkward plot expositions were simply not funny, and though I tried to laugh, only a slightly embarrassed chuckle would come out.<br/><br/>Overall, I am sorry that I was not a quite a bit more drunk when I watched this film.

At first I enjoyed ""Underworld"" for its very pretty visuals and action sequences - even though some of those were also outright stolen from other movies (i.e. Cyborg). Even some plot elements were okay; the idea of a human caught in a war between vampires and werewolves is not original, but can be a rich starting point for an idea. Sadly, the writers and the director ran in a zillion different directions, never following one plot thread to completion. Vampire clans filled with lame political ""intrigue"", species wars, romance...you're given a taste of these things, but never enough of one thing to satisfy, until all of the characters seem like caricatures and as hazy as the ""rules"" of this imagined world are, you *know* just how this movie's going to end about 15 minutes into it. There were very few surprises. I enjoyed the actors who played Viktor and Lucien, even if they were hammy, but everyone else was plain awful.  Scott Speedman played an important plot device, but he barely emoted at all. How could he? It seemed like he had no lines, not even a half-hearted backstory to give his character any kind of depth. There was ZERO chemistry between him and Kate Bekinsdale, who just pouted and frowned her way through this garbage.<br/><br/>
Even the visuals get dull after awhile - I'd be laconic too, if I lived in a world entirely colored black and blue. <br/><br/>If you want vampires and action, rent Blade II instead - much of the same themes are discussed there, but by better actors and a better director."

The only remotely credible actor is Kate Beckinsale, and she's surrounded by utter crap. The actor who plays Viktor is one of the worst in history. The story has enough plot holes to drive a mack truck through. One of the worst things about this picture - and THE most disturbing - is that it was #1 at the box office, and I am ashamed to say that I contributed to that. No longer do I give my money to movies like this, and AVP and Resident Evil. They are examples of just what is wrong with movies today, and America as a whole."

","Comparing a werewolf/vampire hybrid movie to the matrix and x-men?<br/><br/>Interesting. stupid, but interesting.<br/><br/>for a start. there was a movie which did that 'bullet time' thing way before The Matrix was released (i forget which but I'm sure i own it) and wasn't underworld released before x-men 2? if not there would only have been at most a few months between them both, which is certainly not enough time to re-write the character design, re-create it and get it out in the cinema so people can say 'oh look he looks like that one out of x-men 2'.<br/><br/>Jesus.<br/><br/>I have to say this film is class and takes both genre's of films to a new level.

","This movie is all dressed up with no place to go, with sexy vampires  and rugged-looking werewolves, but no soul at all.<br/><br/>The main point of the story, as I understand it, is that Vampire Selene falls in love with Werewolf Michael; she is so much in love with him, in fact, that she turns on her own kind in favor of him. I've watched this movie about 5 times now (I have the DVD; just the regular one, not the ""extended"" one), and I still don't get the feeling that their connection is really that strong. So he saves her from a car wreck; so what? Vampires, especially ""Death-Dealers"" like Selene, have been brought up to despise werewolves and disdain humans.<br/><br/>The werewolves and their lives also bother me; why is this pack (apparently) 100% male? Why don't we see any females in their group? Are all werewolves made, not born? It's one of those nagging inconsistencies that really irritates me.<br/><br/>The movie has great production values, good tunes and nifty special effects, especially the werewolf transformations. The regular DVD has more than enough special features to satisfy most movie buffs, and the extended version is chock-full of even more goodies. Alas, this slickly produced action/romance/horror flick ultimately rings hollow. My rating: 6/10."

","I watched this movie a while ago, and I must say that I was quite disappointed. The concept was interesting, and some of the action was pretty neat- and Kate Beckinsdale is so beautiful it hurts- but the rest was really rather bad. <br/><br/>The transformation from human to werewolf was god-awful- transformations from humans to other species (if that's even the proper word) were done much better in the 1982 version of The Thing. They were much more convincing, and although they look poor as compared to what is possible today, they're still far superior to the human-werewolf transition here.<br/><br/>The action was tolerable, and well-done in most places, but the plot seemed underdeveloped. The blue color that dominated the movie was frustrating- I know that they were attempting some type of ""gothic"" or ""underworld-ish"" feeling, but it didn't come across too well.<br/><br/>A valiant effort with more than a few good points, but a disappointment overall. 4/10."

","It's the oldest war of them all. No, not Democrats versus Republicans, or politicians versus the truth. It's vampires versus werewolves (or Lycans, if you prefer), Evil versus evil. Or good evil versus bad evil.<br/><br/>Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a beautiful vampire warrior who comes across a human named Michael (Scott Speedman), who's been marked by the werewolves. Why Michael? Are the Lycans planning to use him in their endless battle with the vampires? Will Michael fall for the lovely, the talented Selene? Will Selene get to kick some werewolf butt? Yes, like sand through the hourglass of time in a bottle, these are the burning questions that are thankfully answered within the first twenty minutes or so.<br/><br/>The film is very similar to The Crow in style (and in a nod to the earlier film, Speedman's character is named Michael Corvin; the lead character in The Crow: City of Angels was named Ashe Corven); it's dark, noirish dark, foreboding dark, bad-guy dark, you name it. See, there's dark, and then there's dark dark. This is the latter. Now, the original Crow movie was wildly stylish, and Underworld carries that torch a little bit further. Not only does style triumph over substance, it body slams it to death and then dances on its grave. In other words, don't look too closely at the plot, which doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny. But that's not likely, since the film's so dark (did I mention that).<br/><br/>As with most comic-book-atmosphere tales, this one is full of Pretty People. Even vampires and werewolves gotta look good, you know, what with the extra grooming and tooth filing and all. At any rate, there's nary an Ugly Person in sight. Even the despicable ones are Pretty People.<br/><br/>As Selene, Kate Beckinsale is very good, appropriately slinky and pliant. Beckinsale's not known for taking on tough roles such as this - you usually see her in upper-crust films such as Emma and Cold Comfort Farm. But she acquits herself very well, so much so that there's a sequel planned for 2005.<br/><br/>Her primary foil is Shane Brolly as Kraven, the leader of the vampires. Brolly snarls a lot, showing off what have to be more than the usual 32 teeth in the process. Brolly didn't have much in the way of facial expressions here, just you're basic ""I'm mad!"" and ""I'm madder!"" looks.<br/><br/>Underworld is agreeably well done, with a believable romance between Speedman and Beckinsale shunted to the background. This is about werewolves versus vampires, with men in the background, clueless as always, so the romance played out well on a subtle level."

","Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. would be turning over in their respective graves if they could get a gander at `Underworld,' a tale about a war between vampires and werewolves that turns this potentially interesting conflict into one long, unending shootout.<br/><br/>Gone are the days when Count Dracula and Barnabas Collins defined for us the image of a vampire.  No longer are these `creatures of the night' the suave, well-dressed aristocrats who inexorably ¬ñ often reluctantly ¬ñ seduced unsuspecting bystanders into baring their necks to fulfill the need for human blood.  The vampires in `Underworld' can't be bothered with such mundane and hokey paraphernalia as coffins, crosses, or cloves of garlic - not even with turning into bats at the first hint of trouble.  These modern day vampires talk on cell phones, drive fancy sports cars, use personal computers and fight with all the high tech weaponry modern technology and a limitless studio budget can provide.  With all this fun gadgetry to choose from, what's the point in being a vampire anymore?  The result of this is that `Underworld' plays more like an over-the-top gangster action film that just happens to feature supernatural elements than a horror film rooted in centuries' old traditions.   <br/><br/>The werewolves are even less interesting than the vampires in this film. Not only are both camps indistinguishable from one another in looks and appearance, but the werewolves actually come across as surprisingly ludicrous and unconvincing in the few scenes in which they undergo their lycanthropic transformations.   Special effects have become so impressive in recent years that even they have a hard time exciting an audience anymore. A case in point:  when oh when are action film directors going to jettison that most annoying of all action movie clich√©s ¬ñ gun battle scenes filmed in slow motion?  `Underworld' has them in spades and they quickly become tiresome and boring.  Even the typical urban gothic look of the film ¬ñ replete with rain-soaked city streets and a perpetual thunderstorm taking place in the background ¬ñ reminds us instantly of dozens of other, mostly superior outings like `The Crow,' `Darkman,' `Batman' etc.<br/><br/>`Underworld' should have stayed below the ground where it belongs."

","**SPOILER**<br/><br/> . . because, lets face it, this film would have looked completely different without The Matrix.  That's not necessarily a bad thing though.  Underworld looks fantastic, dark, moody and brooding, and the actual plots are imaginative and coherent.  Unfortunately, there are so many different explanations going on, that it is very easy to lose track of what's happening - I got hopelessly lost during several key plot exposition scenes and had to jump the disc back to try and figure out what was going on. Although I did really enjoy this film, it was also disappointing because it could have been sooo much better.  Kate Beckinsale looks great in patent leather and motorcycle boots, but her attempt at dispassionate vampire killer just made her look as if she was going through the motions.  And don't even ask about the male love interest.  The only halfway decent performance came from Lucien, the leader of the Lycans.  And what was the deal he made with Craven anyway?  They didn't even attempt to tidy that one away.  <br/><br/>To summarise then, don't expect too much, and listen carefully to the atrocious accents and you should pick up enough about what's going on to enjoy the film."

","Underworld has a great premise with the conflict of Vampire and Werewolves fighting over domination but while it's a good premise, it needs a story to support it, and if you don't have a good story then you don't really have anything. The movie is more style than substance, and while style is good, it can also ruin a movie if you don't have anything to back it up. Kate Beckinsale and company do their best with what is giving but even their best efforts can't hide the fact that the story feels like it was written on the fly, and rush into production with out a good rewrite to help punch up the script. On top of that, the special effects are of not top quality, and you can see that in the way the Werewolves look and move. You really don't them at all, and when you do, it's very brief and mostly in the dark.<br/><br/>
With better special effects, and a real story that made sense, this could have been the ultimate Action/ Horror movie but because they decided to cheap out on both the story and effects, we have this travesty."

","I don't understand why so many people are knocking this movie.  This was a very unique story (aside from the minimal forbidden love aspect, this is uncharted territory) that was presented in a very vivid, captivating style. Sure the style was very similar to the Matrix, but that shouldn't be attacked.  Hitchcock's style of storytelling has been reproduced umpteen times and nobody is thought to be less of a storyteller when they use that. Underworld is NOT trying to be the Matrix.  It is a very different tale with different messages and characters.  Some people have said they dislike the fact that most of the characters take human form during the movie.  I say that's one of the best choices the director made.  This movie would become really cheesy really quickly if a group of fang faces chased a bunch of steroid dogs around.<br/><br/>The action in the movie was just really cool to watch.  The story was easy to follow without being sophomoric.  And the characters were really cool. Kate Beckinsale is just a treat to watch in this role.<br/><br/>

","I was a bit disappointed with the lack of action in the film and especially how they showed pretty much all the action in the trailer.  But nevertheless, this movie was enjoyable in a dark, vapiristic, gothic way. The vampires are really cool and the plot is not completely given away by the trailer so you can see the plot form while watching.  The sets, lighting, and costumes were great.  The movie has a pervasive ambience of darkness and some hostility.  There are also a few cliches in this movie but they are made up for with the grand darkness and atmosphere that changes all the cliches and makes them the movie's own.  Also the US rating says ""strong violence and gore"" which sounds pretty repulsive but notice it's rated 15 in the UK, it's more like just plain ""violence.""  I really dislike the MPAA.

The division of Vampires that we get to see is lead by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, & the primary warrior of his crew is Gally from the movie Battle Angel Alita. The Lycans are headed up by Rob Zombie. Rob Zombie is hunting after Scott Stapp, the lead singer of Christian Rock band Creed.

This leads her into the typical superhero storyline of proving herself right and also getting to do the I-told-you-so thing when it all goes to crap for her home team.<br/><br/>The rest is about as typical and you already can guess the ending.

","How can a film squander such a promising premise?<br/><br/>Vampires and werewolves must be two of the most enduring creatures of myth. Spanning many cultures and decades we have seen them explored, glorified and demonised. It took Underworld to make them boring.<br/><br/>The fault for that must lie squarely with the script. Somewhere underneath all the plot exposition and back-story speech-making there lurks an exciting movie. Rather than taking a new twist on any of the legends the script relies totally on the audience's knowledge of vampires at the expense of giving us real characters viewers could care about.<br/><br/>To compare the amount of exposition that takes place in Underworld, think of the brain-bending babble Neo cops in The Matrix: Reloaded. Its not often you just want to grab the remote and hit fast-forward in a film and when it does you know something must be seriously wrong, but I digress...<br/><br/>The only extraordinary ability Underworld's vampires appear have is to land happily on their feet after jumping off tall buildings. That's it. No other cool skills, senses or abilities. They may as well be a normal human for all the good it does them.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the werewolves fare no better. We only really get to know three, and are left to make up for ourselves what their existence is like. Do they struggle to be civilised to pass in society, only to relish the release of their inner beast selves? You won't know and probably won't care.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale as vampire warrior Selene tries hard but seems out of place and the leader of the local vampire coven Kravan (Brolly) has a good line in sneers and that's about it for his attempts at characterisation.<br/><br/>But the Tom Cruise award for worst bit of casting in a vampire film goes to Bill Nighy. Nighy plays Victor, the bad-ass boss vampire. When there is an argument in his crypt after being revived by Selene his first words of dialogue delivered off-camera are ""Who's making all that ruckus?"" Ruckus?!?! That's the kind of word my grandmother would use, not a lord of the undead. It made me laugh out-loud. The first time I actually SAW Nighy speak from underneath a lot of prosthetics I laughed again. His light English accent seemed totally out of place in the body of a looming vampire.<br/><br/>Visually Underworld is impressive, relying heavily on the washed-out blue look but you will be longing for the colour senses of your eyes to be stimulated by the time its all over.<br/><br/>However there are at least two dramatic visual short-cuts that I noticed, and I will bet there are more: CGI of a character transforming from man to werewolf is used twice, with the background changed to suit the different locations, and CGI of werewolves running along the sides of a corridor is also used at least twice, again with the background changed.<br/><br/>This for me sums up the whole Underworld experience. A whole slew of short cuts leaving the audience short-changed."

I finally rented it and was fairly disappointed.<br/><br/>The storyline sounds incredible.   Werewolves (called ""Lycans"" in the film to make them sound cooler) vs Vampires?  How much cooler can you get? Unfortunately, the coolness factor doesn't expand beyond the concept.  Yes, the film does feature Lycans battling Vampires.  Unfortunately, the only way you'd know this is by the occasional glimpse of teeth and shot of a full moon.  They fight the entire movie with guns.  I felt like I was watching a bad splice of The Matrix and Blade.  What is the purpose of showing these two historical enemies fighting if they're going to be running behind each other with Uzis?  <br/><br/>Almost no typical vamp/wolf lore was explored.  The ONLY thing the vampires do to show they're vampires if bare their fanged teeth and can jump from big heights.  They don't shy away from the sun, turn into bats, suck blood, or anything else which makes vampires cool.  The film even refers to them at one point as ""bats"" yet you never see it.  <br/><br/>Scott Speedman provides a forgettable performance for all of his 15-20 lines in the movie.  The ending is VERY anticlimactic and is just a very watered down gun fight that would have been too boring to make it's way into The Matrix. I had to watch this film over 4 days because I kept falling asleep. What's more, the lycans looked absolutely ridiculous when they changed.  The werewolves from ""The Howling"" 20 years ago had better make up. <br/><br/>
If you want to watch vampires, get ""Blade"" or watch the television version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

I had no expectations that were any positive about this film, and thats the best thing, otherwise i would probably have hated it.

And watching Selena - admiring her at her best (in tight leather) really doesn't make the film any worse, and very good acting from her too! What i missed from Underworld was perhaps because the narrow vision focusing only Selena-Michael-Viktor, and everyone else seemed obsolete...very sad indeed!

","Synopsis Spoiler! The story of Underworld revolves around a centuries old war between Vampires and Lycans (also known as Werewolves).  Before the war started, werewolves used to protect vampires while they slept during the day.  Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a beautiful young vampire warrior who is tracking down the last group of werewolves that must be killed to end the war.  Selene discovers that the werewolves are after a human being named Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman).  Selene saves Michael from the werewolves, but not before he is bitten by the head werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen). Now Michael will become a werewolf at the next full moon. <br/><br/>
     Selene feels that Kraven (Shane Brolly) is working against the clan, and she tries to prove it before the awakening of the head vampire.  Selene falls in love with Michael, which sets up a confrontation between the vampires and the werewolves.  Since this is a vampire movie, the whole movie is set at night with it raining most of the time.  The werewolf transformations and fight scenes were fantastic, especially at the end. They had two special types of bullets that were used to kill vampires and to kill werewolves.  Since they only killed each other and not humans, you can go to this movie and pick which side you want to win, and not be afraid. The special effects make this a winner.  From the ending, a second movie is on its way.  (Screen Gems, Run time 2:01, Rating R)  8/10"
"lwjoslin","Null","0","1","14 October 2003"," Underwhelmed
","Despite its vampire-'n'-werewolf content, ""Underworld"" isn't a horror movie, but an action/terror movie.  Almost nonstop gun battles between the hunters (vampires) and the hunted (werewolves), who are about to turn the tables with a bit of insider help.  For semi-coherent reasons, a young male human becomes a pawn in the war between bloodsuckers and shapeshifters.<br/><br/>As usual, almost nothing crosses over to the screen from actual folklore. Folkloric vampires are NOT destroyed or harmed by sunlight -- not literally much of an issue here, since almost the whole story takes place at night, though the werewolves have managed to get their paws on some ammo that fires an ultraviolet charge (""liquid sunlight"").  Folkloric lycanthropy is NOT contagious by the bite.  Folkloric vampires and werewolves are NOT social creatures who form ""covens"" or travel in packs.  And the very premise of an ethnic war between vampires and werewolves is inauthentic.  The two ""species"" are NOT anything like now-and-forever separate: in certain folklores, werewolves BECOME vampires after death, and vampires can transform into wolves.<br/><br/>All that having been said, what works? Good atmosphere: lots of darkness, rain, and subterranean locations.  Good art design, ranging from the sets and locations to the props, weapons, and costumes.  Good action and FX, and the pace generally keeps moving.  Good cast, though none of them seem to be enjoying themselves.<br/><br/>What doesn't work?  It's all very grim and solemn, and not very much fun. Kate Beckinsdale as Selene (basically Buffy the Werewolf Slayer) is admirably intense, focused, loyal, and fearless: like everybody else in the movie, she's formidable, but not likeable.  We have nobody to root for: there are so many double-crosses and betrayals -- and, during the gun battles, both sides, clad in black, look so much alike -- that it's hard to ward off confusion after awhile, not to mention apathy.<br/><br/>
A good dose of clever dark humor would have helped this movie a lot.  But ultimately, all the characters take themselves SO seriously that it's like being a captive audience at a Goth party.  This is how the Goths of my acquaintance view themselves -- sleek, sexy, and dangerous -- instead of as the chubby, pasty losers they are."

Most movies are judged within the first 10 mins. So the director thought: ""Well, I¬¥ll put some guys into those black latex suits, give them some cool sunglasses (although it looks unbelievably close to matrix - never mind, nobody will notice and btw. black is cool!) and let them shoot around in the tunnels of a subway station.

Did he intend to test our endurance, how much bad stuff we can take without leaving ... I don¬¥t know. Waving around the camera, wasting 10 mags of ammo within one minute doesn¬¥t make a shooting scene cool - just ridiculous. Now u could say: ""Hey they are vampires !

","As with (sadly) a lot of other movies this year, this looked so good and so promising, but the reality of it is a huge disappointment.  It seems that the film-makers were so obsessed with the style and appearance of the film that they completely forgot about basic things like interesting characters that you can empathise with.  Yes, Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous and sexy and has the ice-cold assassin schtick down to a T, but that's all there really is to her character - it's so one-dimensional that I couldn't connect with her at all.  The other big problem is that there is zero chemistry between the two leads, infact it all feels a little tacked on.  Add to that your usual charismaless forgettable euro-villains and I just stopped caring about the whole thing really.  OK, so the film's gothic look and style is great, but that's just not enough when you take all the other factors into consideration.  I give this film 3/10"
"Nigel St. Buggering","4","0","1","1 October 2003"," Where were the vampires?
","Vampires have come to a sad state of affairs lately. If ""Underworld"" is any indication, the only things separating vampires from humans is an ability to jump from great heights and land on their feet, and an inability to wear anything but black fetish gear.<br/><br/>Not that a lack of vampiric prowess is the film's only weakness. Far from it. If I must pinpoint a single problem that haunts this film to the exclusion of all others, it's a complete lack of original thought. Clearly, the film-makers are going for an anime vibe, and at that they succeed, right up to the final sword move. But why is every single money shot here so thoroughly reminiscent of other, much better, movies? There's the bad guy on the roof of the car stabbing blades through the roof from the ""Terminator"" films. There's the creatures crawling along the walls and ceilings from ""Aliens"". And far too many moments lifted from ""The Matrix"" to even bother counting. There's almost nothing here that won't remind you of something else.<br/><br/>The stylistic choices which are meant to be the film's greatest strength turn out to be a surprising weakness as well. Since the sun apparently never sets, we're given no information on how these so-called vampires operate. We're given only one brief look at normal humans, and absolutely no glimpse of how vampires and werewolves deal with them, or the normal world.<br/><br/>Which brings us back to the beings at the film's center. Namely, that there is nothing, absolutely nothing, special about them. They have no strengths, no weaknesses, and no defining characteristics. I'm not asking for slavish dedication to the legends, but if you're going to re-imagine them, then do so; show some imagination. Give us rules, give us attributes and flaws. These vampires do nothing that Chow Yun Fat hasn't done in your average John Woo gun-play film. There's barely even any reference to feeding on blood. What makes these people vampires? They rely on guns, cars, and cell phones as much as any human being. As far as I can tell, if it weren't for modern technology, the werewolves would clean their clocks. The film might just as easily have been about green berets who fight werewolves; there's no distinction.<br/><br/>Add to all this the fact that the most interesting characters are pushed into the background while the incredibly bland leads take on the spotlight for no readily apparent reason, and you have a mash that lands just this side of incompetent."
"roninmlb","4","0","1","29 September 2003"," Underworld: Underwhelming
","Great idea, bad execution. I was hoping for an epic war between the two of the most famous Hollywood monsters, with a strong dose of Matrix inspired style. What I got was an anemic, pretentious, ""action"" flick that hasn't a spark of originality or life.<br/><br/>The plot is pure action movie fodder, but provides us with only two weak action scenes; one at the beginning and one at the end; with a whole lot of boring material in between delivered by the least talented and least charismatic cast in recent memory. It fails to evoke any notions of an epic or ancient war. Worst of all is Underworld's vain pretentiousness. This is a silly vampire action movie and the filmmakers don't seem to know it, and they present it like it's freakin' high art.<br/><br/>At least the action scenes were cool, right? Right? Wrong! Dead wrong (pun intended)! I'm really sad to see the once cool akimbo pistol style (using two pistols at once) made popular by John Woo's Hong Kong masterpieces, then brought to America in Face/Off and the Matrix,  go all mainstream. It's so clich√© these days that you even see it used on crappy TV shows. If John Woo where dead, he'd be rolling over in his grave. And Underworld puts the last nail in the coffin on akimbo pistols, no intelligent action director could possibly be stupid enough to use them again, but rest assured, idiot, copycat, Hollywood scumbag directors like Michael Bay, have and will, and it does and will suck. Kate Bekinsale, while alluring as a vampire warrior, doesn't look too experienced or confident with the dual USP handguns she supposedly uses to dispatch so many lycan freaks.<br/><br/>Worst of all, are the boring, and all too familiar camera angles used in the action scenes, taken straight out of the 1947 book ""Proper Camera Angles for Television and Film Action Scenes"". We've seen them a million times before. Only people who know nothing about action movies and only watch American crap would think the action scenes in Underworld are cool. The only scene that worked for me was the final sword blow by our heroine, only to have it ruined by the oldest gag in the gore book, the delayed dismemberment shot. Not only is it a Japanese film and animation staple, but was also used in another Matrix wannabe called Equilibrium only last year.<br/><br/>
In closing, Underworld may fool the mainstream masses, but action buffs hoping for something original will be sorely disappointed."
"dariengrey","Null","0","1","27 September 2003"," Underwhelming - great idea, weak film
","The preview came on one day, while I was watching some show. Some show that was instantly rendered meaningless when I saw Kate.  And Vampires.  And Werewolves.  Fighting.  Killing.   And Kate. They finally made the greatest movie ever, I thought.  Even though the film was three weeks away at that time, I got my sleeping bag and cheese and crackers and went and camped out at my local Coronet theatre.  1,000 seats.  Nice and big. I was ready to be horrified and thrilled and titillated (in the just the right vampire way - you don't put Kate in the film if you're not gonna use that booty), but all I got was the horror.  And that was because of how weak -- yes, so very weak -- the film was. Kate spends most of her time driving a very nice car through 'Blue City', some crappy European town where it rains all the time and is blue.  Or grey.  Or blue and grey.  When she's not doing that, her favorite pastime is to pout and stomp through the Vampire Mansion, whining to Kraven (the head of the vampire coven, and a bigger whiner than Kate) about the drapes being the wrong color, and not giving him any play. The vampires, as a group, are petty, dull, boring and vacuous, while the werewolves are grim, grimy, well-muscled, and psychotic.  There isn't one likable character in the whole story, primarily because there wasn't any time spent on character development.  As such, it's like watching really pretty mannequins try to do a vampire movie.  The action scenes are sort of fun, but impersonal, like watching a circus with no audience, and no music.  Stuff happens, people die, the mannequins look cool, but there's no feeling attached to it. And good vampire movies have to have feeling.  If I wanted to spend my time seeing boring, cranky, old people, I could do it for free at the old folks' home. This movie is stylish, but dull and empty.  There aren't even any good laughs.  Good vampire films always have a joke or two thrown in there.  For balance.  Please don't waste your time and money, on this sad failure."

","I was terribly disappointed in this film.  The only redeeming quality was Kate B. in tight leather.  Did anyone notice how Kraven's face twitched every time he spoke? Did anyone believe that there was chemistry between Seline and Michael?  Or how about the multiple subplots?  Multiple family members dying (parents, daughter, nieces) leading to revenge, secrets, and lies; then there are the power hungry vampires; forbidden love (in every direction)-it just seems like they stretched this movie too far. They should have just stuck with one thing instead of trying to squeeze it all in.  Don't get me wrong, the first half hour was mildly enjoyable, but then it just went down hill. It is a shame it had such potential.  But basically, in the end, to me, it was a bad movie that I wouldn't spend $3 dollars to rent."
"MadMonkInBlack","4","0","1","27 September 2003"," Vampires, vampires everywhere, yet still the plot did shrink...
","The major problem with the movie, amazingly {and upsettingly} enough, was the vampires.  Bear in mind that I mean no disrespect to Kate Beckinsale in this.  She was graceful, beautiful, and sexy from moment one.  Better still, she was intelligent, refined, and had a bit of the Renaissance-era sense of dignity and poise.  She combined this well with a sharp sense of slight ruthlessness along with the romantic-warrior-in-a-modern-world outlook and a certain sense of pensive sadness, which I did indeed like.  However, though she did quite well, even she could not make up for the utter lack of depth so prevalent in her vampiric comrades.<br/><br/>An apt introduction to the first problem, I think.  The main, defining characteristic of vampirism -- that of drinking blood -- seems to have been utterly lost.  Yes, yes, yes, there were goblets of what could pass for blood and a blatant shot of a full blood bank bag; but what happened to the biting?  For the love of heaven, vampires BITE people √¢?` this is why they have those lovely, pointy teeth.  Again, yes, there was some vague mention of a rule or law not to bite humans, I believe, but that simply takes the fun out of everything, doesn't it?  Vampires are, beyond bestial, generally viewed as sensual creatures.  Even if that sensuality is perverse and lethal, the whole point of the vampire mythos is that there is a dread creature wandering the night, taking a twisted pleasure in the enjoyment of the flesh.  At their most hideous they still embody this love of flesh, be it the tragic lustfulness of Dracula or the more horrid sexual predations of others.  These vampires, on the other hand, seemed to be humans that had forgotten what immortality was all about, beyond the plotting and scheming amongst themselves, and slaying of werewolves.  Tsk, tsk.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the next problem: there seemed to be a great deal of confusion about the exact nature of what separated the vampires from the werewolves.  With the obvious exception of werewolves turning into huge, snarling, feral, fur-covered chainsaws, the werewolves seemed to spend a great deal of time in conditions normally attributed to vampires.  They seemed oddly pale to a man, lived in dark, dank places, and worst yet they did not seem to have any connection with nature whatsoever.  In fact, the master ""Lycan"" {or Lykin, was it?} in fact, looked more vampiric at first sight than the first three to five non-Beckinsale vampires one saw.  Said master was, incidentally, also the first to actually BITE someone; and no, not in the hybrid lupine form; we're talking vampire-style human face and form with sharp fangs crunching into a victim's neck, here.  In fact, for a time, I was honestly somewhat curious as to whether these ""Lykin/Lycans"" were actually shape shifting vampires themselves, and THIS was what the war was about.  It took me a good third of the movie to be firmly convinced otherwise.<br/><br/>Thirdly, while once again, Kate Beckinsale was quite fearsome, especially in those choreographies which involves some sort of jumping ~{interjection: whoever choreographed all of the mid-air or jumping moves should be applauded}~ many of the vampires, while able to spray a seemingly endless amount of firearm ammunition, apparently cannot fight effectively.  The predominance of long, drawn-out series' of hissing at opponents both lupine and vampiric was perhaps the worst indication, though the barroom-brawl-style swings were nearly as bad.  Nothing wrong with a classic vampiric hiss and baring of fangs; and in this ""World of Darkness""-esque movie, one expects the werewolves to have the upper hand in down and dirty combat.  However, there were several instances where the hissing just went on and on.  Related is the sequence of ten-to-fifteen-stroke display of whip agility mentioned in another review, which is excessive to the point of utter uselessness.  Honestly, were I confronted by a huge man changing into a much larger creature with teeth and claws, I wouldn't hiss at it repeatedly for ten seconds or twirl my whips to show the enemy how remarkably skillful I was.  Out of fear reaction, if nothing else, I'd lay into the bloody thing immediately and hope I didn't get trounced in the process.  There were others, but I think these examples say it well enough.<br/><br/>To sum up, ""Underworld"" began in a ""Blade""-like fashion, which was all to the good.  It seemed to move into a somewhat ""Resident Evil"" sense of scene and tension, but with too little background story and too much reliance on gunplay for cardboard plot.  Finally, it settled {in all possible interpretations of the word} in the end to a ""John Carpenter's Vampires""-grade ending combat choreography for the last fifteen minutes. This is to say, ""Underworld"" was good, fast-paced, and visually catching at first, dragged a little as one began waiting for a bit more oomph, and slogged to a close leaving one disappointed.  It was the worse for the fact that there were occasional hints at what might consider the hoped-for vampire fare, which were never brought to completion.  The film was full to the brim of good concept and possibly wonderful plot potential that as a whole was brought into play about as successfully as a virgin owning and managing a strip club -- lots of energy, good ideas and good intentions, but not quite enough overall substance to make it worthwhile for the knowledgeable customer.<br/><br/>It's saddening, actually.  I had rather hoped that, after the parade of utter low-grade drivel that was the theatrical attempt at ""Queen of the Damned,"" the next major vampire movie that hit the theatres would do us more proud.  Perhaps, if the implied sequel does come about in the future, a bit more consideration will be taken of past mistakes."

All that happened was the vampires took their cue, developed their own anti-werewolf bullets and even variations. So werewolves are stupid and vampires are smart? Does this also mean no vampires are going to see this movie as well?<br/><br/>Secondly, I've seen people whining about how different this movie is from The Matrix, and really, it's different aside from how people talk, dress, and fight, which is about 99% of the movie.

","To those who believe the only reason people won't like Underworld is because they aren't `into' that kind of genre, I say this: no, no, NO! I am a traditionalist when it comes to horror movies involving werewolves and vampires. I like the Bela Lugosi, the James Whales, the Dwight Frye, and the Lon Chaney Jr. kind of film. I love the set ups, short length and soul in the Universal Horror films of the 1930's and 1940's. Now I see films like Blade: fair enough. I will buy the reinvention. But a film like Underworld does even reinvent the monsters, it rips off common techniques visible not even in Blade, but in the Matrix, so on. Underworld is absolutely preposterous. I can think of many two or three scenes that showed some promise. The rest of the scenes are poorly conceived and executed. You would think a lame, terrible contrived and convoluted action horror film would at least have a few scares and/or a major star to flex some charisma. Sadly no. We have absolutely no tension and a lame brained performance by `Scott Speedman'. Who said this dickweed could be in major motion pictures. I sure as hell didn't. People need to get an okay from before their evolve from the WB to the big screen (I gave Jessica Biel an 'okay' when I saw the fuck scene in Rules of Attraction). Scott is completely bland here and interchangeable with Barry Watson in my mind. Actually. I might have enjoyed Barry Watson fighting vampires or whatever the hell this picture was about. Okay. Choke on this load. Werewolves and vampires have been fighting for hundreds of years. For some reason, RIGHT NOW they are all within blocks of each other and killing like heck. The hot vampire protagonist is Kate Beckinsale, apparently the only character given to us to try and sympathize with. Everyone else is amoral in a banal way, evil in one dimension of the word, or completely forgettable.  There are several other vampires around her, but I couldn't keep any of them straight. Please note: the horribly over the top acting in this film. Specifically Shane Brolly as the double crossing (don't ask) leader Kraven. Hopefully Shane will be `Kraven' a new agent after this. He spends his minutes on film brooding about, screaming and so on. His character managed to achieve this plotless mess to become even more ludicrous. Okay, Kraven is a laughably bad character in a fairly inept film. That will not prepare you for the character of `Lucian', played by Michael Sheen. Remember the hilariously over the top costumes by Jeremy Irons in The Time Machine, or Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. Moreau? This is in that league. He is a revived vampire leader who spends half the movie `growing' his skin and face back on. I'm not quite sure what the hell was going on. This movie is that bad. And to compensate for these poor characters and plot, it seemed as if the volume during the 'action' scenes (if you can call them that) was pumped all the way up. My head is still ringing, a week later. Another problem lies in continuity. Even the background given to us through narration had loopholes the size of an African princess getting her ears pierced! What has everyone been doing for all these years? `Fighting'? Riiight. Not to even mention or get into the attempt by the filmmakers to give this film a dark, grisly edge. The film takes place turning the nighttime and in the rain. Do these characters sleep during the day? Do the werewolves have day jobs? The real story lies within the werewolves, of whom I have always been accustomed to liking (go Lon Chaney!). What is the REAL motivation of these beasts. Do they have families? Where do they like hanging out? Starbucks? And is it hard finding an apartment that allows quasi pets? All and all, I hardly felt the need to write a review for this. Several comrades of mine of already pointed the flaws here. This film stinks and I can't think of anything redeemable about it. It gives werewolf movies a bad name (I even liked Teen Wolf!). See this if you are planning a 'Clockwork Orange' type torture session."

","I really wanted to like this film; maybe amazingly agile characters in black beating the cr*p out of each other using guns and martial arts isn't the most original of ideas, but it promised fun.  Unfortunately the reasonable, if somewhat repetitive use of action is mired in a script marked by clunky dialogue and a massive over-reliance on shaky,  blurred flashbacks to explain to the viewer exactly what is going on.<br/><br/>The original premise; vampires and werewolves at war, will have been what interested many people in this film and I still think something good could be done with it.  Given the opening box office in the US and the apparent interest from the star maybe a sequel could live up to this film's promise. I'd just suggest the use of a more experienced writer to script as the roots of this film's problems are in the writing.<br/><br/>In summary, while there are the makings of a good film here, this isn't it, although it's not awful."

","Save your 9 bucks or whatever the price of movies are now. It was the most unbearable piece of trash I have ever seen. The acting was terrible outside of Kate Beckinsale (who was gorgeous) and Kahn (played by Robbie Gee from Snatch). Kraven seemed as if he was the kid who was always picked last for kick ball, always whining. Sophia (the Vampire who is the jealous blond) seemed like she was the hot chick that only wanted to date the quarterback, but never got to. It was a pitiful display of characters. With the exception of Selene (Beckinsale) and Kahn (Gee) I couldn't put up with a single actor. However, I was impressed to notice that Bill Nighy from the movie Still Crazy has found some work as Viktor.<br/><br/>The special effects were terrible; it was as if they used the same sequence of her feet hitting the ground at two different times in the movie. Which was quite obvious that she was on wires the way that she hit the ground. I'm almost positive that my school's film group could've done a better job given the time (and money). The computer generation was also terrible and easy to locate. They used slow motion where there shouldn't have been any, sped up the film when there wasn't a need for it, and cut any semblance of flashbacks they tried to show.<br/><br/>They also couldn't decide whether the vampires adhered to the rules (that we all know and love) or not. We constantly saw reflections in mirrors, glass, etc. Inconsistencies in the strengths of vampires and the lycans (sucks to that, I'm calling them werewolves) was evident through out the film. One minute they had werewolves breaking through cement walls, the next they were being held by common chains. Bullets that couldn't break a chain one minute easily did the next. and when doors were locked, why would they have to shoot them open? Can't both of these species break wood fairly easily?<br/><br/>Most of what I've been mention has been visual and/or minor inconsistencies that I would normally over look were it a good movie. Unfortunately, you need B to have A, hence I noticed everything stated above. The plot line was crap!! I had been reading reviews and comics about how it was the `the Romeo and Juliet for the monster-loving crowd'. If that was Romeo and Juliet, then I seriously missed something when we read that book in high school. I never knew that Juliet was a reject of the house... And had fangs.... And drank blood... either way, the love-line plot was extremely weak. The two characters were hardly ever in the same scene let alone the same room together. All in all, the love line was crap. The movie seemed to drag on an on. People were falling asleep. I couldn't believe how painful some of the scenes were. It was as if Len Wiseman (Director) was trying to lose his job making this movie. I do not fall asleep during movies, but with this one, I was right on the brink of slumber.<br/><br/>The thing that surprised me the most were the people in the theater that liked the movie. As soon as the movie ended, I stood up and said to the friends I was with `I am so sorry I brought you guys to this. That was terrible!!'  People were looking at me like I was wierd or something. They thought it was a good movie. People laughed at parts of the movie where I couldn't see anything remotely funny. Normally I get the joke, but don't laugh cuz it's stupid, just like the audience. This time when people laughed I just didn't know what was going on.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was way too long. Too many long pauses, too many shots of people's faces and eyes that were completely unnecessary. too many long entrances for people we already know. It would have been a decent action movie were it about an hour shorter. it woulda been a better movie if it hadn't been so deadpan all the time. A good joke here or there would have been nice.<br/><br/>So essentially, what I'm trying to say is don't go see Underworld, unless you aren't paying for it and have nothing better to do than torture yourselves for 2 solid hours of crap. Which is what my friends and I did. :)"

","Not a perfect film by any means; however, it suffers severely from a lack of development along with action film clich√©s, and most aspects of the production meet with varying degrees of success.  Funny thing about the flaws though, many (all) `blockbuster' films suffer from a similar or identical set of flaws so I'm eager to see how the public as a whole welcomes Underworld.<br/><br/> Gripe #1.  Lack of development.  We are thrown into the world of vampires warring with werewolves and the lives of these characters who are going to tell the story, yet we never get an introduction nor do we ever get enough information to fully buy into their motivations behind some of their actions (most notably: Michael and Selene's 'relationship').  There are traces of a plethora of nice little character traits and back stories and Underworld could have developed perhaps the deepest set of characters of 2003's action films if only they expanded this story to encompass multiple films and not pack everything into two hours.  Alas, we're left with the feeling of many cut scenes and only hints of what could have been.<br/><br/> With that said, the characters and story of Underworld are still infinitely deeper and believable than the likes of Matrix Reloaded which lacked any development for the better part of its running time.<br/><br/> Gripe #2.  Goes with #1, lightning fast pacing with no indication of time passage especially since we view events from the Vampire's perspective and thus never see daylight in the present timeline.  Underworld is a movie taking place at night in a gothic landscape, and if you don't listen to dialogue and pay attention to events, the movie could all take place in one night for all you know.<br/><br/> Gripe #3.  Action film cliches - things that look wicked on screen but make no sense whatsoever, hero killing 10 people but 10 people can't take her down, etc, you've seen action films you know the clich√©s and if you're going to whine about it I have to ask `Why do you still go to action films?'<br/><br/> Misc #1:  Minor tweaks to both vampire and werewolf mythologies/portrayals in the film. Purists while inevitably whine endlessly as if they've identified the single undisputed source of all vampiric/lycanthropic information and traits to each species.  But the more aware moviegoers will realize that liberties have always been taken with the subject matter depending on who the writer happens to be and view the film as a slightly different interpretation.<br/><br/> Praise #1. Granted I did complain about lack of development, but this bit of praise goes out to Underworld for trying.  Underworld does have a nice story and matching characters whose depth easily surpasses the likes of the latest Star Wars, Matrix, and Terminator entries, and is on par with Pirates of the Caribbean (minus the masterfully created Captain Jack Sparrow compliments of Johnny Depp.)  Because, as stated above, Underworld at least gave me the impression that there was a character to explore, that there was more to these people and this story, that this film could be made better by making it a trilogy and not a single film.  SW, Matrix 2, and T3 left me feeling that the actors had nothing to work with from square one and winged it; I felt their screen plays didn't give enough damn to develop them or bother trying, and thus I don't care to see any of them again.  I actually have a desire to see the Special Edition or Director's cut of Underworld.<br/><br/> Praise #2.  A nice gothic, yet slick 21st century, visual style featuring some flowing transitions from scene to scene.  Tim Burton meets James Cameran meets the Scott brothers.  I would throw the Wachowski name out there too, but I feel they've gone the way of George Lucas and sold their souls for an oversized budget that goes to waste where artistic creativity and genius execution used to reside.  Underworld's fluid transitions actually makes keeping track of time in the film difficult since one scene flows into the next with no visual indication that a 24 hour cycle has passed.  It is a different experience, I'll give Underworld that and award the film points for it.<br/><br/>Priase #3.  Very important: Underworld does not feel like a  video game in every frame thanks to the more concrete sets and effects and some restraint in the CGI department.  If Underworld succeeds and gains a larger budget, please, for the love of God, please continue to show restraint with the CGI. CGI is a tool, an effective tool, but it's not meant to be the movie (ie Matrix 2, Star Wars 2.)  Granted Underworld did show the Lycan transformations a little too quickly, but I said the movie was good not perfect.<br/><br/> All in all, Underworld was a worthwhile investment on my part.  My appreciation for the quality of the film increased upon discovering the size of the movie's budget.  Underworld got far more bang for its buck than virtually all the summer's major players, and it's always nice seeing money well spent."
"jake-179","3","0","1","22 September 2003"," Disappointing and Boring
","Two of my favorite genres are action and horror, and considering UNDERWORLD was werewolves vs. vampires, I did not expect to be falling asleep in the theatre!  I could hardly keep my eyes open!  This movie was a big disappointment for me.  The previews made it look action packed.  But in reality, the movie was overlong and only had a couple of action sequences. Don't go to this movie expecting to see MATRIX type action or something like BLADE.  BLADE and THE MATRIX are millions of times better than UNDERWORLD and UNDERWORLD is not even in the same class.<br/><br/>It's a real shame, because I think UNDERWORLD had a lot of potential.  I am sure most people who saw the movie would agree with me.<br/><br/>
The movie was shot well.  The production design was great and the overall look of the film was fantastic.  But the script fell short.  There was a lack of tension in the movie.  The audience does not really care for any of the characters.  The ""love"" story between Selene and Michael was non-existent.  They fall in love with eachother after only meeting for a few seconds.  And, in that time, Selene constantly has a gun in Michael's face. Ridiculous.  Also, there is no RISING ACTION in the movie.  The writers failed to RAISE THE STAKES.  That is a basic element of good screen writing, and it is absent in this movie.  And for the most part, none of the characters are developed.  <br/><br/>There are two characters in particular that really annoyed me.  First, Kraven was terrible.  I will be amazed if the actor who played Kraven EVER works in a real film again.  Through out the entire movie, he is trying to act ""intense"" and ""angry."" But he just constantly breathes heavily through his nose!  He didn't convince me at all!  The other character that really bugged was that black guy who was the werewolf with the SUPER deep voice. That was just silly.  Obviously, they are trying to test him out as another counterpart to Vin Diesel.  Vin has a low voice, but the joker in UNDERWORLD sounds like a cartoon character.  He was trying to be all serious and everytime he opened his mouth I was laughing out loud!  You really have to hear this guy's voice to appreciate how stupid it sounds.  You can't hardly even understand him.  But believe me, it isn't worth sitting through the entire movie just to hear this stupid guy's voice.  Just take my word for it, it is silly. <br/><br/>The movie is technically done pretty well.  It is definitely a case of atmosphere over substance.  I really wanted to like this movie, I really expected to be thrilled by this movie, but instead I was just bored.  I will go watch BLADE 1 and 2 again.  <br/><br/>But in closing, I must comment on Kate Beckinsale and how she is incredibly HOT!  She is very hot.  And even though the movie was boring, at least I got to look at her most of the time.  She looks better when she is not all gothed up."
"tpcomputerman","3","0","1","20 September 2003"," What a waste of a good concept
","You know what I hate?  When a movie that has a really good concept just totally sucks.  I went to see Underworld today, from the previews I thought it looked kind of cool, sort of a Matrix with Vampire and Werewolf's, not a bad combo I thought.  Although, personally I think that the Matrix, as great as it was, has ruined action movies.  I mean, how many times do we need to see a super slow motion shot with the camera spinning around in a 360 degree arc while the person is shooting a gun before we just go `ho hum.'  You know what I mean?  When it was done in the first Matrix it was cool as s***, when you see it on Charlie's Angles, well it's just gone too far! Oh, sorry, lost my train of thought there, I was talking about Underworld. The basic plot of Underworld is a war between the Vampires and the Werewolf's.  It stars Kate Beckinsaleas Trini. . . I mean Selene (I kept wanting to say `Dion?' every time they said her name.  For all those people out there to who want to write books and stuff, creating good character name is very important!)  who is a hunter of werewolf's.  During one of her hunts she notices that a pack of werewolfs are stalking a man named Michel, she saves his life but he gets away, from there she wants to know why they were after him and what she finds out will have dire effects on both her, the Vampires and the Werewolf's. That's the plot people, that's it.  There are times when simple plots done right can make a great movie.  I mean, the Matrix had a pretty simple plot but they did it so right that it made it an awesome movie.  This movie had a simple plot, a great concept, a good actress, and some good effects but did nothing with it.  It was just a loud, violent mess that made little sense.<br/><br/>My major problem was with the story logic.  Trini. . . I mean Selene thinks that Kraven, her boss or something, is working with the wereworlf's for some reason.  But, you know, I don't know why she thought that.  All we saw was her trying to get to Michel while Kraven yelled at her not too.  How to you make the logical jump from Kraven not wanting her to save Michel to Kraven working for the Werewolf's?  I didn't see anything myself that would lead me to believe that Kraven was nothing more than an asshole Vampire.<br/><br/>Also, Kraven, for some reason or another, is in love with Trini. . . damn, Selene (Dion?)  and I just don't know why. All she did to him throughout the entire movie was disobey him, run away from him, shoot him angry looks, punch him, and totally tell this guy that she hates his guts and will have nothing to do with her.  Now, I can see if they gave any hint that at one time they were lovers or something, but they didn't, in fact, from what I can tell, she has hated him for hundreds of years.  Geez dude, take a hint would you! So, later in the film Selene (Dion?) I guess fell in love with Michel the way she was giving him, you know, that look throughout the movie, how they sort of kissed at one point, oh and how she pretty much got excommunicated from the Vampire's because of him,  I guess she was in love with him. But, how?  Don't you need, oh, I don't know, some time together to fall in love? Or to maybe have some sort of common bond to fall in love?  Here it just seemed that they were in love because the scripted called for them to fall in love.  Really though, they could have come up with a better reason for her to be protecting him as much as she did besides the love story.  I don't know, it's like you need to have the two main characters fall in love or something, even if logic dictates that they shouldn't.  At least in the Matrix they had some downtime to make Trinity and Neo to fall in love, this movie was pretty much action from start to finish. Well, I always like to say something nice about a movie, so here it goes. The final fight was pretty cool!  Not a good reason to see the movie, but the last 10 minutes or so had some really good action between Vampire and Werewolf. What really bugs me is this movie had some really good ideas, the Vampire/Werewolf war, the reasons for the war, the whole part about the elders (there are three Elders, one awake, two asleep, at all times) and the secret of Michel were all very good ideas. But, a movie just can't run with some clever ideas, you need a well told story behind it, you need to know and care for the characters, you just need something this movie didn't do. I just hate it when a movie with good ideas doesn't follow through with those ideas and instead of a fantastic movie we have a run of the mill one that will be forgotten within a few months."

Secondly the story wasn't written all that great.  If you try to have a real story line and try to develop characters thats great, but doing this while trying to fit in all the action that you think you possibly can just ruins everything.  I wanted to know more about the story, I honestly didnt think this movie would be more in the action genre than anything else.  Even the action wasnt even that great, infact it was extremely repetitive and made me think about how Matrix Reloaded sucked becuase it was nothing but overdone action.

Style over substance action horror hybrid about a war converging between vampires and lycans (as in lycanthropes AKA ¬ñ werewolves) mixes mythologies, Shakespearian overtones (Beckinsale and Speedman as a genre version of `Romeo & Juliet') and allows its splendid graphic novel appeal to overwhelm some underwhelming acting (sadly the two romantic leads have zip chemistry and Speedman is so wooden it's surprising that splinters don't fall from his lips when he delivers dialogue).

","I was really looking forward to this film as I'm a horror fan who likes a more intellectual slant on the oft-ridiculed genre and I saw that Underworld held real potential to be a genre defining film.<br/><br/>However I literally could not have been more disappointed as I left after the film. I was initially stunned to discover that this film lasted about 2 hours because to me it really felt more like 2.45 to 3 hours long. Basically I thought this film was seriously overlong, a problem which blighted most scenes.<br/><br/>There were several story points and character developments that could have been totally explored in one scene that were stretched out to three or four. The story suffered from a lack of narrative, bad pacing and an attempt to stretch a fairly simple and thin plot out and overcomplicate it.<br/><br/>I thought Kate Beckinsale was a strong leading lady and acquited herself very well and of course she looked absolutely fantastic, oozing the threat of violence simmering under the surface with real aristocratic class and measured poise and beauty. However the same could not be said of the other players.<br/><br/>I thought most of the cast believed that if you hunch your shoulders, screw up your forehead and narrow your eyes then you become a menacing presence when I thought they just looked like they had read a particularly large phone bill. The 'Kraven' character was awful, the actor playing him like a one trick pony, see above for his acting technique and was it me or did he say his first line with an American accent before switching to Irish?<br/><br/>It had too many models trying to break into acting sitting about in the vampire mansion, arching their backs and posing relentlessly as they tried to be noticed by the camera whilst the other actors could've faxed in their performances and no one would've noticed the difference.<br/><br/>I thought Len Wiseman's direction was merely competant but as he had co-written the story I feel he maybe couldn't detach himself enough to seperate the wheat from the chaff storywise although he did use a small for Hollywood budget to good effect but this can't make up for the fundamental errors in this project and by the end of the film I didn't care about who would win the conflict as the goals of the different groups had been so poorly defined that it felt like five or six different factions fighting for no reason and no true resolution was defined instead leaving the merest shred for any potential sequels that I hope will never be made. An enormous waste of hype, time and money, absolutely underwhelming and awful.<br/><br/>

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Oh dear. The movie had its moments, but it was a reasonably good idea marred by poor execution. I think that the makers/distributors were more concerned about making the film watchable for the majority of blokes by putting the lead actress in a leather corset and PVC/Rubber than putting any significant plot or acting in. Even the martial arts (which usually makes me at least open my eyes) was poorly done.<br/><br/>I would say a scripting and directing disaster. I struggled for emotional involvement (normally not a problem for me). I really didnt care if Kate/Love Interest/Anyone else snuffed it. My heart didnt leap into my mouth when she was placed in a difficult situation, it yawned. Character development was cursory, at best. Normally it was pretty much entirely non-existent.<br/><br/>It's an OK action film, the locations are pretty good, but its really no better than taking two races which are generally known to prey on humans and getting them to fight each other instead. It's Freddie vs Jason, or Aliens vs Predator.<br/><br/>Actually, I've just thought. It could have got worse. They could have had Kate and Love Interest having sex. I suspect that they will reserve that delicacy [irony here] for Underworld 2, which was blatantly plugged at the end (as opposed to actually having an ending, which whilst not an original idea has been successfully trialed in many good films).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what will make this film sell, and hence result in an even worse sequel, is her and her clothing.<br/><br/>For those who regard the film as a masterpiece because of a lead actress in PVC/leather/rubber, I suggest you go rent/buy a film more carefully targeted to your tastes, however you may need to be over 18 to obtain it."

I must say, after seeing the movie, I was<br/><br/>pleasantly surprised.  UNDERWORLD was everything that THE MATRIX<br/><br/>WISHES it could have been.    The movie basically continues a feud that was<br/><br/>shown in the movie THE HOWLING VI:  THE FREAKS:  vampires and<br/><br/>werewolves do not get along.  They have been warring for over a millennium. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is a vampire known as a ""death dealer"", she<br/><br/>especially trained to kill lycans:  Werewolves.  The leader of the lycans, Lucian (Michael Sheen), has been killed. Or so we are led to believe.   It turns out that not only is he alive, but he is tracking a young man (Scott Speedman) who is a descendant of a man who is supposed to have the blood of both lycans and<br/><br/>vampires flowing through him.  Selene  is also trying to get to Michael<br/><br/>(Speedman) before Lucian.  As fate would have it, Michael is being hunted at<br/><br/>around the same time that  Viktor (Bill Nighy), the leader of the vampires, is going to be resurrected.    This isn't sitting too well with Kraven (Shane Brolly), the current leader.  He'd just as soon kill Michael as try to find out the plans that Lucian have for him.  <br/><br/>     The fight scenes are pretty impressive as is the unique ammo that each side uses to exploit the other's weaknesses such as bullets that emit ultraviolet rays inside of a vampire's body and others that are loaded with silver nitrate to get into a lycan's bloodstream quicker.    I repeat, I was expecting a weak MATRIX clone and  instead found a movie that, I think, sets the  bar high for THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS to top."

","It's a dark and complex story. It's cool and hip for today's younger generation. It's sending a message that wars will continue to trigger if old habits of prejudices are not replaced by the meshing of moderate ideals. Can racism or the prejudicial cast system be wiped with crossbreeding? Can wars between the rich and poor be ever solved? Oh yes, the Vampires could easily exemplify corporate snobs fighting the Werewolf Lycans (street thuds?) to conquer the ¬ëHungarian' underworld (interestingly giving the feel of a WWW II subterranean bunker). Wow, aren't we all different sects of monsters when it comes to making war?  I find this film very interesting.<br/><br/>
The film starts off well with a fabulously exciting train station scene - a good premise as we see the two rival species in action. The rest comes off as filmmaking tributes to Matrix Reloaded, The Crow and F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu or signs of recognizable ¬ëvampire' flicks. There are even momentary moments of the `Romeo and Juliet' appeal. At times, the scenes carry the comic book flavor. Everything comes appropriately together without interrupting the flow of the easy-to-digest plot and sub-plots. This film's drenched with CGI visual effects and non-stop action sequences, creating spectacular eye-popping extravaganza. Beautiful choreography in the fight scenes too. Are the characters well developed? Oh yes, they are basically simple characters without too much complexity to make the themes work.<br/><br/>
This film ¬ës really fun to watch. I really like the way the vampires and werewolves are presented ¬ñ so segregated in their ideals, style, methods of defense, and actions as they enter one scene after another that's filled with the explosive blue tinge of special effects.  Of course, it's always lovely to see a shapely, butt-kicking female vampire in tight-fitting outfit or her fluttering cape. Oh yes, the idea that vampires can be toasted by ultraviolet ammunition is also a pretty cool concept. <br/><br/>Even if the plot and subplots may be ¬ëlost in translation' for some, the good twists and furls are there to capture one's attention. Kate Beckinsale's Selene is almost a composite of Matrix's Trinity and Blade II's Nyssa. At long last, we aren't getting any cheesy and voluptuous temptress to make the story work. Beckinsale portrays her internal conflicts without a flaw. She's supported by a great cast of actors who succeed in not creating chaotic mess in the movie.  This movie captured my attention throughout. <br/><br/>B+"
