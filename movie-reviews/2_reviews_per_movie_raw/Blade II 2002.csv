","Blade II (2002) is the vampire superhero action horror sequel film to the original film Blade (1998). We have a kick ass sequel to an R rated kick ass first movie you go the mix of Daryl Dixon who still looks the same and a ball headed Hellboy Excellent!!! Blade II is an awesome movie!!!! Not only does it takes 4.years for this movie to come out since the last movie, but we see Wesley Snipes returning as Blade and he Is awesome!! I love this film but I love the first one way more. It is my second favorite in the Blade trilogy series. <br/><br/>So in this movie Blade is on a search for a Whistler, who is now a vampire in this movie. He tracks him down, he finds him, than he meets up with this group of vampires called the Bloodpack. They need his help to track down Nomak (Luke Goss. and he has basically an ability to turn vampires in to Repears that can hunt both vampires and humans. <br/><br/>So, yea...That's your basic plot. There are a lot of twist from here and now, but it is AWESOME! Because Wesley Snipes knows all those martial arts, they are nice to look at, and since it is 2002 we now got in to the phase, where the fights scenes are awesome and the choreographer says something once heavy handed, you will see bloody violence right away when the character turns in to an CGI model and it is shown trough whole movie, you can really see that, specially old dude drops kicks, kicks Blade right in the face and goes in to an CGI character, you can kind a see that, kind a weak, but does it track down from the movie? Hell to the no! This movie is awesome!!!!! The beginning of the movie, in the first 10 minutes, Blade already kills like 25 people. That's how it is done, just like in the first movie! He killed like 50 or 60 people from the very beginning of the movie it is AWESOME!!! <br/><br/>Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) is a bad ass! He is amazing bad ass! Norman Reedus like I said before still looks 12.year old boy, he is still Daryl Dixon, he still has the same hair style, the same look stubborn on his face and he looks like damn, don't you age boy. And you voice is going now heavy now todays world, but don't you age. Ron Perlman is awesome, he loves to make you hate him, but you can't hate him because he is Ron Perlman, you just laugh at him, because he is such a bad ass and he is such a an awesome, he is so awesome! Where is Hellboy III. Even in Alien: Resurrection (1997) Ron Perlman was standout in that film, come on, the man is just AMAZING! The effects in this movie is pretty good too, besides the fight scenes when they turn the CGI character however, but that's okay I can kind a forget about it because Spider-Man (2002) come out the same year, of course they also did do the same thing, yea, I guess you have to live, with that back than, I'm pretty sure they can do better now this days. Choreograph and everything, Guillermo del Toro takes over, this movie has director, David S. Goyer returns as the writer in this movie. David S. Goyer is a good writer, I have to give him that, he is an awesome writer! How do you make Blade even a more bad ass, than he already was? I think that was possible, it is possible. This movie it is possible and it is awesome! <br/><br/>Wesley Snipes has that charm back again, he has that to be a bad ass, but it has that humor aside Blade II, like in the strip club or whatever they were at. Ron Perlman really was about to shoot Blade and Blade had him track down at his gun and he sit like smiling, Wesley Snipes your gold boy your Gold!!! Without the doubt, the acting in this movie is awesome, Effects are awesome, Action is awesome, story is awesome, Cinematography it is kinda even a bad ass, you actually feel bad for one of the characters, tough she was cute, I am just saying. In the end of the day Blade II is one of the best sequel ever, you have to watch this movie!!!!! <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro is endlessly imaginative when it comes to creating new style, action, and ideas for the vampire mythology. Now the plot doesn't have much character development, but it has just enough interesting twists to keep you interested as well as entertained. And like I said, if you are looking for a movie with brains, this movie should meet your criteria, but if you appreciate brawn, this will blow you away. <br/><br/>The sword-wielding warrior Blade (Wesley Snipes - ""Demolition Man,"" ""White Men Can't Jump"") returns to fight the Reapers, a new race of super vampires hell-bent on annihilating all other vampires before destroying the entire human race. Blade aligns himself with a high-powered team of vampires to defeat an evil greater than either has ever battled.<br/><br/>9/10 my second favorite in the Blade trilogy my number one will always be Blade the first one."
"Keith-35","10","14","16","14 October 2002"," Nonstop big screen action
","You've seen Blade.  You know the story.  Now sit back and immerse yourself in this non-stop action movie.<br/><br/>The pace at the beginning is Guyver, with a little Fist of the North Star and Tenchi thrown in.  I think it was inspired from Anime.<br/><br/>I missed the Tai Chi sword forms in Blade, but we've got some Wing Chun instead.  It's all good.<br/><br/>There's no time for romance, or humor, just friendship, moral courage and action.  The lighting, background music, visual and audio effects are all excellent.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie on DVD but the effects are diminished.  You really need to see this movie on the big screen preferably with DTS sound."
"mahlbowski","9","30","39","27 March 2002"," Great
","There are some types of movies that you walk into expecting a lot of killing,a lot of swearing and snappy dialogue. Blade II is this kind of movie, and it is great. The plot is great, (albeit a little predictable)and some of the computer graphics are extremely noticeable, but altogether this is a great action movie. So many people die a body count would be impossible. The second to last fight scene is unbelievable. Blade puts the icing on the cake when he vertical suplexes the last security guard through a plate glass floor. The music lines up perfectly with the fighting, and I was very impressed with the way the Reaper looks and feeds. A GREAT SEQUEL TO A GREAT MOVIE!!! Looking forward to a trilogy!!!"
"Antagonisten","6","33","45","18 January 2005"," Entertaining
","I have a weak spot for comic-book action. Something about the mix between today and the supernatural has always drawn me to it. And i found the first ""Blade"" to be one of the more entertaining in the genre.<br/><br/>Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been looking for his old-time companion Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) for a long time. Whistler was taken captive by vampires and Blade has slaughtered his way through the vampire clans of several countries to find him. Now though there is another threat to the human race that also affects the vampires themselves. Soon Blade is given an offer he can't refuse, resulting in a unholy alliance between the vampires and their greatest enemy.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is a man with what the Germans would term ""fingerspitzengefühl"". He's got that special feeling for what works on screen, especially when it comes to movies like this one. Blade 2 refines most of the elements seen in the first Blade movie. This is a violent and action-filled journey into a comic-book world and del Toro is not taking any prisoners. Wesley Snipes seems to enjoy himself as Blade and most of the other actors also seem to blend in nicely in the mood of the film.<br/><br/>There were only a few minor flaws that bothered me. Most of all the sometimes shaky CGI-work. Some of the special effects look cheap to say the least. Especially the use of digital ""stand-ins"" for the actors that are used in some action scenes to spice them up a bit. All in all though this is an entertaining ride in it's overblown testosterone-rich way. I rate it 6/10."
"bob the moo","Null","35","49","16 May 2004"," Enjoyable dark style with solid action, OK plot and good cast
","Having rescued Whistler from the grasp of the vampires and acted quickly enough to combat the vampire virus in his blood, Blade reforms his team. When his base is infiltrated by two vampires, he is offered a temporary truce that Blade accepts. He meets with the vampire council who ask for his help to track and kill a new strain of the vampire virus called the Reaper. The Reapers feed on vampires and humans, are immune to garlic and silver and threaten to rapidly multiple. Blade agrees to join forces but fighting alongside those he would hunt puts him very ill at ease.<br/><br/>Opening with the same style that made Blade enjoyable, it is immediately apparent that, if you liked the first film then you should enjoy this one just as much. The plot has quite a few major holes but I can't help eel it's a little unfair to attack a vampire horror movie for being a little illogical at times! What remains is a series of fast and stylish action scenes, held together by a reasonable plot and a nice few little twists and turns to keep it engaging. While the plot may only be average it is probably the dark action that you came for and it is as enjoyable as in the first film. The wirework was pretty good, mainly because the cast members involved could actually do it without looking like they had become members of Thunderbirds! The CGI stuff is not very good and the computerised characters, despite looking good, don't look or move real and thus take away from the energy and impact of the fights. Director del Toro handles the action well and also brings the same dark feel that he brought to Cronos and Mimic.<br/><br/>However generally the fights are good  good moves but still rather rough. Snipes has certainly worked on his body to the degree that he can perform these moves with a natural feel, only the WWF style moves came across as being rather silly or ill fitting. As a leading man he has really come on since reinventing himself as an action hero, and Blade is his best character in that regard. This film scales back on the complexities of his character and it damages the film a little bit but chances are that isn't what you came here for! Kristofferson is good but his character isn't really used well here. Perlman uses his screen presence well and he holds his own with Snipes. Varela is quite sexy but again the script doesn't use her relationship with Blade as well as it could do. Goss is very good in this role and it bodes well but I'd need to see him play a character (as opposed to a monster) to be able to judge if he has real ability as an actor  all the makeup also helped forget his Bros personae too. Jules is a very strange find but he looks good. Donnie Yen was, as he often is, poorly used  he has one small fight scene but considering the amount of martial arts action in this movie it would have been better to have actually used him in more of the action; wisely the film uses him better as the main fight choreographer.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable action movie with a horror twist. The plot is OK and has enough to it to be engaging despite having several themes that it should have done more with. The action is solid and enjoyable and not too hurt by the odd bit of poorly used CGI. A good cast helps and the action flows reasonably consistently to produce an enjoyable two hours of dark style."

","Other than the explanation of where he came from, who he and everyone else is, at the beginning, this film stands nicely on its own. for those of you that know the first one, then this opening explanation will be a little irritating (and a tad confusing, but it becomes clear later). The opening does smell strongly of franchise potential, being repeated in all the inevitable sequels still to come. Once past this though, we are lead through a massive fight and action scene that sets up the whole movie. and warns anyone who can't stand Hong Kong action scenes that they are probably watching the wrong screen.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially a platform for Snipes to have fun with his most renowned character. And he does so with very entertaining results. The movie has reasonably well rounded characters, suspicion piled on top of everyone, some amazing set pieces and a good sense of humour. The impact of all the blood and guts is reduced by the obvious fantasy of the fights (wires and SFX a lot of the time), but its still pretty powerful.<br/><br/>The lead performances are all very good, although some of the peripheral characters are a little too hammer horror. Luke Goss demonstrates great potential, although you would need to see him without the make up, body doubles, and special effects to really judge. and there is occasionally that urge to shout ""when will I be famous."" and the pure blood female vampire who takes a shine to blade is well worth being bitten by.<br/><br/>Overall it feels less like a sequel and more like a stand alone movie. with this in mind, I think its in fact better than the original (a rare example of the exception that proves the rule)."
"bigoakland","10","7","8","29 March 2002"," Total excitement...
","This sequal is typical that it is not as good as the first but it still rocks.  I enjoyed the action scenes.  The music was nice and a added compliment.  When you attend this movie remember that MATRIX should not be your expectation to judge.  Many people have asked me how it compares. The action is different but based off the same idea.  Can not wait for Blade 3"
"Impartial-Critic","Null","4","4","30 May 2020"," More Advanced Than the Original.
","A worthy sequel and a better experience for the Blade character adaptation in the cinema world, Blade has to form an alliance with the vampire council in order to defeat the Reapers, a new common enemy to both vampires and humans.<br/><br/>In an advanced plot to the original with adding a new characters and a new race of creature, this sequel is one of few to rise above its predecessor. To avoid going into details, Blade II is still have its share of good, predictable ending and illogical actions/consequences, yet it is clearly has an advanced plot concept and script writing skills and with the introduction of a new ""villainous"" race, the reduction level of cliché phrases, shots and fighting senses along with the notable advance of CGI and an appropriate use of a better soundtrack, makes Blade II a much better action packed experience with a higher level of creepiness and scares."
"mujiber","10","10","13","5 April 2002"," This movie kicks ass
","Ok, I didn't think it was as good as the first one, though there was an obvious improvement in the special effects - but this movie really rocked. My wife who didn't particularly like the first one absolutely loved this one.  The action scenes were amazing, and though it looked like Blade was gonna get all sappy towards the vampires - (especially the girl), he still kicked ass.  And it had an awesome ending - comparable to the ending in Russia in the first movie."
"Quinoa1984","8","60","102","22 March 2002"," A sequel that does everything in it's power to top the original and it comes to being as good.
","Blade 2 takes what made the first Blade film good and transforms it into a different country with different characters (outside of Blade and Whistler) and a possibly deeper feel, and it works without going into the bad sequel range.<br/><br/>This time, the vampires Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been hunting down for so many years want to make a truce so that he can help them kill a new breed of monsters called reapers, which if you want a brief description are creatures that look like half vampires half zombies and half, whatever, with a chin that opens up a big damn mouth that before attacking it's prey could resemble a mini-sarlac pit (star wars reference).  Blade reluctantly agrees, knowing full well that the vampires could turn on him and Whistler if things go wrong.<br/><br/>Overall, Blade 2, for the fans of the first one, will not dissapoint them. It contains enough imaginativeness and gore effects to brighten the most down of horror film and comic book enthusiasts.  The film also contains some of the best makeup I've seen in a while in a horror movie. A-"
"MR_Heraclius","7","38","62","22 February 2020"," Good action
","Blade II is an improvement over the first movie and offers far more to the table. While not exactly reaching the levels of greatness that it could've, it still has enough creativity and charm to satisfy any action junkie."

","Blade and his alter ego Wesley Snipes are back yet again to battle the vampiric scourge terrifying the world of the humans.  But this time he helps...that's right, you heard me...helps the vampires fight a mutant vampire that prefers feeding on vampires over humans.  Well, to spin a long (actually not that long or terribly complicated) story, Blade is...Sorry I cannot say anymore or I might give away too much of the plot - and you know movies like this are plot-driven.  This film is exactly what you would expect.  Gobs of blood, tons(maybe even more!) of CGI's kicking heads in, bashing heads in, splitting bodies, turning into sparkling dust, and so on and so on and so on, cute one liners with Wesley twisting his neck a lot, and lots of techo-weapons designed to do everything and anything to the body.  Is it a great film?  Get real.  Is it entertaining?  Yes, somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me I must confess.  Snipes never seems to take his role or what is going on too seriously with his low-key, stoic acting.  Kris Kristofferson is back as Whistler.  You might remember he died in the first Blade movie, but through some plot contrivance that was designed for us not to really understand - he is back and much older and somewhat wiser for wear.  The rest of the cast is acceptable EXCEPT for Reedus who is annoying. Ron Pearlman seems to be having the most fun hamming it up as a villainous vampire out to get Snipes.  All in all not a bad way to spend an hour or two."
"Aaron1375","10","7","9","15 April 2002"," Pretty Cool
","This was one action-packed thrill ride.  Though I would say I liked it about the same as the first one even though it had more action, the first one had a better plot.  Though I understood everything and did not find any of the plot twists to confusing or anything like a lot of others complain about. The darker setting is very cool and the European setting makes this movie have a Gothic setting.  It is a combination of the very old and new that gives this film great atmosphere.  The plot is there is a new breed of vampire on the streets and normal vampires need Blade's help in disposing of them, but can he really trust them.  I highly recommend this flick."
"badfeelinganger","7","11","16","24 September 2014"," This bloody punch-fest lacks the charming antagonists that livened the original movie.Basically, this movie doesn't have the heart the first one did.
","Blade 2 takes what works in the original and gives us more. Unfortunately, plot and character development appear to have been left on the cutting room floor.The fight scenes are fun, but it grows tedious. While blade 2 is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor, the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier.This bloody punch-fest lacks the charming antagonists that livened the original movie.If only as much time was spent on the script as was spent on the fight choreography.Take away everything that was original about BLADE, add some exploding vampires, and vampire night at the WWF - you get BLADE II, a knock-off, rip-off waste of film, released to suck the blood and money out of audiences everywhere.Just never seems very convinced of itself that a sequel was even necessary.This second instalment in the trilogy tries to crank things up even more than in the action packed original, which makes for an obnoxiously hyper active movie.Isn't as sharp as the original,Despite some visual virtues, Blade II just doesn't cut it.The fast-paced action is unnervingly fast, almost dizzying. The story is thin, the plot is predictable, but Wesley Snipes carries this comic book character off with enough clever humour and self-indulgent pathos to carry it off.There are plot twists and inventive fight scenes galore, but what director Guillermo Del Toro loves most is the gore.Blade II is almost excessively violent OK, it is excessively violent but that's exactly what Snipes and Blade fans want. Believe me, they get it.Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel."

","Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson and Luke Goss star in this film where the day walker Blade(Wesley Snipes)has to help his enemies fight their enemies the dangerous fully made vampires that were made by lab. The main danger is Nomak(Luke Gross)and his increasing thirst for blood. Soon he multiples and sends out an army of his own kind on the normal night walkers.<br/><br/>But here's the catch. Nomak was created in a lab, yes but by whom in the head oldest vampire Damaskinos(Thomas Kretschmann)whose daughter, Nyssa(Leonor Varela) hasn't a faintest idea of having a brother.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the parts where he was almost drained of blood but brought back to life and killed Scud(Norman Reedus)who had been helping Blade when Blade was searching for Whistler. Everyone was very well acted upon."

","What a bloodfeast! Solid action through and through, from first minutes to the last. The Daywalker (Wesley Snipes) is even more invincible than in the first movie, a very good performance from Snipes. Kris Kristofferson is also doing a good job. Whistler may look like a Santa Clause, but when he opens his mouth he is a seen-it-all veteran who knows exactly what to do. Seldom have I walked out of the theater and straight back in line, wanting for more, but with this movie I made an exception."

","If you look to the side, you will see that the vampire's lair is called the Caliban Institute. Caliban as in the freak trying to kill his master in Shakespeare's the tempest, and Caliban as in anagram for Canibal--cannibal, or vampire eating vampire. Blade is the little boy's fantasy come true, and it scratched the itch I got from watching pretentious-PG-13-for-little-Goths-wannabes-posing-as-dark-movie-Queen-of-th e-Damned by mutilating the bodies of Satanicly twist-minded vampires, and turning them into BME poster children. In the end, as Satanic as Anne Rice wants them to be, her vampires are no more menacing than a pair of white fags--I mean fangs. As menacing as these pansies pretend to be, they would probably faint at the sight Robbie Williams' ""Rock DJ"", which is the stuff you see in the clubs Blade hangs out at. It also turned away from the wow,-mom-I-know-kung-fu-too,-look-at-me! action genre in moments of sheerly brilliant comic relief. Bor lei jun and Seunlau ngaklau both showed that jump kicks are the stupidest moves to throw against wrestlers, and Blade knows it and takes it to the next level by bringing the prowrestling in the kung-fu. Finally, the tragedy of the vampires is played much more dramatically here than in either of Anne Rice's movies, and the end is a pure beauty."

I was gutted that i never got to see the original on the big screen as I thought it was awesome.<br/><br/>So, when i heard that Blade II was coming out, i was first in line at the local multiplex to see it.  Blade is still not a particularly well seen movie and when I said that I was going to see Blade II, I usually had to fill people in on what it was all about.  The cinema, on opening night, was half empty but the half that did make it, were in for a awesome film.<br/><br/>Its not everyones ""cup of tea"" but I loved it.  The kung-fu and action scenes are amazing.  the story is reasonable, and not necessarily as weak as most would have you believe.  the settings and backdrops are great, the music rocks, and there is blood and gore a plenty.  It is complete escapisim and for that, i have to give it a almost perfect 9.5/10.  and i normally would class myself as critical!!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","43","86","11 April 2002"," Ahhh, MUCH better!!
","Blade II is an exciting action film that takes the tired vampire story and adds a new twist by introducing an entirely new villain. Sure, there is sure to be some controversy (at least among film fans and fans of the genre) about whether or not it is right to introduce new characters in this way. Vampires are a tired theme at the movies, but it is a time-honored genre in itself that deserves respect just from the fact that it has been around for so long in literature before the movies. The question of whether or not the writers were justified in introducing these new characters is, in my opinion, satisfied by the fact that they made such quality villains that fit so well into the genre.<br/><br/>I am thrilled to see that they didn't just make another dumb Blade film that was exactly the same as the original except for the possibility of some new special effects, because these new characters, called Reapers, are exactly what the film series, as well as, potentially, the genre as a whole, needed. Reapers are blood-feeders, just like vampires, except they feed on humans as well as vampires, effectively making them an enemy of both, and their thirst is much stronger than the traditional vampire. And to make matters worse (or better, depending on whether you are an enemy of the Reapers of a member of the audience), they are identified by a scar which runs down their chin. This scar is where the lower jaw splits open when the Reaper is feeding, creating a frighteningly massive mouth like a vampire version of the Predator, and which has things inside it reminiscent of the horrifying and strangely unique Tremors. <br/><br/>There are some amazing make-up effects here as well, although I can see the film being automatically overlooked at the Oscars in 2003 simply because it is the successor of such a low class action/horror film, as well as because this is just not the kind of movie that wins Academy Awards. I'm not sure that there is anything in this film that is likely to catch the Academy's attention, but the make-up was very impressive to say the least. Wesley Snipes returns to the role of Blade, the half-human/half-vampire creature dubbed the `Daywalker' because of his ability to withstand sunlight. This is in itself one of the better parts of the movie, because even though I was enormously unimpressed with the original film, there is no one that could play this character as well as Snipes does. There is also an interesting conflict introduced as Blade is forced to team up with the vampires, his mortal enemies who we are to assume could turn on him at any time, in order to fight the Reapers (by far the more dangerous enemy), who reproduce,' you might say, at an astonishing rate. <br/><br/>It's too bad, though, that the existence of the Reapers was introduced by vampires in a rather impressive although entirely unnecessary fight scene between a couple of vampires and Blade himself. Blade is attacked one night by two vampires wearing body suits (and some goggles that probably retain the coolest effect of the entire film), they fight violently for several minutes at full speed without rest, until one of them suddenly kneels before Blade and asks for a truce, informing him that there is now something on the streets that is even worse than him. If they were going to ask for a truce, you would think that they would approach him at least a little differently. One of these vampires (the better fighter, as it were) turns out to be Nyssa Damaskinos, a sexy brunette vampire who's lipstick was not smeared in the least even by all of those flying kicks that she took to the face from Blade about 15 feet in the air. Remarkable.<br/><br/>There seems to be a growing trend of having honest fight scenes replaced at an ever-increasing amount by special effects. Consider how vastly the role of special effects increased in Jet Li's fight scenes in Lethal Weapon 4 (relatively few special effects), Romeo Must Die (massive amounts of special effects), and The One (relatively few movements that were NOT special effects). This same trend is clearly influencing other films that are not made to be primarily fighting films, such as Blade and Blade II. The weapons that Blade carries around are still cool (think of them as a dark version of the toys that James Bond was sometimes given to take on his missions), and while the fight scenes in Blade and especially Blade II are undeniably thrilling and fun to watch, it's impossible to ignore the fact that most of what we are watching is computer generated. <br/><br/>As a whole, Blade II succeeds in reviving the story of Blade, which was not done justice by the original film. The Reapers were a much-needed and very impressive addition to the story, and the resulting conflict between the vampires and Blade himself as they are forced to take sides together provides such an interesting conflict that it almost overshadows the one created by the Reapers, who are by far the more dangerous villains. There is, of course, some stuff here that was thrown in without apparent reason and therefore without beneficial affect (such as the unnecessary, however impressive, fight scene between Blade and the two vampires early in the film), but as a whole the film rises high above its predecessor. The fact that the original film ends with Blade becoming a worldly vampire-hunter is mostly ignored in this film, although this one does end with a similar bit of comic relief and may even leave room for a second sequel. And as much as I disliked the original film, after watching Blade II I can't say that I would be too disappointed to see a Blade III come out in a few years."

I'm a projectionists at a theatre and some nights can be very long having nothing to do up in the booth and having to work till 2:30 am in the morning sometimes,<br/><br/>but this movie was excellent as far as a follow-up movies go, where most films fail like the dusk till dawn trilogy. Blade 2 had some awesome fighting sequences at the end unlike any i've seen, great special effects, and it's a damn good movie, i've watched it like 30 times and i never get tired of seeing it. you won't regret buying this film.   trust me, it's well worth it!"

"auberus","7","24","46","28 August 2002"," Now Blade has a Soul...
","Blade I was what I call a good rental for ""popcorn eater"": good action scenes, descent acting but nothing more. Blade II is what I call a true motion picture, a cinematic experience. How many sequels (in the horror genre) are better than the original movie? Moreover how many good comics adaptation do we know of? ""Few"" is the answer for both questions and Blade II might be among those ""few"". It is a multi-layers movie where the action/horror fanatic will have what they're looking for, a Vampire/Kung Fu flick (and that's fine) however those of us who are asking for more than just another Blade sequel might discover a very thought through movie blend in a myriad of details with extraordinary fight sequences (thanks to Donnie Yen) and a ""design"" feel to it. Obviously the main critic against Blade II is a very ""simplistic"" scenario when you know from the beginning what is going to happen: the story is about Blade (Wesley Snipes) who is half vampire, half human and refuses his vampire nature trying to fight the ""bloodlust"" he suffers. His hatred for the vampire and therefore half of himself is unlimited. In this sequel Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire nation in order to face an even greater enemy: the reapers who feed on vampires as well as on human (who are luckily to us close to Blade's heart). The scenario is simple but not simplistic and Guillermo del Toro ""tour de force"" is to give volume to this scenario by blending it in a very design atmosphere exploring the notion of ""Duality"". Blade's duality is obvious: he is fighting half of himself like a metaphoric evil within each and every one of us. The secret of his redemption does not lie in what he is but in what he does and what he feels. His quest for humanity ends at the same time as his hatred for the vampires but moreover for himself. On the opposite the reapers are bodies/corpses, their reasons for being are purely physical, basics (they live to feed) their appearance pushes the limits of horror (reaching the borders of gore) in order to demonstrate how unhuman they really are, in other words how ""Essence"" (where you come from) in that case human or vampire is not what matters. This gap between the beauty of Blade (Wesley Snipes) or Nyssa Damaskinos (Leonor Varela) and the reapers (Luke Goss etc...) emphasis the gab between ""Soul"" and ""Soulless"". Guillermo del Toro delivers his best movie (after Mimic in 1997). Unlike Mimic which was a well directed but average horror movie Blade II is an exceptional horror movie supported by terrific actors (Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlam etc...). Witnessing on screen the birth of a Soul is not a usual thing. Guillermo del Toro managed to do it in a paradoxical beautiful manner."

","Blade 2 is a awesome movie the whole series is awesome. Wesley Snipes is the only man to do the job of killing vampires. When it comes to kill the mutated creature that came from another vampire he is the man for the job. When he needs the blood he jumps in and starts kicking butt. I recommend that all people own this movie and watch it every day for the rest of their lives and live by it. It is the best movie of all time to where I would make it my last wish to see Wesley Snipes in full costume. There is a line between good movie and great movie and this movie was so great that I almost peed my pants. Then the third came out and then i nearly pooped my pants."
"HawkHerald","1","13","23","26 December 2009"," Where's the fun?
","This sequel is awful. It has a lame plot (the Reavers threat), a pathetic villain (Nomak), and a very awkward attempt at a romantic subplot with Blade and vampire princess Nyssa (Leonor Verala). Blade 2 lacks the energy and fun of the original film which may be in part due to the loss of original director Stephen Norrington and one of the more interesting characters from the first film, Dr. Karen Jensen (N'Bushe Wright). The direction of Guillermo del Toro, whose Hellboy films and Pan's Labyrinth were extremely enjoyable, is at best questionable including a questionable decision to transition from a live action fight scene to ridiculous looking CGI. Norman Reedus also stinks up the joint as Scud, who became Blade's mechanic/weapon designer during the time Whistler was a prisoner. It would have been a far more interesting film if the story had followed Blade on his mission to rescue his mentor."

","I am a fan of dark fantasy movies like Underworld.So,I took up on Blade as well.The first one was OK as well even though the visual effects were not so good but that is understandable considering when it was made.I was hoping for an improvement at the second film.<br/><br/>I didn't really see it.While the plot is very interesting especially in the beginning with the introduction of a new element,after a while the hype is gone.<br/><br/>There are many reasons behind that.First of all,there are a lot of unnecessary bad-ass wannabe moments when many characters try to act tough with no reason at all.Second of all,full of silly clichés.The vamp squad's members names were all typical,tough and mighty,trying so hard to create some kind of badassery but fails since they are so weak.Their cloths and weapons,ridiculous gigantic hammers etc....They are just not that great.They had a fierce appearance but had a weak result.And what about those supposedly explosive punch metal things that Blade had?No one exploded...big fuss for nothing.A vampire squad of the very elites and they had no equipment??And almost none of them could fight?They were dropping dead like flies..<br/><br/>Another thing that ruined it for me are the plot holes.In the first they appear with special outfits that protect them from light,but later on,when Blade suggests they fight the enemy in daylight,every seems confused,surprised and angry because they are saying they have no way to escape light.WHAT ON EARTH?Even in the previous movie,vamps could stand in daylight with mere sunscreen or wore black leather clothing and helmets.Yet in this one,sun light seems to burn even their clothes.No explanation of Damaskinus appearance.Why was he like that?Why did he look like he was sick?Why his blood was blackish?<br/><br/>Also,Whistler acts like he is in his home,not caring much about the movie or what happens.Blade's complete lack of any emotion,may seem cool in the beginning,after a while it gets tiring.Priest was bitten and he started transforming almost immediately and Nisa too.Lighthammer was cool for like a whole day.A plot hole to create an element of surprise or suspense?Big fail....<br/><br/>Nomak transformed anyone who bit him.In the end he was shown bitting numerous humans or vamps(whatever the guards were) but I suppose that doesn't help our story telling so we pretend it never happened,right?<br/><br/>What about Blade?He seems to be really affected by brute force,bullets and electricity but in the final battle he gets smashed upon walls and pillars and he acts like he's been touched by butterfly wings.His chest is getting cracked and he sits up a second later but then,he gets punched and seems to be suffering.WHAT???<br/><br/>Also,he is supposed to have all of a vampire's strengths but none of their weaknesses.So he is as strong and fast as any vampire...Then why any other vampire appears to be so weak when they come in comparison?There are may other plot holes and uncontinuities but I care not to list them all down.I believe all these are more than enough.<br/><br/>In the end,we have a nice villain,creepy and strong.A biological mystery and a lot of shooting and fighting in dark places.On the other hand we have plot holes,bad acting,silly clichés and childish battle choreographies.It gets a 5/10 barely..."
"m0rg16","4","6","10","22 April 2006"," It just sucks
","This sequel takes out everything that was good about the first film and adds in stuff that doesn't work at all. The marvelous action scenes are replaced by traditional Hollywood fights where you have no clue of what's going on and several times the director feels the need to use unrealistic CGI just to replace his actors. You can easily tell the difference between actors and the CGI versions of them, especially in this film. Trust me. Especially dumb is the scene in the beginning where Blade fights against another vampire, and it is shown from the side as if it was some kind of Mortal Kombat video game. You'll have to look hard for a dumber action scene, actually.<br/><br/>The Blade series is here turned into something much less mature and adult and into something that is even more dumbed down than the original (which was no Casablanca, but still good). Action at exactly every corner, lots of shooting and fighting and screaming. But no character. You don't really care for anyone in this film, not even Blade. Why is that? Because Blade is no longer the animal he was in the first film, he's much more refined here. He takes time to meditate, he actually lets a wounded vampire go and he does a lot of unnecessary sword moves for no other purpose than to get the audience to watch Wesley Snipes make his moves. In several scenes, Blade flashes his sword around despite being completely alone. Instead of cutting of a tube, he raises his sword and slashes in the air for five seconds before actually turning to cut the tube off. Why? It just looks dumb. Let's not forget the dumbed down rap music and hip characters they threw in. Compare the young and cool Scud to the old and weathered Whistler. Whistler kicks ass, whereas Scuds constant hip remarks are just annoying. Why didn't he die in scene one?<br/><br/>The visuals are very colorful. The colors are: Red and blue. That's it, you won't find any other colors here. It gets very tiresome after awhile, and the visuals are further damaged by the constant use of CGI even when it's not necessary! A lot of times CGI blood is added, or cgi characters. It just looks bad. Period.<br/><br/>Also, vampire lore is changed. The vampires no longer put up a fight at all, instead they die just by a single gunshot wound. In the original, Blade actually had some trouble beating a few vampires and was taken down by a few of them in some scenes! Here, they go down dime-a-dozen and one wonders why we have to go through two hours of Blade just kicking immense ass in action scenes that are rehashed over and over and over again. <br/><br/>Let's not forget the obvious plot holes and character mistakes. In one scene Whistler, an old vampire hunter, knocks out a vampire villain, grabs a sword and then... Takes off? Why the hell didn't he just turn that sword on the already knocked out vampire and save Blade some trouble? What kind of vampire hunter does NOT kill an evil vampire when he has him under his blade? Stuff like this is abundant all the way through, and makes you sit uneasy in your seat.<br/><br/>Also, the villain is nowhere near as characteristic or colorful as Deacon Frost in the original. It's just a bald headed, pale super vampire who can take out anyone except for Blade. We don't give a crap about the stupid sub plot they threw in about him, or any of the other stupid subplots.<br/><br/>Gah, it hurts my head just thinking about this mess. Avoid."
"Oreolove","3","6","10","15 September 2002"," Good thing this is a vampire movie... cuz it sucked!
","Ha ha ha! Little pun there. But that's the kind of corniness you get in this movie. Terrible plot and acting! It totally ruined the first Blade for me, which I thought was wonderful, esp. with Steven Dorff as the bad guy you love to hate. But all that was flushed when Snipes actually agreed to do this movie. I can't believe he didn't burn the script the minute he read it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>The absolute worst part was the fact that they brought Whistler back. I liked the fact that he was sort of a martyr in the first movie. Why couldn't they just let that be?<br/><br/>
The plot was so utterly confusing and unbelievable... and I'm talking in the vampire world. These things just can't happen. It ruins the entire legend behind the vampire. You can't just change it because you think it will add to your sorry plot! The plot takes so many twists and turns that you have no idea who's good or evil or who's good but pretending to be evil or visa versa. <br/><br/>The story begins when Blade must make a choice between taking sides with the enemy to destroy a new breed of killer that's feeding on vampires or just let them wipe out what's left of the vampire race. Well duh! Blade wants vampires dead, right? Why not let the monsters finish them off and then wipe them out? Seems easy enough in the daylight.<br/><br/>
*More Spoilers* The absolute worst scene appears when Blade gets into a pretty interesting fight with ninja-like vamps that are trying to stab him to death in his own hideout. But then they take off their ninja masks and... oops... we didn't want to kill you. We're just delivering a message. Well, then why didn't you say that to begin with!!! I'm sorry but stupid writing like this deserves to be criticized! <br/><br/>
Now onto bashing the acting. Where did they dig up the girl vamp? Is she the director's cousin or something, because there was little acting going on when she was on the set. I would like to applaud Kris Kristofferson for giving a decent performance given the circumstances. I'd also like to give Norman Reedus a pat on the back. I'm an avid fan of his and I have yet to see him do badly in a film, although I was a little upset with his final scene in the movie. Wesley Snipes had little acting to do. He was supposed to be emotionless anyway. But dear god, couldn't he have refused to do it until a better version of the sequel was written!? I liked the fight scenes, but the plot is more important. And it was sucked dry. Save this one for a day when you feel like watching a bomb. This one didn't even take 5 minutes for me to dislike. A **/10"

","All the dark atmosphere and stylish music, the way Blade was portrayed, the cool villain- in short all that was cool and fun in the first movie is sadly missing from this one. The lack of character-development and story is substituted with lots of unnecessary gore and continuous action (but none of the fight-scenes are anywhere near as good as in first one!!). What a waste of time and money.<br/><br/>All those positive reviews here can mean only two things: Either the makers of Blade II are abusing IMDB to promote this poor sequel, or after years of being fed mass-produced Hollywood-crap the majority of reviewers here have completely lost their sense of taste."

It's violent (very violent in fact)but the pace means you are on to the next bit of action before it all registers. Wesley Snipes is 'perfection' and whilst it was not as character driven as the first, it was fun throughout.  The fight sequences were well choreographed and it was a breathtaking display of skills and martial arts. The 'traitor' was totally unexpected and added an edge to the film.  I can't wait for 'Blade 3'!  Bring on the vampires. P.S. Luke Goss doesn't sing!"
"alindsay-al","6","8","15","11 September 2014"," Its okay but not as good as the original Blade
","I believe the original Blade is a highly underrated comic book film that is great but this film is okay and fails to live up to the level of the original. This film sees Blade ally with a group of Vampires to go against a new vampire hunting race that could affect vampires and humans alike. Wesley Snipes is fantastic as Blade and I really believe that he was the perfect casting for the mix of charisma and sturdiness for the character. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag I don't understand why Whistler was in this film but I thought he was good in the film. I thought the person who was looking like he was having the most fun was Ron Perlman who was great in his villainous role with his chemistry with Blade being really good. Blade's love interest is poor and a waste of time for the story and the main villain is not memorable at all. The story is poor compared to the first one with the romance being lazy and most of the team are not developed at all and the unnecessary bringing back of Whistler. The script is okay with Snipes and Perlman having the best lines and delivering well but nobody else had any decent lines at all. The style was great with the Gothic take of vampire lifestyle mixing with real life that makes this character so unique. Blade 2 is okay but it isn't as good as the original and I won't be rushing to see it again."
"ARTaylor","7","4","6","25 May 2011"," Good but not Special
","I didn't care for this one. Maybe because I heard so many people say it was better than the first that I got my expectations up too high. I didn't find the characters all that compelling or the universe all that intriguing this time around. The villain certainly wasn't as interesting as Deacon Frost. It didn't seem like Blade had any substantial subplots to keep us interested in him. <br/><br/>I hated that they brought back Whistler after his terrific sacrifice scene in the first film. Perhaps if the first had set up his return, but as it is it's just sloppy continuity. <br/><br/>The action and style of the movie are great. But they would be out-shined by Del Toro's Hellboy movies. It worked, but it wasn't as fresh as it was when the first movie came out. At the very least, the CGI looked finished this time around. <br/><br/>The movie is okay, but it doesn't really do much to stand out on its own. The character was already introduced, the story was nothing special, and the fights were nothing that The Matrix didn't already popularize."

Everything is wrong with this sequel to the enjoyable BLADE, and its faults are typical of what's wrong with a large number of modern ""horror films"": all action and assaulting sfx and practically nothing else. I'm generally not a fan of CGI, but the computer graphic effects here are exceptionally amateurish and fake-looking. The characters on screen fight each other and leap about, looking as fake as those unreal computer game people the kids love to play with. In fact, when I saw this pathetic excuse for a movie in the theater I was so insulted that in my frustration I uncharacteristically leapt up for a few seconds for all to see, angrily pretending that I was manipulating Nintendo joysticks in some silly video game. My wife was embarrassed by this, as it's something I'd never do in the middle of a movie. I sat down quickly, but she wasn't nearly as red-faced by my behavior as I felt while watching this garbage. It's also a dark and dingy experience, very long, and all of its characters are equally uninteresting. Boring as hell in spite of all the mindless action bombarding you at every angle.

","You can't SPOIL anything that is already rotten.  This movie is blindingly stupid, inane, and disgusting. Yes, it's got shock appeal for those who like gore.  But now that we've seen people French kissing with razor blades in their mouths, people slicing each other open to expose muscle tissue and spinal columns, Hollywood has done nothing more than animate what those in my generation saw growing up in ""Tales from the Crypt"" comic books (now there's a misnomer!).<br/><br/>The kung fu sequences in this film are predictable, repetitive, and the computerized elements are glaringly apparent in the DVD version.  And when one hackneyed story element is enough, they throw in a slow-mo rap sequence, as if to make everything okay.<br/><br/>The story that amounts to about two pages of dialog is mildly interesting at first, but one quickly loses interest, just as the filmmakers show they were disinterested in the plot and devote most of their time on the blood, gore, and fight scenes (YAWN!).<br/><br/>Scarey?  NAH!  The modern re-make of ""Nosferatu"" is better, even down to the makeup.  Hey, Hollywood, more guts doesn't make anything scarier. Hitchcock knew that (unfortunately he was wrong on the technicolor issue).  Movies like ""Psycho,"" ""The Innocents,"" ""The Others,"" ""Sixth Sense,"" show how to involve the audience in a story and thrill them at the same time."

","My word, I would say that there's a fair lot of delusion, difference in taste and occasionally outright insanity (One entitled ""The Caliban Institute""...) in these comments below...! A few I agree with, but not so many.<br/><br/>The imaginatively named ""Blade 2"" was certainly a slipshod film; a composite of 80 % violence, and 20 % very dull filler material. Plot horrendous, acting unable or unwilling to rise above the pyrotechnics; virtually all characters indistinguishable from one another... The only differences are the character-as-eye-candy prop (perhaps necessary in this visually repellent farrago of a film!) Nyssa; a few bizarre bits of late '80s British retro casting - Danny John Jules and a certain master Luke Goss - and neither chap is used at all interestingly. Plus, there is no sense of why Blade is any better than any of them, or more interesting. He is merely one monotonous thug among many.<br/><br/>Don't expect any hint of realism, despite the massive excess of violence... Few if any of the main characters seem the worse for wear despite however many times they are summarily butchered and seemingly dispatched. None of this is explained at all. I hear some sorts saying ""It's escapism! Get with the game, Tomster!""... some escapism I say; I don't want to escape to a frankly dull world with practically nothing but violence without context, meaning or end. How could they have made it worse...? Perhaps a ludicrous, unsubstantiated ""romance"" slotted in there? Ring any bells, folks? ;-)<br/><br/>Of course, if you enjoy big screen depictions of violence and gore for the sake of it - even ones that aren't that well done - you may just enjoy this. If you have a predilection for nauseating images, you are as they say, quids in. But don't you tell me this is a good film. It is an awful, decidedly ugly one, that fails on all counts."

While it's certainly along the same lines, this sequel seems so targeted at pleasing a (pre)pubescent crowd that only cares about gore and eye candy that it actually becomes painful to watch to anybody who doesn't fit that demographic.<br/><br/>The main idea behind ""Blade II"" seems to have been to make everything as ""cool"" as possible. Apparently, this boils down to Wesley Snipes killing scores and scores of vampires without the slightest bit of trouble. Snipes is so completely invulnerable and the action is so completely over the top that the action alternates between mind-numbingly boring and unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>But at least it looks good, right? Well, not really. The movie clearly suffers from an overuse of CGI, and most of it isn't terribly convincing. Some shots are so fake they even make you laugh out loud. Just about the only thing they did do right was the gore: the are massive amounts of it and it looks truly gross for the most part.<br/><br/>Well, maybe the story can save it then? Wrong again. ""Blade 2"" about the most by-the-numbers script you can get stuck with. There are a couple of twists, but you can see them coming from a mile away. The characters are as one-dimensional as they get, the plot is very basic yet makes little sense (Blade is such a super person that he can easily wipe out both old and new vampires, so why team up with the old ones?), and the dialog is full of tired and unfunny one-liners that leave no opportunity unused to show us once again how supposedly cool Blade is.

The musical score immediately made me associate to XBOX games like Splinter Cell, and the feeling of the movie was just the same. Exagerrated special effects, high-tempo hand-to-hand combat and all that jazz. Impressive? Nope. The computer effects might have been fancy looking for some, but to me they just looked silly. Too many computer-animated scenes. And the fights? My god, talk about overkill. Sure, fighting scenes can be really entertaining from time to time, but in this movie.. my God, they were so over-elaborated that they simply stunk.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is no great actor, and he knows it.

","""Blade II"" is by far the best in the trilogy. With loads of non-stop great action, and an awesome supporting cast, ""Blade II"" quickly became one of my favorite action films of all time. I can watch it over and over and over and never get sick of it. Wesley Snipes is even better than he was in the first film, and Norman Reedus (The Boondock Saints) does a great job as Blade's sidekick. The movie is about a new breed of monsters, who feed on vampires instead of humans. The vampire community who fear for their own lives team up with Blade to take on these new baddies. The vampire team may be one of the coolest groups ever. Led by Ron Pearlman, you also have Matt Schulze, Donnie Yen, and Tony Curran to name a few in the ""Blood Pack"". There is so much action it is hard to even pick a favorite moment. If you liked the first movie you'll love this one. If you like vampire movies, or action packed movies you'll love this one too. This is definitely better than you average action/horror film. I didn't expect it to be even better than the first Blade but it was much more. It has a good story with a new twist instead of your average vampire thriller. There are even quite a few good plot twist that I wasn't expecting in the movie either. With all the great action it is easy to overlook the story and acting, but I thought each character did a great job with their roles and there was a lot of good dialogue.

This was a full 360 degree shot around a body being encased in flames, and then turing into hardened ashes of a skeleton gently glowing with embers.

The middle section in particular was just plain boring.<br/><br/>Like the reason people loved the martial arts in say, Crouching Tiger., was cause you could SEE what was going on.  Blade 2 is full of stupid jump cuts and post-Matrix slow motion, so you end up not having a clue what's going on.<br/><br/>And I hate the way in films like this when the good guys have to team up with the bad guys, the bad guys suddenly stop doing whatever it was that made them bad in the first place.  I mean the 'Bloodpack', did they even bite anyone at all? No sir. They just beat people up all the time - totally at odds with all the other vampires in this film. They're supposed to be VAMPIRES, yet they don't come across like that at all.  They didn't even have pointy teeth half the time.  They were like some half arsed 'Dirty Dozen' or worse still the outlaws from Alien Resurrection - the tough one, the mouthy one, the girl, the leader etc - all bickering and posturing with the 'good guy' (Blade).<br/><br/>Then they went down in the sewers with their special armour on and it all got a bit too 'Aliens' for me.

So lets expose something of the movie-making frailty that Blade 2 embodies....<br/><br/>Pretty much any scene, by itself captures something of the essence of the first film (and tortures it). No, thats harsh. The scenes individually are okay. Some pretty spectacular fight-scenes, well choreographed and generally well conceived. The trouble comes when one tries to view the film as a continuous narrative. It's as if the film was written by about 7 different script-writers, kept in separate rooms, and not allowed to communicate with each other.<br/><br/>Plot-developments and devices used in one scene, are not carried over to the next, exposing poor continuity and one begins to see the movie for what it actually is: A series of disconnected fight scenes which begin to look more and more like a particularly violent hour on MTV.<br/><br/>The film has one redeeming feature which I was quite surprised to discover: Luke Goss played his part superbly, stealing each scene, and making Blade look like a lunk. Which is essentially what he is. (I'm looking forward to seeing what Luke does next....)<br/><br/>All in all Blade 2 is another classic example of lowest-common denominator movie-making.

Thus, an uneasy alliance is formed between Blade and the Vampire legion to combat this growing epidemic.<br/><br/>Action fans who like their violence bloody with plenty of martial arts and gunfights will probably be pleased.  The movie aims to deliver more crowdpleasing battles than its predecessor and in terms of quantity, it certainly succeeds.  Quality is another story.  While a few of the fights are reasonably exciting (particularly the sewer battle and mano-a-mano showdown), some of it is cringe-inducing because the filmmakers actually employ unconvincing CGI stunts and wrestling moves.  The movie's final half-hour manages to take the ludicrousness of the premise and double it with inane plot twists that are obviously only there to give the movie a semblance of a story."

","Recently I just went to the movies to see Blade 2. Actually it wasn't my idea to see this movie, it was my friend's idea. Personally I wouldn't have even wanted to see this movie because I figured it would be boring and stupid, and it was! All the way through this movie, I was so bored and I couldn't wait to leave the theater! They call this a horror film, well it was the most dull, boring, pointless, and stupid horror movie I have ever seen. And truthfully, I am a huge fan of horror flicks. I've seen almost every horror flick out there and nothing matches up to the horror flicks from the 1970's and the 1980's, in my opinion anyway. I saw the original Blade movie, and I can't remember what it was like. It couldn't have been this awful though. Blade 2 is just a pile of junk and there's nothing, and I mean nothing at all scary about this film. It's just a movie with a very shallow plot. There's no good killing scenes, or no good scenes at all for that matter!!! Extremely, extremely, extremely dull, lame and boring movie!!! Save your money, don't rent or go see this. Stay home or elce watch something worth your time and money. Rating: 1/10"

","Blade 2 is yet another Hollywood action-packed sequel that manages to both insult your intelligence and bore you to death at the same time. The good thing about Blade 2 is that it's not like other sequels made for money, it's actually not worse than its predecessor. It's just as bad. Realising that the movie doesn't quite try to depict reality in any way, it does have some insulting moments to the average human being that passed Physics class in high school. We are treated to several scenes that surely will go to the hall of fame of insulting science as we know it. As an example for the readers that haven't seen the film, in one particular shot the hero decides that the best way to deal with a horde of foes is to blow up an UV bomb. Unaware that such UV radiation would be deadly for any human being - I'm also aware that he's supposed to be half-human half-vampire but if the UV radiation doesn't affect him the same way it does the vampires then it must affect him like it does to humans! -, whoever decided this scene should be in this film also decides that UV radiation should travel in a purely fabricated way through tunnels and also that it wouldn't travel in water. Of course, one nonsense is not enough, and we're also treated to a couple of vampires spotting the light and managing to avoid being hit by the UV radiation by going underwater. Be aware that light travels at approximately three hundred thousand kilometres per second. Maybe it's the made-up material ""nitro-vacuum"", whose name doesn't even make sense. Blade 2 is cinematic disaster, a film to avoid at all costs. Watch it only if you manage to shut your brain off during the whole duration of the movie."

","Blade 2 takes what made the first Blade film good and transforms it into a different film with different characters (outside of Blade and Whistler) and a possibly deeper feel, and it works without great! This is how sequels should be made.<br/><br/>This time, the vampires Blade has been hunting down for so many years want to make a truce so that they can recruit him to help them kill a new breed of monsters called reapers, which if you want a brief description are creatures that look like half vampires half zombies and half, whatever, with a chin that opens up wide.<br/><br/>Blade reluctantly agrees, knowing full well that the vampires could turn on him and Whistler if things go wrong.<br/><br/>Overall, Blade 2,is a great film for fans of Action movies, comic movies or the first one.

Visual style is just a bit more comic-ish than the original movie, and both worked in their own way. The plot is again a great fit for a Blade movie and delivers enough decent twists and turns to make the movie more than just hack and slash.<br/><br/>Fightins scenes and choreographies are once again a success. Speed is fast enough to make you realize that the protagonists are supernatural, but not too fast to make you lose sense of what is going on. Wesley Snipes proves that he is perfect for the role and you can sense that he enjoys it.<br/><br/>The main villain, Nomak, does not manage to raise to the level of entertainment provided by Deacon Frost but still poses a real threat and generates thrill whenever he is on screen. And the final fight counts as one of the best fight scenes ever filmed that I can remember of.<br/><br/>On the negative side, I disliked the scene where the blood pack enters Blade's base. As Blade did not know who they where, it made no sense that he did not dispatch them, unless they could match his fighting skills, which would make no sense either. Long, useless and dumb fight.<br/><br/>Also, as this is a Del Toro movie, you can expect a bit more horror than in a standard comic movie. And being no big fan of horror movies, I can say that the horror touches added here and there are very well measured and I thought that they fitted perfectly in. The few jokes here and there were also a nice addition as there were not too many and those present were good. Great directing job."

","Blade 1 is a fantastic film for the action/vampire genre. This followup will certainly please fans of either the comic or the movie.<br/><br/>Firstly I very much love the premise of this film. The vampires actually seek Blade out to help them kill a super-vampire by the name of Nomak who has no weaknesses except sunlight. I also like the relationship Blade had with Nyssa. It very much establishes Blade as a deeper character than previously thought. Especially when he chooses to kill Nomak when as said ""they want the same thing."" I also love Wesley Snipes as Blade and even Luke Goss plays a good Nomak.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are very entertaining...when they aren't Computer Generated. The actual real people fighting was entertaining to watch, the CG in this film is definitely a down-point because its way too obvious. Those scenes have not aged well.<br/><br/>Overall this is an entertaining followup to Blade, obviously its not better and its not on the same level but does that really matter? Its still good. 8/10"

If the scripters tried to be original, they didn't succeed... how many times has ""a virus"" been involved in disaster movies and such?

"fitzebwoy","4","4","8","7 February 2003"," Disapointing sequel to an Amazing original.
","READ ONLY IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM. MINOR SPOILERS. For all the things that the film-makers got right on Blade 2 it does sadly fall short of hitting the mark. The amazing visuals and sound (I watched this for the first time on DVD with a DTS soundtrack) are a credit to those who put them together, especially some of the CGI assisted fight scenes.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the lack of thought put into the story. Supposedly the new 'Reapers' are very deadly and Blade and the team discover that they can be destroyed by UV light. As the first film had large UV torches you would expect the same or even bigger one's as this is the only weakness?? No. The team choose to have the smallest UV lamps avaliable! Maybe they wanted a challenge! There are so many plot holes it's unbeliveable. Two big ones are how one of the vampires managed to get bitten by a reaper but not change for over 6 hours and that the Vampire family are very confident that Jared/The Reaper won't be able to find them when they are at home. Surely he would know where they are as he was one of the family and used to live there.<br/><br/>It seems that a structured plot has been put second to a visual treat. And a visual treat it is. One note for the fight scenes: It rather clear that Snipes isn't the fastest fighter on his feet when they have wide shots of him fighting the masked vampires who deliver him a message. Knowing this fact, why did they make him move very fast during the CGI parts? It goves away what's real and what isn't. Either slow down the CGI or teach Snipes to dance faster<br/><br/>Overall: Not awful but seems dumbed down too much"

"zetes","5","4","8","27 March 2002"," Big, dumb, and forgettable
","Blade II isn't terrible. I, in fact, like it a smidgen better than the original. That film suffered from a very uninteresting love interest (who doesn't come back) and a dull villain. It had its moments, though, and so does Blade II. The visuals in both films are excellent, with a marvelous eye towards the set designs and costumes. II contains more computer animation, with several scenes using far too much computer animation. It tries to hide that a few times by setting the sequences in the dark or whatever, but you'd have to be mentally challenged not to notice. Because of this, its action sequences don't carry as much weight or energy. It steals liberally from The Matrix and, even moreso, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's slightly better than The Matrix, pretention incarnate, but can't come close to the physical beauty of CTHD, whose action sequences did not rely on computers.<br/><br/>Blade II steals its plot wholesale from Aliens, which is a common action film to steal from (it's probably the best ever made at this point, over 15 years old now). The villains are pretty cool, but they're a direct combination of Max Schreck (of Nosferatu fame) and the aliens from Aliens. They're still pretty brutal. A lot of the supporting cast is simply terrible. The film employs a ton of uber-predictable twists and betrayals. You'll see some of them coming and you'll wonder why the writers even bothered with others. 5/10."
"nikolasbelmont","10","5","11","15 August 2004"," Topnotch action, great entertainment.
","I would like to express my bewilderment towards people who do not enjoy, or even like, the action genre, yet choose to see these movies just so they can criticize them for their shallow plot lines and general brainlessness. Moreover, it greatly annoys and perplexes me that these people then use their ""expertise"" to rate these movies poorly, and thus enforce the impression that we are, in fact, dealing with a lousy piece of movie-making, when the actual truth is that these people prefer films of completely different genres. <br/><br/>It should be a no-brainer that if the only movies you can appreciate fall into the category of films such as ""Vertigo"", ""Citizen Kane"" and the like, you're not going to have fun watching ""Blade II"". But then, you should know that, and not spend your hard-earned money on simple entertainment such as this! When one rates films such as ""Blade"", ""Blade II"", ""Van Helsing"", ""Bloodsport"", ""Kickboxer"" etc., one should consider how they perform in their own respective subcategory, that is, entertainment! It is neither appropriate nor is it productive to place these films on the same line with ""artistic movies"" because they simply weren't made to serve the same purpose; when one watches ""Yojimbo"", Kurosawa's masterpiece, for example, one needs to concentrate on the film fully to truly experience it. This rule does not apply to pure entertainment, because the general idea is that one can check one's brain at the counter and simply enjoy the ride; I can think of few pieces of work that provide the setting for action as efficiently as the presentation of Blade II does. After this, a rather lengthy (but desperately necessary) foreword, I will now look at this film and consider its merits against other movies in this subcategory of films called ""action/entertainment"". <br/><br/>In ""Blade 2"" the protagonist, Blade (Wesley Snipes), finds himself up against a new, deadly adversary and, needless to say, there's a lot of topnotch action in store for the entertainment-junkie. In terms of the visual style of the film, ""Blade 2"" fares even better than its predecessor; with its dark and stylistic presentation, this movie certainly is a treat for the eyes. In fact, it is hard to come up with any flaws as far as the presentation goes, because audiovisually this film is brilliant! Wesley's performance, can be summarized into one word; bravo! - he manages to be even more convincing with his one-liners than he was in the first movie, and certainly delivers in the action department as well! <br/><br/>All in all, well worth your time and your money...that is, if you enjoy action films!!<br/><br/>-Nikolas Belmont"
"ScarTrek","10","5","11","14 April 2004"," A live-action comic book
","Of all the DVDs in my collection, there is only a very small handfull that I've watched more often than Blade II. I can explain my love of the movie very simply. It's a huge, over-the-top, indulgent, immature comic-book/cartoon brought into live action, packed onto a rollercoaster that careens along wildly from start to finish.<br/><br/>What a ride.<br/><br/>The action is the first thing anyone will notice. Mainly because once it starts, it pretty much doesn't stop. Everything is slightly exaggerated, everyone pulls off moves that should be impossible. But the cast pull it off with such style, that you barely need to suspend your disbelief. Snipes is excellent as a physical actor, Perlman has a classy Lee Marvin style to him. Goss, who I'll forever remember as a ""teen heartthrob"" back when I was a kid, surprised the hell out of me with some extremely competent fighting. His brutal, straight-to-the-point streetfighting style impresses, turning the UK's version of Justin Timberlake of the early 90's into one of the most physically threatening antagonists I've seen in the past decade of movies. Even Kris Kristofferson gives someone a good head-stomping. If you're worried this will consist of a couple of vampires standing 10 feet apart and firing at each other, a la Underworld, have no fear. This is far more ferocious and much more entertaining.<br/><br/>The special effects are integral to this. For the most part, they hold up. The action looks stylized and unique, not only due to the massive mix of unconventional styles used (listen to Snipes' commentary on the DVD as he reels out a list of 9 or 10 styles he uses in a single fight sequence as they happen), but also due to the ""L-Cam"", which lets the camera woosh around the battleground in a way never before seen (but seen since in Spider-Man, the effect used to follow his webswinging through the streets). The CGI holds up for the most part. In combat, it enables the crazy cartoony action del Toro was looking for, and it really works. It's not QUITE over the top, but pushes it. Monster effects are top-notch though. The Reapers in particular were enough to unsettle even me, a hardened veteran of the worst Video Nasties the 70's had to offer. Many subtle uses of CGI are dotted throughout, and the movie makes no attempt to showcase them, which makes them very effective. There's only one real duff moment, which is a fight scene taking place in front of a wall of lights, a horrible decision, as lighting is one of the main reasons CGI often looks unrealistic.<br/><br/>But it's not all fighting. There's a nice dollop of humour, which director Guillermo del Toro understood perfectly, and Snipes pulled off without a hitch. The characters in this movie are ""cool"", they're calm, collected, never have a hair out of place. So when they throw out a witty one-liner at the most unexpected of moments, it plays off the ""straight guys"" perfectly. Yet this doesn't undercut the drama. Admittedly, it's due to the physical nature of most of the drama, but that's a matter of semantics. It doesn't change the fact that the undercurrent of humour fails to lessen the severity of the situation, or three brilliant, emotional deaths (including what is presently my favourite villain death ever).<br/><br/>The plot is nice and tight, for the most part. There are definately moments where the more observant will stop to wonder, but there's no time for that, the movie just moves too fast. And that's perhaps the one thing that will turn many people off this movie. If you don't like action, and you don't like fast-paced movies, you'll be in a nightmare of rushed-over plot points and blurred secondary characters whizzing by in the background. For people who just want some fun though, who cares about the backstory of a character who accomplishes little and dies after 30 minutes of screentime? Many characters are there solely to die and further the plot. You don't notice, the rest of the characters are too damned cool to take your eyes off of.<br/><br/>Unless you like your movies grounded firmly in reality (if you thought The Matrix was a bunch of sillyness, stay away), or hate action movies in general, hunt this one down. I'd strongly recommend picking it up on DVD in fact, as the two audio commentary tracks are both utterly hilarious, yet highly informative at the same time, a rare thing."

Quite simply the worst movie I have EVER seen, and that's saying something.

Just ridiculous, and you will be dying for it to be over 15 minutes after sitting down. My friends warned me and you are now forewarned. But, if you like your action sped up 2-3x to where it's nothing but a constant blur then you may enjoy this pig. They couldnt even get the Krispy Kreme doughnut scene right.

"theroscoevine","3","2","3","4 October 2018"," It's ok, I guess, if you like dumb action....
","No style to this one. The first movie had real visual flair, creative camera work, lots of cool, stylized shots. This movie had none of that. It's full of crappy CGI, really noticeable in several scenes, including the introductory fight between Blade and Nyssa, in front of the hot lights, which I think must have been used as an attempt to mask the cgi, but failed, as Nyssa's acrobatics are clearly artificial and cartoony, and the movie really overplayed the vampires death bit, where they burn up, right from the first scene of this movie. That concept, introduced in the first movie, was used fairly artfully, until Blade II. 
The inclusion of the thought-dead Whistler, reprised by Kris Kristofferson, was ponderous at best. I guess they just thought this movie need ""grizzled, old, angry man"", and it was worth subverting the most emotional sequence of the first movie get it. 
I will admit that I didn't hate this movie as much as when I saw it in the theater, (I write this on 10/3/18, right after watching it for only the second time), but it's still not good. 
It's hard to say what makes a movie bad, but they really nailed it with this one. It's a bad sequel and it's unfortunate for many reasons, including the fact that it was directed by Del Toro, who I admire. This is not some of his better work, though I have enjoyed several of his movies. It's also irksome to me that Snipes considers this his favorite Blade movie. WTF?

It is unfortunate to note that action films such as ""Blade 2"" must rely on nothing but action to obtain praise from critics and viewers.<br/><br/>Along with Kris Kristofferson, Leonor Varela and Ron Perlman, Wesley Snipes attempts to re-create the magic and success that original ""Blade"" brought to the audiences two years ago.

No character development, slim plot and no sense of teamwork to create the same magic as the original ""Blade"" had.<br/><br/>I found myself in disbelief as it became obvious to me that ""Blade 2"" would have no story. I have come to the conclusion that most action films fail due to the lack of story and rely on the action and assume that everyone will overlook this fact. ""Blade 2"" reminded me of another action sequel that failed miserably called ""Speed 2: Cruise Control."" Unlike ""Blade 2,"" I found ""Speed 2"" to be much more interesting because it had a decent storyline.<br/><br/>Snipes is a tremendously successful action superstar and talented dramatic actor, whose selected filmography includes ""New Jack City,"" ""The Waterdance,"" ""Rising Sun"" and ""Demolition Man."" Though Snipes has proven he has the talent to turn great performances, but it is unfortunate that the film relies on his expertise as a martial artist throughout the film rather than his acting talent as he reprises his role as Blade. Snipes is too good to be on the awful end of a film; my only wish is that he get his stroke back soon.<br/><br/>Kristofferson has proven with his role as Whistler that he is still a force to be reckoned with because he continues to add credibility to each film he stars in. Along with Snipes, Kristofferson made the wrong decision when he reprised his role because it wasted his talent.<br/><br/>Varela and Perlman are nice additions and they add as much as they can; however, the problem with them is their roles can be played by anyone.<br/><br/>Snipes, who also co-produced ""Blade 2"" missed the opportunity to make a great sequel to an awesome film. ""Blade 2"" did live up to the hype that it is a great action film, but that's all it had because it lacked everything else. My advice for ""Blade"" fans is save money and watch the original."

","I don't know how it happened, but this just let me down.  Sure, I liked the first movie, I like Guillermo del Toro, and I like Bradstreet's design work. Heck, I even like the soundtrack, but the movie just wasn't any fun for me.<br/><br/>First off, del Toro directs it like a horror movie, which would be fine if the script was strong enough to hold it together.  The problem is that the script is made for a dim-witted action movie, like the original.  A picture like this shouldn't take itself as seriously as del Toro's dark and heavy visuals.  The whole thing just winds up looking ridiculous.<br/><br/>Then there were the action sequences.  They just didn't have the violent frenzy of the first movie, and that thing with the CGI people just reminded me of Deep Blue Sea.  What really bothered me was that Snipes never went all-out with the sword.  My favorite part of Blade was the big swordfight at the end, but there wasn't anything at that level in this one.<br/><br/>The plot-holes were a bit of a distraction.  Normally, I can accept a few and be okay with it, but this was bad.  Whistler came back with an explanation that... well, there wasn't one.  **** MILD SPOILERS **** How did he come back?  Well, he was a vampire.  Then Blade gave him a drug that made vampires explode in the first movie.  The result:  it turned him back into a normal person.  Okay.  And why did the vampires stop wearing the UV-proof suits that they had on when they met up with Blade?  And if the explosive Blade stuck in that guy's head was so darned useful, why didn't he use it to take out the one who was an actual threat instead of waiting for Scud to pick it up?  **** END SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>I did like a few things about the movie.  The gore was okay, the villain was impressive, and it was interesting to see the cat from Red Dwarf playing a vampire.  Still, all together, it was a disappointment."

","In Blade II Whistler returns,that was a BIG plus. It also has good continuation from part 1. 1 gripe some fans have is the CGI fights. I didn't like them but they weren't so bad that they ruined the entire movie.<br/><br/>Guellermo del Toro's directing in this was like Tim Burtons directing in the Batman movies: He's so good at making a villain so ruthless yet you can feel sorry for the villain too.<br/><br/>Unlike Blade Trinity, Blade II has so many characters yet still manages to focus on Blade. Ron Perlman did a great job also.(real treat for Hellboy fans) This sequel has Blade teaming with the Bloodpack that trained 2 years to hunt him, so they can get rid of new vampires called Reapers. Scary thing is Reapers are far superior to regular Vampires. <br/><br/>The final fight between Blade & Nomak was surprising and was pulled off really well. Whats really interesting is that throughout the movie its hard to tell whos on whos side. <br/><br/>In conclusion: twist, lots of action/little drama, great acting, superb cast, awesome director makes for one of best action movies ever. Its a shame Del Toro couldn't direct Blade trinity,(he was making Hellboy at the time)"
"Kurt-15","3","4","9","23 March 2002"," By the numbers sequel with few surprises and big plotholes
","Where ""Blade"" successfully pulled the viewer into a very sensual vampire underworld, and maintained that suspension when the film took a super-supernatural turn, ""Blade II"" alienates & insults the viewer with too many Hollywood cliches.  The film's ""surprise"" is too much like the original, combined with the hokey antics of the ""Towelly"" episode of South Park.<br/><br/>Tim Burton turned a few city blocks into Gotham City for ""Batman"", Del Toro struggles with constructing an ethos for the film with the entire city of Prague at his disposal.  Del Toro attempted to ""scare"" the audience, but the attempts are laughable, at best.  The elements, apparently designed to scare, are cliche Hollywood slasher.<br/><br/>Worse yet, is the hokey ""team"" that partners with Blade.  For the purposes of this review, let's call them ""Fox Force Five"".  The team members looked more like potential action figures than believable flesh & blood characters. For that matter, all the characters in this film remain static.  The first film introduced the viewer to the seedy underworld of vampires, this film is like a documentary of it.  All the scenes of vampire culture are shot from a distinct, third person pov.  This further disconnects the viewer.<br/><br/>
The ""love story"" angle is poorly underdeveloped here, especially viewed in comparison with the first film's Oedipal overtures.  Blade's love interest is underdeveloped, and while the actress is stunning, the character falls flat.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film, of course, is the creation of the ""Vampire Nation"".  In the first film, vampires existed, and helped operate things from behind the scenes.  In this film, the over the top protrayal of them is just too much - vampires have corporate offices now.<br/><br/>Of course, action is the name of the game - but with all the nonsense heeped onto this weak story, there's not much room for it.  The first film's groundbreaking martial arts - backed up by excellent physical acting by Snipes, are sadly mediocre in this film.  The set design for these fights are standard fare - the catwalk, the church, the underground tunnel, etc.<br/><br/>
In all, a dissappointing sequel that has little of the energy, style, or sensibilities of the first film."

","Recruited by his vampire prey to help them out in a deadly struggle they've been recently engaged in, Blade finds that his new employers have a far more sinister agenda in play than previously told and must battle his way through this new threat.<br/><br/>This was quite the enjoyable and highly entertaining sequel. What really gives this one some great parts here is the addition of a fun new breed of vampires found here, not only finding a great way of introducing the creatures logically from the storyline as the explanation of them being a viral mutation offspring of vampires is given a truly great touch but also managing to put their physical changes here to good use as they're really freaky looking and gets a lot from these advanced forms. That is mainly due to how it fixes one of the major problems with the original in a far more even pace this time around, by appearing more as an Action film than a true Horror film and generating action pretty much more nonstop fighting the creatures. From the teams' first encounter in the underground dance hall where the individual members have encounters of their own in the kitchen or up in the guest-rooms before the frantic, frenzied battle on the dance-floor where the team is able to overpower several of the creatures in brutal, utterly bloody battles before finally getting the upper-hand and dealing with the strays left behind which provides the further fun of the autopsy sequence where they finally learn about the creatures. Furthering that, the sewer battles are even better as there's the tense suspense of the darkened locations providing a creepy setting while there's a lot to like as they swarm over the team requiring plenty of gun-fighting and weaponry that mixes in tons of gore with furious action scenes. That even leads into the other grand action scene here where there's the series of thrilling hand-to-hand battling and even firefight scenes that are just a blast. There's even a really great amount of prosthetics here to showcase the vampire's change in physical structure rather than opting to leave it strictly CG, which is a hugely appreciated feat and all together makes this good enough to hold out for the film's positives. The biggest problem here is the rather clueless and utterly inane series of twists, which make the last half-hour quite packed with story lines and exposition rather than action the way it had been from the start, especially with several of the characters' allegiances shifting for no real reason simply to make for a bigger impact and it falls apart somewhat. Along with some dodgy and lame CGI work here showing off their superhuman abilities during fights, these here are all that's really wrong here.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."

","There are no words to describe how horrible this movie is, I'm talking Batman and Robin level bad.  It tries to be hip and stylish, but its already dated. It tries to be macho and cool but it looks dumb. It tries to be ""Aliens"", but its monsters are nowhere near as scary (in fact, they look funny as hell trying to pop out of the water like they were in ""Aliens"" or when they run, they look like actors trying to run like otherworldly creatures...instead of actually looking like otherworldly creatures), and the team assembled is nowhere near as badass. I would recommend it only to twelve year old boys, or guys who are in the mood to watch a movie drunk and/or high, and don't care what's on the screen as long as *&$# blows up. David Goyer said he had no qualms about naming Blade Trinity despite the popularity of ""The Matrix"" (and its character ""Trinity"") because the sequels weren't any good. First off all they were flawed, but at least they're not on the level as this dreck. The action was better, more stylish , and those movies actually had something going on upstairs, working on multiple levels. These movie's had no one at home, they weren't playing with a full deck,etc...<br/><br/>Del Toro proudly claims to have an affinity for ""comic books"" but it just goes to show you that that in itself means jack*&$# unless you also, um , I dunno, happen to be talented.

"kayins","5","3","6","23 March 2002"," Great, if you like mindless action.
","Blade had a lot of wonderful action sequences.  The special effects and the creature effects were pretty spectacular except for in a couple of scenes. However, this is where the movie ends.  There's no real story line (very cliche) and the acting in this movie is an exception rather than the norm. You have no reason to empathize with Blade or the characters in the movie. You don't get to look into the psyche of the main character as you did with the original Blade.  Stephen Norrington (director of the Original Blade) painted a picture of a scarred and tragic hero battling the forces of evil in order to heal the ache in his soul for how life wronged him.  Blade II throws that out of the water and is a cheap thrill ride of non-stop action and horrific effects. While I found the action and creatures of the movie particularly pleasing with its graphic nature, I felt the sequel lost some of its maturity from the first film and is a disservice to the franchise. I appreciate it when directors treat comic book heroes as if they are real, with respect, and drama interlaced with action.  I think this is one of the elements that made X-Men so successful.  But I also think it's an element that made Unbreakable and the Original Blade not as successful as they could of been.  In this case, the film makers erred on the side of making money. So if you're coming to see a movie with great non-stop action and horror then you've come to the right movie.  But if you're looking for an intelligent script that pulls you into the world of the lead character, stick with the Original Blade."

","I saw this movie last sunday, 2 days after the premier, and is really stupid. I mean, I like the first movie, ""Blade"" have a lot of good fighting, good specials effects, it was fun and I know that the plot wasn't really elaborate, but it worked. Here the plot is so stupid you wont believe it. I don't understand why they have to bring back the character of Whistler, he was great on the first one, but in that movie he died, he commit suicide, leave it dead!!! And if they can bring a vampire back to normal, like they did with Whistler, why not do it with all the vampires????, why kill them???, this was a big plot hole. Scud was a great replacement for Whistler, why make him a traitor????, you really think that Blade is so stupid that is going to leave a traitor working for him for 2 years???, thats so dumb. I guy here said that they should use a big lamp to kill all the reapers in the tunnel, that was the most smart idea, why not do it?????, why use those stupid grenades, and if those grenades worked on reapers and vampires that means that Reinhardt and Nyssa must died too, not only get burned.<br/><br/>Another thing that in this movies wasn't fully use was the father-son thing between the really old vampire and the reaper leader, it was a good idea, but the totally blow it. The reapers make up and special effects where great they have a good point there, and the fight where cool too, but the movie sucks.<br/><br/>I'am a fun of Guillermo del Toro since ""Mimic"" and ""Devil's Backbone"", he is quite a good director, but here it looks like he get paid and he don't care. Some parts look like ""Nosferatus"" especially the reapers look, I think that that is the directors contributions to the film (If you watched ""Mimic"" you will know that he love ""Nosferatus"") but thats really it"
"alntv","5","3","6","26 March 2002"," Not as good as the first...
","I have to admit, after seeing ""Resident Evil"", I was really in the mood for even more action/horror, so I figured this would be the film to follow it up with. I really enjoyed the first Blade, and I kinda knew going in that this one would probably be a rehash of that film. And it was.<br/><br/>Not a lot of room to develop a serious plot, there is plenty of action and lots of loud music. Kind of like the first. Kris Kristofferson returns (unfortunately), a new ""female"" is added (thankfully), and this time Blade teams up with his enemies to battle an even badder baddie than NORMAL vampires. Unlike ""Resident Evil"", I did have a little higher expectations for this film. I really thought that maybe after the first film, they would lay off Blade's past and focus on just kicking ass. But we are once again forced to sit and watch Blade struggle with his past and who he is and can he fall in love...blah blah blah. Truthfully, I think the character of Blade is very cool! But, unlike Batman or Spiderman, he is NOT human and even if he could be, why wouldn't he, after 20 or 30 years, figure out that being Blade is not so bad! He's not a 100% vampire, so he gets to enjoy being out in the sun. He's not 100% human, so he gets to jump off buildings, leap off walls, and kick everyone's butt! I was really hoping that since Blade got to meet his mother in the first, he would have come to terms with who he is and move on. Oh well...<br/><br/>Anyway, on a positive note, the new vampires are very cool. I thought the new villain was more ""cartoony"" than the first film. Of course, he was also done up to look more like Nosferatu, so the costume and makeup were more scary than the actual villain. I did like the new ""love interest"" in this one a little bit more. Being a vampire, she could have been a little harder in places, but at least she had an understanding of Blade.<br/><br/>
One negative, the filmmakers create a team of vampires to work with Blade, and then they don't even let us get to know them! Unlike, say ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"", where you get to at least meet the team, thus allowing the viewer to at least care a little bit if they get eaten by the bad guy, they are so underdeveloped that, except for 2 characters, I could have cared less if they got what was coming to them. Too bad...cause they looked pretty cool!<br/><br/>This film is no where near as good as ""Resident Evil"". So if you have a choice, you now have my opinion. However, I do think that on some cold January afternoon, when there's nothing else to do but sit at home and watch a couple hours of television, watching both Blade movies one after the other will not be a waste of your time."

","Blade is back in this much gorier and CGI-ier sequel. It's more of the same garbage, but with a pinch of dog excrement added.<br/><br/>If the pansy vampires from the first weren't bad enough, we now have ""Reapers"", mutants who feed on blood suckers. And since this is H.P. Lovecra...uh, Guillermo Del Toro, it needs to be as disgusting as possible (at least he didn't include his fish fetish), with the reaper's jaws breaking open, revealing a leech-looking tongue.<br/><br/>The vampires seek out Blade to help them exterminate the Reapers. This time, Blade has a new, marijuana smoking sidekick, a resurrected Whistler and the ""Blood Pack (tm)"" to help him kill the new monsters in the goriest ways possible.<br/><br/>The whole movie is like a nightmare, and not in a good, classic horror movie way. It's hard to describe, but imagine if your uncle Larry decided to travel to hell and when he came back, he wanted to show you his vacation movie. Everyone is a foul-mouthed sadist in this movie. Everything looks and feels disgusting.<br/><br/>We're so lucky we even get to see our ""heroes"" dissect one of the ""Reapers"". Why? Because Troy McClur...sorry, Del Toro, wants to shove disgusting things in your face. If you watch the behind-the-scenes feature, it's revealed that they used sex toys and fake semen to make the Reaper's innards. That should tell you something about the quality of the movie. There's also a strange scene at a vampire night club, where a woman's back is cut open and the spine is exposed. What's the point?<br/><br/>The twist near the end, where Blade's new kid sidekick is revealed to be a traitor is so stupid and illogical I almost laugh when I think about it. Earlier in the movie, it's revealed that Blade saved the stoner from two vampire girls (yet another excuse to add vulgarity). He ""planned it all along"". Yeah, right. How does that even work? ""Plan A: Rip my intestines out of my body. Then, Blade will show up and save me. He'll probably kill you two, and I'll quite possibly die myself. Plan B: ...wait, there's no plan B? Who wrote this plan, David S. Goyer?""<br/><br/>The fight between Blade and the main reaper Nomak is like watching someone else play Mortal Kombat on Playstation 2. I'm don't expect realistic physics in a comic book movie, but at times Blade looks like he's a big-headed, rubber puppet bouncing on a string. When the movie finally ends (at a peep show, where else?), the words of the tragic villain Nomak echoes through my mind: ""it...it hurts no more!""<br/><br/>There's no beauty in Blade 2. There's no goodness or truth. I'm not sure if it deserves to be called a movie. It's a waste of time, money and film. Like its predecessor, it's just meaningless garbage. Save your time and watch/read something better.<br/><br/>(Del Toro ripped off his own movie in Hellboy. I'm talking about the sewer battle. How lazy!)"

","The first 'Blade' really helped to set the tone for the new era of comic book based films that we now enjoy by taking a serious approach to the material. Fanboy favorite Guillermo del Toro surprisingly takes 'Blade II' back to a pre-'Blade' 90s mentality, heaping on the cheese while at the same time lifting the over-stylized action of the first 'Matrix' film.<br/><br/>The entire film just looks cheap and amateur. More like a made for TV or direct to video production than a big budget feature film. It's poorly shot, badly staged and filled with cut-rate special F/X.<br/><br/>'Blade II'--never a great film to begin with--has aged very poorly."
"HighlanderArg","5","3","7","6 April 2005"," Mmmm... I think The Law Of The Sequels apply here...
","There's an unwritten Law Of The Sequels that goes (more or less) like this : ""Seldom shall a sequel be as good, let alone better, as the first film."" This has its exceptions (""Batman"", ""Superman), and tons of examples, such as ""Highlander"", ""Mortal Kombat""... and ""Blade"".<br/><br/>The movie takes up two years after the first film. It turns out that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) did not die when he shot himself, and Blade goes out to the rescue, in order to bring him back to humanity. However, the good old man is only a bait for some vampires to propose a truce to Blade. Why? they need him to bring down an evolved way of vampires that feeds on both humans and vampires.<br/><br/>I never actually read a single comic book of ""Blade"". Perhaps the movie goes strictly as the comic and I'm b******tting it, but not doing it consciously, I will continue. I like watching vampire movies, and the concept of an evolved vampire is interesting, but when the creature looks like the son of Nosferatu (the original 1929 film) and Predator, I'm disappointed. Even more when I see Blade uttering things like ""Oooh, how exciting"", or having a romantic interest.<br/><br/>The movie also features lots of martial arts, some done by Wesley Snipes, other by CGI, and other by a stunt surely. A good thing is the cameo Donnie Yen plays. Unfortunately, it's too short and he only kicks butts once. The rest of the cast has Ron Perlman (""Hellboy""), the above mentioned Kristofferson and Yen , and large load of people I don't know.<br/><br/>In short, it has martial arts, action, but the story (and some performances) is weak.

","If you're a fan of comic books or comic book movies, then please disregard my comments.  ""Blade 2"" is slick, flashy and well-made.  It's packed with action and most of it is well-choreographed.  But I just couldn't get into it.  I didn't find the plot all too appealing, the little plot there was. This is basically an action showcase.  The first minute you see Blade pop up on screen and beat the crap out of these ugly vamps, you wanna cheer.  But after a while, the action runs its course.  With a stronger script, I think this movie could've gone a lot farther.  The special f/x are elaborate, the soundtrack is way cool.  Aesthetically, Guilermo Del Toro did a fine job.<br/><br/>
I saw the original ""Blade"" and thought it was pretty good.  It could've been a lot better, but it was entertaining.  I loved the opening shot of the original, in the vampire club where the blood sprays from the ceiling. That was a beautiful scene in a demented, perverted sort of way.  But I had a hard time watching the sequel without my mind drifting off.  I love Wesley Snipes, and recently he hasn't been in too many movies.  So it was good to see him on screen again.  I really don't see too much of Kris Kristofferson, and as old as he is, he still maintains a cool presence.  If you do happen to rent or buy the DVD, please don't skip out on the commentary with Wesley Snipes and writer David Goyer.  Snipes has an incredibly good sense of humor.  It was almost like Snipes and Goyer were doing an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 2000.""  So instead of hearing pretentious comments about how great working with this person was and how great this scene was, they blurt out all sorts of hysterical things.  It's great to know that a fine actor can lay back, watch his own movie and simply have fun with it.<br/><br/>
I've grown desensitized to most graphic violence in films, but even for vampire movie standards, I will say that the gore factor in ""Blade 2"" is tremendous.  So if you're squeamish, this really isn't the film for you.<br/><br/>

Though there are many holes in the plot, and many changes from the original that in my oppinion detract from one's ability to enjoy the show, I will limit my comments to the production and directing choices that have ruined this movie.  Blade II difers most dramatically from Blade in its desire to appeal to everyone.  Blade was made for guys who like vampire movies and guys who like superheroes, period. (Goths, freaks, etc..)  Blade II tries to reach out: Embracing the hip-hop crowd by replacing the techno that the goths and freaks prefer to hip-hop and rap (this is especially bothersome when it is played at an underground rave); embracing the old romantic theatre buffs in its blatent rip offs of the old ""Nosferatu"" flicks; and finally the rednecks get their share in the replacement of cool martial arts with WWF choreography.  The end result of this confused pandering is a movie that doesn't have enough to appeal to anyone that doesn't already like everything.  In short, it SUCKS.  A blatent betrayal of the fans of the first movie."

But after 5 mins into the movie i kinda felt that is just lame. Its basically just action and more action. The plot is weak and has no good storyline in it. You can predict what will happen at every turn. Top in the Box office....bah! it just shows how much americans loves action filled movies OR they were all anticipating to enjoy the movie as much as they did with BLADE I. I was certainly dissapointed big time"
"Xanthippe","2","3","7","1 April 2002"," Good Grief, This Was Awful.
","I was sadly disappointed in Blade II.  I wasn't expecting a stellar, groundbreaking movie, but I was expecting something like the first Blade was: a pretty decent action vampire movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, Blade's sequel was absolutely horrible.  The dialogue hit unprecedented lows even for action movies, the plot was rather silly, and the ""thrills"" consisted of mere gross-outs, which weren't even effective. The most disturbing part of the movie was watching Wesley Snipes crack his neck.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this movie.  Rent the first one instead, or see something else.  This one's not fit to wash the first one's sandals."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","2","4","3 July 2015"," A knockout and the best of the Blade films
","Guillermo's Blade 2 is like Blade, except injected with a syringe containing 50cc's of adrenaline, an intricate blast of Del Toro's imaginative creature design, and a bit of red colored cocaine just for kicks (the vampires in the film snort that stuff like candy). There are few franchises where the sequel surpasses the original (terminator comes to mind), but this is definitely one. Don't get me wrong, I love the first Blade. It's just.. this one leaves it in the dust. Wesley Snipes returns as the original dark knight, hunting blood suckers and tossing one liners faster than he tosses UV light bombs. He's and wonder to behold in the fight scenes, all virile menace and energetic badass. He's forced to join forces with his vampire enemies to take on the terrifying reapers, led by Nomak (Luke Goss). There's so many characters, effects and set pieces happening it almost demands a rewatch or ten. Leonor Varela makes a sultry female vamp, Kris Kristofferson returns as the ever grouchy Whistler, Norman Reedus has a ball as Blade's stoner sidekick and Ron Perlman gets all the best lines (""like my daddy said right before he killed my mom.. you want anything right ya gotta do it yourself""), and there's a whole excellent supporting rogues gallery including Tony Curran, Karel Roden, Donnie Yen and Thomas Kretschmann. Del Toro works wonders with the action aesthetic and special effects, making us feel like we're really there watching these creatures of the night pound the ever loving hell out of each other in one fantastical, bloody, stylistic scene after the next. He never ceases to amaze me with his creativity and vision, and in my mind the Blade comics are a perfect outlet for that talent. This is my favourite of his films, equalled only by Pan's Labyrinth."
"MinorityReporter","6","2","4","17 October 2005"," Decent entertainment but overall inferior to the first!
","Blade II is a very entertaining film. To summarize the film is fairly easy as the film consists of one fight sequence after another and that is not a bad thing. Far from it because it is highly entertaining to watch Blade kick some ass but it is also the greatest flaw of Blade II, which could have been even better than the first film.<br/><br/>Blade is back in action and the storyline picks up a few years after the first one ended but the story is just a loose draft to provide for a lot of heavy action. The film starts off strong with Blade chasing some vampires. Blade soon accomplishes his objective and after only a few minutes of peace Blade finds himself in the middle of some heavy action once again. It seems to me that the film makers knew that there wasn't much of a story and just decided to cover it up with a lot of action and to del Toro's credit, it nearly works. A few action sequences are marred, however, by some very lame and unbelievable CGI. The CGI is so bad in fact that the film is dragged down from an otherwise deserved 7. Overall the action works though and I must admit I was entertained and after the first viewing I even preferred Blade II to the 1998 original. After re-watching it, however, I realized that a lot more attention was payed to the first film.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes returns in the sequel as the title character and he is woolly at best. His performance is pretty non-existent. Most of the act is in posing and looking cool which we knew he could do from the first film. I am not asking for a deep personal look into the character's psychology but a little depth couldn't hurt now could it? Most of his lines are hissed in the usual Blade manner and so not a lot of new has happened to the Blade character. The character of Whistler returns once again in the form of Kris Kristofferson who does what he can but as the story is pretty flat so his character is as well which is a shame because we know from the first film that Kristofferson is a talented guy. It seems that the leading ladies are all picked by their lack of talent because even though I didn't think it was possible an even worse leading lady was found for the second film in the form of Leonor Varela. Her performance is lifeless at best and her ""relationship"" to Blade is embarrassingly badly written. Ron Perlman is in this film as well and some say it is his best (before his breakthrough in Hellboy) character but I disagree. While his character is the most worthwhile in the film it still isn't great. The villain played by Luke Goss is a decent villain and seems like a decent challenge to Blade (unlike the villain of Blade Trinity) and there are a few interesting showdowns between Blade and the villain. Other than this the acting is pretty standard.<br/><br/>The film's visual style differs from the first film and this is good because it further separates this film from the first. Blade II can stand on its own. The color palette has moved more towards earth like colors like brown(ish) and yellow which makes the film interesting to look at during the slow talking parts. The overall set work is excellent and especially the sewer set is very claustrophobic and atmospheric, kudos to the set people and the director. Here also the music should be mentioned as it is nearly as good as in the first film which had a great soundtrack. Compared to the instantly forgettable soundtrack of the third film it is like Mozart. A few changes have been made to the wardrobe as well. Blade's costume has become more streamlined and some color has been added to the his cape and this looks great. Blade is cooler than ever.<br/><br/>Blade II is not a deep or personal film for that matter but it is entertaining and two brainless hours of pure testosteroned action. My suggestion is that you leave your brain at the door and enjoy the action because there is plenty of it and the Blade character himself deserves a closer look. The film is not as good as the first but it is still an exhilarating ride and the comic book feel remains making Blade II a decent film.<br/><br/>6/10"
"hokeybutt","5","2","4","5 June 2005"," Sometimes Bad CGI Is Worse Than No CGI...
","BLADE 2 (2+ outta 5 stars) Wesley Snipes did a good job on the first Blade movie so I have no beef with him coming back to make more of them. For this second installment the filmmakers came up with a decent story and a good bunch of actors. Unfortunately, the script could have used a little more pizazz... and they could have used a lot less phony CGI work in the fight scenes. I realize Snipes may not be a trained fighter... but replacing him with an unconvincing CGI simulation does not help the movie one bit. I think this time around Snipes came on a little too strong with his ""cool"" persona. Blade definitely came off as cool in the first movie... but this time he comes off more as someone desperately *pretending* to be cool. Kris Kristofferson makes a welcome return as Blade's previously deceased partner and he seems to get the better one-liners, while Blade himself is stuck with dud lines like, ""Keep pushing, a**hole."" Ron Perlman does a pretty good job as well, playing an uneasy ally of Blade's. They are forced to team up to destroy a special kind of vampire that feeds on other vampires and so is ultimately more dangerous to mankind. It's all fast-paced and kind of interesting but all that jumping around and blowing things up does get a little old after a while."

With the New Breed growing in vast numbers, Blade and the Night posse prepare to dice 'em.<br/><br/>This Dark Movie over shadows it's predecessor, the stunning special effects are meticulous to detail that is a feast for your eyes, Stephen Dorff is sorely missed as the original villain Frost, but Luke Gloss has a good chance of a movie career.

"rogerebertsclone","Null","2","4","12 October 2002"," A mediocre sequel to a mediocre movie.
","**SPOILERS**""Blade"" (1998) essentially revitalized Marvel's return to the big screen after those straight-to-video flops (remember Dolph Lungdren's ""Punisher?""). I admit, I wasn't intrigued by the whole vampire aspect of the film but the action was what drew me to the theaters. It was average at best, but not without its flaws.<br/><br/>Now comes the highly anticipated sequel. Director Del Toro definitely brings his horror touch to the movie and a fan couldn't help but think of ""Mimic"" when watching this. The movie also has an '80's B-movie feel to it (check the scene when Blade comes out of the blood pool at the end - the music, the slo-mo, it's screaming B-MOVIE!!!). More wall-to-wall action. More weapons. More Whistler. More, more, more...It's essentially a style-over-substance movie and most will agree. But the style does look great.<br/><br/>
Alas, I am mixed. I have a sneaky affection for it, yet I cannot fully recommend it because it lacks story. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!) It was only logical to have Blade team up with his enemies to fight a greater threat - The Reapers. In the third act of the film, it turns out that the Vampires created the virus to lure Blade, which brings us back to the format of the first movie. Frost wanted to bring about the Blood Tide and needed his blood. In this one, they need Blade's blood to continue their race. Seems like Blade's blood is the McGuffin to the series. We see that Blade has a character arc with his affection for Nyssa. But wait! He's back to killing vampires at the end.<br/><br/>I did like the way screenwriter David Goyer inserted Greek mythology into the Vampire mythology. The Reapers were nightmarish, a memorable addition to the Blade series. Snipes lightens up Blade, but in the next one, let's see more character depth. The soundtrack is great, especially Mos Def. View this movie as a breather in the Blade storyline and wait to see if Goyer will give us something interesting next time. All in all, could've been better, but still stylish entertainment."

"jefferyq","10","2","4","23 March 2002"," 50% more action...almost perfect!
","A step or two up from the first outing.<br/><br/>First up, the story is better - some folks are saying there was no story but this one has 200% more story than the cliche that is the first movie's 'plot', that one and this one are really about Snipes fighting vampires, not an in-depth character study. Great plot twists included - there are some moments early on where I was thinking how stupid for Blade to be told and shown so much but later you find out why...now, I wouldn't have told him so much if I was one of those vamps but hey, they wanted his trust right? So, it may have been a bit stupid but it IS possible. Also, not having to set the character up, we get right to business and that equals 40% less exposition.<br/><br/>Action is far better. It wasn't bad in the first one but his foes were not too skilled and the fights were not long enough...as a result, the original Blade film couldn't top the opening fight (one of it's few flaws). but here the fights start high, dip to a steady level and escalate to a smashing finale! Lots of things I am hearing about the fights are that they are too similar to Matrix scenes...this makes complete sense seeing as Donnie Yen, who plays Snowman in Blade 2, was the fight choreographer on this movie (the film's credits say he was assisted by Michael Woods, who was in a bunch of Donnie Yen's Hong Kong films). He learned all about fight choreography from Yuen Wo-ping who did the Matrix fights and he (Yen) also did the fights in some of those Yuen Wo-ping Hong Kong films. So now you know WHY they look so similar...they are not copies of the Matrix, more like brothers to that film's fights.<br/><br/>My ONLY complaint abot Blade 2 is that Donnie should have been used in the movie more than he was...yeah, they also could have dumped some of those special effects fight bits but they really didnt do it too much for the hand to hand stuff, more for the leaps...so, it doesnt get in the way all that much (even if it does look weird).<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to seeing this one again (and still again!) and would tell anyone/everyone to run out and see it. For what is tries to be and how well it succeeds: 10 out of 10!"

I got shushed so many times, but I could not help it! I think the plot has so many holes, there's almost nothing there. David Goyer completely breaks and redefines all rules about vampires at all times. But that is the best part! It makes the movie so humorous! Just watch Blade's glasses. They are indestructible and they don't fall off! That is pure comedic genius. Okay, so I found this move hilarious. It isn't supposed to be a comedy but it is. How about the action? I'm not too big of an action movie fan, but I am a ninja movie fan, and this movie has the best of both worlds. Not only does it have action, kung-fu fighting, but they added professional wrestling to the mix also. The excitement never stops, so most people can look past the terrible story. (But you miss out on the humor!) Plus, the action scenes are breathtaking. They seamlessly put CG in to do amazing visual effects for stunts and camera work that could never be done in the real life. If you want 2 hours of pure escapist fun, then see this movie right away! It has everything! Action, excitement, ninjas, sci-fi, horror, disgusting amounts of gore, lots of comedy, (but unintentional) romance AND drama!

Besides I feel that the plot was adequate and was not as thin as people are saying it is. The movie is of course non stop action from beginning till end. You can really tell the difference that it makes when you have an experienced kung fu choreograher (Donnie Yen). The fight scenes are 10 times more intense than in the first. The characters are really cool, have cool weapons and are just really neat to watch. Wesley Snipes doesn't miss a beat and proves once again that he is a solid action movie man. Enough with the lovey dubby junk with movies like One Night Stand, back to bone crushing, neck breaking action.

"dee.reid","10","2","4","23 March 2002"," Y'all know the name...BLADE
","""Blade II"", the highly anticipated sequel to the 1998 action thriller of the same name, met every single one of my expectations.  I expected ""Blade II"" to surpass ""Blade"" in almost every way and it did.  This meant more weapons, more action, more vampires, and the best part of about this movie of course, Blade himself.  There is a lot of shots of vampires being dismembered, blown up, and fried by sunlight. <br/><br/>""Blade II"" takes place two years after the events of the first film. Blade(Wesley Snipes) is continuing his search for his long-dead friend Whistler(Kris Kristofferson), who has since become a vampire.  Blade eventually finds his quarry with the help of another chain-smoking human, Scud(Norman Reedus).  It isn't long before Scud and Whistler begin to go at one another for who is better at inventing vampire-killing weapons.   Soon after, Blade is later informed of a truce that is being called between him and the Vampire Nation.  The entire reason for the truce is that a rare mutation has occurred within the vampire strain.  It seems that a new breed of vampire called a ""reaper"" has resulted from the mutant strain.  These ""reapers"" are a kind of super-vampire.  They have an insatiable thirst for blood, needing to feed every few hours.  In turn they will feed on anything, even other vampires.  They have intense strength, are immune to silver and garlic, but are still vulnerable to sunlight.  They are led by Nomak(Luke Goss), the originator of the mutant strain.  The Vampire Nation needs Blade's help in eliminating the reapers before they wipe out everything on Earth.  To do this, the Vampire Nation allies Blade with the Bloodpack, a team of specially trained vampires who were originally training to kill him. The Bloodpack, which consists of Reinhardt(Ron Perlman), Chupa(Matt Schulze), Snowman(Donnie Yen), Lighthammer(Daz Crawford), Verlaine(Marit Velle Kile), and Priest(Tony Curran), are a very tough bunch.  The group is headed by the vampire leader's own daughter, Nyssa(Leonor Varela).  So together Blade, Scud, Whistler, and the Bloodpack set off to eliminate the reaper threat.  <br/><br/>Make no mistake, this movie rules.  It is far superior to ""Blade"" in almost every way.  The reapers are very cool looking.  You should also be on the lookout for one feature of the reapers that was not shown in the previews. ""Blade II"" is actually scary too.  ""Blade II"" is also less dark in tone than the first film.  ""Blade II"" also has a bit of humor, which is provided mostly by Norman Reedus and Ron Perlman.  The acting here is great too. Wesley Snipes does a fantastic job in this movie.  I had previously never heard of Luke Goss until I saw this movie.  He is fantastic as the evil and twisted Nomak.  I almost hate to say it, but he's even better than Stephen Dorff's Deacon Frost in the first film.<br/><br/>As I said before, ""Blade II"" is one exciting, scary and exhilarating action film.  I can already see that this movie is going to be a smash at the box office, so don't be surprised."

","Blade II is not your typical vampire movie sequel. Not only does it do things better than the original, but it makes vampires look even cooler than they already did. Guillermo del Toro didn't hold back on any of the action, Donnie Yen's signature fight scenes style is really prevalent in this movie, as he himself plays a role, which can only be described as underused. The cinematography is decent, there are some really cool shots of the Bloodpack while they are heading into the vampire nightclub. The plot is really unique and breathes fresh air into the vampire genre, accompanied by the never ending tension, this sequel really succeeds in making a different movie, even when the story isn't complicated at all. You have vampires versus a new breed of vampires, created from a virus, which makes them even more strong and bloodthirsty, and really really grotesque. The make up and effects team deserve very high praise on their work here, the reapers are truly terrifying.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, of course, and the new additions to the universe are quite exciting. Young Norman Reedus plays the whacky sidekick to Blade, and Kris Kristofferson returns as Whistler. Del Toro also brings in the Bloodpack. They are highly trained vampires, whose only job was to hunt down Blade, until things went downhill with the arrival of the reapers. They are a cool new addition, as Ron Pearlman, Matt Schulze and Tony all give plenty of personality to the group. Donnie Yen is also a part of the Bloodpack, but as mentioned before, he is severely underused in the movie. None of them really have any backstory or move the plot in any way, apart from a few very cool scenes. The villain of the movie is Nomak, who is the patient zero and carries the reaper virus. He is decent and the opening scenes with him are entertaining, but he doesn't do much from there. The dialogue is simple, but the movie let's its dark visuals do the talking.<br/><br/>There are couple of bad plot points, which involve Nomak's father - Eli Damaskinos. He is the weakest character in the film, even though he has more lines and screen time than more of the members of the Bloodpack. The only positive is that it doesn't take away from the overall quality of Blade II.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of action packed early 2000's vampire flicks, which include a well known Marvel hero, this is the perfect movie for you. Blade II perfectly captures the gritty and hostile vibe of the cities and makes vampires cool again for a bit."

","When a sequel changes its director, it wasn't a great sign. Norrington delivered a stylish vampire hit and deserved to return to the seat, but apparently chose not to. Enter Del Toro and if you've followed his career, the guy is a visionary. Blade 2 is essentially Blade part II. That's an important thing to note, as the storyline thread is heavy connected to the first. The film is far from the first film and the filmmaker ensures this is a completely different film. I love this film and the first. Both filmmakers had strong visual styles and it was a shame neither would assist the third film. The villain is well constructed and unlike Frost from the first film, he could kill Blade from the beginning. The film has a fun cast and a filmmaker at the beginning of his career. There's some minor errors, but they could be due to budget lags and a rushed production."

","Guillermo Del Toro is a talented movie director. But Blade was really the first big hit for him. The first film was action packed, filled with blood and gore. The acting was decent but the plot was thin. Well, this sequel manages to have all of that exactly. Which for some it may be a bad thing considering that it does not improve any of the flaws over the original film. It can also be a good thing also because that means it is not worse than the previous film. With that being said, Blade II can be considered an underrated sequel. If you really enjoy the original film but have not had time to see this one, then I would recommend watching this film."

","Moving from the first movie which was bit of mess, though still pretty cool, we have an amazing sequel. We can't thank del Toro enough for this movie. It has amazing action, cool style, interesting characters, great main protagonist and fitting soundtrack. Disintegration of vampires is still present, but at least it now looks a lot more cool compared to the first movie. In fact, I am now pretty OK with it. So, what more can you ask for from a movie like this? Having seen ""Hellboy"" and this movie, it seems del Toro was a real savior of the comic book based movies, and I can only say: ""Thank you!"" I give the movie 9/10, because even though this is everything what movie about Blade should be, we need to take into account what movies deserve 10/10 score, and those are masterpieces.

","This movie was very good and i enjoyed watching it but it wasn't better than the first one and if i had to choose between the first one and this one i would choose the first one but i still love this movie and i thought it was cool. The special effects were a big improvement from the first one so thats a good thing. I feel like the first one did a better job showing and explaining blade and had more action and better scenes. There was a whole new feel to this movie starting from a whole new group and characters and new villains and vampires and it makes the movie look silly at some times and sometimes i get aliens vibes from the whole group hunting vampire and stuff. The movies best part is the first 10 minutes just like the first movie but the only other good part were some of the fight scenes and the club scene but the music was kinda the only cool part and also the shootout within that part. I mean i feel like it was very different from the first and a lot of new things but i feel like thats a good thing too because its a new movie and its good thats its not the same thing even though i loved the first one but i feel like it was better to turn a new leaf. It had a whole new vibe and most of the movie is taken place underground which also again makes it feel like the movie alien where the whole movie takes place in space which i just realized that sounds kind of creepy. Anyway probably a one time watch for now but not forever and i will definitely see these cool movie again sometime in the future and i cant wait to see blade trinity and it should hopefully be a good ending to the blade trilogy which is sad but there might be a new movie soon by marvel sometime in the future or should i say by Disney. Anyway watch it its cool but see the first one first obviously."

"one9eighty","7","0","0","8 April 2016"," Blade is back
","Blade (Wesley Snipes) is back, bringing his unique vampire hunting skills to a new scenario. You may remember that in the last film Whistler (Kristofferson) appeared to be killed off, well the audience was deceived and he wasn't killed off. Blade is doing his job while looking for clues to find his old friend. Filling Whistlers role at home with Blade is Scud (Norman Reebus), a young wannabe cool kid who enjoys making vampire slaying equipment and watching powerpuff girls while toking on a big fat spliff. Blade finds Whistler and attempts to detox him. All of a sudden Black Ops vampires (Leonor Varela a.k.a. Nyssa, and Danny John Jules a.k.a. Asad) infiltrate Blade's base of operations with a message from the vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). Blade and his merry gang of slayers agree to meet the Vampire overlord who tells them that a mutant vampire strain is making a new breed, dubbed Reapers. The only way to stop the mutation is to kill his alpha carrier Nomak (Luke Goss, who is great BTW), killing him will kill all the reapers he has created as they are linked via blood. Blade begrudgingly agrees to join the Black Ops Vampire team, a.k.a. The Bloodpack which features random vagabond bad-add vampires such as Reinhart (Ron Perlman), Priest (Tony Curren) and Lighthammer (Daz Crawford). Working with Vampires to bring down a mutant vampire lets Blade be exposed to the real underground Vampire world, his hope is that working with the vampires will allow him to learn enough about them to bring them all down in the future. And so, the epic journey and battle begins. <br/><br/>This film goes a long way to better the first Blade film and it actually does it in parts. The main gripes in this for me are Whistlers return after being killed in the first film, the overuse of obvious CGI in some of the fight scenes with Blade, and the obvious plot twist which is looming with Scud. Apart from those things the film is actually more mayhem and chaos than the first film which actually works really well. Despite it working good as a comic-book fan this isn't the Blade I'm used to, there are obvious attempts at humour and puns within the film which isn't Blade, but unless you are a comic purist like me you'll probably enjoy it. The origin story is featured in the film again (directly stolen from the first film) so you do not have to have seen the first film to work out where Blade comes from and how he got his powers. I enjoyed this film, maybe not as much as the first film because that had charm and style mixed with a good plot and dialogue. As an action film though this film excels beyond the first film, I just think there was more potential that could have been milked from this. Blade's relationship with Nyssa maybe or using the member of the bloodpack more - bearing in mind Donnie Yen (Snowman) has a lot of experience in the martial arts combat choreography featured throughout this film. All in all though Guilllermo Del Torro has made a great film which fits nice in the series of Blade films or works as a standalone. Like the first the musical score is upbeat and pacey much like the film. 7 out of 10"
"ES-III","Null","0","0","5 June 2003"," A very meaningless sequel with little redemption value...
","I could be wrong, but there's not a lot of plot going on in this follow-up to the surprise '98 hit `Blade.'  Again, Blade (Wesley Snipes), the half man, half vampire, gets to save humanity from a blood-drenched Armageddon in a very violent, round-about way. Here, Blade aligns himself with a militant group of vampires (The Bloodpack) -- originally trained to kill him -- to battle a new genetically-enhanced strain of super-vampires called Reapers who feed on both vampire and human. The hunt takes Blade into the compound of vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), where he meets Nyssa (Leonor Varela), Damaskinos's exotic daughter.  His infiltration unveils many secrets of the vampire sect, but not too much more, unless you consider fighting scenes a crucial part of the narrative. To the film's credit, super-Reaper Jared Nomak (Luke Goss) is highly entertaining, and del Toro creates some pretty stunning visuals, like the vampire autopsy and the Reapers who have a scar down the center of their chins that spreads out into retractable jaws.  Outside of that, the only redeeming factor is Blade's mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), as crusty and bad-mannered as ever.  The film actually throws in a useless, unrelated subplot just to have Kristofferson back for the ride -- he didn't die, but was instead infected with the vampire virus and taken overseas (of course!). Still, `Blade II' is nothing like the first installment  instead, it's all flash and blood and guns and `Matrix' kicks.  The first brought `humanity' into the picture; this one ignores it.  For example, when Blade's industrial unit is attacked by messengers from Damaskinos, a ten-minute fight ensues before the invaders  risking death -- stop and let Blade know they're just stopping by to deliver a message (maybe have some blood and crumpets).  And the characterization is horrible  the Bloodpack is easily one of the worst and least-memorable collection of heavies I've seen since 1997's `Con Air'  bombastic, predictable, stereotypical, and pumped full of steroids. Furthermore, outside of the physical stunts, this couldn't have been a very challenging role for Snipes (he only has five minutes of dialogue scattered throughout the film at best).  Why bother using an actor at all  just digitally generate Blade in the next flick!  Oh, and did I mention that everyone in the film knows some type of martial-arts must be a vampire pre-requisite or something?  I hear those late-night vampire karate-schools are all the rage out in LA!"

","Darker and more gruesome than the original, Blade II delivers an intoxicating blend of horror, butt kicking martial arts and comic book sensibility. Wesley Snipes is back as the half vampire half human `Daywalker' whose life's mission is to hunt and eliminate the undead. Also making a return appearance is Kris Kristofferson as his sagely sidekick Whistler. Mexican Director Guillermo del Toro amps up the action, inserting incredibly violent, but entertaining fight scenes every ten minutes or so. The story is outlandish but remains true to the movie's comic book roots - which means it makes enough sense while you are watching it, but doesn't hold up to close scrutiny at the coffee shop post theatre."

"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","17 November 2002"," monotonous action film
","I seem to recall a time, in the not too distant past, when vampire movies actually made a little effort to be scary.  This is no longer the case, apparently, for nowadays the vampires themselves have become so image-conscious that they just can't seem to be bothered with anything as mundane as conjuring up a few goose bumps for a thrill-starved audience. These modern-day Draculas need to devote all their time and energy to proving just how hip, cool and trendy they really are.  Take the bloodsuckers in `Blade II.'  In this sequel to the highly successful 1998 original, the vampires all talk in the vernacular of streetwise thugs and sport the very latest in grunge attire (one would think that there would be at least a few old timers in their ranks who would rather don a Bela Lugosi-type tuxedo than a torn jeans and leather ensemble, but, apparently, in this day and age, vampirism has become strictly a young person's game).<br/><br/>
In this film, Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the laconic `half-vampire' who, unlike his full-blooded brethren, can move around in the daylight. Blade has dedicated his life to defending mankind against the deadly assaults from the world's apparently enormous vampire population.  However, in `Blade II,' a new twist has been added.  Blade learns that a new form of vampire  a `super vampire,' one that feeds on vampires as well as humans - has suddenly been unleashed onto the earth, and the mere conventional vampires are forced to enlist the aid of their own archenemy to help defeat this new strain.   <br/><br/>Because `Blade II' ends up substituting action for suspense, the movie quickly turns into a monotonous series of nonstop chase scenes, gun battles and kickboxing sequences  all filmed so darkly that it is often hard to fully see what is happening on screen.  I guess we are paying the price for the success of `The Matrix,' since every action movie worth its salt now has to feature at least half a dozen martial arts sequences to make the action-hungry audience feel it is getting its money's worth.  The makers of `Blade II' also rely so heavily on gross-out effects and state-of-the-art gizmos and gadgets that they all but drain the life's blood out of the film. With no one for us to identify with or care about, there is really no way for the story to generate any actual suspense.  We sit and watch, admiring of the technical aspects of the film, perhaps, but completely unabsorbed in the action on screen.   In `Blade II,' the vampires, super-vampires and pseudo-vampires, by waging what is little more than a two-hour long gun battle, end up boring us long before the sun peeks over the horizon."

","I was first introduced to the characters of Blade and Whistler through a more recent Spiderman cartoon. So when a big screen rendition of the character was made I knew right away that I had to see it. It had non-stop action, just like the sequel. It had buckets of gore, just like the sequel (though not quite as extreme as one would have expected). It had a touch of witty, dark humour, just like the sequel. It ran to long, just like the sequel. It was a wild, entertaining, thrill-a-minute, roller coaster ride...this is where the comparison stops. The film starts off strong with an explosive action sequence that screams of the first Blade but then slowly looses itself it the stupidity of the story. This time around Blade must team up with his vampire enemies to take on a new breed of ""super"" vampire known as Reapers. The story is so dumb and such a far cry from the original that it will have you wondering when Steven Dorff will pop up and the real story will begin, but that doesn't happen so we are left with a story that drags on and doesn't possess one lick of logic. Wesley Snipes is again ultra cool and ultra stylized as our title character (the main reason to view the film). Kris Kristofferson is also back as Whistler but the absence of Steven Dorff as Deacon Frost takes a huge toll on the final product (maybe they should have resurrected Frost, that probably would have made more sense than this). With a change in director comes a change in style. Director Guillermo Del Toro seems more worried about how big and high tech he can make everything look than providing the sheer entertainment value of the original. He also relies to much on computer generated effects during fight scenes  making the battles look more like watching a video game than an action flick at times. Don't get me wrong, Del Toror is a talented director. Some of his techniques could have worked wonders in the first film but he doesn't seem to realize that things need to be taken one step at a time and not just have everything thrown in a viewers face all at once3 and still expect them to have a good time. So in the end it was a fair attempt that is worth seeing for Snipes' super cool performance and the mind blowing intro but other than that, as a Blade fan I was expecting much more than I got."

Let me state that I like a well-thought (ie. plotted) action movie where there are only one or two plot holes.  And I also like Wesley Snipes as an actor.  This film proves that he's as good as his material and his material was terrible. IF you are definitely going to see the film, don't read any further as I will lay out the plot and the problems fairly completely.  Otherwise, read on...<br/><br/>The plot is that an ancient vampire from Eastern Europe has been experimenting with creating a strong, weakness-free breed of vampire and it's gotten loose and he has to turn to Blade to save the earth (and his own skin).<br/><br/>Problems with the plot:<br/><br/>I.  The ancient vampire...<br/><br/>1 - is funding an effort to replace himself on the top of the food chain. He's managed to live for centuries and build himself a position of wealth and privilege and he's going to risk that eternity to make something that will replace him.  (Not too bright, how again did he manage to survive all that time, much less build a power base?)<br/><br/>2 - looses control of the Reaper subject in the first place and has to call on his mortal enemy to cover his butt.  No locks on the doors apparently.<br/><br/>3 - Instead of taking Blade to a temporary location that cannot be traced back to him, the ancient vampire has Blade walk in through the front door of his stronghold.  Hi, I'm home.<br/><br/>4 - The ancient vampire actually meets with Blade in person exposing himself,(here I am Blade) rather than remaining behind the scenes and acting though intermediaries.<br/><br/>5 - Knows way too much about the Reaper strain for something that has just been discovered.

(Why hasn't the virus mutated or evolved before now?)<br/><br/>6 - Gloats about the glory of the ""new"" Master Vampire that he's breeding and shows our heroes where the test tubes baby vamps are stored, so that they can destroy them later in the film.  (Can someone please just shoot him now and save me 30 minutes of screen time?)<br/><br/>7 - Doesn't kill Blade when he can. (I know that this is a staple of the Master Villain mistakes, but come on.  Just once I'd love to see the ""hero"" killed by the villain and the sidekicks then have to save the day)<br/><br/>8 - Remains at the secret stronghold (Grand Moff Tarkin aboard the Deathstar) so that he can be trapped and killed by the original Reaper.<br/><br/>II. The Reaper Virus (aka Zombie Movie hides as Vampire Flick)<br/><br/>1 - requires the vampire to feed every few hours.<br/><br/>2 - infects everyone that the Reaper feeds upon (human and Vampire).<br/><br/>3 - transforms those infected at an incredibly rapid rate, just slightly longer than 20 minutes (except for the standard plot device of infecting a team member who takes far too long to transform and then does so quietly just so that he can kill the martial arts vampire from behind and deprive us of a really cool fight scene)<br/><br/>4 - makes those infected immune to everything except for sunlight/uv radiation.<br/><br/>5 - In typical Zombie movie fashion, the fewer the number of Reapers being fought on screen, the tougher they are to kill.  The Reapers in the club are nearly impossible to kill but the team mows through hundreds of Reapers in the sewers like a hot knife through butter.<br/><br/>6 - The original Reaper takes his own life at the end of the film for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>III.  The lackeys (Other Vampires & Human agents)<br/><br/>1 - are prepared for UV radiation by wearing protective bodysuits and goggles when they go to offer Blade a truce with the ""Vampire Nation"". Nice touch, thinking ahead.  Apparently, these are the only two suits and they were destroyed so that they couldn't be used again in the film.<br/><br/>2 - Proves that they are incredibly bright and well trained by taking Blade down not once but twice.  The first time is with tasers and the second is a mass attack with shock batons.  Then, the lackeys forget all their training and go one on one with Blade so that he can kill fifty or so in a minute and 30 seconds.  (Or did Coach Vamp send in the 3rd string to get some play time?)<br/><br/>3 - Attack the original Reaper with machine gun fire when they already know that only UV Radiation will harm him.  (In other words, they die needlessly and in twenty minutes will be the new Reaper Army)<br/><br/>4 - Willingly follow Blade into the sewers to hunt the Reapers with UV grenades and no way to shield themselves. (see #1 in this section)<br/><br/>III.  Lovestory between Blade and the Vampire Princess<br/><br/>Given Blade's history and the fact that he killed his mother in the first movie, I don't buy it even for one second.  It doesn't matter how attractive she is.  She's the enemy.<br/><br/>IV.  The Fight Scenes<br/><br/>1 - look like some sort of MTV Video Choreography<br/><br/>2 - uses cut-away shots to cheat and make it look like someone other that Wesley Snipes can actually fight.  Just hire people who can do the moves to be standins and have the camera center on Blade during the fight scenes so we don't notice that the fighters aren't necessarily the actors (requires a more difficult camera shot but gives a more enjoyable result)<br/><br/>I could go on, but I think I'll stop now.  Hopefully, if this movie does well enough for a 3rd installment, the Studio will actually spend money on a screenplay."

","Blade 2  The original movie, Blade, wasn't anything to write home about unless all you require is 'cool'; 'cool' protagonist in a long black leather coat; lots of 'cool', shiny silver weapons that go well with the black leather...  Lots of 'cool' action sequences, i.e. martial art fights,  hero doing feats only a half human/half vampire hero could possibly do.  Oh yeah, and lots of *really* 'cool' gore.  Heavy metal music, blood, blood and, yes you've guessed it, more blood.  This was Blade. Blade 2 is, as one might expect, more of the same.  Unfortunately, the film is worse than the original in several ways, albeit slightly.  In Blade, when a vampire was destroyed, there was a subtle difference in the way the creatures disappeared; some of them burst into flames, some of them splattered, some of them turned to dust, etc.  In Blade 2, the creatures disintegrate in exactly the same way each time; a way which stank very much of an over-reliance on computer generated imagery. This made the deaths look cheaper, more fluid and slick perhaps, but less visceral and impactive, like a 'made for television' version of Blade. The resurrection of the character Whistler is an awful contrivance.  By bringing Whistler back to life, the filmmakers have undercut the drama of the having him die in the original; not to mention the fact that Whistler had both *wanted* to die and done the job himself!  Why would the vampires keep him alive?  This makes no sense.  Not to use as bait to get to Blade, since they kept moving him around, all over Europe, making it (as Blade himself said) very hard for him to track him down.  Whistler was a key adversary, and he was wanted dead.  The vampires had good reason to kill him and kill him they did.  To have them then decide, in Blade 2, to keep him alive at great expense, and transport him around the world from location to location, is nonsensical!  So all one can make of this is that it was deemed (by studio executives) a safer bet for the financial success of the film, to have Chris Kristofferson back  forget about art, Hollywood is about making money!  What they don't realise is that better movies make *more* money still! It has been said that Blade 2 has been 'Matrixed', which is a very apt observation.  There is even a team, similar to the one in The Matrix, of anti-heroes - the vampire squad that was being trained to take out Blade, each with their own 'cool' name!  I mean, 'The Priest'!  *Please*!   Loads of extra martial arts, al la The Matrix, loads more black costumes, al la The Matrix, more fast music and destructive mayhem, al la The Matrix.  This is all about 'fashion filmmaking'  merely looking at what is going down well at the moment and copying the style.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer is big, Angel is big, the Matrix is big (and a sequel is due out soon)... so lets just jump on the bandwagon. The director could have stuck with the unique look of the original and remained a trend *setter*, instead he has sunk to becoming a mere trend follower. One interesting aspect of the movie is the *computer generated* Blade and enemies; these shots, although they were noticeable as CG images, mark a significant leap forward in what can be achieved in superhero films.  With the forthcoming Spider-man, I am intrigued by these developments.  Maybe the techniques aren't refined enough yet for the sophisticated viewers of special effects that we have become, but they soon will be.  Then directors of escapist films in the superhero genre will really be able to translate the action that was previously only possible in comic books/graphic novels, onto the screen. Overall, Blade 2 is fine for the average, undemanding fan of blood splattered action films.  For the more discerning cineaste, it is a straightforward exploitation of the fans of the original, with no originality, no standout performances, and a hackneyed plot.   Look closely, and you'll even notice that Wesley Snipes looks bored by the proceedings."

","Wesley Snipes proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he is the leading action star in Hollywood - he kicks butt with an aplomb and relish that surpasses Blade and fulfills the glimmer of action-talent witnessed in the otherwise unspeakable Demolition Man.<br/><br/>The styling, the atmospherics and the effects are all top-notch - I agree that the only weak part in terms of effects is when Blade and his enemies are fully CGI rendered. The storyline - well heck it's good enough. I wasn't looking for total plausibility but I was looking for something that took the original Blade story further and still upped the ante in terms of action - this did it.<br/><br/>Luke Goss should also deserve a mention - for doing a solidly good job as the uber-Reaper, especially considering anyone aware of Bros probably wondered what the hell he was doing in this film. I only have one worry - for Blade III to have even more action will require one non-stop hour and half of ass-whupping....hey it may work!"

","*****SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>The original Blade was hokum that managed to avoid mediocrity through its stunning opening sequence, new take on the vampire myth and the charisma of both hero (Snipes) and villain (Dorff).  I loved it.  I bought it.  I still watch it.<br/><br/>This formulaic romp through the vampire world essentially wants have its cake and eat it through fusing developments on these themes with the machismo-stroking accoutrements of the buddy/team movie and the perverse thrill of the horror genre.<br/><br/>None of this works.<br/><br/>In order:<br/><br/>The opening Blade-based sequence (after a fairly neatly-staged incident in a blood bank) is a poorly montaged combination of a summary of previous events and new vampire destruction.<br/><br/>Borrowing heavily from computer games (shoot left, shoot right, change weapon...) it falls into the endless repetition common to that medium.  After four flaming corpses in two minutes the only trick left is the close-up.  Then the ultra-close-up.  Then the slow-motion close-up.  Then increasing the number of flaming corpses.  Then showing those in slow motion.  Repeat ad infinitum.  The law of diminishing returns has never been so well demonstrated, as kick after punch after stab after bite after shot endlessly assaults the viewer, leaving them bored senseless.  Any meaning in death is completely obviated.<br/><br/>Perhaps meaning can be found in the new take on the vampires.<br/><br/>Vampire recreation, shown as dancing in a shower of blood in the original film, is now extended to flesh play.  Opening up a spine, or perhaps a vein.  Kissing with razor blades.  Interesting concept - if the flesh is eternally healable then why not experiment with pain as a sensation?  Does it affect the rest of the film in any way?  No, since the vampiric personality of the ""traditional"" vampire characters is muted beyond recognition.  Physical effects (light +silver sensitivity and regeneration through blood) are the only interest, and then only for pyrotechnic effect.  There is evidence of this being realised halfway through (better bolt on a ""I've come to terms with what I am"" line), but it is addressed to little effect.<br/><br/>Charisma is notably lacking.  Blade becomes more violent poseur than ultra-hard uber-vampire.  Nomak is a hunched Nosferatu/Frankenstein's monster hybrid with bad varicose veins.<br/><br/>Traditionally vampirism has always been about lust - the neck-biting, the consuming passion, the earthly physicality of blood and body - wheras these monsters seem to deal more in gluttony - the crunching of bone and marrow, the daily greed for a feed.  The paradox of desire has become utterly one-sided.  It says almost nothing about the human condition in this context.  The patterns of lust could have been more richly fertile.<br/><br/>The buddy movie elements fail to hang together.  Reinhardt, the leader of the ""Blood Pack,"" fails to convince, impress, terrify, entertain - anything.  The Blood Pack themselves have been drafted in from the Street Fighter School of Ethnic Representation - the kung fu one, the big hammer one, the girly one, and so on.<br/><br/>Scrap the lot of them and leave me the hero, please.  They serve no purpose (other than providing for a larger range of action figure spin-offs) and, through their idiotic acts, seem to know it.  Blade and Whistler was a dualism that worked - ""he makes the weapons, I use 'em"" perfectly apt.<br/><br/>Horror, meanwhile, seems to mean endless gore-porn close-ups of the Reaper mouth/jaw/tentacle thing and sections through the human body.  The shot of the blinking lone head-section revelled in its ability to disgust.  The full-body-splitting of ol' Reinhardt showed more than we possibly needed to know.  Remember a time when the imagination filled in details more horrifying than what could be put on the screen?  We appear to have passed that point at speed.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out the glaring stupidities of the film (light travelling around corners in a roaring flame-effect my favourite bone-headed moment.  Who thought that up?) so I shall leave those to one side, and finish by apologising for all my waffle and sub-theorist posturings.  I'm just trying to find out why, when I turned my brain off and sat down in the cinema for an hour-and-a-bit of mindless fun, I ended up with a film of jaded blood pornography.  The sex metaphor explains it best - without the mind involved, the rest becomes pure mechanics.  Excess of sensation can be amazingly entertaining, but this is an attempt at stimulus-response level sensory overload.  One reviewer compared its excesses to Auschwitz.  Given the level at which mutilation has become entertainment, I can see their point.<br/><br/>Liked the bike stunts and the ubiquitous sunglasses, but give it a miss.<br/><br/>T."

","So I just sat through this movie which is supposed to be a sequel to the best sleeper hit of '98.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wonder that when the director, writers and producers are sitting in the screening room and watch the final cut do they say to themselves that 'that's some of my best work' because I seriously doubt it. Its probably more like 'that will do cause the cinema audiences of the world are mindless peebs and I've already got lots of money so what the hell'. I just figured they tested this film to three chickens and a farm hand in a barn somewhere.<br/><br/>I bet I got you thinking that I hated this movie, well you'd be wrong I loved Blade and Blade 2 will take a permanent place in my DVD collection, but a couple of questions<br/><br/>*Spoilers Spoilers Spoilers*<br/><br/>1, Did Dr Karen Jenson who was quite alive at the end of the first movie and who most likely got straight to work on a 'better serum' go on vacation or something? I mean you could explain her absence in five lines<br/><br/>Whistler: ""so what happened to that girlfriend you had""<br/><br/>Blade: ""oh you mean Karen, who I risked my life saving by going up against Deacon Frost?""<br/><br/>Whistler: ""Yeah that's her, so where is she then""<br/><br/>Blade: ""she went to Memphis and opened a vampire themed Elvis bar""<br/><br/>Whistler: ""well thats a shame, well at least i know why she isn't here (winks to camera)""<br/><br/>2, what the hell was the point in the scud character? He didn't do anything that whistler or the vampires couldn't have done themselves.<br/><br/>The vampires didn't need to break in the Blades hideout they could've just knocked on the door so there was no need for scud to let them in.<br/><br/>Whistler could have been in the van while the team were in the House of Pain and he could of designed the UV flash grenades after all he built a lot of other stuff.<br/><br/>As for scud's oh so clever deception the only reason for that was to get the bomb of the back of Rhindharts head.<br/><br/>Oh and finally he was a extremely poor character, yeah a pot smoking twenty-something if I want to seen one of those I'd watch Jay and Silent Bob strike back (Great Movie).<br/><br/>3. Not that I'm really complaining (Whistler is a great character) but are we really meant to believe that after Whistler shot himself in the head that the Vampire clan would actually bother to take his body and spend millions of dollars keeping him in a vat of blood for four years. Maybe, I suppose, but why not explain it a little better?<br/><br/>Ok spleen vented, on the upside this movie did have some really cool action scenes and one-liners, I loved the very last scene in a Soho peep show, excellent and the wrestling stuff that was cool too.<br/><br/>So in conclusion if you like some ass kicking and Vampires then this is the movie for you, just try and forget that the first one was a much better movie.<br/><br/>Here's hoping the DVD has some deleted scenes that explain some things (or at least have a commentary that apologises)."
"exarch3d","Null","0","0","3 April 2002"," Average Action. NOT better than the original
","The original blade suffered a bit from it's pre-matrix release. It started off very strong, with the bloodbath club being a very cool visual (and one that is never topped, in B1 or B2). But after that it just slowly drifted downhill, nothing too drastic, but it was just kind of hard to care....<br/><br/>Flash forward to blade 2: It starts weakly with a boring, uninformative voiceover and a pretty poor pre-credit sequence. It picks it up with a few good fights (almost always then ruined by some VERY DODGY cgi work) and then goes totally off the rails at the end with plot twists (or HOLES as they are normally called) all over the place.<br/><br/>I think my biggest problem with both movies is Blade himself. He is cool, too cool, he almost never breaks into a sweat, has no real emotions, says almost nothing, is so much stronger and faster and better than the vamps (and even the super-vamp reapers) that you never really feel he is in danger, never really care that much.<br/><br/>Also, his singleminded ""kill all vamps"" attitude seems as wrong as the attitudes of the villians, the vamps have made pacts, compromises and treaties, but he just wants to kill them all.<br/><br/>Blade 1's plot was more straightforward, but made more sense and worked much better as a film plot, i would guess that blade 2's plot was taken from the comics, as it seemed to have been highly compressed. Lots of new characters (that we hardly meet, can anyone name more than 2 of the Bloodpack?), lots of competing sides (but we get no sense of the rivalries, or histories). and plot holes galore.<br/><br/>what is the dramatic point in being made to team up with your enemies if a:you have never heard of them, b:you knick the leader's butt in the first 2 secs making him look a wimp and c:they almost all die in the 1st 5 minutes of the first mission?<br/><br/>and what was with the, supposedly touching, ending. are we supposed to think blade cared about that vamp chick? why? surely if she lived he would just have staked her? why did she want to get bit anyway?<br/><br/>And i can't believe they wasted donnie yen that badly... sigh.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Luke Goss (i can't believe it was him) was a cool baddy, whistler was always a cool character.<br/><br/>Having said all that, it was a fun mindless film, and even with all those minus points it gets a 7 out of 10. but it could have been so much better. unfortunately it is already disapearing from my memory, by next week i doubt i could tell you anything about it. :("

","There's a certain realm of bad movie that will carry away juvenile fans because of the high level of craft that goes into them. They might have great images, great effects, great cinematography--but inside, nothing's there. This is one of *THOSE* movies.<br/><br/>""Blade 2"" was designed to be wall-to-wall action scenes and a genuine comic-book movie, and at that it succeeds brilliantly. Unfortunately, that is *ALL* it succeeds at, and I was struck by how very little the makers of this film wanted to achieve. Why did they think so small?<br/><br/>The characters are not as interesting as in the first movie, since the director and writer so clearly don't care about them. The dialog is truly dreadful, though there is very little of it, so that it won't get in the way of the pumped-up action scenes.<br/><br/>Aside from the action scenes, which are eventually boring due to the lack of any variation in pace, there is a terrific monster/anatagonist, mutant vampires called ""reapers,"" with a tripartite jaw that opens from a cleft in their chin. The technical staff who envisioned and executed these beasts deserve to be commended.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while the technical staff did their job well, the writer and director did not. This is very disappointing, given what a jewel-in-the-mud the original ""Blade"" was, and that David Goyer wrote them both. And the director, Guillermo del Toro, has talent.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie doesn't have the heart the first one did, and the director has never heard that less can be more.

"giancarlorocks","Null","0","0","23 March 2002"," An overabundance of plot twists, make it seem like a bad David Mamet film...
","To think Guillermo Del Toro would deliver a more thrilling cinematic experience in Blade 2' is to delude oneself. Director Guillermo Del Toro has buried his roots in horror films and makes a solid yet failed attempt at integrating his visceral horror style into this horrible sequel. As seen in his prior films such as Cronos' and his first Studio film Mimic', Director Del Toro seems to want to reinvent the Vampire Slayer and creates a soup of genres that does not satiate the excitement level created in the first film.<br/><br/>     Wesley Snipes reprises his role as Blade, a Vampire Hunter that has all the strengths and none of the weaknesses those he hunts have. Except for one, he can tolerate sunlight. And as such he has an advantage that as one will see within the film through the overabundance of special effects displayed; works to his advantage. Yet in this sequel, those he hunts have suddenly become his allies. David Goyer's Mamet-like' script tries to create a film filled with unnecessary twists and turns that make this film seem like a bad David Mamet film. Surely, comparing the two writers is an uneven match yet this comparison is simply to demonstrate the immense amount of ridiculous double-crosses that occur in this film. When a new evil threatens the Vampire Brotherhood, his worst enemies ask for his hand at stopping this great-looking yet underdeveloped villain who feeds on all vampires. Nomak played by Brit Luke Goss, has an insatiable and unstoppable thirst for blood and as werewolves, those he feeds on join his army of Reapers'. These movie monsters are a cross between the Predator' character and the Jeepers Creepers' Monster, unfortunately, without the appeal of the previous aforementioned characters. And as the army greatens, so does the urgency of the need to stop this evil force.<br/><br/>     The film has Blade leading a pack of Vampires that have been trained to capture the very man they are being lead by. Through this tacky script ploy, one sees right through this dark, shallow and failed attempt at recreating the energy the first film delivered.      What is admirable about the film is the fact that Director Del Toro attempts at reinventing the Blade character and enjoys a healthy does of suspense and horror in the film. Unfortunately, this change does not fit the scheme of the film original Blade' film Director Stephen Norrington created.     The suspense and horror within the film come up short as the action becomes repetitive and the plot twists become migraine inducing. Furthermore, the overabundance of special effects becomes monotonous due to the careless overkill. For fans of the original seeking a campy action sequel filled with many pints of blood and guts and repetitive action sequences  they have found it. Yet, those seeking an inventive and creative film will have to study what other choices there are at the local multiplex. Director Del Toro directs his repetitive action sequences in a manner that leaves nothing to be dazzled at. The only noteworthy mention are his ambitious intentions at amalgamating live action with CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in order to beef-up' the Martial Arts sequences in which Blade leaves bodies decomposing on the floor. And just as a corpse decomposes with time, so does this film. It attempts at reinventing a pulse-pounding ride as the opening sequence in the first film demonstrated and completely loses track of its' intentions.      Furthermore, deceased characters within the first film inexplicably reappear in order to lend a little acting clout to the film. Kris Kristofferson returns as Whistler, Blade's right hand man who was shot to death in the first film and through a completely ludicrous explanation is somehow kept alive artificially. That is just one example of how far-fetched and how serious the filmmakers were at bringing us a sequel superior to the original. One last criticism of the film is the audacity to make Blade a more caring and nurturing protagonist.      One such example sees Blade saving the life of a female vampire by slitting his wrist in order for her to feed off him and rejuvenate herself. I am safe to say that the predominant male audience shared my opinion at their distaste of the sequence; the only difference was I was cussing to myself and not at the screen.      Therefore, as Hollywood rolls out another bad sequel, I write up another harsh, detailed criticism of a wretched attempt of filmmaking. And just as the film will lay the probability of a final and fatal blow to the Blade' franchise, so will it to the career of a once respected Wesley Snipes.<br/><br/>Giancarlo' s Rating: *1/2"

","If you like watching someone play doom for two hours this is the movie for you. The movie started out with Wesley Snipes killing vampires and continued all the way through to the end with little interruptions for some plot and dialog. I have better plots on my video games and the characters monolog comes really close to that in Blade 2. In the first part of the movie, it became known that silver bullets couldnt harm these creatures, but they continued to use these really cool guns that had no effect. I guess it wouldnt have too exciting if Blade carried around a flash light.  For the cliche ending where the bad guy and the good guy battle it out, they decide to beat each other to death, since 20,000 rounds of ammunition, and silver stakes that fired at the rate of 6000 fpms didnt seem to work. Whats up with these fight scenes where half the action is one giant blur. When I got up from my seat and looked around at the end of the movie I got the impression everyone in the whole theater felt the way I did, like we all just sat through 2 hours of watching someone playing a video game. On the plus side, the movie had good props and it looked good. ROGER EBERT  gave this film 3 1/2  stars and it doesnt even come close to other movies he gave 3 1/2 stars to, Back To The Future, Braveheart just to name a couple.

The problems I see with the movie:<br/><br/>1. Bad CG. I think Spiderman is going to have the same problem. Guys swinging around on the ceiling, jumping up and coming down that don't look the least bit real. Filmmakers need to realize that CG is only good on nonhuman stuff. When you try to replicate humans it usually looks like a cartoon.<br/><br/>2. Annoying supporting characters. Ron Perlman basically does the same role he had in ""Alien 4"". And what's up with Blade's assistant? Half his role is smoking, the other half is calling Blade ""B"".<br/><br/>3. Unimpressive soundtrack.

","Blade is back and harder than ever. I had the feeling that this time the creators have payed more attention to the choreography of the different action and fight scenes and less to the story. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on your taste for movies of course. Personally I liked the first one better (although it has been a long time since I saw it, so the way I see it may not be entirely correct), but I still like movies with a good story. I know many people will disagree with me, but different people, different opinions I guess.<br/><br/>In ""Blade II"" Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire council in order to combat the 'Reapers'. This is a rare mutation of vampires and they feed on vampires as well on humans, transforming the victims in Reapers themselves. The council has to admit that they aren't able to control the problem and that they need Blade's help. Together with The Bloodpack, an elite team of vampires trained in all modes of combat to defeat the Reaper threat, Blade will try to prevent the Reapers from wiping out the entire vampire and human population...<br/><br/>If you are looking for an adventure and action filled movie, than this is probably THE movie for you. It has plenty of it to offer and I'm sure that all the fans will love it. However, if you are, like me, more a fan of vampire films than action movies , then you might ask yourself why the first movie needed a sequel like this one? However, I also must say that I like the fact that they try an original and new approach to the centuries-old way of telling vampire tales. I'm not saying those should disappear, certainly not, but a new one now and then can make things even more interesting. Anyway, the movie left me a bit with a double feeling as you may understand. I give it a 6.5/10. It's OK, but could have been better."

","Whoever said that the original of a series is always the best, clearly had not seen Blade II!<br/><br/>Snipes is back, and oh my gosh is he incredible! I don't think the director could have casted an actor more suited for the role!<br/><br/>Blade II involves Blade fighting against the vampires again, however, he soon realises that the old adage ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is true when a new monster stalks the streets, known as Reapers. These creatures feed on vampires, and then humans, so Blade is forced to align with the vampires in order to fight against the Reapers.<br/><br/>From the start of the film, the adrenaline is pumping with Blade fighting multiple vampires, and coming to the rescue of an old friend whom is still alive!<br/><br/>Once again, the movie is excellently filmed with the different angles to capture the fight scenes and the music is amazing. Every fight scene is once again filmed perfectly, and this film contains one of my favourite ever action-movie fight scenes when Blade and the vampire council fight against the Reapers in a underground nightclub called 'The House of Pain', the name itself is epic!<br/><br/>Amazing.

Ron Perlman was a sensation...He truly made me hate him! and last but of course not least...Blade himself..truly perfection...Every thing about his portrayal was perfect. The tattoo's, the hair, the shades and of course the car. Kris Kristofferson was a major treat as well..And what CAN one say about Scud.. He totally tricked me out..dirt bag that he was..The woman who played Nissa was fabulous! She is gorgeous and I was kind of hoping that she would live and stay with Blade. There was one or two foul words that didn't need to be included.

"cherold","5","2","5","11 August 2004"," generally acceptable way to blow a couple of hours
","Blade II is basically decent.  It's got a few cool and/or effective moments, it keeps moving, and everything about it says ""basically adequate though uninspired action flick.""  Snipes makes an acceptable b-movie sort of action figure, with less presence than Vin Diesel but more talent than Chuck Norris.  Kristofferson is blandly adequate in his very generic role.  Ron Perlman is, of course, quite good, although the movie's characters let several good chances to kill him go by just so they can keep him around longer.  The minimal story is pretty much okay.  Some of the fight scenes are well-choreographed, although the finale is a bit too along the lines of a wrestling match.  <br/><br/>I watched it to the end and didn't feel overly restless, so if you just kind of like action pictures and it's on TV it's worth at least looking at.  But that's about the best I can say for it."

","This movie is full of action and pseudo-horror. The action itself may be well performed and the horror at least well meant, but the fact that there is nothing else beside it makes the movie such a boring one. Furthermore it is full of silly scenes of senseless violence that have been so idiotically exaggerated that I almost started to laugh (Which seemed to be their purpose; While on the other hand nobody in the cinema even snickered) . But in the end it was pity that I felt for this meaningless piece of a movie. It tried to be exciting, it tried to be shocking but having a plot mostly consisting of holes was meant to fail."

"jigglez","10","2","5","23 March 2002"," Startlingly surpasses the original!
","I had been looking forward to seeing this ever since I heard it was being made.  I was relatively skeptical, however.  Would the villain be as crisp and cool as Stephen Dorff?  Would the fight scenes and gore come in as many amounts as it did in the original? During the first fifteen minutes, one of my questions was answered.  This intense and extremely satisfying action sequence had already surpassed just about every fight scene in the original.  The vampires vaporized into burning dust in a much more glorified fashion, and Wesley Snipes found more unique ways to take them out.  This opening was truly eye-popping, and was a good sign of things to come. In general, the movie stayed that way.  The action scenes were smoothly intertwined with a storyline that had made a good progression from the first movie (Blade must team up with a group of vampires who had originally been trained to hunt and kill him to help them fight a new and dangerous enemy that feeds on both humans AND vampires).  The only thing that this one didn't have that the original had was the cool villain. Stephen Dorff was a more menacing villain than the creepy Nomak.  Not that Nomak wasn't menacing at all, but Deacon Frost had more of an entertaining badass factor.  But other than that, this movie had more action, more gore, and more bite overall than the first one.  Highly recommended!"
"Gambitt","5","2","5","23 March 2002"," Guess I always like the first one more
","Blade 1 had just the right amount of action, horror, gore, paper-thin plot, and cinematic style to create a movie that was entertaining for the masses yet still get some nods from weathered movie critics.  Blade II takes this balance and goes over the top, using outlandish fight-scenes, loads of CGI, plenty of blood-dripping, gut-mashing gore, and even a bit more expletive language in the script.<br/><br/>For a movie of this genre, the plot is needlessly complicated and drawn out, and there are a number of pointless plot twists thrown in towards the end. In the first movie, Blade made vampires look sadder than storm troopers, so new baddies were needed for the sequel.  Enter the reapers: vampire vampires that resemble the mutant love children of Nosferatu, Quasimodo, and Alien. So Blade teams up with the good vampires to fight the bad vampires. Sounds simple enough, right?  So why does it take over 2 hours to get through all the but-kicking?  It seems that lately there have been a number of action movies that have aspirations to be epic dramas.<br/><br/>This is an extremely violent and gorey film.  ""Black Mask"" comes to mind as a movie on par with Blade II on the violentometer.  Blade II features numerous disemboweling, dismemberment, and mutilation scenes.  The action scenes and fight sequences are fairly typical, though many are shot closer than I prefer similar to the confused fight scenes of Batman and Robin. Also, if you ever come face to face with a zombie, mummy, undead, ghoul, vampire, reaper etc... watch out!  Forget crosses, silver, or holy water. All monsters in this post-Matrix age are highly trained in Tae-Kwon-Jiu-Jit-Fu, WWF-style.<br/><br/>It wasn't all bad.  The movie succeeds as a thriller, making you jump at times.  The special ops vampire unit is an interesting lot, though none of them are developed enough for the audience to get attached.  Too bad Donnie Yen's talent was wasted.  If you're going to use a stereotypical Asian, sword-wielding, samurai character, then dangit at least let him kick a lot of but!<br/><br/>So in short, if you are a big fan of gorefest movies  (ie the type who grew up reading Fangoria), then Blade II will not disappoint.  If you like your movies to be a little more, or at least know their bounds and not pass them, then I would steer clear of Blade II.  My final rating is 5 / 10 (watchable, but mostly forgettable)."

The only gripe i had was that doctor Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) from the first movie was not even mentioned. Other then that i really liked the story. In addition to the good plot, the movie also had good character development, and smart dialog.<br/><br/>The Reapers are very well done with all the make up and digitzed effects. The make up work is top-notch and the special effects are very slick. The only problem i had with the computer segments is the battle between Blade and Nyssa. A small part of the fight sequence is digitized which made it a little bit unbelieveable.

","This movie was good because Whistler was in it!  Sure, Blade was good but Whistler stole the movie.  Whistler had all the good lines and fought really good.  What I liked most was when Whistler would get mad at Scud or that one Vampire and call them names like NIPPLEHEAD.  Whistler questioned Blade a few times but that was just because he was like a father figure and just looking out for him.  What I liked about Blade 2 was that the bad vampires looked like Nosferatu.  It's been way too long since we've had a good Vampire flick where the blood suckers truly look like Nosferatu.  That is where Blade 1 lacked.  If you're going to make a movie about Vampires then make them look like monsters, not some GQ person from the makeup department. Whistler never fails to deliver.  Kris always plays that role well.  Too bad he didn't get nominated for a best supporting actor award in Blade 1. Perhaps this will be the year for Whistler.  Also, what's the deal with that good looking Vampire dying at the very end?  It was too emotional and made me think of Kirsten Dunst from Interview w/ Dracula.  All in all this was an ok movie.  Whistler made it watchable."

"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","2","6","29 March 2002"," Yet another disappointing sequel
","Let's just remember what made Blade such a cool movie, before thinking about this sequel. We had impressive visuals, cool action, a charismatic and hypercool bad guy, an underdog saving the world scenario, some genuinely surprising and gripping scenes (the intro, and Blade's peculiar way of regenerating before the final battle) all blended into a stylish movie.<br/><br/>Let's just look what Blade 2 has to offer: Impressive visuals, cool action,.... Ooops. We ran out of things to praise. Especially the first twenty minutes suck, being a poor and disjointed connection of scenes needed to define the enemy, reunite Whistler and Blade, introduce the wacky sidekick, and team Blade up with some vampires. And, worst of all, the movie employs that ancient and least original trick to clear some backstory: a narrating voice (Blade) explaining the setting during the start credits.<br/><br/>
The story is a bit simple: New monster vampires with weird slimy mouths begin eating vampires, vampires get Blade, Blade helps them hunt down the mutated vampires and try to track down their leader. Now, every single one of the mutated vampires looks identical. So much for charismatic bad guy. They look and move like a halfway-combo between the pygmy mummies out of ""The mummy returns"" and the zombies in ""Night of the Living Dead"". And they're immune to silver and garlic and pretty much any physical force. But all in all, they're a weak solution of the type ""if our bad guy is not nearly as charismatic or cool as the previous one, let's at least make him invincible, ugly and disgusting, and give him an army"". Slime instead of charisma - might satisfy some people, but I felt it ruined the class of the movie.<br/><br/>The action is good, there's no doubt about it. There's lots of kung-fu style fighting and shooting and exploding vampires and it's even well done, even if slightly too fast-paced. The only glitch: Blade is posing way too much. We know he's cool, we know he can pose, but does he really need to to it twice as often and twice as obviously as the original one?<br/><br/>All in all, an average movie. The original had class and style and it was fresh and original. This is just ""How to make a sequel for dummies"" with a bigger budget, and no style whatsoever.<br/><br/>5/10"

This makes the first film seem Oscar-worthy by comparison. Unless you're a BLADE completist, wait for cable. PS: do I NEED to mention this is not a film for children?

","Nowadays, we live in the golden age of superhero movies where great films of the kind are always around the corner. This film was made at a time that now seems like ancient history when it comes to superhero movies. I didn't like how I wasn't familiar with any of the characters. I went through the Marvel Encyclopedia and don't remember seeing any of these guys. It works much better as just a standard action movie. It's often fight scene after fight scene with vampires being killed over and over.<br/><br/>There is still much better creativity in this movie than most of the Transformers films. They do at least manage to expand on the vampire mythology. I knew that was the guy who played Daryl from ""The Walking Dead""! I personally didn't care for the original Blade movie. I felt this was better as I was more accustomed to the setting and it didn't feel like they were just repeating stuff. Dozens of better superhero movies exist now, but as an early film, this wasn't half bad. I admit some of the effects don't hold up that well. ***"
"AlienatorX","10","1","2","4 April 2016"," Just what this franchise needed
","Guillermo Del Toro. I am a HUGE fan of this guy, he is a creative force and one of the most versatile creative directors working today. After the success of the first Blade film a sequel of course got under way and the studio hired Del Toro to helm it, this was an odd choice at the time since Del Toro wasn't a household name but in retrospect it was a genius move because it took an awesome movie hampered by a cliché mythos and gave it over to a director who thrives on mythos. Before I can talk about the rest of the movie I have to talk about my favourite aspect of it. The Reapers. Good god I love these things; I love how they're look is inspired by Nosferatu, I love how their lower jaw splits open to became a bug like mouth, I love how they feed on both Vampires and humans, I love how they run sideways and on all fours like old Hollywood gorillas, I love the only Vampire weakness they retain is their weakness to sun, and most of all I love the scene where actually dissect one and we are allowed to see what makes them tick. Del Toro goes out of his way to make these things as alien as possible, not just in the way they look but in the way they behave, as one of the Vampires remarks ""they're as different from us as we are from humans"", in typical Del Toro style there's something beautiful about them and yet profoundly disturbing at the same time. Everything that was good about the first film is here and better, the action is better, the story is better with higher stakes and all kinds of fun twists and turns, the acting is phenomenal; Wesley Snipes has allowed the Blade character to loosen up a bit and the other actors are all fun especially Ron Perlman, I also love the Elder Vampire Eli Damaskinos who is a classic monster inspired again by Nosferatu, a welcome change from the cliché 'vampire council' from the first film. This movie is great across the board, a great film for superhero film fans, action movie fans, sci-fi movie fans, fantasy movie fans, horror movie fans, Del Toro fans and fans of good cinema in general."
"SnoopyStyle","5","1","2","23 May 2014"," Close call but a couple of things bothered me
","Blade (Wesley Snipes) rescues Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from one of the vampire's tanks and turns him back into human. Scud (Norman Reedus) is Blade's new human sidekick. There is a new form of mutant vampires called The Reaper. They are even more powerful than the regular vampires. Blade must form an alliance with the Shadow Council to battle this new threat. He teams up with the elite vampire team The Bloodpack.<br/><br/>The new type of vampires look alright. There is more CGI blood and a higher body count. The fights are back. I guess if blood, kills, and fights are what you're looking for. And why not. Then this movie has it all and more of it. However I don't particularly like the CGI fights. They look like a video game. I always prefer the real hand-to-hand combat stunts. The other thing that irked me is the quick return of Whistler. While it's understandable to revive Whistler, it was done so quickly that it strikes a sour note. Those are annoying enough for me to marginally vote this down."
"vjlgerv","7","1","2","24 November 2009"," Almost!!!
","Blade nears vampirifection. Blade II could have been that impressive too, if the limping Whistler did not flee away from savage Reinhardt, all the guards and high security systems to help his protégé free, which is hard to swallow and screw up the movie which was so good so far. Blade should have been helped by Nyssa instead whose live he just saved twice, or Scud role should have been a little more extended. <br/><br/>Another thing that really irks in the closing of this movie in this sequel is the thrashing that Blade gets from the half vampire killer and half failed Damaskinos experience, Nomack! In the case of Frost, in the first movie we understand that 'The Magra' has been awaken after the blood rituals and sacrifice of the pure bloods, including the unwilling contribution of Blade himself. But not the sick Nomack, it does not make sense really: when he should have delivered Nomack the death dance, Blade gets the worst beating of all the three movies, which is again counter flow to the movie. <br/><br/>I think they should have made the most of the confusion that the daughter of Damaskinos was going through at that very moment: that is the turmoil from the growing gratitude & appreciation she started to feel for Eric her savior though her established enemy and the fresh discovery of her father's betrayal and mercilessness towards his own flesh & blood. Of course, the movie would have been fifteen minutes or so longer but Blade escape would have make sense with the movie flow so far, which like I said was as captivating as the first one. <br/><br/>But, sadly they made a mess with that very part of the movie and we the Blade fans we have to make with our disappointments. Some viewers blame it on Leonor Varela, Nyssa, but i think she plays her role very well and never infringes on Blade authority like Nomack, but brings the necessary contrast without excessiveness to the plot."
"Quebec_Dragon","7","1","2","17 July 2009"," Slick vampiric action
","Technically and visually, it's awesome. The director is great at making action look cool. The fight scenes are fast, sharp and exciting, probably helped a lot by the choreography of Donnie Yen (although he was not alone). The actors were obviously replaced by computer graphics a few times but it's not too bad. One of the best parts of the film is the blood pack, a team of vampires. They might not be developed very much but they have killer looks and moves. The story had a promising concept, a new strain of vampires hunting traditional vampires, and their design was very good and creepy, especially the mouth. However, the action eclipses the story by a fair margin and there's not much plot development nor is it likely you will care much about the few dramatic elements. Wesley Snipes as Blade shows amazing physical prowess but almost always wearing his dark glasses is almost as stoic as Arnold in the Terminator movies. This is interesting to see as a stepping stone for talented director Del Toro's future projects: the 2 Hellboys and Pan's Labyrinth. It's also a decent sequel to the first Blade without as much character development but stronger action and visual design. It's worth a rental and perhaps a buy if you're a Benicio Del Toro's or Blade fan. It's leagues above the rather poor third installment and it's where you see how much a director makes the difference.<br/><br/>Rating: 6.5 out of 10"

I loved the first Blade, it had vampires, they could go out into sunlight wearing sunblock, and there was a vampire council who were all born vampires who were in charge of everything, government, police etc. Blade 2 introduced the Reapers, being who feed on vampires and humans, when vampires are bitten they turn into Reapers, who are immune against garlic, and silver. Only Sunlight can kill them.<br/><br/>The Vampire Council enlists Blades help to track down Nomak - a Reaper vampire who is rapidly spreading Reapers across the city, and he must lead ""The Blood Pack"", a group of well trained vampire soldiers funded by the council to track them down. The guy who plays Nomak had his acting done perfectly, Wesley Snipes is good, and Kris Kristofferson reprises his role as Whistler.<br/><br/>An Excellent sequel, that offers kick ass martial fight scenes, and CG that is done perfectly and very realistic, you can barely notice it compared to silly movies today like Star Trek and Terminator Salvation, watch this, The story is original and just awesome, I would Recommend!"

The ranks of the uber-vampires fail to impress, rarely looking threatening except for their progenitor in his fights with Blade.<br/><br/>Despite the promise of the interaction between vampire hunter and vampire forced by circumstance to work together, the enmity disappears to a great extent, although the payoff of the Blade - Reinhardt dynamic does raise the game a little. Worst of all, the film ends tamely, failing to recompense the viewer for the investment of their time.<br/><br/>Watch the original instead."

","I saw the sequel on DVD while I was staying in a hospital. I couldn't sit through the whole movie cause I was ill and the movie made things worse, not a movie to watch while in pain. This has got to be the darkest, goriest, bloodiest, comic book action flick by far. Just looking at the reapers freak the hell out of me. The sword fight in the beginning should not be missed, but thats pretty much my favorite part of the movie. I wanted to see the fearless hunter ""Snowman"" played by D.Y., perform some really awesome moves except because there's too many damn people in the pack which means 5 minute scenes each. Bummer. I like the original cause it was Blade versus all, while the sequel was just a bunch of people taking turns scene after scene. What's also funny, once they discover U.V. lights can kill reapers, why don't they just wear lights all over their bodies? Why waste ammo and getting kicked around when all you need is Energizer?"

","Whereas the original Blade was an edgy, dark thriller with awesome, real, action sequences, the sequel is almost comic-like, with enhanced special effects and well-choreographed fight sequences. However, the plot and the characters are wafer-thin and the Reapers, the new bad guys, are hardly given any substance to. Wesley Snipes is about the only thing that carries the movie as he really suits the character. Unfortunately, every other character has only a few moments to establish themselves before we move into another extended fight sequence. Overall, an average sequel, but do watch it if you liked the original Blade"

","Crafted with an over-the-top, stylish visual style, Blade II is a surprisingly enjoyable, solid sequel. In this second outing, the ""daywalker"" Blade continues to hunt the vampires around the world as he tracks down the whereabouts of his turned-vampire partner, Whistler. Soon, he's contacted by the Vampire Nation to lead an elite team in a search-and-destroy mission of a newly fangled strain of vampires known as Reapers, vampires who feed on vampires. But everything is not as it seems. Spanish director Guillermo Del Toro energizes this sequel with a swift use of CGI effects: You've never seen disintegrating vampires as pretty as you'll see here. There are also clever gadgets, such as the UV hand grenade. And the fighting sequences do not dissapoint, mixing furious martial arts moves with CGI-enhanced ""Matrix"" styled effects. Wesley Snipes kicks vampire ass and takes names. And its enjoyable watching him do it. The script by David Goyer never lets up, quickly and decidedly racing forward as a good action film should. This is a sequel that lives up to the original in tone and style. Those seeking depth should look elsewhere; this is a fast-paced 'popcorn' flick done well. Blade II is a good, stylish vampire action fun."

But the film was poor. There was too much loud music, dark lights and far too much action. Now, I love action as much as the next person but every good film needs some dialogue and plot in between the action. Even the Bond films have quiet scenes in between all the action. Blade II gave me a headache.<br/><br/>No-one-with the exception of Blade and the Whistler-were interesting. Even the villains of the film didn't turn out to be as formidable as I thought they would be.

Blade is supposed to, I suppose, to be the good guy. But to me he is just a dark and dull character with about five lines in the whole movie.

For whatever reason the writers couldn't 'complete her storyline', they could have at least added some sort of explanation as to what happened to her so us Blade fans could have some closure.  That left me feeling like there was a big hole in this movie.<br/><br/>The storyline was OK but still, not as exciting as the original Blade. Definitely more gory though.

It is not however like most action movies- Wesley Snipes is in rare form, both in the attitude of the character he portrays and is physically at his best. Director Guillermo Del Toro is at an all time high, especially when stacked next to ""Mimic"". Some may criticise this movie for it's terribly unrealistic fighting scenes. This, however, is not a fair criticism since the action sequences in question are between supernatural creatures- anything is possible. The final virtue in this movie worth noting is the ending- similar to the first, it ended very well.<br/><br/>

","Sequels are always tough but I personally love sequels, sometimes even a bad sequel is good just because you missed the characters.  Blade 2 brings Wesley Snipes back as a kick-butt action hero who is also part Vampire...how can you go wrong with a story line like that?  I will say Blade 2 doesn't touch how good Blade was.  Blade was a deep story, packed with action, and depth, and was so fascinating and dark.  Blade 2 keeps it's dark appearance which is very good...I would hate to see Blade go soft on us.  It's a relief that they also went out of their way to bring back Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who gives us a anti-hero...something just not right about his character and yet he's like Blade's only weakness because of his love for his mentor and father-figure.  In this story, Blade is approached by the Vampires seeking his help this time.  Something is hunting the Vampires and ripped them to shreds and in the process creating something worse than a Vampire.  They are called Reapers.  Blade agrees to join a squad of mercenary Vamp killers who were trained to kill him originally and work with them to rid the world of these Reapers who will eventually turn on humans. Blade still doesn't let his guard down and doesn't trust his new allies. This is the basis of the story.  The story is very shallow and could have been written so much better.  It had so much potential and I just think they got through it as quickly as possible.  Fortunately for them it's action packed, and the fight sequences are still pretty good.  But for the most part the savior is Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson returning in their roles.  They save the movie they make it worth while because they are just great super hero's.  Otherwise the movie is lost in RIDICULOUS special effects, that I could do sitting at home in front of my Desktop computer. The effects are computer generation and they show, you can pin point exactly where the real people end and AI takes over.  It's annoying and campy.  The music is just absolutely lost in this one.  In the original Blade the music is unbelievably complimenting the story line and Blade.  It's thumping and exciting and makes you heart race.  In this one, the music is barely a part of it.  Blade's sudden use of a magical gun that explodes Vampires into little computerized sparkles of dust is just plain stupid.  Now can you believe after all those things I just listed that I would still tell you to go see this movie???  As I said, the original characters make it worth while and some of the new Vamps are interesting.  I sincerely hope they carry on the Blade franchise but I hope they go back to the original Blade to continue from and not Blade 2.  Definately go see it for action and just because Blade rocks but don't be surprised if it's not quite what the first one was.  I give it a 7/10"
"jamesgardiner1","7","1","2","15 April 2002"," Entertaining movie with some obvious holes.
","I am not one who really likes action movies but for a change, Blade II did the trick for me. Wesley Snipes is very good as the Blade character and pulls it off well. Some of the concepts were good, like the bloodpack and dna splicing to create reapers, however the bloodpack fails in many regards. Their internal squabbling with Blade is one storyline thumb down; as well two of the bloodpack earlier on in the movie have a big fight scene with Blade and they are super hero like. However, for the rest of the movie, they don't display any of those super hero like talents. They along with the rest of the bloodpack, simply act very unspecial like and are used like extras waiting their turn to be killed.<br/><br/>Overall it is a good but somewhat lacking movie 7/10."

Blade 2 is just atrocious. WHY? It shouldn't be, it has the same script writer (David Goyens) and a seemingly bigger budget. But it looks cheaper. The acting is atrocious and believe it or not it is actually really badly dubbed in some scenes (why was it dubbed to begin with?).<br/><br/> It looks very cheap. Badly lit, cheap 80's stylisation and very few fight sequences- we spend more time with the blood pack (rubbish breed of semi vampires) and plot set-ups that fall into place later in the film, that dominate over action (ignore reviews that say Blade 2 ups the ante on action- we see Blade kick ass three times and it's seems to miss out on the originals self conscious sense of coolness). The original had a really frenetic pace and a hero in Blade who was too cool for school but was also fairly angst driven. In this he spends half the time insulting the blood pack and investigating fancy gadgets and not nearly enough time getting down to business.<br/><br/> The truth is Blade was just a few steps behind the Matrix (in terms of the modernisation of it's fight sequences which actually came out before the Matrix). BLADE 2 looks and feels remarkably similar to a cross between Alien Resurrection (right down to the appearance of Ron Perlman who plays a very> similar character in both) and an episode of the A Team (if it ever featured vampires).<br/><br/> Admittedly the effects of the Reapers are excellent (but are severely underused) as is the creative spin on the CGI driven fight sequences (these are quite remarkable in never-before-seen ways, but are also severely underused).

"EdYerkeRobins","5","1","3","23 March 2002"," Thrills? Yes. Style? A little. Substance? NO!
","There are two kinds of vampire movies: those that present the vampire as a dark, soulful, mysterious, troubled being, and those where they're just fodder for ass-kickings from uber-cool vampire hunters.  ""Blade II"" is, like ""Blade"", definitely in the latter category.  It's also the kind of film that works solely as a cheap thrill, enjoyable for the moments watching it in the theatre without any lasting impression.<br/><br/>	""Blade II"" is full of one thing, and that is Wesley Snipes killing lots of vampires.  Not just everyday vampires, mind you, but a new breed of super-vampires called Reapers.  The Reapers are such a threat that Snipes is joined not only by old friend Whistler (a returning Kris Kristofferson) and new assistant Scud, but also by a vampire task force, a motley crew who look interesting enough but not-so-surprisingly provide very little help to Snipes in any of the film's multitude of fight scenes.  They also make lots more Reapers very fast, which also helps because it provides a lot of fodder for the film's multitude of fight scenes.<br/><br/>	Now that it's been established that the core of the movie is composed of fight scenes, the question becomes are the fight scenes enjoyable? Exciting, thrilling, and absurdly unrealistic (director Guillermo del Toro replaced the live actors with computer-generated body doubles so they could do what no real actor could  its just a shame that the transition from live actor to CG body is so obvious), the one-on-one fight scenes are a sight to behold (particularly when Blade uses wrestling movies in a climactic battle, after running up walls and jumping what looks like 20 feet in the air), but, like in any other film, anti-climactic sequences where Blade takes on large groups of Reapers single-handedly without batting an eyelash get old very fast.  Seeing vampire after vampire vanish into CG smoldering ash and bones is impressive the first time, but after seeing it time and time again, one will leave the theatre in a sort of trance, the only thoughts on their mind being, ""Too many computer graphics...""<br/><br/>	This is really a shame because there's some beautiful direction and unexpectedly good story in ""Blade II"".  Del Toro, following up his acclaimed ""Devil's Backbone"" and considerably less acclaimed ""Mimic"", has crafted a beautiful dark atmosphere.  An interesting mixture of technology and gothic architecture, it fits the film and its characters perfectly.  Scenes in an underground series of tunnel-like enclosures have great use of shadow, even giving a sense of mystery to something as obvious as a roving pack of Reapers seen in the background creeping along the ceiling and walls of a corridor towards a character.  David Goyer crafted a much more significant and engrossing story (when all is revealed at the end, its surprisingly smart) this time around, albeit with some occasionally really dumb dialogue. It really kills the dark tone of the setting and movie if the audience (myself included) is laughing at the protagonists' lines (Whistler was especially bad at this, lashing petty insults at the vampires at every opportunity).  Unfortunately, since the action takes precedence, very little of these two great traits come off as more than afterthoughts.<br/><br/>	""Blade II"" is a little too action packed.  As enjoyable as seeing Wesley Snipes killing lots of vampires is, when that seems to be the only draw it's enjoyable for all the wrong reasons.  The film's other aspects are good and would've been really great had they been developed, but these were shelved for action that is good enough for a quick thrill but cheapens the film so it doesn't leave a lasting impression.  Is this a terrible thing? Not really, but it's a little disappointing.  If quick thrills are all you are interested in, ""Blade II"" is a good fix, but if you want more substance in a film look someplace else."
"fred-287","Null","1","3","28 March 2002"," The sadness of vampirism
","The great English writer Graham Greene used to be a film critic back in the 1930s, & in one of his reviews he described how in a certain movie an actor had captured ""not just corruption but the sadness of corruption, a mind in chains...""  Sadness seems to be G. del Toro's forte.  His ""Cronos"" had a haunting elegiac quality that has stuck with me for years, something ancient and mournful and beautiful like his native Mexico itself, & his American debut ""Mimic"" had a similar quality, enhanced of course by the lustrous Mira Sorvino.  Yet ""Mimic"" also had enough horrorshow bells-&-whistles to keep the Yank audiences entranced--even Siskel & Ebert raved about it, they recognized the primal level it tapped.<br/><br/>Ultimately what's the most horrifying thing about vampirism?  Isn't it that you're neither one thing nor the other?  You're human-but-not, alive-but-not, doomed to an eternity of consciousness with nothing more to achieve but the next hemaglobin fix.  You know you're a monster, a freak of nature, but there's nothing else for you to be.  So you make the most of that.  The seminal ""Near Dark"" pioneered the vampire-as-badass-antihero concept.  TV's ""Buffy"" & ""Angel"" rendered it cartoonish.  Del Toro has reinvigorated it.<br/><br/>The first ""Blade"" deserves credit for some bold notions: vampirism as a virus; a ""caste system"" of ""purebloods"" as opposed to ""mixed blood"" or those who were merely ""turned"" --the most memorable line from ""Blade"" was Udo Kier's ""I was born a vampire, as was every member of this council""--it'd never occurred to me before that that one could be a vampire from conception onward, I mean imagine the vampire parents ""He's a little cranky, he's been fanging""---the re-introduction of silver & garlic as anti-vampire tools; the ""corporate"" aspect.  Yet the original suffered from twin limitations: it never ventured beyond the comic-book realm, & it's bad-guys were terminally lame, chiefly Stephen Dorff.  He was okay in ""City of Industry"" as a cocky punk.  He was okay in some other movie in a similar role.  But a vampire??? Threatening the entire world, yet???   Gimme a break.<br/><br/>
But with ""Blade II"" we're in the realm of the sad & the ancient.  Not just because it's filmed in a history-soaked European city--it's the desperation & black-humor at play.  The opening blood-bank scene sets the tone perfectly. I won't give it away, although it's probably no secret by now. But it alerts us we're in for something different.  A dark corner of the soul is about to be explored.  After that one may opt to stick around for the ride, or not.  Sure there's the computerized stuff that everyone has noted, & other aspects.  But beneath the audience-grabbing bells & whistles, this is a movie about sadness, & desperation, & despair.  The recently late Billy Wilder said ""If you want to say something important, wrap it in chocolate""--or in this case, If you want to say something bleak, wrap it in SFX.<br/><br/>I've been deliberately avoiding specifix.  Others have said ""This is great,"" ""This sucks,"" ""This looks like Nosferatu"" or ""The Matrix"" etc.  I myself thought the movie's vampire-boss looked a little too much like Mark Metcalf as the Master in ""Buffy"" a few years back.  And a few other quibbles. (Del Toro borrows chiefly from himself, too bad we don't have ""auteurs"" any more.)  But bottom line, this flick REALLY got under my skin.  I'd never figured I'd cry at the end of a vampire flick, but damn, there's even some emotional resonance there.  Again, the inescapable sadness.  I think that's the true genius of the whole vampire shtick, whether it's from Bram Stoker or elsewhere--not seeing the sun.  If there's anything more beautiful on this planet than a sunset, it's a sunrise.  I was out for a walk before dawn one morning recently & passed a little pond with some ducks on the surface, still largely in silhouette with the sun venturing up from behind the trees; I'd like to retain that image until I die.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong, this is still a ""popcorn flick,"" it would never be nominated for an oscar (thank god) but if you see it, it'll stick.  You may even want to see it again.  I probably will.  Filmmakers are the modern alchemists.  Mr. Del Toro, from our ancient, sad & beautiful southern neighbor, has much to show us.  I say it's a ride worth taking.  There's always the bright new safe amusement park next door.<br/><br/>PS If Wesley Snipes wants to make this a franchise character, it's okay with me, maybe he'll make enough to where he'll be game for another ""arty"" little project like ""The Water Dance...""  Meanwhile---YOU GO, BOY!"

","I found it slightly better and more entertaining than the original 'Blade', albeit not by much. The special effects here are really great, but there is far too much blood, too many long and unnecessary 'ballet' scenes and generally far too much 'shoot-em-up' footage for my taste. When you think of it, in order to kill the vampires, you don't really need all those weapons, martial arts knowledge, etc. All you need is a flashlight with a good battery! Maybe I am being overly pragmatic here, but even as I wish for films that go over the top (surely, the movies are and remain a 'dream factory'), I would also like them try to make some sense at the same time. Otherwise it can get to be annoying."
"freemantle_uk","9","1","4","7 December 2009"," Best of the Blade films
","To some people the release of Blade was a watershed in comic book films, leading to a more serious tones in the genre. I personally think the real watershed film was Bryan Singer's X-Men, but that doesn't stop the first Blade film being an enjoyable film and still important film the vampire and action genres. The first Blade film was very successful with only a modest budget, a sequel seemed to make good business sense. New Line ensured that it kept their star and writer of the first film and comic book fan David S. Goyer. They also hired a top director, Guillermo del Toro to ensure it was more then a simple cash-in.<br/><br/>Two years after the events of Blade, our hero (Wesley Snipes) is on the search for his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) in Eastern Europe. Whisper had been held hostage by the vampires, who Blade assumed had killed himself to avoid becoming a vampire. Blade is able to rescue Whistler and reform the team with their new member Scud (Norman Reedus). Within the vampire world a new enemy has be born, the Reapers. The Reapers feed on vampires, have all their strengths, but can resist garlic and silver. Sunlight is their only weakness. They are lead by Jared Nomak (Luke Goss), but the Reapers are an almost zombie like creature, needing to feed daily to survive. The vampire nation offers Blade a truce; to help them destroy the Reapers before they become a threat to humanity. He offered to lead a team called the Bloodpack, a special team that were meant to kill Blade. Included in this team are Nyssa Damaskinos (Leonor Varela), daughter of the vampire leader, and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), a vampire who has a particular dislike for Blade. The teams unite to stop the powerful Reapers.<br/><br/>They is a good mix of a dark serious tone that made the first film really good, but with a decent mix of humour and one-lines to balance things out and make Blade II a excellent action film. Del Torro directs some fantastic action and fight sequences, but also brings his own style to the film. It shows he has a good eye for this type of film. He also adds some horror moments which another strength of his. He makes a first paced, entertaining film.<br/><br/>The theme of enemies uniting to face a greater foe is nothing new. It was done in X-Men 2 (which was released a year later), in Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series, in computer games like the newer Sonic games, Bond films, the lists goes on. But it was done well in this film, and there are plot twists and betrayals in this film. There is also good interplay between Wesley Snipes and Ron Perlman (who latter works with Del Torro in Hellboy).<br/><br/>The first Blade film deals with a almost religious element of the vampire world with the re-birth of the Blood God. In Blade II Goyer tackles the issue from the other direction, a scientific view of vampirism as a virus, and the idea of evolution. We also get to see more of the vampire's world in this film and less of the human world. I like the idea of modernising the vampire myth.<br/><br/>There is a good cast. Wesley Snipes is perfect as Blade, both as a somber character, as a fighter and knows how to deliver a one-liner. Kris Kristofferson returns to the mix and is decent. Ron Perlman as already mention a fine member of the cast, so is Luke Goss as the villain and the fine German actor Thomas Kretschmann as the leader of the vampires.<br/><br/>Finally the soundtrack is very fitting for the film.<br/><br/>An entertaining film for Blade, comic book, material arts and vampire fans."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","4","28 August 2009"," A different flavor
","I base this on the Special Edition DVD release. When a strange and aggressively reproducing breed of vampire turns up, Blade finds himself forming an alliance, which is born out of necessity and very unstable, with his life-long enemies. This makes for an interesting and fresh situation for the film series, and the dynamics, how the uncomfortable group relates to each other, does lead to some nice moments. The bad-ass factor is back and kicking, though it kind of gets to be over the top at points. Maybe that was the idea, I guess. Ron adds a lot to it, obviously, the man could render anything awesome, and him and Wesley are impeccable together. The ego-stroking is absolutely ridiculous, and this is so full of testosterone that the audience is likely to drown in it during the viewing, but there are dramatic instances, too, and the conflict between the two sides working together definitely doesn't cease to be tense or cool during the running time. This is paced well, with quite a lot of build-up as well as action(and every sequence of that feels unique from the rest in the movie, and they tend to rock), and it's certainly never boring. Instead of attempting to top the opening of the first(let's be honest, the rest of that film didn't manage that, and with good reason), this chooses another route, and thus also does a fantastic job of setting the tone, as it is not the same as Norrington's entry. While what you prefer is up to the individual, it's tough to claim that these aren't both marvelous, pun intended. This is more playful, intentionally cheesy, and the horror aspect gets used to a greater extent. There is genuine suspense in this. The effects are far superior to those of the original, if whether or not you care for the new way the death ones look is subjective. Dialog is pretty well-done. The story is magnificent again, if at least one subplot is awkwardly half-way cut out, leaving odd moments that don't stand on their own. Acting is mostly impressive. The music is spot-on, at least the equal of the 1998 flick, and possibly better. There is strong language, disturbing content and bloody, brutal violence in this. On the two discs are three audio tracks(a commentary with a Frankfurt and Del Toro, who is amusing, one with Goyer and Snipes, who is hilarious, and an ""isolated score"" one), the ""press kit"", several featurettes(the one that distinguishes itself is The Blood Pact, a documentary of around 90 minutes, which I will review on its own page here on the site), deleted/alternate scenes that you can watch with or without the director and producer's thoughts, all of which are informative. Finally, there's an art gallery, a ""survival guide"" for the tie-in video-game, a music video, a teaser and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Guillermo's style and/or of the franchise. Noteworthy sequels are a rare sight, and this certainly deserves recognition for helping to combat that unpleasant truth. 7/10"

","Well once again i am satisfied with the works of the creators of the blade trilogy. This was even better then the first one, with plenty of cool stuff to watch. Featuring awesome vampires with cool mouths, blade himself, the half vampire hunter and whistler again, as well as a host of other characters, this film is satisfying to the eyes. This time blade is working with the vampires to exterminate a greater threat: vampires with cool mouths. As a result, it contains the usual array of bodies being chopped up, body parts breaking, tasers zapping and much much more. It also has some interesting plot twists, (i said interesting, not amazing) and some new characters thrown in to make it more exciting."

","Well....what can I say about this one? A real let-down of a movie....what I would expect of a sequel which is upsetting considering just how excellent the first movie was. The special effects were excellent, as ever, but the acting seemed rather apathetic and the story was somehow flimsy. It left me cold, lacking the original thrust and 'Matrix' style techno feel of Blade. Such a shame when a change of director completely changes the feel of a theme. Luckily I stuck with it and was more than pleasantly surprised by Trinity....a most excellent movie with the best comedy lines that I've heard in a long time. I await the fourth with bated breath...."
"FilmOtaku","6","1","4","10 December 2004"," Not as good as the first, but still a decent flick
","As Scud (Norman Reedus), an armory expert who Blade has employed since we last saw him in the original ""Blade"" says, ""Lock up your daughters boys and girls, the dark knight returns."" Blade (Wesley Snipes) is back, and this time, he is forced to form an uneasy alliance with the Shadow Council, the elite group of vampires he normally is fighting to eliminate. The reason is that there is a new mutation of vampire in the population that is spreading rapidly, vampires called ""Reapers"" who feed on other vampires. Blade is talked into helping the Shadow Council find and kill the Reapers because once they run out of vampires, the logical progression would be to move on to humans. Blade is assisted in this endeavor by The Bloodpack, a group of highly trained vampires employed by the Shadow Council who have ironically been training the last two years solely in the art of killing Blade himself. We also see the return of Whistler, (Kris Kristofferson) and the introduction of the aforementioned Scud.<br/><br/>In terms of story, ""Blade II"" is pretty good. The constant tension between The Bloodpack and Blade provide both dramatic and hilarious moments alike, particularly between Blade and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman). There seemed to be more humor overall in this film, and it was done well. Director Guillermo del Toro (""Hellboy"") gives us a film that is full of style and some pretty cool monsters, (and great makeup) but some of the special effects used during the fight scenes in particular were mediocre at best. Perhaps, being a film fan who doesn't put action films at the forefront of her film preferences, I am being a little simplistic in my views, but I often question why, if something just doesn't look good on the screen, an alternate method of presenting that scene isn't used. I'm referring mainly to the fight scene between Blade and one of the Shadow Council messengers that takes place in front of a wall of lights where the CGI figures looked ridiculously cartoonish. Again, I am merely an observer of action films, not a lover of them, so perhaps my view is too plebeian.<br/><br/>""Blade II"" was another enjoyable popcorn flick that falls into the usual sequel category  not as good as the original, but in this case, it is at least an enjoyable, fun movie to watch. 6/10 --Shelly"

Nope what is shocking is the story, the acting, the CGI and the film itself.<br/><br/>Blade was a good film - not a great one - but a good action flick. This one is awful. Scud is the most annoying character I have come across for ages - and it was with utter relief when he went pop! I could rattle endlessly on about the obvious inconsistencies - like vampires searching in attics with a torch - when they can see in the dark. The CGI is very poor and obviously stands out. The actors are not helped by a see through plot - and Wesley Snipes doesn't get the opportunities to bring the character to life it deserves.<br/><br/>The ""twist"" that some people have alluded to is SO obvious its untrue. Its a real shame. The whole film smacks of being a gloriously bad sequel in the true sense of films that go one film to far. MI2 anyone? So its poor. Really poor.

","BLADE II lays claim to being even more comic-bookish than the first film in this series; and better, to boot. While I'll always contend that Blade- the character- was ""inspired by"" the movie GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE (in which William Smith plays the half human-half vampire son of vampire Michael Pataki, who rapes a human woman in an open grave), the filmmakers who opted to bring the character to the big screen committed a cardinal sin when they tricked him out with a variety of automatic and semi-automatic weapons. In the comics, he carried wooden stakes, which sufficed. In the movie(s), wooden stakes never enter into it. Go figure. BLADE II has several things going for it: a sometimes frenetic pace... and the director, Guillermo Del Toro. If nothing else, Del Toro's participation automatically means that the movie will look great: he incorporates the Mario Bava and Dario Argento influences that have given his movies a most distinctive look. The vampires, too, prefigure the creatures in THE STRAIN (the teleseries) and The House of Pain has to be seen to be believed (it's where vampires go ""to feel something,"" which takes on a whole new meaning when you're a vampire and you have what amounts to super powers). The ending is identical to the ending of a script I submitted to the first season of TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE (titled VAMPYRE, about an undercover cop who goes all the way by allowing himself to be bitten by a vampire), another reason I really liked this one."

As usual, there is non stop action and very fast, fluidic vampire ass kicking with little subtlety and plot. Abraham Whistler is also reintroduced, seems he survived being turned before shot and all, but in this movie, he is much more of a loser than in the previous. Snipes himself does'nt seem to respect him as much. There are a few original ideas (concerning action of course) and a few good moments but this movie isn't great.

Maybe it was Whistler's revival that was too awkward, or the Bloodpack being strange or the fact the part of Asad was over acted.

But as the film requires more dialogue, the audience is blessed with such quality one-liners as, ""Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer"" and the final line, ""You didn't think I forgot you, did you?""<br/><br/>And then there's the plot: Blade enlists the help of his former-mentor-turned-vampire Whistler, who was supposed to have died in the first movie. While the Vampire Council seeks the help of Blade and asks him to lead the 'Blood Pack', a tactical vampire team formed and trained to kill him. Can the Blood Pack resist with guns in their hands and Blade in their sights? Can Blade control his need to shoot every vampire he sees as he's lead into their hangout?<br/><br/>Ooh, the suspense!

","Besides that this movie is quite long (or maybe it felt that way..?) and taxes the patience, Blade II has it's good qualities. But in my opinion, this is a film that can wait to be seen once it is out for rent. There is a plot, a simple one. There's plenty of action, too much action that is a result of Snipes' love for the martial arts and control of the movie. The fighting scenes are a big chunk of the film and yeah, I knew that it was basically the movie's basis. But come on...too many becomes really old really quick. The same moves over and over...ugh. Guillermo's vision for Blade's cinematography is said to be the result of studying Dr. Dre and Eminem videos...odd. The special effects and make-up though were top-notch. Yes, there are plenty more good things about Blade II, but the bad really outweighed the good, and that just plain BITES."

It was an OK movie if you're just in the mood to watch stuff explode and watch neat vampire death effects.<br/><br/>If you were hoping to see Wesley Snipes act in this movie, you're going to be disappointed.  It's an awful lot like he'd repeated all his character's mannerisms so much, he's become bored with them.<br/><br/>The special effects rate very high on the ""ooh, ahh"" scale.  However, any scene where the vampire ninjas are crawling across the ceiling or walls looks very fake.  We're all used to wirework and slow-mo angles of scenes nowadays, but at least in them, gravity and momentum looks somewhat logical. In the ninja scenes, though, they jump and fall with a rushed, unreal look. I kept thinking of Cats & Dogs when I was watching these scenes.  It's sad that in this day and age, they're still making mistakes like they did back in the Mortal Kombat II movie.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good action flick with a unique plot, then pass.

","Blade. The first movie was all in all a good time. Of course that movie was made before the Matrix. Now, every action movie uses that damn bullet time crap. Does Hollywood know that we the public like that great substance known as originality? It was sweet in the Matrix. Blade 2 opens with some narration by Snipes, then busts into an action sequence. I was pumped. Then, the worst happened. Blade fired a gun, and what happens you ask? Bullet timing. ""Damn,"" I thought. Then it went away. The story got good (no spoilers), and then something happened that amazes me made it too the screen. It was a battle between Snipes and a scuba diver outside of water. There were a bunch of flood lights in the background, and they were fighting in front of it. Side note= I saw this movie with someone who couldn't point out a ""fake"" looking effect if it bit her in the nose. During this scene, the camera angle cut to a medium shot and to my surprise... There was a digital Wesley Snipes fighting a digital scuba diver. I held my mouth shut because most folks hate watching movies with me for this reason. It was then that the greatness happened. My fellow movie watcher leaned over to me and said, ""What the hell is that, claymation?"" I was stunned. If this person could point out a bad looking effect, then any mindless movie goer could too. Let me tell you folks, it was all down hill from there. It is a shame too. Good story, bad direction. It is ashame too. I liked the first one."

","Blade 2 opens in a seedy looking ""blood clinic"" in the Czech Republic, where the guy who was in the 80s boy band ""Bros"" (seriously) anxiously awaits his appointment time. Bros is Nomak, and it looks like he is to be a victim of a trap until<br/><br/>The credits start, and Blade himself does a voice-over that gets us up to speed - a useful technique that is over in around 3 minutes - and kills two birds with one stone. Newbies and those that forgot are updated, and we know who edited the film and other miscellaneous stuff that no-one pays attention to.<br/><br/>We catch up with Blade in a 6 minute scene that effectively shows us everything that is cool about Blade, (and why he deserves better films than Blade:Trinity).<br/><br/><ul><li>Cool weapons and toys, including a muscle car. - Heavily stylised movements, violence and stunts. - Cheesy jokes and dry dialogue. - Cool karate moves and a no mercy approach to killing vamps. - The man wears his sunglasses at night! COME ON!</li></ul><br/><br/>At the end of the scene Blade saves Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who I would never picked as the guy who would say ""Like hammered sh*t"" and make it sound cool.<br/><br/>So we're 10 minutes in, we know the primary guys and their background, now we can go into the Blade 2 plot. Mmmmmm, that's good movie-making.<br/><br/>After a momentary digression to meet Josh, Blade's new ""assistant"" who calls himself ""Scud"" and called Blade ""B"" for some reason, Blade announces that he is giving Whistler some stuff.<br/><br/>Then the vampires drop by for a visit to tell Blade and crew about the latest threat to mankind, called Reapers. (But not before it is clearly evident by some very dodgy CGI work that not all the budget went to special effects.)<br/><br/>After a brief chat the Blade posse hitch a ride to Vampire HQ for the exposition part of the film, where the next 90 minutes are nicely mapped out for us, allowing Blade to get to the serious business of killing various things.<br/><br/>Blade is told all about the Reapers by head vampire Damaskinos - which in short are a threat to both vampire and human - he is introduced to his soldiers for the mission. They are called the Blood Pack and include the usual Gen X crew of tattooed, pierced muscle bound freaks, including the underrated Ron Perlman and the horribly under-utilised (in this film) Donnie Yen. <br/><br/>There are three ""BIG"" scenes in the film. The first is the stakeout and search of the House of Pain, a vampire club. Coincidentally the best bit of Blade by far was also the scene in the vampire club, at least Blade 2 has several other scenes which are almost as good, which the original did not.<br/><br/>I know I'm getting older now, but I still would think it a bit odd when 8 odd heavily armed and shirtless guys walk into a club unchecked, and no-one even bats (pun not intended) an eye.<br/><br/>The scene is given time to play out, we witness all the kinks and quirks of the vampires in their ""natural habitat"", and the tension builds once it is evident that Blade will face the Reapers for the first time.<br/><br/>And when the Pack finally do meet the Reapers in the flesh, it still gives me tingles when the ""Woah"" moment arrives.<br/><br/>In the first showdown between Blade and Nomak it appears that they are quite evenly matched, and that Nomak has had some karate lessons on the sly, we are given a taste of what might come, but ultimately it is left for later.<br/><br/>The second BIG scene occurs when the Blood Pack and Blade venture into the tunnels to take on the Reapers in their home turf, even though it contains much of the action and killing in the movie it is simply a prelude for the even BIG-ger finale to come.<br/><br/>The final BIG scene is the showdown that occurs at vampire HQ, and it has everything that a grown boy needs from his vampire flick: torture, stylised violence, faceless henchmen that are really only fodder between boss fights, WWE Smackdown moves, blood-baths and of course SUNGLASSES!<br/><br/>If you were underwhelmed by Blade, or can't be bothered with most comic book adaptations I would still urge you to check this out. Blade 2 isn't just Del Toro cutting his teeth, it is a really solid movie when considered on its merits. It stands head and shoulders above Blade and (especially) Blade:Trinity, neither of which I own.<br/><br/>The movie is violent, of course it is. But once you are able to get your head around the fact that Blade is simply butchering vampires and reapers, (none of which exist guys), all thoughts of how gratuitous it all is should vanish. This is the same with zombies really; vampires and zombies don't exist, and if they do they're already dead anyway, so killing them is perhaps a little redundant and therefore warranted.<br/><br/>This movie is so stylised that I argued one day that it should almost be the first movie shot entirely in slo-mo, that ""honour"" eventually went to Zack Snyder's 300, which turned 80 minutes of action into a 2 hour flashy crawl.<br/><br/>All in all I strongly recommend Blade 2, it obviously has good production values, with set design, costumes and even music that complements the action, and Del Toro knows when to build up to something, and then how to stage a big set piece.<br/><br/>Final rating – 8.5 / 10. Up there with The Dark Knight as one of the best comic adaptations going. I've watched this 4 or 5 times now and it never gets old. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","The best of the Blade trilogy no doubt, and one of my personal favorite films of all time!!! If you thought 'Blade"" was a decent action flick, ""Blade 2"" will blow your mind, proving effortlessly that it out does it's predecessor easily. WWWHy? Because one of the greatest directors has taken over: Guillermo del Toro! Guillermo really gives the film the tone the first one lacked, in pretty much every aspect possible. The lighting is more eerie, the villains much more threatening, etc., etc. First off, I love the cast!! Wesley Snipes and Kristofferson both return, both a host of new characters arrive, much more lively and likable ones to add to this. Where as Norman Reedus' performance is top notch and Leonor Varela is sexy as hell, Ron Perlman!!<br/><br/>He steals the show in my opinion with his fantastic performance. It is characters such as the Blood Pack that make this film much more enjoyable than the first. The sense of conflict of Blade working with his own enemies to defeat a bigger threat, while still having its light touches of humor, is great. David Goyer really out did himself here. The art direction is stunning, from The House of Pain to the sewers, everything really sets the mood of the film as a scary-comic book come to life. Luke Goss as Nomak is dope and this time the end fight is truly pulse pounding! The pacing is better and the action seems literally non-stop. Also, we dive deeper into Blade's inner demons as he begins to challenge his hatred of his own kind and the story is simply great here. And the score is even better, this time Marco Beltrami being the composer. Tradgic, emotional, chilling, the score delivers the right tone at the right time. Such as Nomak, as when the audience finds out his true origins, the music is sad and remorseful for him, rejected by his own father. <br/><br/>""Blade 2"" is definitely one of my top hero flicks of all time!!"

Okay, you never see real people, it all happens in the underworld. Fighting scenes are better done qua fighting and bringing it in front of the camera. Make up is also much better. Some people hated this one again due the CGI Blade, well, these days it is used a lot, watch Hellboy or Spiderman. Of course there is an open ending so indeed there was a number 3 on the way.

","Blade 2 is a much better improvement over the original from director Guillermo del Toro who is admirable in making this sequel by amping up the action, improved special effects, and a more deadly villain(s). del Toro has shown his skill as a filmmaker in all his movies and this one is no different. Welsey Snipes returns as Blade and he's still a solid choice for the character especially in the action/fight sequences. In this sequel Blade forms an uneasy alliance with the vampire council in order to combat the Reapers a more deadlier breed of super-vampires who not only feed on humans but vampires as well. Kris Kristofferson also reprises his role as Blade's mentor Whistler and he's still effective in the part. Lucikly he's given a little more to do in this one. The rest of the cast are good in their roles including Ron Perlman, Lenora Verola, Thomas Kretschman, Norman Reedus, and Karel Roden in a brief appearance as a corrupt lawyer. Luke Goss a relatively unknown is the stand out as Nomack the leader of the Reapers. Goss makes for an imposing a villain who's a real challenge to Blade. Their final showdown at the end was a bit of a letdown mainly because it's over too quickly but Goss still makes for a great villain none the less under all the makeup used to create his character. The rest of the cast are okay in their limited screen time. The action/fight sequences are impressive and there's more of them in this one fortunately. The pace was fast mainly because of the action and some of the new characters are developed enough others no so much. The final showdown between Blade and Nomack felt rushed as mentioned before but it was still fierce and intense. The ending was fitting and the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Overall Blade 2 is better than the original with plenty of cool martial arts action, impressive special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (Snipes and especially Goss) who make this vampire sequel worth the time to watch."

Snipes, for his part, falls back in easily and does what he does best. He's the perfect Blade. And Guillermo Del Toro has his fingerprints all over this thing with the Reapers. It's much more stylish than the original, but it's also shamelessly ridiculous. They retconned Whistler back to life and didn't even blink doing it (although, try to imagine this movie without Kristofferson). And that's really part of its charm. There's plenty of bad CGI here (Snipes is full-on digital in a few scenes), but then again, it was 2002 - they were computerizing everybody back then. There's also Ron Perlman, so there's that going for it.<br/><br/>But when all is said and done, this is a pure action movie, and there's a constant flow of energy.

","It's definitively a rarity: seldom sequels top their originals. 'Blade II' is one of the exceptions. I admit, I'm not one for ""origin"" stories as they normally take too long to get to what we came for, and the original 'Blade' is also an exception: it didn't take too long and was thoroughly enjoyable. However, any problems with #1 (bad, very bad, CGI, Blade acting amateurish) are gone and they move (fast) forward with a very good story and action. An already-established Vampire Mix-breed Hunter, Blade, is given the opportunity to team with his nemesis, the vampires, when a new advanced-model Vampire enters the ranks. Their (or his, to begin) mission: destroy all vampires and then supposedly wipe out humans, following. Blade's no dummy, so he's taking all precautions after rescuing his mentor, Whistler, teaming with him and newbie, Scud. It's an extremely interesting concept to the relatively new series and though it mostly plays as a ""mystery,"" it's pretty easy to figure out from the get-go on how this will play out. Nevertheless, it's fun if you just sit back and enjoy, if blood-thirsty vampire action's your idea of entertainment. Pending you watched this when it first came out, it might be more original, but after the success of 'Hellboy' (also starring Perlman,) 'Aliens' (boy, it had a lot in common with Cameron's film) and any of the 'Underworld' movies, it's hard to see this original as it was in 2002. It was, despite some obvious ""plot-twists"" and some silliness – slooooow-mo scenes can be annoying at times and watch how interesting sunglasses can be. Regardless, sit back, root for the male-vampire slayer as it has a little bit of everything for an action, horror, comedy and adventure person to enjoy."

"rparham","8","1","11","31 March 2006"," Sharpen this Blade
","Many individuals have raised the issue that it is rare to find a sequel that matches the quality of the original, let alone surpasses it. On that short list, you should find the film Blade II. The sequel to the 1998 vampire action flick is more stylish, more exciting and scarier than it's predecessor, making it a solid entry in the comic-book adaptation pantheon.<br/><br/>Opening some time after the conclusion of the original, we find our hero Blade (Wesley Snipes) searching for his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), whom the vampires converted to a vampire and kidnapped. Shortly after locating and curing Whistler of his vampirism (using some complicated retro-virus magic serum), two vampire ninjas drop in on his hideout, but not to kill him. The vampire nation is seeking Blade's assistance in ridding them of a new mutant strain of vampire, dubbed the Reapers. You don't want to mess around with the Reapers: aside from being impervious to silver and many of the other standard vampire repellents, they have a nasty habit of splitting their lower jaw in half and sucking you dry in a much less appealing way than normal vampires.<br/><br/>Blade joins forces with a elite group of vampires that were trained to hunt him down, the Bloodpack, led by Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) and Nyssa (Leonore Varella), daughter of the leader of the vampires, Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann). Blade and the Bloodpack begin hunting the Reapers, but it quickly becomes obvious that they have an agenda that goes beyond stopping these mutants.<br/><br/>A big component in the improvement of Blade II over Blade has to do with the presence of director Guillermo Del Toro. Director of several stylish horror films, he brings a more unique flair to the proceedings. The film is darker, with harsher shadows and moodier lighting than the last entry. The action sequences are also well choreographed, using computer generated imagery that generally integrates well into the live action to add an extra kick to them.<br/><br/>Unlike Blade, Blade II also has a stronger element of horror to it. This is principally attributable to the presence of the Reapers. The standard vampire in a horror film is rather passé these days; the Reapers, however, are not. It's easy to see that the Reapers are representative of any major disease, be it AIDS, bubonic plague, etc. They are hairless, light skinned, and will feed on anything that moves. The scenes where they attack en masse are reminiscent of such films as Night of the Living Dead, although with a little more kick to them than the slow, shuffling zombies of that black and white classic. Where the vampires in Blade were not that scary, save for the film's opening, the Reapers are and add an extra level to Blade II missing from the original.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes is back in fine form as Blade. Still not graced with an overabundance of dialogue, Snipes imbues the character with a little more attitude than the first time around, making Blade a character that is easier to sympathize with. Ron Perlman turns in his usual solid performance as Reinhardt, taking the role of central villain for the piece. Kristofferson is also his curmudgeonly self as Whistler, and his presence is welcome.<br/><br/>It is always refreshing to see filmmakers take a decent film and liberally expand and improve on it with a quality sequel, which seems in short supply these days. Blade II manages the break the curve, and if you were a fan of the original, the sequel is more than worth your time."

","Part two unquestionably is the best entry in the rather dreadful ""Blade"" series, simply because the director's chair was occupied by a gifted filmmaker for a change. Guillermo Del Toro might be a little overrated (""Cronos"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"" really aren't that good...), from a routine and dull vampire movie script, he can make a remotely entertaining and visually impressive time-waster. With Del Toro in charge, it quickly becomes obvious how badly the first ""Blade"" and ""Blade 3: Trinity"" lacked a decent director. The story is also slightly better than in the original Blade, with our half man  half vampire hero teaming up with his enemies to battle an entirely new breed of bloodsucking species; the Reapers. These pale and caped monsters are seemly immune to garlic and other old anti-vampire tricks and  very interesting  they drink the blood of vampire victims as well as humans. There's still way too much hi-tech nonsense going on in this film and the fights between Blade and his vampire opponents now look like lame imitations of ""The Matrix"", but at least there's some relatively good humor in the script and Wesley Snipes is kept on a short leash by Del Toro. Kris Kristofferson reprises his role of cool old mentor but the best part is reserved for Guillermo Del Toro's buddy Ron Perlman. He's the leader of ""The Blood Pact""; a squadron of eccentric vampires that are trained to kill Blade. Perlman is the real star of this movie with his impressive charisma and barbaric looks."
"bowmanblue","9","1","13","15 November 2014"," Am I the only one who thought this was better than the original?
","I remember when Blade II came out - everyone was saying how much better it was than its predecessor (that's not saying the original was bad - it was excellent, too). However, now I look at the other reviews, I see many pretty scathing appraisals of the film, so I thought I'd readdress the balance.<br/><br/>Blade II makes the bold decision to team the titular character up with those he has sworn to destroy - namely vampires - in order to hunt a new super strain of the undead who plans on feeding on both humans and vampires.<br/><br/>What follows are some pretty good action and fight scenes against a race of monsters who are well-designed enough to actually be pretty horrific. Besides some of the non-English speaking actors (who's lines are purely understood with the aid of subtitles) all the cast play their parts well. Wesley Snipes finds it easy to keep going as the half-vampire, Blade, but Ron Perlham deserves a special mention for generally being nasty to Blade and getting away with it (or does he?).<br/><br/>A good sequel should offer the same and more. Blade II does this. It's easily recognisable as a Blade film, yet takes the story in a fresh direction to the original, meaning it isn't simply a rehash of old ideas. I would rank it alongside other such great sequels as Terminator 2 and Aliens. It's just a shame they couldn't repeat the magic with what followed: Blade Trinity (but that's another - sad -story)."

","SLIGHT SPOILERS<br/><br/>Blade II is a better film than its predecessor, though not much. That is to say, it is another gore-drenched helping of vampire slaying, except with more, or better, of everything. There's more blood, more fighting, a better villain, a better script and a better pace.<br/><br/>As befitting a more well-plotted film, much of the action is transferred to suitably Gothic European locations. But this is no James Bond movie. Blade is enlisted to lead a group of vicious individuals known as the Blood Pack, vampires themselves who have been organised to hunt down the carrier of a deadly virus, who looks suspiciously like a member of Bros. The tension of the story is that these mercenaries have also been trained to hunt Blade who until now has been their worst enemy. The edge of the film is based on the lack of trust between the two.<br/><br/>Beginning with a blistering action-packed start, the film keeps the tempo up well, in the typical Hollywood fashion which makes sure that no-one in the audience has time to bother thinking about what's going on. The flaws however do not manage to hide themselves in the torrent of blood and guts. Kris Kristofferson is as wooden as before and the half-hearted romance that develops is totally superfluous, meaning that its supposedly emotional climax is just daft.<br/><br/>Still great, fast-paced nonsense for anyone fancying a huge hit of adrenaline with a little hint of blood at the edge."
"grottoboy40","8","1","16","23 March 2002"," One Vampire Film That Doesn't Suck
","Blade II starts off with a bang and never lets up for the complete 2 hours it is on the screen, and you can't ask for much more then that from a comic book adapted, vampire action flick.<br/><br/>The film is better than its predecessor in many areas and weaker than it in others, but the pros far out weigh the cons in this case.  This is one of those rare sequels that manages to better itself upon the original overall, but doesn't forget where it came from in doing so.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's direction is well done, and he allows the film to develop its own distinctive look and feel much like he did in his previous film Mimic'.  At times it may seem as if the gore is a little over the top, but isn't that the entire point of a movie like this?  He also knows how to film an action sequence, shying away from the hyper editing techniques that have infiltrated so many action movies these days.  If there is to be a sequel, as is almost assured, I can only hope that he once again at the helm.<br/><br/>Snipes delves a little deeper into the character this time as well, and injects a nice sense of humor into the mix at just the appropriate times, mostly consisting of constant barbs with the vampire Reinhardt, masterly played by character actor Ron Pearlman.  Unlike the first movie in which Blade's character is all doom, gloom, and kick ass, we get to see another side of him.  Snipes seems more comfortable in the character, and is able to better portray a conflicted soul, even adding a bit of warmth to his leather clad exterior.<br/><br/>One thing that can ruin a film like this though is the absence of a good villain, and here Blade II does not miss it's target.  The mutated vampires known as Reapers(imagine Nosferatu with a steam shovel for a mouth and you are fairly close) in the film are one of the better and original film villians in recent memory.  They are totally unrelenting and evil, exactly what a film like this needs and a major improvement over the main villian from the last film, which was one of the first film's drawbacks.<br/><br/>Having said earlier that the film starts off with the action right away and never lets up, I will say that this is the film's major weakness as well.  I was impressed though at how well del Toro was able to establish fairly good character development for the major players in the movie at a breakneck pace.<br/><br/>Sure the film is silly and has a few plotholes.  Sure the film doesn't have a really complicated, enthralling plot.  But the film delivers what it promises, a great comic book adapted, vampire action flick.  And if that is what you are wanting to see this weekend, you can't go wrong here.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

"DJ_Shilo","9","0","1","21 September 2018"," Hunting Season Continues
","Guillermo Del Toro steps into the director's seat and takes over for ""Blade II."" Seeing has how Del Toto is a visionary; it's not hard to figure out why this sequel is superior to the original ""Blade."" ""Blade"" was a rollercoaster ride of high-octane action and gory vampire violence, but ""Blade II"" takes it to new levels, and we learn a little more about this mysterious hunter they call the ""Daywalker.""<br/><br/>It about half human half vampire, Blade (Wesley Snipes), who finds himself up against a new mutated strain of vampires called ""Reapers."" When the vampire lords realize they can't combat the creatures, they turn to Blade for help. Of course, Blade is reluctant, at first, but he decides the Reapers are a greater evil. With new weapons and gadgetry, he strikes an uneasy truce and teams up with his sworn enemies, the Blood Pack, before the Reapers take over and drive humankind and the Vampires into extinction.<br/><br/>It opens in a blood bank in Prague. I sense this is not the place you want to go to give blood. It seems dank and unclean. Not to mention the doctor has what looks like a Freddy Krueger glove. Before everyone in the blood clinic gets slaughtered, a character who remains a mystery looks at the camera, and we get a quick glimpse that he is a different type of vampire before the camera cuts to black. These new vampires called ""Reapers"" are quite a fresh design. Guillermo Del Toro's imagination knows no limits, and it shows.<br/><br/>Blade prowled the streets in the original film like a lonely warrior but now finds himself against all the odds as he must take on the reapers and keep the vampires on their feet because he is smarter than they think. Wesley Snipes is still convincing as Blade. He's intelligent, aware of his surroundings and cracks jokes in his sarcastic ways but can again blow something up if he wanted to and make the body parts fly. He seems to be much stronger and more prominent than before, and this proves when he puts up a big fight against two vampires that get sent to retrieve him and deliver a message. They tell him - ""You have been our worst enemy, but now there is something else on the streets worse than you!""<br/><br/>He was raised from childhood by Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who trained him to fight the vampires and kept his vampirism in check with an injection of some sorts. Whistler returns in this film, now rescued from a tank harvesting his blood and revived with a retro injection of some sort. Snipes is more agile as Blade this time around. He is older, wiser and still uncertain about himself. With this new threat of the ""Reapers,"" Whistler designs the new UV weapons when they examine a dead Reaper and discover a stake will not piece its heart due to it surrounded by bone. He also gets a lot of flack as being the old hillbilly and berates Blade's new assistant, Scud (Norman Reedus), for screwing up the operation he started years before.<br/><br/>Del Toro crafts a visceral and well-made film filled with gorgeous special effects, high production and, of course, more blood, gore and extreme violence to fill a bucket. Make no mistake, ""Blade II"" is a brutally, intense film and not for kids. It's twice as violent and disturbing as the original. Usually, I would say something about the violence levels being that extreme, but it works well for the film because most will want to see Wesley Snipes pounding on the vampires and watching them scream or run. It's entertaining to watch the Vampires/Reapers suffer in gory defeat. No one is safe from Blade's new weapons and gadgets when his iconic sword starts cutting through everything in its path and his guns rip everything to shreds.<br/><br/>Most of the second act is Blade chasing after Jared Nomak, the vampire who created the ""Reapers."" They are quite an exciting concept. They are pale white, have a three-way jaw with sucker-like tentacles, and they feed on both vampires and humans. They also have some sort-of scar running down their chins that turn out to be an opening for their mouth, like a clef. Therefore, Blade's usual weapons do not work as well and use the UV lights to combat the creatures when Blade decides to go into the sewers to take them out.<br/><br/>You can almost bet there will be a ""Blade III."" I am not sure what kind of vampire they can design, but I am interested to see it because of the high-quality Del Toro brought to this film. He doesn't rely on a lot of computer effects. You can see some are when Blade is climbing on a wall, but for the most part, he delivers a well-made film. Some will be turned off by the extreme violence, but if you liked ""Blade,"" I can't see how you are not going to be thrilled after seeing this. It improves on everything the original did. I left out the Bloodpack Vampires for a reason. There is not much to say with them. One holds a revelation we see coming in the second act. There are two revelations, actually, but it's better to see them, but don't be surprised by it.."

","For the best in action and horror, you probably can't go wrong with 'Blade 2'. The action is relentless and non-stop from beginning to end. The film features incredible photography from interesting angles and the visual effects are incredible, to say the least. Wesley Snipes is once again in top form. The creature effects are cringe-worthy - it is just so well done! Being Guillermo del Toro, though, I suppose great visuals were inevitable. The man is a so visionary!<br/><br/>I did detest the Hollywood annoying fight to the death first encounter and then working together cliche.

","Blade II may be the trashiest (in the best sense of the word) to be directed by a Best Director Oscar winner. Wesley Snipes returns as the vampire hunter who is part vamp himself as facing a new breed of blood suckers who are a greater threat to humanity. Guillermo Del Toro brings his trademark eye for the weird in the form of the Reapers (and their nightmare jaws that open for to suck on victims) who lead by Jared (80's pop idolLuke Goss) Nomak. There are sequances that have a slow burn of suspense unfolding before exploding into dynamic action including one (typical of Del Toro ) set in a sewer system. That is not to say that bad guys are not dispatched in fun ways, one is vaporised by a bomb and another is sliced upwards. Ant there fight scenes that show off Snipes martial arts skills to the max. Blade II may not be high art like The Shape of Water but it is a lot of fun."

It maintains its confidently laid-back spirit and calmly assured bad-ass protagonist, this time expanding the luscious lore that surrounds both and only making a couple of missteps with the narrative.

"Tweekums","7","0","1","8 May 2017"," Blade must fight alongside his old enemies
","As this instalment opens we see a man going to a rather sinister looking blood bank in Prague; it is run by the vampires and they intend to drain him little do they know that they are his prey. He is Nomak, a 'Reaper' or mutated vampire that will kill people and turn other vampires into a reaper like himself. Meanwhile Blade rescues his friend Whistler from his two years of captivity with the vampires. Shortly afterwards Nyssa; the daughter of the leading vampire approaches Blade with a surprising request; the vampires want his help to eliminate the reapers. He agrees but it is a very unstable alliance; many of the vampires he has been asked to fight alongside want to kill him there and then. Once the action gets underway they learn something rather worrying; the reapers aren't effected by silver of garlic only sunlight or intense ultra violet light will stop them. As the film progresses it emerges that not everything the vampires told Blade was true; in fact some facts about the reapers was even withheld from Nyssa.<br/><br/>This film isn't quite as good as the first but it still provides plenty of entertainment. There are lots of impressively choreographed fight scenes and some spectacular vampire deaths; the use of CGI meant these looked cool rather than gruesome. Wesley Snipes impresses as Blade especially in the numerous fight scenes which he makes look real. The supporting cast is solid enough with Kris Kristofferson returning as Whistler; Ron Perlman putting an entertaining performance as the vampire Reinhardt; Leonor Varela as Nyssa and Norman Reedus, who plays Blade's new weapon designer 'Scud'. The story itself is perfectly fine if fairly predictable for the most part; there is a decent twist later on. I liked the design of the reapers; their mouths were possibly the most disturbing thing in the film. This may not be director Guillermo del Toro's best film but he does a fine job keeping it pretty dark without making it hard to see what is going on. Overall I'd say this is a decent sequel; I imagine most fans of the first film will enjoy it."

","I saw this movie for the first time last year at age 24 and I was at how good it was. Every studio making comic book movies need to take a lesson from this movie.

It's almost funny how well received this movie is. I recall seeing a documentary (it may have been on the DVD) where the director said something along the lines that they had nothing to go on and was pretty much making things up as the movie progressed. Turned out Stephen Norrington did a very good job. Also, I was a bit disappointed knowing that most of the Blade action wasn't Wesley, but his stunt double. Every person that served can be called a veteran, but not every veteran can be called a Marine."
"Leofwine_draca","9","0","2","25 November 2015"," Top-notch combination of action and horror
","Finally, a great popcorn flick that's an improvement over the original movie and offers up an often stunning combination of the action and horror genres to great effect. BLADE II, like its predecessor but more so, skilfully combines full-blooded gory horror with some excellent martial arts choreography, here done by Donnie Yen who also appears in a minor role. Although the plot is fairly predictable stuff, sometimes rehashing scenes in the original movie except with different places and characters, and the various plot twists are a little contrived at times, this is never anything less than very entertaining. Sometimes it may be silly but that's part of the charm. Never has there been such a combination of the ultra-cool (the action) with the ultra-cheesy (Snipes posturing wildly, e.g. the hilarious ""sunglasses throw""), a combination which makes BLADE II a more satisfying film than the original -which is no mean feat in itself.<br/><br/>The director is the acclaimed Mexican Guillermo del Toro, who brings his usual visual artistry (the world in which the film takes place is a dark, Gothic, decaying netherworld of ugliness and filth), plot elements (scary transforming monsters, mechanical devices which attach themselves to people and don't come off) and actors - yep, Ron Perlman is back from CRONOS and used to good effect once more. Starting with a wild action sequence in which Snipes takes on a pack of motorbike-riding vampires, the film rarely slows down, offering up some great set-pieces like the vampire's rave, the sewer hunt and the over-the-top finale. Influences from the likes of ALIENS and PREDATOR are evident but staged differently enough to avoid being too similar or noticeable to ruin the flow of the film.<br/><br/>My love of the martial arts is quickly growing and BLADE II offers some fantastically-choreographed fights and swordplay. Incredibly fast moves and hits are seamlessly blended with CGI characters (to do those moves which truly are impossible for human actors to perform) and the result is adrenaline-pumping action highlighted by an appropriately pumping score. I really was on the edge of my seat for the vampire-busting antics and kept on looking forward to the next scene, and the next. The final one-on-one, in particular, is spellbinding stuff. Nice to see that they threw a few wrestling moves in there too to keep things fresh and entertaining (!). Wesley Snipes effortlessly slides back into the character of Blade and it's nice to see he doesn't take things quite so seriously this time around; however, his screen presence and talented handling of the action makes him a hero to be proud of.<br/><br/>As for the horror-side of the film, well this is where things start getting really nasty. Forget the vampires from the first film (who now become normal, everyday kind of menaces), the newly-designed Reapers are a horrific bunch of subhuman-looking creatures who have a really disgusting surprise hidden up their sleeves which I don't want to spoil too much (other than to say there are some great shocks in store for the first-time viewer). The gore and violence is played to the hilt and this is a film packed with people being sliced in half, having half of their heads cut off (really sickening bit there), throats torn out and blood spraying all over the shop. Plus plenty of the usual arm-snapping, neck-breaking and bullet-busting everyday kind of film violence. The vampire destruction sequences, showing the creatures burning into skeletons and exploding into ashes, are truly spectacular and a delight to watch. Here's a film where I can 100% recommend the excellent CGI effects used - and I never thought I'd get a chance to say that (not a big fan of computer effects at all, but they work really well here - congrats to all involved).<br/><br/>Cast-wise, it's nice to see Kris Kristofferson back in shape (although the movie doesn't do a very good job of explaining his back-from-the-dead presence), although there's another unnecessary and frankly unwanted love interest in Leonor Varela. Norman Reedus makes for a likable accomplice, Scud, despite being a bit of a geek, but the most surprising thing is that the chief nasty vampire (a really evil-looking screen villain) is played well by Luke Goss, also known as one of the members of '80s boy band Bros! A nice mixture of talent is evident in the vampire cast members, with actors ranging from the aforementioned Ron Perlman (as impassive as ever), to Donnie Yen, to Danny John-Jules (another British celebrity turned Hollywood star) to THE STENDHAL SYNDROME's Thomas Kretschmann. Although it never goes any deeper than being a purely visual display of effects and action, BLADE II is a solid and above-average entry in the action/horror genre and even something of a minor classic. Definitely a film that can be enjoyed more than once so a full recommendation to this one."

","Blade 2 had a lot to live up to with the successful entry of the initial Blade movie. Luckily for audiences Guillermo del Toro was at the helm of the project and he did not have a letdown. The action is way better, it is predominately kung-fu with less evaporation of vampires. Although the story is not as strong as the first, the plot incorporated the ""keep it simple stupid"" motto as its method, which really payed off. Blade's (Wesley Snipes) team is a strong mix of characters played by heavy hitters, Norman Reedus, Donnie Yen, Ron Perlman and again, the great Kris Kristofferson. The sequel has a more gore, more action and more sinister villains compared to its predecessor. Blade 2 hits on lots of film genres, which makes the movie a great, unique watch for any film viewer."

Having teamed up with his erstwhile enemies to combat a new strain of vampires that feeds on normal vampires he has his work ct out as they are immune to garlic and silver. Luckily UV light still works but this is my biggest bugbear with this film. In Blade 1 he had a UV torch that he used to threaten and kill the obese librarian creature. Why not use this in this film. Just shine it around and it kills off all the bad guys. No this would be too simple. Despite knowing that bullets are useless they insist on carrying guns everywhere and trying to use them against these new vampires. Use the UV light torches guys. The only problem with that is the film would be done in half an hour. The other ridiculous thing is where the UV bomb goes off and the Nyssa character sees the light coming down the tunnel and dives under water to save herself. Surely light travels at the speed of light. Anyone who can spot it and dive underwater faster than the speed of light is someone to be reckoned with. I kind of lost faith in the film after that. Other than that the film was OK but too two dimensional. The first one was way better - no contest."
"rcolgan","8","0","1","11 August 2015"," Cool Characters and Great Action
","After the great success of the first Blade film and before the horrific disaster that was Blade Trinity, Guillermo Del Toro took the reigns of the Blade franchise for it's second outing to turn Blade into the first Marvel movie franchise. In spite of this being Torro's first venture in to action, he proves that he is clearly suited for the genre already having the trademarks that make him such a great director, including his flair for cool designs and his ability to create stylish and focused action sequences. <br/><br/>Taking place 2 years after the first Blade film, a mutation has occurred within the vampire community that causes them to mutate into a new species called Reapers. These creatures are stronger, faster and have a far more extreme blood lust, sucking both the blood of vampires and humans at a rapid rate. Thus Blade and his team of vampire hunters are recruited by an elite squad of vampires called the blood pack, to hunt down the Reapers and save both vampires and humans from this new threat. <br/><br/>Once again Snipes is on top form as the Blade, bringing the right mix of humour and sword wielding mastery needed to bring the comic book character to life on screen. But the best new addition to the film is the inclusion of the Bloodpack. Their incorporation into the film creates an interesting dynamic as they were originally trained to kill the daywalker, but put in this new situation are forced to work with him. Thus we're basically waiting for the timb bomb to go off throughout the film, waiting for the inevitable double crossing to begin. Although whilst they all look like the badass vampires they're supposed to and the team as a whole are effective in the story, several members of the team don't seem to get any real screen time. Out of the 8 in the team only 2 of them are being given more than the bare minimum amount of dialogue, making it too clear the rest of them are the vampire equivalent to a nameless red coat. <br/><br/>But the members of the Bloodpack that the film does give time to live up to their badass looks. Ron Perlman plays the leader Reinhardt, who brings his usual tough guy attitude to the role, whilst sharing a cool unfriendly rivalry with Blade, where the pair constantly try to oneup each other. Then there's Nyssa who acts as the main liaison with Blade and his team. Whilst her role in the film is fairly typical as the standard love interest in spite of sharing little chemistry with Snipes, the character still has some great moments through her fight scenes and an interesting side plot exploring where her loyalties should lie.<br/><br/>Toro takes all his talents from directing horror movies into the action genre, with the Reapers slit lipped mouths looking like they could have been ripped directly from a horror film. He's also able to adapt to the action genre by incorporating a constant sense of movement in his camera movement, making the already fast paced swordplay even more exciting. The only downside with the action is the CGI, which at times is rather chunky and ends up making Blade look more like an action figure. However it's so well implemented to maintain the flow of the fight that the effects never distract from the enjoyment of the scene. <br/><br/>Not everything in this film works, with some characters having no real purpose and some poorly explained story elements like Whistler coming back from death in the first film. But what does work is so great that it's easy to look past these flaws. This is by far the best Blade film by delivering on all the cool things that made the first film so enjoyable, with it's fast paced action and awesome designs, whilst improving on the formula with even more impressive action sequences and a great story that leads up to an extremely satisfying pay off."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","1","24 July 2015"," A doable followup but not as strong as Blade (1998)
","Although Marvel in the late 1990s was just beginning to produce and widely release live-action versions of their comic book properties, not many probably saw what would be the upcoming popularity of Wesley Snipes starring in Blade (1998). It might have been an obscure character at the time but that particular movie is what ignited the fuse for what would be Marvel today. With its stylized hard R action/horror and storytelling elements, it was definitely not the type of movie Marvel would release until more than half a decade later. It's weird too because with this powerhouse releasing up to roughly 3-4 properties a year (some of which are sequels) nowadays, it's surprising to see that the popular vampire hunter got his well deserved sequel after 4 years. Talk about neglect. With this entry there's a lot that was kept right but it did have more noticeable problems than the first.<br/><br/>Like most sequels should start, the time Blade II (2002) takes place is a little after the first movie. After recovering the coordinates to where a group of vampires are holding his old friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) captive, Blade (Wesley Snipes) and tag-along techie Scud (Norman Reedus) are approached by Nyssa (Leonor Varela) a leader of pure blood vampires for assistance against a new type of vampire. The new vampire is named Nomak (Luke Gross) who not only feeds on humans but also other vampires (pure blood or not) and the after effects are still the same except they turn into what Nomak is. As the saying goes ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" or as Blade puts it ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer"" - well put. As for putting Blade in a new situation, it's different and new. As for how the story is executed is another thing to be debated on. It's not that it doesn't work as entertainment because it is fun. The problem is that once viewers begin to see how things start unraveling, it becomes fairly predictable.<br/><br/>A big question left unanswered is the return of Kris Kristofferson's character. It's not that nobody wanted him back but how it is quickly brushed over that doesn't look or feel legitimate. Apparently Whistler was held captive for years, but that's not the biggest question. The big one is how'd he recover from a headshot wound? So apparently he was bitten and turned - okay. Blade finds him and injects a remedy and was quickly cured. But if it was years since Blade recovered Whistler how'd he heal so easily? It doesn't make sense, plus the subplot of thinking that Whistler isn't fully recovered keeps being brought up but is never confirmed. What's the point? Comic book aficionado David S. Goyer again wrote the screenplay. It's appreciated that Goyer attempts at keeping everything straightforward but it's all in the wrong places. It's too straightforward in execution and not enough in subplot information.<br/><br/>This is about it though in flaws. All the old and new characters are interesting to get to know or revisit. Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson still have great chemistry along with Leonor Varela (who is quite attractive). Co-starring Varela's character is Ron Perlman, Matt Schulze, Donnie Yen and a few others who play the pure blood vampire group. It also makes sense as to how Ron Perlman got cast to star in Hellboy (2004) since Guillermo del Toro is directing this feature. Another nice little addition that usually comes with the ""del Toro package"" is at least one creative creature design. If there's one thing del Toro works best with, it's creature effects/design. Here is no different - the new vampire that Nomak represents is much more threatening than Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) ever could have been. They have a special feature to their bite that is just jaw dropping. And for this alone, you know there'll be a good dose of horrific gore and action. This again no doubt is stylized action; full of sword play and fist fights. Always entertaining stuff.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Gabriel Beristain in his first megahit movie was nicely shot. Beristain has had experience before but this would be his first work for a much bigger film that had a much larger release. All of Beristain's angles are steady, well lit and capture all the unique set designs. The music composed by Marco Beltrami had an interesting take and provides a different listening experience. With Beltrami's experience in the horror and action genre, it only feels appropriate that he could make the music his own. The only thing that Beltrami does not do the film right is creating a continuous main theme for Blade. The main title that cleverly mixes electronic synth and jazz like tunes is catchy but it's never revisited again. If Beltrami could make a memorable theme for Hellboy (2004) two years later, why not Blade II (2002)? The action cues are well constructed however, with loud percussion and horns. It's basically taking a horror score and injecting it with adrenaline. Bring it on.<br/><br/>If paid attention to closely enough, the execution becomes fairly predictable and an explanation for a returning character goes unfinished. However, those errors do not sink this sequel below good quality. The hard action/horror elements, main characters' chemistry, music and cinematography help keep the vampire hunter vehicle running on all cylinders."

","The second piece of this vampire hunter trilogy blurs the lines between Action, Super Hero and Horror, which personally I'm kinda liking.<br/><br/>This time around, Blade (Wesley Snipes; New Jack City, Chaos), Abraham Whistler (Planet of the Ape, Provinces of Night) and new arrival Scud (Norman Reedus; The Boondock Saints, Pandorum) must team up with the Blood Pack, made up of Dieter Reinhardt (Ron Perlman; Hellboy, Outlander), Nyssa Damaskinos (Hell Ride, Wrong Turn at Tahoe), Chupa (Matt Schulze; The Transporter, The Fast and the Furious), Asad (Danny-John Jules; Red Dwarf, Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels), Snowman (Donnie Yen; IP Man, Highlander: Endgame), Verlaine (Marit Kile; Doctors, Blue Murder), Priest (Tony Curran; The Midnight Meat Train, Underworld: Evolution), and Lighthammer (Daz Crawford; Hammer of the Gods, Game Over) in order to defeat UberVamp Jared Nomak (personal favourite Luke Goss; Death Race 2, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Tekken) and his army of Reaper Strain Vampires.<br/><br/>With me so far? No? Then go watch the damn movie! It's very bloody good. The opening is almost as strong as the original, and pretty much everything else about it is better. Not to mention the fact that I'm a total Luke Goss fanboy. All of the characters are so much better. They interact and everything. And even though Wesley Snipes has never really impressed me as an actor, the character of Blade was a little less cheesy, which always helps, and basically just better all 'round.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOR BLADE, BLADE II and TRINITY: An interesting point, without ruining anything about the trilogy is that in all three films, vampires fight vampires. Not in the whole ""Blade's half a vampire so he kills full-on vampires"" way, although there is most certainly that, but in Blade, Frost kills the Elder vampires to become La Magra. In Blade II, The Blood Pack and Blade team up to take down a new, much more dangerous breed of vampires. And in Trinity, Dracula goes around killing vampires, pretty much for fun. Just food for thought. I've never read the comics much myself, so I don't really know if that's something that's been going on for a while, or if it just turned out that way.<br/><br/>There were a couple of lame bits. Some very stupid lines like ""they took all of our weapons. Even your sword."" Even your sword! Man, the single weapon for which you were named after that has killed more vampires than any other thing on the planet, and the vampires took it away from you? The audacity! And there's this whole thing where Whistler is alive again, they went most of the way to explaining it, and then sort of forgot. It would have been so simple to have a four second flashback cover the lot of it. Oh well.<br/><br/>Still though, I'm very, very fond of this one.<br/><br/>77%<br/><br/>-Gimly"

","Blade II is a difficult film to rate. Firstly it comes closer to capturing the look and feel of a comic book than the original, which is a good start. A familiarity with the characters is also helpful.<br/><br/>There are more than a few issues with the plot. Whistler is bought back, his death rather unconvincingly retconned and the stakes are upped to try and make everything super dooper Bladey, and there seems to be something missing.<br/><br/>Blade gets some Vampire slaying groupies, the bad guys are super scary looking with multiple jaws and the stakes are ludicrously high. I'm being deliberately vague here because a lot of the plot and contrivances are things will either work for you or they won't and you really have to see the film to know which camp you fall in.<br/><br/>Snipes and Kristofferson are on top form reprising their roles, but neither major villain in this one stacks up to Dorff in the original. While Blade II certainly isn't a bad film, and has its share of admirers, (for the atmosphere and feel mainly, but many liked the plot, which expands the Blade universe and the vampire mythos) it left many viewers feeling like a lot of elements could have been done better. Specifically the antagonists really could have been built up more and the script could have flowed better.<br/><br/>I don't know of anyone who hated this, and a hell of a lot of people went to see it, and quite a few loved it.

","Actress N'Bushe Wright didn't reprise her role as Karen in director Guillermo del Toro's ""Blade II,"" but Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson are back for this blood-drenched, action-packed vampire slaying epic. The vampires exploit their own in this surprise-laden tale of complicity, duplicity, and heroism. The opening moments of this ramped-up sequel recount Blade's creation. He begins his narration of the past with the line: ""Forget what you think you know."" Blade has been searching for Whistler, the man who raised him and taught him how to control his affliction and live with it. Whistler was beaten up by the fangsters in the original ""Blade"" and he has become one of them in this pugnacious but swiftly-paced sequel. ""Blade II"" is comparable to ""Aliens"" in franchise terms. ""Blade: Trinity"" followed and qualified as a major disappointment, with few of the surprises and cool action scenes of the previous ""Blade"" outings. <br/><br/>This time around, for the sake of brevity, the Vampire Nation approaches Blade to establish a truce. The ruling Vampire Overlord, Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann of ""Wanted""), offers a truce because they have identified a greater enemy than Blade. The new enemy are called 'Reapers."" Jared Nomak (Luke Goss of ""Death Race 2"") has started a one-man war on the fangsters. Worse, when a Reaper (whose elaborately lethal jaw splits into three pieces when it strikes) attacks, its poison doesn't kill the victim. Instead, it turns them into Reapers. As one of the vampire leaders points out to Blade, ""These things are like crack addicts. They need to feed daily."" The always suspicious Blade decides to team up with the Vampire Nation and joins a unit known as 'the Bloodpack."" Moments later Blade is informed that the Bloodpack was formed to destroy him. The Bloodpack consists of Priest (Tony Curran of ""Gladiator""), Asad (Danny John-Jules of ""Red Dwarf""), Snowman (Donny Yen of ""Iron Monkey""), Chupa (Matt Schulze of ""The Fast and the Furious""), Verlaine (Norwegian actress Marit Velle Kile), Lighthammer (Daz Crawford of ""Snitch""), Reinhardt (Ron Pearlman of ""Hellboy""), and Nyssa (Leonor Varela of ""Texas Rangers""), and they've been training for two years to take on Blade.<br/><br/>Del Toro stages some exciting action scenes in the sewer of Prague.

"nvjs","7","0","16","22 July 2012"," The best of the trilogy
","Let me start by saying this is by far the best in the franchise. Goyer makes a better writer and producer than a director calling the shots. Pun intended. What lacked in the first one, was a worthy foe to match Blade's force of nature and efficient dispatcher. Dorff just seemed like a trashy-chic vampire who spouts cliché'd one-liners in between over-acted fits of spontaneous, narcissistic rage.<br/><br/>This one has Nomak who isn't a villain for story sake. He's a tormented, estranged hybrid of a crack-head and vampire. He's an experiment of his father, Damaskinos's.A baddie by circumstance.<br/><br/>While the story is good enough here, I feel that a lot of little things add up to detract from the Blade series. First is the set design. Clearly this is where del Toro either skimped, or overlooked. The sets look so bland while the characters obviously were where the money was spent. Next, the Reapers look a little ""barebones"" and ""neatly un-imaginative"". del Toro spent too much into their anatomy and not enough anywhere else.<br/><br/>Third is the color palette. del Toro is such a renowned film maker and for good reason. His films look so rich and evoke emotion. The ""blue days and amber nights"" just don't pull it off. Look at ""Hellboy"" 1 & 2! Nobody and I mean nobody, does the amber filter like del Toro. It's so over used and now it's old hat. Nobody uses the color palette/filter as a tool for storytelling. Instead they ""utilize"" it strictly for aesthetics.<br/><br/>As I've said, ""Blade II"" is still entertaining, just that all of these flaws detract from the perfection it could have easily attained."

It is a vampire flick, so it was supposed to be gory. The action from this film was way much better and thrilling than terrible first ""Blade"" movie, resulting in one of the most entertaining and well made horror flicks ever made.<br/><br/>Too bad than the third part of the franchise lacked of this same level of quality.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is the only ""Blade"" film that I liked."
"MaximumMadness","9","0","19","17 February 2012"," Better than the original by leaps and bounds, Guillermo Del Toro's ""Blade II"" is a furious, bloody, fun ride with some surprising emotion...
","The 2002 New Line release ""Blade II"" is directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth), from a script by David S. Goyer. (Blade, Batman Begins) A sequel to the 1998 Stephen Norrington comic-book film, ""Blade II"" is, in every sense, one of those rare sequels that is a triumph over the original, which is no small feat, as the original a strong film in its own right, and is arguably one of the films whose success with the public lead to the modern popularity of comic-book films, and brought about modern classics like ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""The Dark Knight."" (Which was co-written by Goyer)<br/><br/>This film picks up a few years after the original. Half-man, Half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes) has finally tracked down his former friend and mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristopherson), whom is being held in suspended animation in Prague by a group of vampires. After saving him and ridding his blood of the vampiric virus, Blade and Whistler (along with a new sidekick Scud, played by Norman Reedus) are attacked by two vampiric assassins, who reveal that they were sent by aging elder Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) to ask Blade for help. Blade is forced to team up with a pack of vampires employed by Damaskinos (called ""The Blood Pack"") in order to battle the ""Reapers""- genetically manufactured ""Super-Vampires"" that have gone out of control, and have the ability (and urge) to kill human and vampire alike.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit silly, but then again, no sillier than the ""Blood God"" from the first film. The film really works well for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, this is obviously a Guillermo Del Toro film- his distinct and poetic visual style is present, and his camera work is beautiful and elegant. His direction and visual sense is quite astounding, which is a big part of why he is one of my favorite directors of modern cinema. In addition, Marco Beltrami's magnificent and tragic/Gothic score serves as a perfect compliment to Del Toro's masterful direction- the film is a treat for the senses, and is much more elegant than you'd think a film about vampires and martial-arts fights would be.<br/><br/>The acting is very strong. Snipes and Kristopherson deliver subtle, powerful performances, and all of the secondary characters (such as Scud, Damaskinos, and Leonor Varela as Damaskino's beautiful daughter) are all fantastic. Special points go to Blood Pack members played by Ron Perlman and Donnie Yen, whom are just a joy to watch, and are a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The action is a step up this time. The first film had some solid action, but it suffered from what I call ""Pre-2000"" syndrome (when films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" became more prevalent). By that, I mean that the action in the first film felt a little manufactured and didn't flow as nicely as it could have. Here, the action has a more operatic, ballet-like flair, which works better on the big screen. (Save for a few wire-fu moments that left me gagging) There is also a grander scope to this film's action, and it just feels more thrilling.<br/><br/>The visual effects are surprisingly strong, but have some problems, which is where this film loses a point. In 2002, when this came out, CGI artists hadn't quite yet ""gotten"" how to render people. (And some movies, even today, 10 years later, have this problem) A lot of the effects are improved. When vampires ""Ash"" (disintigrate), they look much more convincing than in the first film, which looked... well, bad. Also, the effects work on the reapers (who have split-jaws and a phallic, alien-like tongue) was amazing, and looked perfectly real. But for whatever reason, there are a number of shots where Blade (and others) are rendered using CGI models, and it looks... really pathetic. They look like plastic dolls (with bad lighting), and move in a hysterically unnatural way. It really takes you out of the movie at times.<br/><br/>But asides from that one (fairly major) complaint, this is arguably the perfect ""Blade"" film, and it is the finest of the trilogy. I give this a great 9 out of 10. See this movie!"
"mr-s_saunders","7","0","1","24 January 2012"," Quick Review of Bladde II
","Right, this is my first IMDb review, I hope you enjoy it. Blade II has been sat nestled into my DVD collection for a few weeks now, so, I thought it was about time I put it on. Now I know the film was released in 2002 so I'm a little late to watching the sequel to Blade, a film I thoroughly enjoyed. I found that at first the obviously low-budget special effects started to put me off, but then realised being 2002, the graphics weren't going to rival James Cameron's ""Avatar"" and that I wasn't watching for CGI brilliance, but instead for a bit of an action thrill, and for this, Blade II didn't fail to deliver. Wesley Snipes bringing action fight-scene after fight-scene. Shortly into the film Blade is contacted to help the ""Bloodpack"" a group of vampires who have spent years training to defeat Blade. Each member of the Bloodpack fits a different action group stereotype, which when they meet the all have animosity towards Blade. The story following their meet and the plot twists throughout the film are nothing spectacular, but like the special effects, I don't always watch action films for the gripping story telling abilities. The only problem I truly found with Blade II was Norman Reedus's character ""Scud"" constantly playing on the cliché of his character as a the cocky stoner who spent the time since Whistler had been taken helping Blade out, and getting a little to proud of what he's been doing. Some of the gadgets he's created seem quite good but, he still doesn't take over the general bad-ass character that Kris Kristofferson portrays as Whistler. Altogether, I think if you've not seen Blade II you should defiantly think about giving it a watch."
"The-Sarkologist","5","0","18","23 December 2011"," Much better than the original film
","For some strange reason this was much better, and much more enjoyable than the first film. It had less clichés, had a few twists, some of which I didn't anticipate, and has Blade teaming up with the vampires to fight a third enemy, though whether this third enemy is an enemy of blade is a little unclear, however it does become evident that he does becomes Blade's enemy by the end of this film. Also, the movie was filmed on location in Prague, and not only have I been to Prague (though not for so long that I could say that I recognised some of the places) but it adds a bit more of the exotic feel to it.<br/><br/>However, before I continue, we must remember that while vampires have existed throughout human history in one form or another (though I would not agree with those who say that vampires are one of those legends that appear to turn up in multiple cultures) Bram Stoker had his original vampire, Dracula, arise from this corner of Europe, though Transylvania happens to be in Romania and not the Czech Republic. So, while the first movie is set in Los Angeles (and I found it a but odd that a major vampire temple would be located in Los Angeles) this film goes back to where the vampire legend began (sort of).<br/><br/>Basically the vampire world has been rocked by the appearance of a mutant vampire. The mutant, which the call the Reapers, feed on vampires, and turn vampires into Reapers. This, obviously, concerns the vampires as the Reapers have all of the strengths of the vampires, but their only weakness is a vulnerability to sunlight. Further, reapers that have been turned tend to be a lot more violent and a lot more dangerous. Further, the vampires use the threat that the Reapers have on humanity as a way of bringing Blade to assist them.<br/><br/>In this film, Blade is tracking Whistler. It turns out that he was not killed in the last film, but rather has been turned into vampire. However, he is not running around like a vampire, but rather being constantly tortured. As vampires regenerate and age a lot slower than humans, it is easy to torture him to the point of death, and then come back a few days later for a bit more.<br/><br/>Despite this film being substantially better than the previous film, Blade II is still not much of a film. I did enjoy it more, and getting rid of some hot shot young vampire and trading it with an ancient vampire as the bad guy made it a lot more enjoyable for me. Still, it is not exactly a film that I am going to be watching again anytime soon."

","Besides it consisting of my favorite director I believe it to be nearly as good than the first, even though the second is my favorite over the first film. The reason why I will tell you shortly because in my opinion starting with the bad right in the beginning of a review makes the film look worse than it is.<br/><br/>Graphics/SpecialEffects - I thought this was pretty well done. The effects done with the reapers mouths were amazing. Instead of expecting something sexy it's gruesome. The barbs on the tongue and fangs on the cheek are a nice add too.<br/><br/>Costume - The designs of the clothes were fascinating. Blade's was improved (but of course, what's to expect of the main star of the film?) Yet the metal buckles that look oh so appealing and complicating are just magnets. So besides being super cool and sleek they also allow the actors the ability to move freely.<br/><br/>Fight Scenes - Now I thought some changes were needed in the near beginning of the film. Otherwise you shouldn't expect nothing less than the greatest.<br/><br/>The Bad - Okay here it is what you all been waiting for...the bad. Hmm let me think, where to start? Oh how about the costumes, yes it's still true that they are super cool but the downside; they are all wearing leather, yet again the look alike contest. I know the filmmakers didn't want all randomness in their film but I don't think they were looking for a wanna be rock band with blade as the lead singer. How awesome would that be? A vampire killer and a bad boy rock singer all rolled into one! I don't think so. Anyway yes I think blade should wear his normal style, but the rest? Let's just have them stick to the color black at least or grey, whatever. I could go on and on about this topic but let's not and say I did, otherwise it's going to take a lot longer so, next. The fighting scenes. Okay I love how they tried to combine new tatics with old but the suspension lines could do a little less if you know what I mean. It looked too much like a freaking video game if you ask me. <br/><br/>Anywho, if you seen the first then this film should be just as good even if there needed to be more done to it."

There's others of course, and naturally it's all arguable, but I would vouch for Blade II as being a worthy entry on any greatest horror sequels list any day. Stephen Norrington's original first entry from 1999 is itself vastly undervalued in the action/horror pantheon, such is the case here with this Guillermo Del Toro directed sequel. Guillermo Del Toro raises the bar in comic book-manga-esquire violence, flayed limbs aplenty, gore drenchery unbound, droll gallows humour throughout, expert choreography and all delivered at a break-neck pace by its makers. It's kind of hard to see why the discerning thrill seeking comic book fan hasn't truly embraced the first two Blade movies {a third, fun, but cheesy instalment followed} as bona fide genre highlights.<br/><br/>Joining Snipes {Blade} in this return is Luke Goss, with the former Bros pop star a surprisingly effective performer, Ron Perlman, Danny John Jules, Leonor Varela and the-ahem-returning Kris Kristofferson as Whistler. Screenwriter David S. Goyer is perhaps guilty of underwriting the characters outside of Blade and his new nemesis. Certainly The Bloodpack members are barely given stories worthy of interest. But it's high octane action one is surely looking for in a piece like this?. And we get it, with blood and bells on. Blade II made a worldwide profit of $100,000,000-and rightly so because it deserved that success. Its reputation appears to have dimmed as much as its leading mans star appeal has, but it marked a return to form for its director and it remains a wonderfully exciting and blood letting piece of genre entertainment. 8.5/10"

The bad, however, is that the story and the writing are less creative, failing to really immerse us in the vampire lore that made ""Blade"" so interesting. While the bad plot development doesn't really saw the legs out from under ""Blade II"", it certainly makes it difficult for anyone who did not really enjoy the first ""Blade"" to get anything good out of it.<br/><br/>For the sequel, Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro steps in to replace the vacated spot left by ""Blade"" director Stephen Norrington. The difference is apparent but not that drastic. Del Toro uses a more martial arts style of filming fight scenes and this takes away some of the highly stylized shots of the first film. The action is not as cool-looking but the fight choreography is a bit better. Del Toro is also more imaginative in terms of how the characters look.<br/><br/>The plot takes place two years after the last film. Blade has been out in search of his mentor Whistler (Kristofferson, who, surprise, didn't actually die in the first film) when he is approached by the vampires who request his help. The reason is that the vampire mutation has apparently evolved into a strain called ""reaper"" and these reapers feed on vampires. Agreeing only because these reapers are deadlier than vampires with less weaknesses, Blade teams up with some skilled vampires (ironically trained originally to kill him) to take the reapers down.<br/><br/>The reapers are more barbaric creatures--not very interesting for the film's focus, but brought to life in an interesting way by Del Toro. They are pale, bald creepy figures with chins that open up to reveal parasites for feeding on their victims. They make the overall tone of ""Blade II"" more about the gross than the sleek like vampires. In fact, most of the vampires in the film are just dubbed as such, it doesn't really play a role in their characters. The lore of the first film is simply taken for granted here so we can jump right into the plot.<br/><br/>The cast is even worse than ""Blade."" Why? Because there are more people in it. Last time, the only bad performance we had to deal with regularly was Stephen Dorff as the evil Deacon Frost. This time, there's a whole crew of pathetic vampires and then some other nuisances. The worst might be the annoying new sidekick of Blade's/tech geek character Scud played by Norman Reedus. The script also calls for a new vampire love interest for Blade, which might be the worst part of the film. There's nothing in the film that says these two should be interested in each other yet they are. Those two examples are just the stand outs in a cast that you kind of are just hoping will die at some point in the film, which interestingly enough, most of them do.<br/><br/>David S. Goyer, the original film's writer, continues with the great pacing that made ""Blade"" entertaining, but in this film, there are too many characters and the pacing leads to us not caring at all about any of them except Blade. Even then, ""Blade II"" is only an excuse for Blade to kill more vampires/reapers, not grow as a character. Some of the strengths of his character from the original just disappear, like his struggle with the fact that he's half- vampire. This is mostly because the plot is not conducive to rehashing those themes.<br/><br/>""Blade II"" is a great example of how a sequel maintains the entertaining elements of the original but cuts off the material underneath with a fair plot. The film aims for ""not disappointing"" instead of ""good,"" and so it achieves just that and nothing more."

","Another great action movie facing humiliation in this feminized society. Its really depressing to see such disheartening comments. People who are complaining about this movie being too gory, they have no idea what the word ""gore"" means. Now honestly, if u don't like Wesley Snipes, action movies, violence and blood, why did u choose Blade II? Does the cover of the DVD or the movie posters ever claimed itself to be a chick-flick. I can tell u what the problem is and why people hate this movie. They go to see this movie or rent this movie with an expectation of some movie like ""Spiderman"" where everything is soapy and romantic and the lead character engages in action as if he is doing a favor to this world. Instead, what they get is a tough and no nonsense Anti-hero who means business right from the start. He is not there to fool around with some dumb chick. He never shows too much emotions or any emotion for that matter. He is stone-cold always with a straight face. He has no love interest with anyone, no engaging in tiring dialouge conversation. The dialouge that Wesley Snipes is given matches his characters perfectly, for example, ""Keep ur friends close, keep ur enemies closer."" Just what u expect when a man is surrounded with enemies. Thats what this movie portrayed so brilliantly. He is simply here to kick some vampire as*!!! And boy!! Wesley Snipes is God when it comes to hand to hand combat and sword fights. The director deliberately kept things simple and the story is moved forward with the action sequences. So, in a nutshell, if u r in a mood to check out some unbelievable, over the top, yet well done action scenes, with a lot of blood and violence then this is the movie for u. Otherwise visit the next section in the DVD store which says ""Brain Damaging Chick Flicks""!!! Leave this movie for the fans."

"culmo80","8","0","1","4 March 2008"," Best of the Blade films
","Yes I know, that's saying a lot (or not much) but it's true. <br/><br/>The first Blade, to me, is comprised mostly of introducing the audience to Blade and explaining this version of the Vampire. These vampires are not affected by religious icons unlike Vampires in other works of fiction, just as an example. I also thought Stephen Dorff didn't pull off the arch-villain too well. He always comes off as a bit snotty and I just couldn't accept him as this mastermind to bring about a Vampire god. Maybe I'm being too critical, who knows.<br/><br/>In Blade 3, the villains across the board seemed like amateurs compared to what he faced in previous films. Even Stephen Dorff was more believable than Parky Posey or the rest of that bunch. Dominic Purcell as Dracula or Drake....nah, not buying it. Hey, I like him in Prison Break but as the original vampire, I think they could have found someone with a little more depth. Hey, the guy who played Dracula in Van Helsing pulled it off perfectly. Also, there was just too much comic relief from Ryan Reynolds whom I could not buy as a vampire hunter. Every line from him was a joke, it seemed. Plus, they killed Whistler...again. Kris Kristofferson(sp) had little more than a cameo in this film simply so they could bring in eye candy with Jessica Biehl (sp). She did alright but it wasn't anything special.<br/><br/>Now, take Blade 2. The villains were believable. The acting was good for the most part and the plot was interesting and deep enough. Basically, after Blade tracks down Whistler who has become a vampire himself, he is recruited by the Vampires to help fight a new common enemy, the reapers. The reapers are a mutation of the vampire virus that creates a creature more powerful than the vampire and harder to kill. Blade agrees to team up with the Vampires to hunt these creatures until it turns out that the head vampire has set this all up to create the next step in the vampire evolution. That's a pretty brief synopsis.<br/><br/>What makes this Blade film different is that there is actual character development for Blade. He develops, if nothing else, a respect for vampires and even a possible love interest with a Vampire woman. This was starkly different compared to the other films where Blade is just a constant brooding individual who never changes.<br/><br/>The special effects are great; no more of that obvious computerized blood that made Blade 1 almost silly at times. The fight scenes are great and come on...any film that has Ron Pearlman in it is going to be good.<br/><br/>Blade 2 just had a different feel to it."

","Blade must now work side by side with his enemies, the vampires in order to stop a whole new breed of Vampires who devour not only humans but Vampires.<br/><br/>This film is a little more comic bookish and does not portray some of the themes of the other movies. I felt that the producers were trying to reach out to a whole new demographic.<br/><br/>The film has some good fight scene by a kung-fu legend named Donnie Yen who makes a surprising appearance and does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes manages to portray the vampire again but something that disappointed me was the whole bringing back Whistler and leaving out the doctor from the first film. This was definitely a disappointment but the Vampire, Nomak; makes up for that, the special effects are amazing.<br/><br/>A good action movie overall."

Everything about the first movie which was great has returned, but is now even better. Wesley Snipes brings back to life one of the coolest Marvel characters on film. The vampires are even more frightening and the action is amazing. The story has a lot more thought into it this time. More turns are featured, with interesting characters which really make you think about. The action doesn't kick off straight away, but rather delivers itself at the right moments.

","BLADE II has our antihero uneasily joining forces with the vampire league to wipe out the Reapers, a group of degenerate vampires that prey on vampires. What Blade is actually doing is walking into a trap, but that's to be expected, and the climax of BLADE II plays out in similar fashion to BLADE. What sets this sequel apart from and possibly above BLADE are the fight sequences. They are spectacular, and the CGI used to make some of the more spectacular fight gags is less obtrusive this time round. Mr. Snipes as Blade is in fine form once again, and Kris Kristofferson is back as Blade's aide de camp. The delectable Lenor Varela provides the romantic interest as a fellow vampire, and Ron Perlman has a strong supporting role as one of several warrior vampires sent to aid Blade in his quest. Still, I would only recommend it to fans of the comic book or comic book fans in general. It will have no meaning nor make any sense to anyone else."

","This movie manages to live up to the under-rated original, but just like the 1999 remake of THE MUMMY, if you didn't ""dig"" the first one, then you won't find anything different about the follow-up. <br/><br/>Wesley Snipes does less talking and more fighting as he faces more enemies and meets possible allies ( some of them are annoying). Kris Kristofferson returns as well and Ron Perlman joins the gang, but has plans of his own. The film will not scare anyone, but it will pack a punch for Action/Adventure fans as there are numerous stunts and enough blood to satisfy the ""gore"" fan. Sometime the stunts don't work because they rely too much on CGI (Realistic animation done w/ computers).<br/><br/>There also could had been better character development and less flaws, but that wasn't the film's biggest goal. People who do not like ultra-violent movies or are ""squemish"" have better stay clear because once this film starts, it never let's up. <br/><br/>Recommended for fans of the first film and those seeking a type of ""action-sequences- galore!"" movie."
"crowrobot","8","0","1","24 July 2007"," Blood-drenched action flick that delivers the goods
","""Blade II"" is a blast, an atmospheric horror-action thrill ride from director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan's Labyrinth). Filling his canvas with sticky surfaces, gold hues and tones, and blood as only del Toro can do blood, ""Blade II"" is simultaneously exciting and gross.<br/><br/>Long story short: Blade (Wesley Snipes) must join forces with the Vampire Nation to eliminate a new breed of vampires called Reapers. Reapers feed on both humans AND vampires, so it's bad news for both sides. Made leader of a team previously trained to hunt him (which includes amongst its members Ron Perlman and Donnie Yen), Blade finds himself in some very deep trouble as he discovers that there is more than meets the eye to the Reapers.<br/><br/>The Reapers are one of the best parts of Blade II. Armed with Predator-esquire jaws and an incredibly disgusting tongue, they are quite possibly the grossest antagonists in recent memory. They are also very persistent, occasionally resembling the creatures from the Alien series. There is an autopsy on a fallen Reaper that is both fascinating and repulsive; I would suggest not eating before watching this scene.<br/><br/>del Toro does a fine job with the action scenes; wisely utilizing the terror of the Reapers as a starting point, the only downsides to the action are the occasionally really fake-looking CGI stunt men (especially in the vampire-ninja fight). The smack downs between Blade and Nomak (Luke Goss), the original Reaper, are wonderfully over-the-top and cartoony.<br/><br/>Blade II is just loads of fun, even more so than the first movie. Just remember not to eat before watching."

It's not scary because it has action! Maybe it's not that different, although it has a good plot. From this trilogy, I would say this is probably the best but I can't count on that, yet. Here's my explanation: I've only seen part of the first film, not even finishing it. Then I watched the third. Then I watched the first and didn't even finish it (again). Then I watched the second! So yeah, the whole series was a mix up.<br/><br/>I like the way how this film can be seen without watching the first film because it helps explain the whole movie during the beginning, so it was not a problem watching this movie at all. This is a very fun and entertaining popcorn film! The action scenes are well made, with the use of the L-camera (is that how they call it?) and great choreography and CGI.<br/><br/>Horror fans would also get to see some great kills and some squeamish scenes.

A villain that will force Blade to do something he(we) never thought he would do ...<br/><br/>Apart from the balls out action, the movie will have the tongue in cheek humor too. What it doesn't have, is a story. So yes you could dismiss the movie because of that. But why hating, if you can just enjoy this crazy wicked piece of film. That's what I did, because the movie never ever let's you think otherwise. So it obtains and stays this way from beginning to the end.

","""Blade 2"" was a little bit of a step backwards. Blade, of course, was as cool as the upper atmosphere, but the nemesis is what makes a movie. In comic books and movies based upon comic books, the villain is who makes the hero. If the villain(s) are weak or undesirable, then the hero doesn't shine as much by defeating the nemesis. But when the nemesis is powerful, strong, or charismatic even, then the hero is also viewed as powerful and strong when he/she defeats him/her.<br/><br/>The hybrid creatures in ""Blade 2"" were strong and nearly indestructible, but they were a bit on the disgusting side. The main villain and his father were equally on the disturbing side. The uncertainty and twist with Whistler and Scud added a little bit of flavor to the movie, and it was nice to see Scud get his just deserts. Blade 2 just didn't have the same appeal as the first one, but it was still good."

","What I like about the first Blade movie was Deacon Frost. I loved the character and thought he was very well executed. This movie on the other hand just did not have a satisfying bad guy. The action was not bad, and I really liked how they incorporated the wrestling moves into the fighting style. I hated how Scud turned out to be a familiar and that Blade was onto him the whole time. They should have just killed him off and left that part out. It was weak story writing and felt forced. The special effects at times looked really hokey, but I actually did think some of the shots in the final scene had a good vision, but the special effects department just did not pull it off. The fight scene where Blade beats up all those armored guards was boring after a while and I just wanted it to end. The girl was hot, but that was all she contributed. I thought there was a lot of plot potential and great character moments involving the blood pact, but they totally missed out on that. The couple in the blood pact relied on the opening scene where they are seen hugging each other. The fact that they really did not do much else with them between there and when they actually die together it was sad. By the way Wesley Snipes is just not that funny. He tried, but just could not make me feel for the character at all. The one good thing was the reapers looked amazing, but beyond that not much there. Overall the movie just did not have the script and I felt bad by Del Toro and I know he can do much better work, and if given a better script I feel as if it would have turned out better."

The fight scenes in this movie are better than Green Goblin vs. Spiderman or Gangs of New York, both which lost to it in the awards chase.<br/><br/>Blade (Wesley Snipes, who is so chiseled that his six-pack abs look stocked with 16-ounce cans) and the Bloodpack are on the trail of of super-vampires, led by Nomak (Luke Goss).

Also there is somewhat less gore in this film, and it really isn't all that necessary. If I have any complaint it is with all of the jarring music in the film. It tends to wear thin on your nerves after a while. With the exception of Ron Pearlman the secondary characters do not come off as memorable as in the first feature.

"johnnyboyz","5","0","2","19 February 2007"," The film relies on visuals to cover up its frustratingly poor plotting.
","Despite enjoying the first outing of Blade; I was very weary going into the sequel of a film that relied on blood, over the top action and comic book violence to tell its story and I'm glad I was otherwise I would've disliked this second film even more.<br/><br/>What happens in Blade II is that Blade is forced to ally with his mortal enemies, the vampires, to fight an even deadlier foe that will consume both of them. First the vampires; then the humans. The main problem with Blade II is that it's completely full of holes. The way the film is pieced together means it keeps that oddly distracting air of mystery and sense of no real trust between the two allied forces that spoils, and thus ruins, the end twist. The whole truce plot is very weak throughout and you definitely get that feeling, especially since the initial incident of them attempting to make a truce features a female vampire trying to decapitate our hero instead of reasoning with him. What's more, the truce is actually hard to fathom given their filmic situation and the hatred they have for one another in their world.<br/><br/>Another thing that was weak was the fact I could see straight through the third ally character. I found it amazingly convenient that Blade had found a new sidekick following Whislter being taken by the vampires; and the twist towards the end can be seen a mile off. Rather than add something to the team; the character of Scud was really just someone there to make it look like 'the whole Vampire race/ three others' rather than 'the whole Vampire race and just two others'. The only thing he added to the film was the fact a daft, predictable twist was sure to arise. Something that I found laughable when really I shouldn't have was the fact that once the Vampires and Blade's threesome are together; they create more problems for themselves rather than their enemies. Scud gets himself into all sorts of problems when he's operating his surveillance van and the other allies just don't seem to learn that bullets won't work on these bad guys (Not yet, anyway). Another annoying, predictable thing the film has going for it is the vampire team Blade's assigned with. I thought these particular characters would make for juicy cannon fodder once the film progressed; and I wasn't too far wrong  brainless and only mildly entertaining. <br/><br/>By the time the film has entered its final third and all the twists start to unravel, its become a bit of a mess. Suddenly, bullets can kill the Reaper Vampires, the normal vampires aren't so 'good' anymore and Scud can't even seem to remember weather his own inventions are or aren't explosive devices. With this, Blade II relies on visuals to make up for it's holey plot. The fight scenes are impressive at times whenever weapons are involved but the final fight was a little too 'you hit me, I hit you' in my opinion. I liked the early references to Samurai with the Japanese sliding doors mise-en-scene and reference to swords and the script has some amusing quips and situations the Vampires and Blade's unit find themselves facing and sharing throughout. <br/><br/>But, with too many things wrong with it overall; I have to stand up and say that this is rather overrated and a little care with how obvious/inconspicuous certain plot points should be made should've been addressed better."

","Blade II starts as the half Vampire half human Vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes) continues his 2 year long quest to find his friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) whom the Vampire race have held captive for that time after the events in the original Blade (1998), Blade finally has tracked him down & frees him. One night back at his base a group of highly trained Vampires known as the 'Bloodpack' infiltrate it & they deliver a message to Blade that the Vampire king Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) wants a truce between the two warring sides, Blade agrees & the Bloodpack takes him to their headquarters to speak with Damaskinos personally who wants Blade to help him & his race exterminate a new breed of Vampire known as a Reaper. This new type of Vampire needs to feed on fresh blood every few hours & preferably Vampire blood but once they have wiped the Vampie race out they will turn their attention to the human race, they are immune to silver & garlic & infect their prey with a virus that turns them into Reapers, in a matter of months the whole planet could be overrun with the things. It' up to Blade & the Bloodpack to destroy the source of the virus, the original carrier named Jared Nomak (Luke Goss) before it's too late...<br/><br/>This American German co-production was directed by Guillermo del Toro & is the second outing for the popular comic book character Blade, personally I think the original Blade is complete class & I was slightly worried by this sequel as I thought that it would be a huge disappointment but I'm happy to report that Blade II is almost as good as the original which was more than a little bit surprising. Anyway, David S. Goyer returns to pen the sequel & he does a fine job again as this time around he has more scope & money to play with as he makes everything that little bit bigger, louder & more ambitious. The film moves along like a rocket yet still manages to have a good story which has more to it than you may expect, the character's are good & the uneasy truce between Blade & the Vampires is well used & is always there as an undercurrent, there are a few twists & turns as people aren't quite what they first seem & things aren't quite as straight forward as they seem, there are also some neat ideas here particularly the Reapers themselves whose jaws split apart to reveal snake like tongues. I liked the ending which isn't the usual Hollywood 'happily ever after' type thing & the script also does a good job of making the main villain Jared quite a sympathetic character who in essence is just a victim of his circumstances although deliciously evil at the same time. Overall I was very impressed with Blade II.<br/><br/>Director Toro does a great job & while I can say this has a decent script with better character's & narrative than your average Hollywood no-brainer Blade II just wouldn't be any good if it were not for it's gore, violence, fights, chases, monsters, glamorous sleek chrome plated weaponry of various descriptions & it's cool attitude. Blade II has a fantastic look about it with great production design, it seems to alternate between dark run down decrepit sewers & back alleys to ultra sleek, modern & shiny scientific labs & complexes & it's a perfect mix & Toro manages to get the blend just about perfect, visually Blade II is top-notch. The weapons are suitably over-the-top & used to good violent effect throughout with the fights & action scenes extremely well choreographed & actually pretty exciting, the costumes are cool too with Leanor Varela standing out in her skin tight leather outfit at the end. There's plenty of blood & gore here, there's loads of the red stuff splashed around, there's plenty of disintegrating Vampires, people sliced in half, someone has the top of their head cut off, someone is blown up & there's a yucky autopsy scene. The body count in this must be pretty damned high.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $55,000,000 Blade II looks the absolute business & has that sleek ultra well made Hollywood polish to it with great cinematography, top special effects, the usual catchy techno music to accompany the numerous set-pieces & excellent production values. The acting is decent enough, Snipes as Blade is suitably emotionless & delivers the one-liners with the appropriate enthusiasm. Kristofferson puts in a good shift while Ron Perlman equally so, ex-boy band singer Luke Goss is an unexpected choice for but rather impressive bad guy, Varela makes for a nice looking love interest & Norman Reedus is good & pretty likable as Scud.<br/><br/>Blade II is an absolute top action horror hybrid big budget popcorn film that's a very worthy sequel, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Make sure you watch it as soon as you can, followed by Blade: Trinity (2004) & Blade: The Series (2006) stars someone called Sticky Fingaz..."

","Blade II is something of a mixed bag, being largely well made, fairly well written and passably acted, but it is in many ways a sequel that was neither needed nor asked for.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film contains a lot of what lets this film down, with the rescue of Whistler by Blade within the first few minutes seeming both poorly tacked on as well as unnecessary. The character went out in a respectable fashion in the first film, and to be fair the presence of the character as well as Kris Kristofferson add largely nothing to the film. The film is quickly let down once again by the poor special effects used in the Blade vs Nyssa fight, looking both fake and largely inept. This is the end of the truly cringe making parts of the film, with no real let-downs as far as plot and effects are concerned for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There are the highlights of the film which do however make it somewhat better than average. The costumes are brilliant, the script isn't terrible and the plot allows for plenty of action with very little thinking required. The performance of Luke Goss is brilliant and easily the best piece of acting within the film, Ron Perlman is entertaining as always and Wesley Snipes, whilst wooden, brings the same level of performance as he did in the first film.<br/><br/>This film is easily the worst of the trilogy, but it is still enjoyable to watch if there are no better options, and of course is worth watching if you ever intend to watch Blade III."

"CrassActionHero","4","0","2","16 December 2006"," A Rusty Blade
","Blade 2(2002) Review: Blade is back. The Blade this time around is getting rusty. Blade makes a not so exciting sequel. Here's why: Blade 2 is not as good as the first. The first installment had action and intrigue. It was not great, but was good. Here, Blade gets a little repetitive. The opening scene was not really good. The vampires this time around are quickly taken out with such little effort. A single gunshot does the job? C'Mon. Vampires are tougher than that. Also, i can't stand the first vampire at the beginning of this movie to be a total wimp. You are a VAMPIRE. You have super strength and agility. Why are you so terrified? It was just irritating as hell.<br/><br/>The story was okay at first till later on a bad plot twist happened. I still am scratching my head wondering ""what was that""? The Reaper vampires are not all that impressive. They all look the same and are very dull looking. Every other character here was very one-dimensional as you can get. Blade 2 does have some good action here, but is not enough to redeem this. Blade this time around is more merciful than the first Blade. That is a problem. I liked Blade when he would slay a vampire at a drop of a hat. The ""unholy alliance"" made no sense later on.(The plot twist sucks) Too much CGI. Forget about character development as well.<br/><br/>Blade 2 is nothing like the first thrilling installment, but is the brainless sequel. Blade 2 has no depth towards it either. From a convoluted plot to a forgettable villain, Blade 2 suffers big.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Leave your brain at the door. This is better than ""Blade:Trinity"". But than again, that's not saying much."
"suburbannightmare","8","0","1","4 November 2006"," Fab sequel....but not like the first....
","This is Blade's second outing (nothing like stating the obvious, I suppose). And really rather good, considering it's lack of similarities to the first movie. Blade once again, continues to fight the good fight against creatures of darkness. Only this time, it's not the vampires he's hunting. This movie brings forth an idea about a strain of vampires being 'created'. These 'reapers' aren't what you would call normal vampires, although there are a couple of similarities between the two. They still feed on fresh human blood, sunlight fries them to a crisp, and they have the customary supernatural strength that vampires have. However, they're a little harder to kill than ordinary vampires. And they're spreading at an alarming rate. The vampire nation, disconcerted by this new breed of bloodsuckers need help to eliminate them before they infect and turn the entire human race. So they call in Blade to help them. But can the two races put aside old grudges and unite to destroy this frightening new evil? This film was made almost 4 years after the first movie, and with a different director at the helm so the look of the whole thing is entirely different. Not a bad thing though. I think with sequels a lot of people expect the subsequent films to look and feel exactly like the first one. This doesn't always work. With Blade II, there's an entirely new set of characters, a new race of vampires, new weapons and Whistler undergoes some interesting changes between this movie and the first one too. It all adds up for another serving of deliciously dark action adventure.<br/><br/>So we have Blade teaming up with the Bloodpack  an elite group of vampire warriors going after the reapers to destroy them. (Interestingly enough, the bloodpack was supposedly put together to try and take Blade out.) Some of the Bloodpack are a bit laughable though. Priest is just a bad-tempered git with an Irish accent. Lighthammer was obviously cast for his build and not his acting. Verlaine does little other than pout and look worried, and Chupa spends the entire movie having a go at Whistler whilst clad in some kind of weird chain-mail vest. Snowman and Reinhardt more than compensate for the rest of the gang's mediocrity though. Donnie Yen, who is one of the coolest martial artists alive, plays Snowman (and earns his paycheque choreographing the movie's fight scenes), and Ron Perlman (a Del Torro favourite) gives an excellent performance as Blade's nemesis-esquire Bloodpack heavy, Reinhardt. Leonor Varela is quite good as Blade's number two, Nyssa. She's another black leather catsuit-wearing hottie of the vampire-movie universe, and like Selene in Underworld, she looks rather good. Although I'll never understand why women in action films feel the need to spend two hours constantly frowning. Maybe it's the universally accepted symbol of 'hardass female'. Hmm Luke Goss plays Nomak, the lead reaper, and is amazingly good in this film. Even though his accent seems to falter somewhat. He sounds like a cockneyfied Czech which is pretty remarkable. His overall portrayal is outstanding though, he looks dark, grim and murderous  he even gives Blade a run for his money in the fight scene stakes.<br/><br/>All in all, the plot line, characters, gore, action and soundtracks are sufficiently entertaining (keep an eye out for an echo of the infamous clubscene from the first Blade movie), and although not as good as some have said, it's enjoyable enough for what it is  an action/vampire movie."

","Blade (1998) will without doubt be remembered for that awesome opening sequence in the 'Old Meat Factory' club with New Order pumping furiously out of the sound system. This was an opener which epitomises the unadulterated satisfaction of watching Blade in action.<br/><br/>For me though, Blade II (2002) is the pick of the bunch. Special effects were now fully realised, the story line was definitely appropriate and there were some classy one liners from Blade (Wesley Snipes) and co. Such a shame then that Blade: Trinity (2004), seemed to think that the whole film was based on these as the main form of entertainment. This contributed towards the downfall of the final Blade film which for many including myself, was easily the least satisfying of the trilogy. How did they get it so wrong? I will let it rest one day.<br/><br/>In all, Blade II is an excellent sequel, hitting all the right notes, full of action, atmosphere, and an excellent soundtrack, which leaves you with total viewer satisfaction, even if you have seen it before. A must watch!"

","A -surprisingly, at least for me, given the fact that I'm not into fantasy or comic adaptations, and that I'm definitely prejudiced against sequels- enjoyable action and sci-fi movie that includes new generation vampires and vampires with mutations.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original film, nor the third part, so I can't assess this film as a part of a trilogy. It just works alone, and I think that's a good achievement. If you're immune to the ick factor, or plain enjoy it (there's plenty of that in ""Blade 2"" -that autopsy sequence!) and to some actors' narrow range of facial and vocal expressions, and if you make a blind eye to painfully stereotyped characters and predictable turns of the plot (but aren't they supposed to exist in a film like this?), and you're a fan of action and fight scenes, you'll probably enjoy this. The video-clip looks get a bit old, but oh well. An entertaining film, all in all."
"bannonanthony","8","0","2","21 July 2006"," A brilliant follow-up and excellent second instalment in the trilogy.
","So, I finally got around to posting my review for this movie. I must say that BLADE II is probably the best of the trilogy. I absolutely6 refused to watch this sequel until I'd seen the original. After I did, I wanted to see this one as soon as possible. I was not let down. I was pleased to see Kris Kristofferson return as Whistler as I enjoyed his performance in the first movie. Of course, Wesley Snipes is excellent as Blade once again. I liked how this film made use of an ensemble cast as this time, the humans and vampires are in danger and Blade must team up with a crack team of vamps who were being trained to kill him.<br/><br/>I was especially surprised when I heard that Luke Goss, whom I knew from 80s boy band Bros would play the big bad vamp Nomak in this film. But he is excellent any time he is on screen, very menacing. Ron Perlman and Matt (FAST AND THE FURIOUS) Schulze are very good as two of the reluctant vamps teaming up with Blade and Norman Reedus is very good as the two-faced Skud.<br/><br/>The action scenes are all handled brilliantly. and the final death of 'good' vamp Nyssa is very moving. All in all, a brilliant film."
"whpratt1","7","0","2","10 July 2006"," Bathing in Blood
","Enjoyed Blade 2 more than the first version, there seemed to be plenty of action between vampires trying to make peace among each other in order to get the real Blood Suckers. Wesley Snipes, (Blade) was kept busy almost every minute through out the film and had more tricks and special devices in order to bring plenty of light into the eyes of the blood suckers. Blade even takes a nice bath in a deep pool of thick blood which made me stay away from tomato juice for my entire life. Kris Kristofferson, (Abraham Whistler) acted at first like a very old man who just came out of a coma and then he started to use his brain power and helped Blade accomplish some of his tasks. There was very little time for any real sex in the film, I guess that all came into play after the Mission was completely accomplished."

","Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson reprise their roles as Blade and Whistler, who this time join forces with the vampires to take down a new breed of viscous bad guys called ""Reapers"", seems that only sunlight can destroy them and Snipes teams up with Vampire marines to wage a final battle. However there maybe a double-cross among the proceedings. Blade II is a sequel that manages to be even better than it's predecessor. For one the action sequences are imaginatively staged and the gore level is even larger. Snipes as usual has the silent hero thing down pat and Kristofferson is always a welcome sight but the script this time is written with more depth and the relationships between characters manage to give this more of a watchable edge. Also it's very enjoyable, provided you like lots of gore.<br/><br/>* * * out of 4-(Good)"
"kaspen12","8","0","11","20 May 2006"," A bloody good action flick, and the best in the series.
","Starring: Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Ron Perlman<br/><br/>Last time we saw Blade, Wesley Snipes's half-breed vampire slayer, his hunting operation had been heavily compromised. His warehouse headquarters had been rushed, his mentor Whistler (Kristofferson) had shot himself to prevent imminent bitings -- no matter, he prevailed, he got his man. In these movies, they always do.<br/><br/>Flash-forward a few years later and Whistler is not dead. The vamps have turned him and kept him alive, so they can torture him for all eternity. Blade tracks him down, busts some heads, turns him back and we're back to square one. Of course, the film is not content with closing the curtain at the half-hour mark, so now the story can really begin: The warehouse complex finds itself blitzed again, this time by a pair of super-stealth special-ops vampires dressed in jet-black spy-gear -- one of them a skilled swordsman, the other our leading lady. Blade intercepts and they kung-fu fight. Turns out the battle, flashy and entertaining as it was, was all for naught -- the vampires, members of an elite vamp-squad called the Bloodpack, have come to make a peace offering on behalf of the Vampire Nation. You see, there's a new threat stalking them -- bigger and badder than Blade: Reapers, vicious vampire hybrids whose scarred faces mask their horrific weapons. The vamps don't just want a truce with Blade, however -- they want him to fight the Reapers with them. He faces a dilemma: do nothing and let the Reapers move on to humans once they're finished with vampires, or help the vampires, only to have them try to kill him when the job's finished. If you can't tell which way he finally leans, you've never seen an action movie.<br/><br/>I liked the first Blade film if slightly. It was a fun movie with some very cool moments, but didn't live up to the hype. The third, 'Trinity' is a mind-numbing disaster. Oh the difference a good director can make! Guillermo del Toro (Cronos, Hellboy) has the reigns here and clearly had a good time with the movie: it briskly bounces from one energetic action sequence to the next, with a fair number of frightful sights thrown in to liven things up. This is a good thing -- with a wafer-thin plot that takes enough turns to keep your attention, Del Toro knows exactly what kind of movie he's making: a pure action flick. And he delivers the goods. The movie is dripping with cool, and while it may not be a classic, it's a fun flick to throw on and let it suck you in.<br/><br/>FINAL SCORE: 8.3/10<br/><br/>If you've never seen a Blade movie before, no worries. There's not a lot to catch up on, and you can jump straight to the ""good chapter"" and not miss a beat. If the movie suffers anywhere at all (other than the plot department), it's that the battle sequences occasionally suffer Spider-man Syndrome, wherein the impossible is made possible by some glaringly obvious CGI. Other than that, if action movies are your thing, Blade II is a bloody good show."
"james_norman1981","7","0","1","17 February 2006"," Friday night fun if not as good as the original.
","There is a school of thought, seen on this very website, that suggests Blade 2 is superior to Blade 1. Quite why this is I don't know as, like many films of its ilk, horror sequels, Blade 2 tries to give us everything we saw in the first movie multiplied by 10! It succeeds in this limited goal, but, in my opinion, fails to make a good, simple, coherent or fun action film.<br/><br/>The original Blade was not without its faults and the sequel endeavours to address them. One dimensional characters, failures of plot and a rather weak ending are all details that made the first movie fun but not quite the finished article. Anyone who's seen the final fight in Blade will know exactly what I'm talking about. Unfortunately, in an effort to rev up an already fast paced, hardcore action flick, the director of Blade 2 has gone a bit far...<br/><br/>Since the Matrix, wire work has been done to death so it is to Guillermo del Toro's credit that he tries to do something new. Unfortunately, as with the third Star Wars prequel, the blending together of CGI and real time action fails in two ways: the fighters are neither balletic, nor do they appear human. Here, in Blade 2, we have fights that seem more like a computer game than a film, both in how they look and, equally jarringly, in how the stunt-men/animations move.<br/><br/>Added to this is an unexpected, new found compassion from Wesley Snipes' Blade. Whereas in the first film he'd draw his sword once his firearms were depleted of ammunition, this time he actually fights multiple adversaries with his pig-sticker firmly sheathed! Now maybe the resolution of his mother's death at the end of the first movie made him feel a little bit better about vampires in general, but he's still supposed to be hunting and destroying them for crying out loud... not touching them up.<br/><br/>Similarly, his collection of toys, read weaponry, has suffered a great deal from sequelitis. Whereas before he had cool, retro guns and the occasional unusual tool, now he has silver coated pistols, bizarre ultraviolet grenades, spear guns that fire a bolt of silver at umpteen thousand metres a second and weird, spinning, bladed things which seem to be vampire seeking and capable of turning corners...<br/><br/>Now I must admit to liking it when a film takes a moment to explain what weapons the protagonists are using. Lethal Weapon's comparison of hardware is a great explanation of the two cops characters. In Die Hard, when Karl pulls out his rifle, we get the indication that now he really means business... But in Blade 2 there's an almost fetishistic manner to the way various guns are talked about and the character who builds most of these weapons is both incredibly irksome and very poorly explained. Plus it begs the question: why would someone as friendless as Blade hang out with someone as annoying as Scud? It also made me wonder what happened to the female doctor from the first movie. I don't know if I just missed it but I didn't hear a reason for her absence. Nor did I hear an adequate one for the presence of a guy who did not survive Blade 1...<br/><br/>Other characters have also appeared in the interim and few of them are any good. The story behind this film is that some sort of super ugly vampire has sprung up (Luke Goss playing to type) and the normal vampires need our friend Blade to sort him out. This he goes about doing with the help of the Blood Pack, a bunch of what we're led to believe are the hardest of the hard in the vampire world.<br/><br/>You could've fooled me. Not only are the Blood Pack less than intimidating, they're also incompetent, badly acted and more than a little unintentionally humorous. One also has to wonder why the producers forked out for Donnie Yen, one of Hong Kong's top action stars and a genuinely thrilling martial artist, to be part of the Blood Pack only to have him do absolutely NOTHING IN THE WHOLE FILM! I mean come on! This is the man who's three fights with Jet Li (across two films) are perhaps the greatest martial arts moments EVER! The thought of Yen, Snipes and a decent choreographer had me practically salivating from the off. When it became clear it wasn't coming I was more than a little miffed. I was also more than a little sickened. Blade 2 is not for the faint hearted and, unlike the original, is well worth its 18 rating (in the UK). The mutated, or re-mutated, vampires are not pretty in any way shape or form and they only get worse as the film progresses.<br/><br/>So I hated this film from beginning to end, right...? Well, the answer to that is no! Although it has a great many flaws, which I've taken a somewhat unfairly savage delight in highlighting above, Blade 2 does some things well and some even better than the original. There are powerful fights, stronger dialogue, a few genuinely 3-dimensional characters and a twist or turn here and there which, although not exactly unexpected, are handled, in both the build up and the execution, with aplomb. Del Toro deserves credit for fashioning a solid, if occasionally unnecessarily extravagant, Friday night movie that ticks many of the boxes marked 'A Good Time.' Like the first the ending is a bit weak and there are far too many unintentionally humorous moments, but overall Blade 2 is a cracking film that, to my mind, is not bad at all. I still prefer the original but, while I can hardly offer unconditional praise, I would suggest that if you liked the first you'll probably enjoy the second. Just don't show it to anyone who doesn't like seeing the details of a person's internal anatomy..."
"Bogmeister","6","0","1","17 February 2006"," Blade & Vampires & Reapers & Tigers & Bears
","When you do a sequel, one option to not simply repeat the events of the first film is to up the ante. In this follow-up to the first Blade(98), we not only have the standard vampires to contend with, but a new threat called Reapers, which feed on vampires, just as vampires feed on humans. There is also an elite group of bad-ass vampires teaming up with bad-ass Blade (Snipes), though you tend to forget they're vamps at this point; they come across as a new team of super-heroes. Of course, sooner or later, vamps tend to revert to form, but there's less of the standard bloodsucking and more of the standard martial arts swordplay. The plot is a bit more complex than the 1st pic, with some backstabbing and counterplots revealed late in the game. The new monsters, the Reapers, a more extreme version of vampirism, provide the horror angle.<br/><br/>So, in all, you end up with a film with numerous genres mixed together to form an unusual super-hero horror soufflé. You need only be familiar with director del Toro's monster picture ""Mimic""(97) to appreciate the flavor he strives for. Like his previous film, this is heavy on grotesque creature visuals, quite unusual even in this day and age, but usually covered in a familiar slime. The combo of computer FX and advanced puppetry is admittedly impressive, though some of the long shots of creatures jumping from wall to wall become cartoon-like. Snipes as the hero is more relaxed in this 2nd go around, and they brought back Whistler (Kristofferson), supposedly killed in the 1st flic, a somewhat contrived plot turn. Perlman as another vamp overplays his hand a little, but del Toro was right to bring him along for ""Hellboy"" a couple of years later. The climactic fight is pretty brutal, with both combatants showing off their superhuman abilities to the extreme. By the end, however, you may wish Blade had focused more on his life mission instead of reacting to the machinations of others throughout most of the story."

The fact that Blade is given only a weak reason to fight Nomak means that there is none of the chemistry or intensity to the battles that the original had.<br/><br/>2 - The introduction of the Blood Pack draws attention away from Blade.

","Blade 2 is a great movie. As it is a sequel the film creators knew (apparently) they couldn't have the same success, as Blade 1 was almost perfect, they turned to more characters, new enemies, a different storyline and a new feeling overall. It worked great. The sequel is not better than the original, but it's close. And for a sequel this is saying a lot. After all we have three great actors: Wesley Snipes, Kris Krisstoferson and Ron Pearlman. There's action, great visual effects and an awesome soundtrack. What more could you want from a sequel. There are just two things that REALLY bother me: 1) near the end of the movie, i don't quite remember, but i think Ron Pearlman's character was shooting with a rifle at Whistler and sparks appeared on the metal rails. This is simply laughable. How come NONE of those pellets hit Whistler? I know it's a movie but come on... 2) few moments later when Whistler throws Blade's sunglasses to him. Blade catches them perfectly. That's another moment for 10-year-old children to be happy about saying: 'Wow, maaan, look at how Blade caught his glasses, maaaan! So cool!' Besides these two moments i find this movie to be one of those REALLY successful sequels. 8/10 is a fair mark as far as i'm concern.<br/><br/>_RaziBG"

","Enjoyable sequel in which Wesley Snipes reprises his role as Blade, the half human, half vampire vampire hunter! Blade must team up with his vampire enemies to combat a new threat that could endanger both humans and vampires: the reapers! The reapers are powerful vampires that feed on vampires! How many times can I fit the word 'vampire' into this review? I don't know! But I digress, this film is great action from go to woah, featuring all you could ever want in a vampire movie. Plenty of gore, gadgets, action, and fights, and all backed up by a solid performance by most of the cast. Snipes is awesome, Ron Perlman who is excellent, and Kris Kristofferson once again.

","First of, I am one of those people that really like the first Blade movie. So I had high hopes for the sequel. Funny, because I am not a big fan of sequels, because they tend to lack much of what the original had. Anyways, Wesley Snipes is back, and so is Kris Kristoffersen. Much is the same, the humor is the same, Blade is still the coolest cat in the world and he still has the most amazing weaponry handy. So what is the biggest difference between Blade and Blade II? Well, the action. In the first movie, they had cool music and martial arts. In this movie, they have both those things, plus computer animated moves to make it look like Blade can jump immensely high and is very quick. For me, that didn't quite work because it is so obvious that it is computer animated. But a movie like this isn't without flaws, and if you count them all, it is still an entertaining movie. So if you liked Blade, chances are, you are going to enjoy this as well. I rate this movie 6/10"

Some minor spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>This movie, starts off with Blade looking for his mentor Whistler who apparently died in Blade but has actually been kidnapped by the vampires and moved around from place to place. With Whistler gone, Blade has a new sidekick Scud, who is witty, smart, and funny at the same time. After the whole whistler thing, Blade is recruited by the vamps because some a new kind of Vampire called the ""Reaper"" is out and must be stopped. He must lead a team of vampires who were ironically trained for two years to take Blade out. The story builds from there with a lot of ass-kicking, feeding, blood, humor, and some intense action.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie I was like WOW. This one had a bit of humor and the action was amazing. Blade somehow appeared cockier, stronger, funnier, and more violent than in the previous Blade movie. The Bloodpack (Vampire group) is not a bad addition to the storyline because they don't take as much camera time as the Nightstalkers in Blade Trinity.<br/><br/>The Effects had a bit of flaws but the martial arts make up for it, the acting job wasn't bad except for some of the BloodPack members (e.g Chupa). The villain is completely bad-ass and just by looking at this guy you know he's something.<br/><br/>Check this movie out if you enjoyed Blade, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>9/10"

The bloodpack is awesome especially Ron Perlman as Reinhardt of course but I also liked Tony Curran (Priest) and Donny Yen (Snowman).

","I enjoyed the first ""Blade"" flick. I felt it was a moderately entertaining flick that effectively showcased the fantastic screen presence and decent martial arts skills of Wesley Snipes, but this sequel by far blows its predecessor away in terms of good action. Although ""Blade II"" doesn't offer much in terms of story or character development, unlike the first flick, the opening and ending action sequences are stunning and hold up extremely well after several viewings. That being said, although Stephen Norrington's vision worked well for the first chapter in the series, I have to say I preferred Guillermo del Toro's much more gothik imagery this time around. The final showdown between Snipes' protagonist and the film's villain will satisfy even the most ardent action fans, and I gotta say, this movie had me eagerly awaiting the release of ""Blade: Trinity."""

","Blade II is one of the best action films I have seen in a while. Probably ever since the first Matrix. Of course, let me go on to explain... I didn't see the first Blade before seeing this. What attracted it to me was something rather odd: Danny John-Jules, who plays the Cat on the British sitcom ""Red Dwarf"", has a supporting role in this film. And I was expecting it to be a horrible movie... anyway, back to what I was saying. I need a plot to evolve in order for me to enjoy it. So like, if a movie is about one thing and it stays being about that one thing, I don't enjoy it. Like Lord of the Rings: it starts off they have to destroy the ring and the goal never changes -- I disliked it for that reason. Nothing changed.<br/><br/>But the evolving plot is why I liked Blade II. Not only does it deliver stylistic and awesome action, but the plot evolves above the point of Blade-vs.-vampires. That's where it truly succeeds. I gave it 9/10 -- it's, in my opinion, a very good example of a great action film, but I'd never give a pure action film 10/10. That's just me, though. If you like action films... enjoy :)"

","Let me preface this comment by stating that aside from the opening blood shower, I really couldn't stand the first Blade. Not that the film was so bad, I just was not interested in it at all, maybe it was Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff that turned me off, or the pedestrian like fight scenes, I have still yet to see the end of the movie. Why did I even watch Blade II, you ask? One reason, Guilermo Del Toro. I love his films and that extra umphh he puts into familiar stories, I knew that he would do something different with the same old Blade, and he did. This film is so much fun, from super realistic fight scenes to great pussy gaping vampire hybrids, yeah there are plot holes but this is a comic book put on screen and in my opinion it is one of the best, and you know its the little things, WWE moves choreographed into climatic fight scenes, Ron Perlman, throw away lines that deliver, a great villain and a plentitude of viscera.<br/><br/>The other great thing about Blade II is the pacing, this flick moves like a bull through a china shop and never lets up. Yeah you know there are references to Aliens, to Del Toro's own Mimic, Lines from The Godfather, lapses in CGI rendering and some pretty bad dialogue but its all forgiven because this flick is a blast. Even Snipes fares better as the Rock would say ""He knows his role"" just be a bad ass vampire killer. Despite loving Blade II, I still won't watch the end of Blade though."

Ever since Passenger 57 I've been a fan of his, as far as action goes, but I dig the Blade character. He's so driven, tattooed, dry sense of humor, hard as nails, and it gives a twist to the concept of ""Vampire"" instead of them being undead creatures, they are just humans with a blood disorder. That's rad. Blade II was kick ass. The fight scenes were a little fast, and you could tell allot of it was Computer Animated, but very cool. It got a little squeamish with the pathetic love scene but whatever. Beyond that, go see the flick because it's got lots of action, fighting, and above all, comedy."
"MadMonkInBlack","Null","0","1","30 January 2004"," I propose the operating title: ""Blade II: Blunted""
","All right, folks.  I don't give away the end of the plot, but there are pieces mentioned here.  If you truly want to see the movie in all of its low-grade glory, I might spoil a thing or two of course, it might save you a rental fee, so you might well read on and thank me.<br/><br/>Blade II is a well-thought concept in its continuation of the original. Unfortunately, its execution was and remains a blistering pustule on the dirtiest parts of the rear anatomy of the trademark, both movie and comic.<br/><br/>Where shall we begin?  Perhaps with the most obvious:  the combat sequences. Oh, I agree, the weaponry is rather interesting; I even like the ""blade pistol"" whatnots.  The armor used in the trek into the sewers was also nice, despite looking vaguely fake and insectile.  However, the absolute ridiculousness of the combat should make even a novice want to vomit.<br/><br/>Example:  Blade takes on a pair of vampires on motorcycles, bent on escaping him, probably by running him over.  They're trapped like rats, looking for any way out.  Not a good time to screw around, I should think.  But the director has Blade take these two on not with his sword, two feet plus in length, but with is glaive {an admittedly nasty but small boomerang-like double-blade knife}.  Makes for interesting scenarios of him leaping up and sending the thing spinning through the air and all that rot, but frankly he's not just looking to challenge his abilities, he's got a specific mission in mind, to find the person he cares about most.  Ten minutes might be nine longer than he has.<br/><br/>Second Example:  What in the name of hell is it with the use of crappy CGI these days?  You've got obviously highly-trained martial artists able to do amazing things with their bodies, and you throw this foolishness in just because it's trendy?  I think it's an insult both to the people and the arts in which they have worked so hard to become accomplished.  It's worse when it's so obvious it's CGI -- the bodies don't move like they should, are unnaturally stiff or too fluid.  Give me real, please!<br/><br/>Third and worst:  If the movie's a pustule, then wrestling moves are the thing that relocates it to the anus.  When first I saw Wesley Snipes' Blade do one, I was sickened.  You get a man trained in arts that can shatter bone with fist, add vampiric strength and speed to his attacks, and you have him down piode drivers and elbow drops?  And then the villain, who apparently follows WWF more closely, does even more of them.  That kind of pandering makes sequels the ""whore's movies"" they are.  Even a fair amount of the martial arts moves have the WWF-style sloppiness or slowness; that or the lack of finesse that concentrates more on how far your opponent flies than in truly disabling a target.<br/><br/>Beyond that, some reason, Blade's sword, the trademark of his very name, looks decorator-model fake during any close-ups -- not just low-grade stainless steel but something akin to aluminum.  It even clatters, when it breaks and is thrown to the ground in the final fight scene, like something made of pot metal.  Someone should have told the director that if you're have a weapon, much less something supposedly forged of titanium, much less a character's signature weapon, it should give the impression of strength and craftsmanship and not just pretty-shiny like something off a discount rack.  Perhaps that's the reason he doesn't use it enough in this movie -- except to flip it around cutely in completely inappropriate moments -- he's afraid of it breaking!<br/><br/>A more minor problem seems to be that Whistler, far from being the proud if grizzled figure that appeared in the first movie, seems to have been reconciled to old age by the second.  He didn't truly accomplish all that much, save to get the hell beaten out of him a couple of times and finally beat down Reinhart a bit toward the end.  Granted, did manage to go after the captured Blade, and save his arse just in time to have a nice half-vampiric father-son moment.<br/><br/>Which leads to one seemingly unremarkable but honestly vast mistake, which gain happens at the end... I'm suddenly realizing how many of the major mistakes and stupid decisions happened at the finale, yikes. Blade, caught to some grim operating table and having his blood siphoned off {we'll ignore the clichÃ©' from the first movie, of course} pleads with Whistler when the old man comes to save.  He pleads for blood.  Not his serum -- BLOOD. Blade, who has spent all of his life hunting vampires would never plead for blood, especially not in the idiotic, drawn-out way the director had Snipes do it.  It would be a violation of everything that makes the character what it is.  All right, it could be argued that he was thinking of the huge vat of blood in Damaskinos' chambers which he leapt into later, but it certainly don't come off that way.<br/><br/>The horrendous soundtrack I think I will leave alone, as I'd probably get railed against for my trouble.  However, is rap really the only music appropriate for a fast-past movie with an African American {God I hate the ridiculous locution} star?  Is that the best and brightest music, the true mainstay of its urban culture?  When a fight scene is to Cypress Hill with the remarkably intelligent beginning of ""Listen all you motherf**kers..."" it sort of loses it for me right there.<br/><br/>It's too bad that the director obviously doesn't have the sense that God gave a goat, because the movie could have been pretty decent with the ideas that they had for the Reapers and such.  The tension between Blade the vampires he must work with was well-done, and there are other parts throughout that have something of the first movie's shine.  The rest... so, so sad this all is when directors decide that shock value, special effects, and trends should dominate over the making of a good film.<br/><br/>Conclusion:  try again next time, kids.  I'll stay with the original."
"CitizenCaine","6","0","2","14 January 2004"," A Worthy Sequel
","Wesley Snipes returns as the day-walker in this worthy sequel to the original Blade. The plot is less formulaic than the first one, which is especially necessary in sequels when the newness of the originality of the characters disappears. This time Blade teams up with select vampires to hunt a more deadly threat to both vampires and humans. There's tension between Blade/Whistler and the vampires, and Blade starts to fall for one of the vampires. There are several more good plot turns that follow. The action is fierce and swift, even more so than in the first movie. However, the vampire lore takes more of a back seat in this film, and the effects are far more intrusive and grotesque in this film. Kris Kristofferson once again plays the crusty Whistler, although his reappearance in this film is somewhat dubious. Ron Perlman is a worthy adversary as one of the select group of assassins. Donnie Yen does a good turn as the sword wielding member of the group; I would like to have seen more of him.

","My all-time favorite comic book hero is Batman. Why; because he's dark, cool and constantly has battles with his almost double personality. Blade is in (pretty close) second spot. Why; the same reasons! Love Burton's style, hate (maybe that's a too strong word for ""Batman Forever"")Schumacher's. From ultra dark to super silly just is just too much Love Norrington's style and approach. Despise del Toro's.<br/><br/>When somebody sets out to make a sequel they want to make it better than the first one. Better is not more! Quantity sure as hell ain't quality here. More guys on blade's side this time (a bunch of cool looking characters that don't get nearly enough screen time for the viewer to feel any emotion for them), more cool action(which in some cases doesn't really serve the story at all), more effects(some pretty good, but the CG Blade looks unrealistic and just plain bad). Plus he jumps all around the place like a monkey on speed, sadly making the movie loose any credibility it was left with after the opening sequence.<br/><br/>Did del Toro even take the time to watch ""Blade"". An opening scene that has gained an almost legendary and infamous reputation, a scene which will go down as one of the coolest club dance scenes ever is more than enough a reason to make the opener in the second installment at least half as good. Nope, not even a glimpse of effort. As if del Toro intentionally wanted to do this, I just have a feeling he managed to make a big F..K YOU to all ""Blade"" lovers and threw together a movie that does nothing but the worst with the material. The cinematography (compared to the first Blade) is worth dick and they could barely find some decent electronic tunes to go along. It's pretty hard to find anything better in this sequel except for some really R rated violence scenes and some really funny scenes between Blade and Reinhardt.<br/><br/>An adrenaline-pumped hyperactive movie that doesn't take time to stop and think but instead just keeps going into the wrong direction from the very start. And I'm not talking plot-wise at all, but going from the very cool and smart Blade from the first movie to the cliche filled movie (the first action scene where he almost crashes into his car(which is hardly used in the movie anyway) and then gives it a kiss)with a jumping maniac that should at least have done it with the female vampire.<br/><br/>

The script is still by David S. Goyer, and is still on the flimsy, light side. Wesley Snipes returns in all trenchcoat-flowing, shade-wearing style as Blade the vampire hunter - half-human, half-vampire, all hero...and so on and so forth. The story is that a new breed of bloodsuckers, led by Nomak (ex-pop star Luke Goss) are causing havoc in the underground world of the supernatural, and so Blade has to ally with the A-team of the fanged universe, and whup some ass. Which he does rather well. Goyer does try and make the plot at least partly coherent, but what you really want to see from a film such as this, is Snipes and co slicing, dicing, slashing, punching, shooting, kicking, and blowing-up as many long-toothed villians as possible. The film certainly delivers above par, with some truly impressive fight scenes, even enough to beat the jaw-dropping club massacre which opened the first film so brilliantly.<br/><br/>Del Toro has created an entirely new atomsphere to this movie, making it darker, broodier, and ten times as bloody. The comic-book stylings of the original have been dropped in favour of a colder, harder look, which works fantastically. Del Toro evidently wants to make this 'Blade the horror-action movie; not Blade the comic book sequel.' He makes it his own.<br/><br/>Snipes is great as the hero, moody and ruthless, like a hyper-up Batman. BLADE II is as superficial as movies get - it is the popcorn munching machine on hyper-drive, but is as enjoyable as any other action flick released in 2002, and actually a far deal better than xXx or disappointing 20th 007 movie, DIE ANOTHER DAY. In a world of comic-book movies with McDonalds-friendly tie-ins and 12A certificates, it is so nice to a hero cutting a baddie in half length-ways, and hearing cringeworthy dialogue like 'I feel like hammered sh*t!' Despite a few hitches, such as the awful techno-babble ('Administer the neuro detox!') and a couple of plot gaps, this is perfect Friday night entertainment."

","I wasn't a big fan of the first Blade, so when I caught Blade II on cable, I was really surprised by how enjoyable it was. It was sharp and gross and very, very violent. The Reapers were fantastic, especially the first time one appears - a nice, nasty shock. Anne Rice this ain't, thank God. I really enjoyed the humor, especially between Snipes and the magnificent Ron Perlman (now I REALLY can't wait to see this awesome actor as Hellboy). The Bloodpack was a good bunch of side characters, and the martial arts were a lot of fun. Not the most original story on the planet, but del Toro does an awful lot with what he's been given. This is definitely one of those rare times a sequel renders its predecessor pointless. And not just because Whistler was brought back from the dead. (Yeah, that part was kinda clunky, but having him in the movie was a good idea, because his character is an important one to Blade's story.) In fact, this should've been the only Blade movie ever made; it's dark, entertaining, and an excellent addition to the vampire movie genre. 8 out of 10 stars"

","I love the way this movie was edited and the camera angles used.  It was very cool the way the camera followed Blade as he jumped in the air and did flips.  This sequel also has quite a bit of blood and gore for the horror fan.  The special effects were great concerning the reapers mouths. And the fight scenes were good; my favorite was when the girl and guy vampire invade Blade's territory and they fight with pipes. One thing I didn't like was the cliche Rave/Party scene. Just leave that out next time.  And the way Blade seemed so protective over the girl vampire. I mean why, vampires are his enemy and just because one's a girl he automatically feels a connection with her. I just didn't get that.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  The plot won't burn up any brain cells, but it is very visual appealing.  I definitely recommend it if you like action and/or visual effects movies."

","Guillermo del Toro is my new hero. I just began looking at his films and each one of them have elements that make me sit back and go.....""Whoa!"" Blade II is no difference. <br/><br/>I will be honest. I didn't see Blade I. Wasn't interested. Didn't grab me. I knew of the Comix, I thought Wesley Snipes was a great cast. But for some reason, I didn't get into that one as I had this one. I found it interesting, watchable,gross. I like that kinda thing!<br/><br/>
In Blade II we have another evolution of Vampires that actually make sense. Yes, as I get older, I am sick of the traditional Vampire..even those who rip open the neck and expose flesh. Whoopie. Ya seen it once, ya seen it 1,000 times. Here, I see it--and more, and the thing about it is..its very interesting and different.<br/><br/>The story was 'alright', but remember I didn't see Blade I. It didn't take Blade I to see and like Blade II which is another plus for this film. The minuses for me was the teeny-tiny possible love interest, I could have done without it. And the new vampire elite squad, I would have liked a tad more character development on them, I found them interesting but I never got to know them. <br/><br/>Kris Kristofferson's character seemed like there was more than meets the eye, but went nowhere in this sequel. The twists and turns in Blade II were fine, but could have been much, much sharper developed. I felt it was made into a 'machismo' type film....throw in great martial arts and...wow! No need for that really. The film should have just evolved.<br/><br/>The film should have developed more about Blade, his new relationship to his mentor and those evolved vampires vs. the elite vampire crew. Don't get me wrong, ""something"" was there, but not enough. Including the fighting. I love a good fight, several of them in fact. But I love Guillermo del Toro, and needed more of his vision. (Is it on the editing floor ready for DVD extra minutes, perhaps?)<br/><br/>All in all, Blade II is watchable if you like this kinda genre and I do. Don't let the kids watch, for sure. It's interesting and could be better. In saying this, I know there's probably a Blade III. But even for those like me who never saw Blade I, I found this one -- a little better than 'okay', but not 'spectacular' as it could be for the genre."
"pv71989","Null","0","1","18 March 2003"," Well worth the price of admission
","I was thoroughly impressed with ""Blade II,"" although I do feel it could have used some extra work. Wesley Snipes is bad ass, as usual, as Blade, the ""Daywalker"" (half human/half vampire). For those who may not have seen the original or may not know about the comic book, Snipes gives a brief, but thorough introduction to his character and that of Whistler, his mentor so you don't get lost. It won't be like trying to see the  ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" without seeing the first series installments.<br/><br/>In the first film, Snipes just brooded as he slowly revealed his world to N'Bushe Wright. In this film, he gets to let loose and even show some emotions, such as when he rescues Whistler and later with the female lead. Some of the action is cartoonish, but, hey Blade is a Marvel Comics character.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is tight, too. Kris Kristofferson is tough as nails, although he manages to take way too many punches for a guy his age. Ron Perlman plays yet another guy with serious attitude as a Reinhardt, a member of the Bloodpack, vampire mercenaries trained to hunt Blade, but who must now join up with him as their leader to deal with Reapers, a new strain of vampire. I wish director Guillermo del Toro (""Mimic,"" ""Cronos"") could have fleshed out the rest of the Blood Pack (Priest, Snowman, Chupa, Lili and Lighthammer all get serious camera time, but remain two-dimensional). Del Toro should have taken a page from ""Aliens"" in which most of the space Marines reveal some character.<br/><br/>Luke Goss as Jared Nomak, the original Reaper, is almost as impressive a bad guy as Stephen Dourif was as Deacon Frost in the original. He's totally believable, especially in the opening scene when he had me thinking he was just an extra about to be sliced and diced by vampires at a Czech blood bank. Thomas Kretschmann is suitably evil as the vampire overlord Eli Damaskinos, although he never gets to the point where I cared when he got his comeuppance. Karel Roden plays the slimy lawyer to a tee.<br/><br/>Best of all, though, is the lovely half-Chilean, half-French bombshell Leonor Varela (""Cleopatra""). She plays Nyssa, Damaskinos' daughter. She can act and with the skintight black leather suits, she looks hotter than hot. Hotter even than former porn queen Traci Lords was in the original movie. The only thing I hated about Varela was that del Toro began to show Blade and her character warming to each other, but he never really explore it. Let's just say, I was really disappointed in the ending, though it was heart-wrenching and poignant.<br/><br/>The action is magnificent. Some of the CGI effects when Blade and Nyssa go at it looks silly, but it doesn't detract from the film. The best action, though, is a scene later when an unarmed Blade takes on a couple of dozen ""familiars"" (humans who have sold out to the vampires) armed with cattle prods. The martial arts here are believable and cool and reminded me of Bruce Lee's legendary fight scene with the guards in the underground complex in ""Enter the Dragon.""<br/><br/>Also, check out the fighting in the House of Pain, a disco for vampires (seriously). The gunfights are awesome (and show you how much pure-blooded vampires really like their half-breed cousins). Donnie Yen as Snowman choreographs the fight scenes and even gets to show off some of his stuff himself (although the film could have used more of him since he comes off as likeable and not a smartass like Chupa, Priest or Reinhardt). On a side note, the producers hired some hot-looking women to play female vampires at this club. They certainly don't look anything like the traditional pasty-skinned vamps from the various Dracula films.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Blade II"" is worth adding to your video collection, even if you're not a fan of the comics."

","The original Blade was not a bad movie by any means. It wasn't particularly fantastic either. I didn't exactly have the highest expectations when I rented this. My only interest was in the director, Guillermo Del Toro, of whom I'm a fan. <br/><br/>It seems to me that successful sequels utilize one thing: expanding the world in which the characters inhabit. In Aliens we didn't get one xenomorph, we got an entire army. In Terminator 2, the expected plot was twisted inside out and the scope of the film went above and beyond its predecessor. In Blade II the filmmakers clearly went the route of excess hoping more=better. In some regards it works. In some it does not.<br/><br/>For starters, I LOVED the look of the movie. The visuals were the best part and I think pushing this one over the edge into full blown comic book territory was a wise decision. Blade is a comic book character and although the first one tried to keep a firm grip on reality, Blade II gleefully crosses the line aiming for more of a gothic fairy-tale sort of quality which I think suits the character better. <br/><br/>I had no problems with the plot of the movie either. I think the Reapers were a great idea. We'd already seen Blade fight vampires. Creating a new enemy and having him team with vampires to fight them was an awesome way to go. After The Crow: City of Angels, I had serious doubts about screenwriter David S. Goyer. But now, after reading his original version of that film and now having watched this one- my faith has been restored. Anyone else would have given us a very standard, rehashed sequel. Which makes me think he had this plot cooking even while he was writing the first Blade.<br/><br/>
Snipes borders on over the top in the lead role but he's obviously having so much fun it's hard not to get caught up in at all. I liked the Bloodpack and the father Vampire. The main reaper could have benefitted from a tad more fleshing out, though. As far the rest of that clan, I disagree with other reviewers who wanted more of them. I believe we saw just enough. Serious props for casting Norman Reedus as Scud. I love that guy.<br/><br/>
Blade II is a ""slick"" movie and if you're a fan of that style there's a lot to devour here. It seems to me the only ones who really don't care for it too much are die-hard fans of the original. Which I clearly was not. I think Blade II is more exciting, humorous, and visually heads and tails above the first one. Could have done without the CGI fighting but at the end of the day that's my only complaint- it ain't that bad. 8/10.<br/><br/>
I hope they can top themselves again with Blade III."

So, yeah, I had some expectations concerning Blade II, but even expecting some good time I didn't enjoy the film. Oh no - I was simply blown right through the roof of our local movie theater!!! It's clear that everyone involved in the project, from actors to FX masters to Del Toro himself set out to enjoy themselves & have some serious fun with this film - and they do, and marvelously so. Everything gets thrown in the mix - from mutant super-vampire breed feeding on both humans & usual vampires with equal thirst to elite vampire team (sort of Aliens-soldiers from parallel universe) trained to hunt Blade but forced to accept his leadership. It's fast, it's loud, it's bloody & violent - and, more importantly, imaginative & atmospheric. The CGI-enhanced fights sometimes seem a bit too caricature, but that's not a big problem, cos there's so much more to compensate for that - some scenes will have you on the edge of your seat, like the lengthy episode in the night club. All in all, a solid coctail of comic-book-action & bloody horror, with enough thrills to make its nearly-two-hour length seem fast & furious."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","1","10 December 2002"," Interesting Premise
","Blade II succeeds in not retreading with the original Blade film by developing the premise of Blade joining forces with his enemy, the vampires, to face an even greater threat.  I don't think the filmmakers fully exploited this concept, and fell into the rut of typical filmmaking anyway. At least it has the premise.  Possible Spoilers below: <br/><br/>
One of my gripes with any sequel continuation is the episodal nature of the films.  Most TV episodes begin and end with nothing really changing--you still have the same characters in a similar position, and every now and then the show gets ambitious and changes their relation to each other.  Only when an actor leaves does something dramatic happen.  Same can be said of film sequels, and if they do try to do something dramatic within the film they find a way to hit the reset button.<br/><br/>Look at the Batman films--Kim Basinger's role could have been reprised, but no.  Michelle Pfiefer, Nicole Kidman, same story.  Batman, the character, and his relations to everyone around him never really change throughout the films.  In Batman & Robin the butler may die--yeah right, like any writer has the balls to make a permanent change to the existing Batman world on celluloid.  By the end of the film, everything is pretty much the same except for the inevitable team up of Robin and Batgirl.  The comics have more ambition than the films--at least they had the guts to originally add those characters.  That's not to say the comics can let a character stay dead . . .  <br/><br/>In Blade, Whistler dies.  In Blade II, they bring him right back.  It'd be nice if in life we could just push a reset button and have things fixed like that.  In this one, Blade starts to develop a sympathy for a certain vampiric vixon, but what happens?  She wasn't around at the beginning of the film, so consider her already gone.  Blade's new assistant, what's his name? Is he part of the typical Blade world?  No.  Guess who he's really working for?  <br/><br/>Blade II has a writer who's too timid around the character to properly explore Blade enough to make permanent changes to his environment.  As a result, you can predict this entire freakin' film based on the Blade character.  You don't even have to see any of the film's footage to predict who dies and lives.  It wouldn't be so bad, but every film with this nature is -exactly- the same way.  So, why exactly are we going to see a film set where nothing really happens across all of its sequels?<br/><br/>Blade II ruins Whistler's death scene, it doesn't pack the punch it should because ""oh, he comes back.""  The people who whined that he died in Blade 1 can watch the part of the film where he's alive, or maybe read the same comic books over and over.  Why spend money on something new when there's nothing really new in it?  I don't get that.  I want to see a sequel who is bold enough to actually make changes to the Blade concept, to the characters, introduce new characters and keep them or kill them off and leave them buried.  I'd be very pleasantly shocked to see someone make a film ballsy enough to kill off Blade in the end, as much as I like the character--I'm so itching for some one to do something dramatic with a franchise like this, I would welcome that.  But hey, that's not going to happen.  Too many people would whine because someone has more ambition than they do.   <br/><br/>Other things that annoyed me with this film--the villains all looked alike. Not one of the film's many villains had the flair and personality of Frost from the first film, which was disappointing."
"Bogey Man","6","0","2","9 December 2002"," A pretty noteworthy lesson in hysterical editing and cinematography - Hollywood getting closer to Hong Kong
","Guillermo Del Toro (Cronos (1993), Mimic (1997), The Devil's Backbone (2001)) directed this fast and furious sequel, Blade 2 (2002), to Stephen Norrington's original Blade (1998) that gave hope for something interesting and personal to come out from Hollywood in this horror/action department. Wesley Snipes' charisma and strong presence accompanied by Kris Kristofferson's calmer talent with the over-the-top special effects and martial arts made the first film a very nice experience and piece of 90's ""Hollywood genre cinema."" The sequel isn't quite as positive an experience but still has its moments and positive things.<br/><br/>Snipes is again Blade, the half human, half vampire, vampire killer trying and willing to save the world from the bloodsuckers that inhabit everything and can be everywhere as long as there's no sunlight, silver or garlic near them. The sequel has a new kind of vampire breed that fights and feeds on also the ""normal"" vampires and very soon Blade is forced to join forces to fight the more lethal and meaner enemy that cannot be discussed with at all. What follows is mayhem, blood, ""suckheads"", typically not-so-deep characters, CGI effects and plenty of action. <br/><br/>The sequel is written by David S. Goyer who also wrote the original Blade and for example The Dark City (1998) for Alex Proyas of the Crow (1994) fame. The plot is pretty simple and as it includes plenty of action and martial arts scenes, it is really pretty hard to feel bored while watching the film, at least I didn't feel at all. The beginning, the punch to the viewer senses, is very long and interior/exterior based action spectacle that ends only when the film makers could be sure that no one in the audience was bored or not interested in the premise! The beginning gives some clues about the film's most interesting merits that are in the editing and photography departments. <br/><br/>The editing is fast and fierce but not irritatingly and amateurishly so. It all serves the film's cartoon like (vampire) world in which words like slow, peaceful and safe are very rare and not so easy to be found in its everyday life. When the action begins, the speed is very fast and this is taken to its maximum effect by the hysterical editing and inventive usage of camera. There are many great and long drives and different speeds of the drives that make the film genuinely stylish as they are not used in vain and all the time but cleverly and restrainedly to add the effect only when the piece needed it. Also the dark scenes at the sewer and the infamous vampire bar are pretty atmospheric and there's also a brief but memorable bit of blue mist pushing through the windows and blinds to give the kind of incredibly beautiful and moody effect as in the greatest Hong Kong pieces like Ringo Lam's City on Fire (1987) and Danny Lee's Dr. Lamb (1992) and its stunning flashback scenes at the lamb's apartment. And this is not the only thing this film has in common with the Hong Kong films and makers.<br/><br/>The fight choreographer is no less than the Chinese Donnie Yen who is known for his breath taking fighting talent in various Hong Kong films like Yuen Woo Ping's Iron Monkey (1993), Raymond Lee's New Dragon Gate Inn (1992) and Tsui Hark's Once Upon a Time in China 2 (1992). He also has a small role in Blade 2. The martial art fights (which are plenty, too) are, alongside the mentioned visuals, among the things that make the film's action so interesting and kinetic, and thus the film a bit close(r) to Hong Kong films. <br/><br/>The major bad thing is the special effects that seem little too ""computer like"" and don't seem to fit to the film. The CGI gore and vampire killings are not so convincing and flawless but still nice to watch as in some computer or video game, but not in a film. The film is most likely equally violent with the first film, but the first film had much more effective and inventive special and vampire effects than this sequel. Especially the beginning of part one is among the greatest beginnings I've seen for long time in any horror attempt.<br/><br/>The needless ""shock epilogue"" is also a very irritating and seems to be there as if the screenwriter had had one minute to write it and then decide, during the same minute, whether it will be included in the film or not! Also the usual one liners could be completely lacking but fortunately they are not too irritating and ""entertaining."" Blade 2 is harmless and fast paced piece of Hollywood horror and action film and in its own unpretentious genre it is among the more interesting and definitely professional attempts for some time and well worth a look for those interested in the genre. Definitely should be seen on the big screen as (of course) any other film, too.<br/><br/>6/10"

Some of the fight scenes were ruined by CGI actors so obvious that it just hurt my feelings. The movie is bloody and really violent. It's really, really violent actually. People get slain in ways that defy description. Now I have no problem with that. It's just... there's just things in this movie that shouldn't have been here. All that rap/metal/techno feels really out of place, especially during the fight scenes. I feel that they should've stuck with the original score for those scenes. Watch the scene where he fights the two ninjas in his hideout. The music they use there is really good (but the scene is also a perfect example of bad CGI, cough, cough). But to have some Crystal Method's ""Name of the Game"" during a half-inspired whoop-ass scene leaves you tapping your finger in Space Madness style.

","I thought the parts of the first Blade I saw were pretty cheesy, since the ending was filled with fake computer effects and sported a skinny villain who looked like he needed a tan. But the budget for Blade II is obviously much higher, so now we get insanely cool Reaper vampires who can suck the fluids out of you with their bowling ball-sized tongues and fight sequences that defy imagination. Sure there are the usual questions about the loose plot, but since you'll never get answers it is better to just sit back and watch the body count rise. I dug Blade as the hero, with his silver bullet uzi and Batmanish attitude towards others, the Blood Pack team (sheesh, even the name Blood Pack is cool by itself!), and especially that creepy, 1,000-year-old vampire who wants to breed invincible Dracula warriors (oops, spoiler!). There are one or two nice twists that I didn't see coming and again, the fighting is just as good as anything you'll see in The Matrix, if not better. Of course we get that one token slow-mo shot where the camera pans around the combatants, but who could refuse to do a shot like that in their action movie? Hopefully when the second Matrix movie comes out it will have something fresh for everyone to rip-off. Be warned, though, that this is a very gross movie, filled with exploding bodies, scenes of vampiric autopsy, gooey brains and much more, so the squeamish would definitely want to stay away from Blade II. Other than that, comic book fans and lovers of action should adore this movie. ***/****"

","When I first saw this movie, I was amazed, but couldn't hear anything, but I bought the DVD. When I saw it again it was all action and the plot was a bit understandable. The plus side is that the Blade movies are A LOT BETTER than the Resident Evil movie. ""You do not know WHO YOU'RE F***ING WITH!"" Blade<br/><br/>Story: Blade (Snipes) is now in Prague trying to find his partner and mentor Whistler (Kristofferson)(Whistler did shoot himself, but he turned into a vampire.). Teaming up with Scud (Reedus), Blade finally finds Whistler and cures him. However, moments after, two vampires enter their HQ to deliever a message telling Blade the Damaskinos clan needs his help. Blade then makes an unlikely alliance with the Bloodpack (led by Perlman), originally trained to hunt Blade, to eliminate a new threat. Reapers, led by Nomak (Goss) Nosferatu-essque vampires, are capable of feeding of vampires, which turns them into their kind. The same thing applies to humans also. Main strengths are that they're immune to silver and garlic. They are only vunerable to sunlight, and on the sides of their bodies. Now Blade has to go along for the ride.<br/><br/>There is more to the story as it seems, but I don't want to spoil it. In some of the scenes, there were a few emotional scenes and morals like for example, Blade started caring about Nyssa sometime in the movie and Whistler was more of a father figure instead of a drill-sergeant type of character. ""Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer."" Blade<br/><br/>There was some humor in it, but some of it was dirty (no problem with that.). The action scenes were like ""Oh S***!"" and Blade was more of a bad-ass and seemed like he was enjoying it. The fight scenes were well done and coordinated by Donnie Yen (Bloodpack member Snowman). The Reaper effects were well-done.<br/><br/>Should you buy it or rent it? It depends on your tastes. If you're not into vampire movies (stupid teens meet up with them), then this is something you'll like. If you just don't like vampires in general, don't get it. For people that enjoy action movies, it is a MUST-BUY. Any Resident Evil fans disappointed with the movie, this will cheer you up hopefully.<br/><br/>Personal evaluation: Watching it makes me hyper and confident enough in my karate class which helps me kick a lot of ass.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 and a half/10"

","Terrific yet even more violent sequel as Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson reprise their roles from the first movie and director Guillermo del Toro runs the show here.<br/><br/> The story, written by David S. Goyer here is even more complex as Blade (Snipes) who bails out his mentor/sidekick Whistler (Kristofferson), who from a lab, and the duo and the new partner, Scud (Norman Reedus) are urged by the vampire nation to assist them in riding the world of a new threat that are called ""Reapers"" and their feared ringleader, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss).<br/><br/>The Reapers themselves, are certainly a work of art, and not only they feed on humans, but vampires, too.  That's why has the nation deeply concerned and they see their bitter rival Blade and Whistler to lead the crusade.<br/><br/>Blade, Scud, and Whistler are soon paired with the Bloodpack, a buffed up and ambitious version of ""The Wild Bunch"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" (take your pick).  The unit's sole purpose was to kill Blade and they're led by Nyssa (Lenor Varela), the king's daughter and Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), who sort of resembles Victor Franko minus the hair.<br/><br/>Once the bunch find their targets, the movie begins to get very intense and the fight scenes are brutal, so I'll put at that.  There are some unexpected surprises that follow and you're not sure what will happen.<br/><br/>Director Guilllero Del Toro is no stranger to making movies that deal with vicious creatures.  ""Cronos"" and ""Mimic"" are a couple of noteworthy examples.  And here, he takes the film in a direction in the way someone drives down a back road at night, not knowing what they run into.  You ask yourself ""Where do you find the suspense in that?""<br/><br/>""Blade II"" asks the same question and you don't how to answer that.  Well, it's just as good as the original, if not better."

","Those who wound up not liking this movie all seem to have the same complaint....it wasn't as serious as the first....what these people don't get is that THAT'S THE POINT.....<br/><br/>Having purchased the DVD last week, and heard my theory proved correct straight from Guillermo Del Toro's mouth, i can say this with complete confidence....the first one was meant to be the establisher....the basis for which any and all sequels (and oh yes, a Blade III is coming...it's in David Goyer's contract) will work from. Hence, the more serious tone. Del Toro's take on Blade was meant to be more of an episodic anime/comic book feel. His main concern was to have fun, to make a movie in the Blade universe that would rock in every sense of the term, and not betray the universe set up in the first film...while I, like others, am disappointed that the character of Karen from the first film didnt make the transfer over to the sequel, about 10 minutes in, you forget she exists.<br/><br/>What we got in exchange is a new breed of vampire that's just about THE scariest cinematic creature creation since H. R. Giger's Alien....action scenes that rival some of Hong Kong's best, which is something a scant few American films can claim.....and a load of atmosphere and style that only a mind as in tune with what makes horror horror as Guillermo Del Toro's could've envisioned properly.<br/><br/>Looking for story? A continuation of the themes of humanity and breaking social hierarchy from the first movie? Lotsa luck. This story was meant to stand on its own two feet, and like the anime and comics this style of storytelling is based on, not every episode/issue has to advance the tale 3 steps. Expect that of X2 in May, not this flick.<br/><br/>The other big issue is with the CGI....are the CGI effects obvious? Yeah...although there are a couple of places where you think they used CG, and it's really a makeup/prosthetic....does it matter? To me? No. I honestly don't know where this idea comes from that ANY CGI is bad, and any effect can be done better using wires and miniatures. Granted, there have been massive failures of the idea, most notably in the form of a certain wrestler-turned-half-scorpion, but in the case of most ""impossible"" effects, i think these people are being far too harsh on the method. Case in point in this movie being the final fight between Blade and Nomak, with CG stuntmen making up the harshest parts of one of the most brutal fights in recent memory. Yeah, the CG stuntmen are obvious. I also think it wouldnt have worked any other way. People, youve gotta look at thhhings with better eyes than that.<br/><br/>In closing, i think the succeeds on every level it attempts to hit, and anyone willing to put some duct tape over the mouth of their inner cynic looking for more substance in their movies should be able to see that. Roll on Blade III indeed."
"SalvatoreConte","Null","0","1","6 September 2002"," Blade, the crusader
","""Blade II"" is an enjoyable formula-film, characterized from an almost unsuspicious romantic tinge. In the second chapter of the series, the new vampires leader sends his attractive daughter to negotiate a temporary alliance with Wesley Snipes-Blade, half man-half vampire, immune to the light and silver, and pitiless exterminator (in ninja-samurai style) of vampires. The final goal is to chase a common enemy: the deadly Nomak, a vampire-Frankestein, degenerated from an unlucky cloning experiment by the vampires leader himself, able to infect both men and vampires, transforming them in degenerate beings. To help Blade in the audacious enterprise, it's ready a squad of presumed ultra-trained vampires, who are going to go up as smoke. At the end, after an apocalyptic `ridding of pests', and literally incinerated all the characters of the script, Snipes and the faithful Kris Kristofferson (this one revived from the first `Blade') are the only survivors. It turns out immediate to the reader as the final goal's surely achieved without need to add any particulars. There is not even the risk, sometimes feared, that the new sequel could foresee too many points of contact with the actual chapter. The general plant of the plot goes back to ""Aliens"" and to ""The dirty dozen,"" without neglect suggestions even from ""Popeye"" (the regenerating dive in the pool of blood remembers much the ""spinach-effect""; and after all also Blade is a character of the comic strips). In the context of an approximate screenplay, that seems spoiled from repeated afterthoughts, it stands out the not verbal dialectic between Blade and Nyssa, the daughter of the Vampire Nation `leader maximo'. The tenebrous Nyssa is not able to win the dull distrust of the crusader Blade in useful time and, tricked even from the father, broken not from the fights but in the heart, she surrenders without resist to the infected bite of the degenerate stepbrother, choosing then to incinerate between the arms of Blade, in a dark romanticism that remembers ""Arc of Triumph"". At the end it seems however to go in ash just the hero-Blade, incapable in distinguishing between nobility and poverty and between faith and fanaticism; the whole story at the same time coming to an unintentional parable on the destructive effects of the ideological absolutism. It would have been interesting to go into the opposition between humans such biologically but ethically vampires (see the characters of Scud and Kounen) and vampires such biologically but ethically humans; but that required too much courage... ""Blade II"" stays an enjoyable formula-film."

","'Blade 2' is an action movie crossed with a horror. It is macho, gruesome and very, very violent.<br/><br/>That description will have put many of you off completely, which is fair enough, but if you do have a taste for the action genre then you should see this movie, because it kicks ass.<br/><br/>For those of you who have not seen the first film, vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes) is half-human, half-vampire, with their  strengths but not their weaknesses - except for a thirst for blood. He's a bit like Buffy, but a lot nastier. In the first film the vampires took his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristoffersen) and Blade is seeking him. Blade finds the old man but also learns that there is a new breed of vampire loose in the world, almost unkillable mutants called Reapers, who feed on vampires as well as humans. Blade must team up with a elite unit of vampires to try and destroy the Reapers, while watching his own back and developing feelings for one of his enemies.<br/><br/>The movie is actually an improvement on the original. We get a closer look at the vampires, particularly one family, and, ironically, they become more human, which makes them more interesting than when they are just sadistic killers. But the real foundation of the film, the thing that all action movies stand or fall on, is the intensity and style of the action. It is here that Blade 2 triumphs. The fights are adrenalin-surging amalgams of power and precision, speed and slow-motion, beauty and brutality. Guns, swords, fangs, kicks, throws, punches, dark glasses, black leather, tatoos (including a Maori design), vampires disintegrating in showers of sparks and gore. Because it is so spectacular, and occurs largely to the undead or faceless guards, the violence does not have the unpleasant, dehumanising feeling that many more realistic action movies do. <br/><br/>With its superhuman warriors the film belongs to the tradition of martial-arts fantasies developed in Hong Kong and is exemplified by 'The Matrix' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. While it does not have the class or intelligence of those modern classics, Blade 2, with its merging of Gothic shadows and cyberpunk technology, is very stylish. I could not say it was smart, and it certainly is gratuitous, but it is, literally, bloody cool.<br/><br/>

I saw this movie at the theaters when it first came out. I saw it despite the fact that the reviews of it were split  and that I didn't care much for the original film. However thanks to one personal recommendation I paid my $6.50 to see it at the theater and came away with a smile on my face. This was a perfect summer film even though it actually came out in the spring. I actually found it to be more entertaining than the more hyped and overrated ""Spiderman."" This film starts off fast and never thinks about slowing down. Sure the last 15 or so minutes may have been a little overkill with its how-can-we-top-what-we've-already-done epic battle. And I'll concede that the characters could have been explored a little (okay, a lot) more. But those flaws do not prevent the film from being thoroughly entertaining and, surprisingly, very creepy at times. Take a bow, Mr. Del Toro!<br/><br/>
Kudos must also go to Snipes. I respect him as an actor but in the first Blade I found him intolerable with his facial expressions and acting that was over the top for even comic book film standards. This time out he got it just right. Now let me give Mr Snipes a bit of advice: skip doing the Black Panther film. Playing two super hero roles in a short time span could lead to some serious type casting.<br/><br/>Oh, is it okay for me to say that Leonor Varela is a goddess? I think I'm in love."

There are great fight scenes and excellent special effects (including awesome gore and CGI's despite one cartoonish looking fully animated Blade) and a satisfactory explanation to Whistler's return (he is supposedly killed in the original). 	 Del Toro was a perfect pick for the director.  His trademark vampires and graphic violence are kinetic here as they supposedly are in his Cronos films.

Totally counter to the norm, this sequel is streets ahead of the original in terms of style, action, choreography...even testosterone tease. It even manages to flow on reasonably well from the original tale with Snipes awesome in his re-incarnation as the martial-arts vampire vigilante with a cool line in both armaments and fashion sense.<br/><br/>If one had gotten Ridley Scott, Dario Argento and John Woo together on a horror/action flick collaboration, BLADE II might have been the outcome. A tad low on plot development? Jeez, give me a break...who goes to see a flick like this looking for character and plot development for God's sake? Certainly not the theater full of actions fans I saw this with the other night. It gob-smacked the entire audience!<br/><br/>Few of you would not know by now that ""Blade"" is put on a new ""case"" this time...hired by the very vampires he hunts so well, to eradicate a bunch of genetically altered super-munchers that feed on their own kind. Most of the film plays pretty much as a re-run of ALIENS, even down to the new breed's retractable mandibles - half Ripleyesque, half PREDATOR unplugged! Derivative or not, this thing rocks. Very RESIDENT EVILish at times with arguably the most stunning fight sequences ever presented. By comparison, BLADE 1 is for wimps.<br/><br/>Call me sick, but I personally found the night-club sequence where some remarkably good looking female vampires were being disembowelled and/or having their backs ripped apart to satisfy the blood lust of their companions, totally erotic! As many have commented, the film generates a savage desire to be bitten oneself and to be able to share in this gratuitously violent existence. Ron Perlman, sartorially resplendant as the gothically unchallengable and virtually indestructible Reinhardt, has probably come up with his finest role here. The concluding confrontation between him and Blade is as good as anything I have ever seen. The viewer could never say they were short-changed here!<br/><br/>A celebration of vampiric evil, offhand I cannot nominate a more adrenalin pumping children-of-the-night tale. ""Stylish"" doesn't adequately cover it! I agree, the fx range from campy at best to straight out jaw-dropping (pun-intended) However the less effective sequences are thankfully very short. Leonor Varela hands us the best-looking euro-vampire yet (mind you, the setting is Prague!)and if ever she needs to bite someone....I will gladly take a ticket and stand in line!<br/><br/>My ONLY complaint is the pathetic and totally inappropriate last scene which single handedly destroys the credibility and emotional power of the previous one (the rising sun!) It was unnecessary and should have been cut leaving Blade (and the audience) alone that dawn, with just their own thoughts.<br/><br/>Tremendous effort all round. If you don't like it, you have no imagination, no taste for horror films and no right having been in the theater in the first place! No self-respecting vampire would look at you twice!"

One thing i dont understand that some people could gushes complains about story plotting , ok, i dont blame them though, it is probably the anally retentive veins pumping, i myself dont read Blade comics so i wouldnt know what does the comic version offer that this film didnt have...dig that B?<br/><br/>ok i hate to like this film, but i do like it , the energy of the action scenes are ridiculously squeezed into your cerebrum, this feeling of ""oh-how-i-wish-im-a-cloaked-vamp-vigilante"" invaded me,i got out of the cinema feeling jealous that i have to lead this gloomy college life, the same feeling when i watch films like Matrix, spiderman and such.. bummer.<br/><br/>Aside from the parrabelum holed plot settings, credits due where its due, one can tell the difference of budget between this blade and the first, probably like El-mariachi(1991) to Desperado(1995) if not like Desperado to the upcoming Desperado; once upon a time in Mexico(2002). The computer effects; the burning to ashes slaughtered vampires for example, whilst in the first Blade this effect can sometimes be shown in a playstation 2 presentation (to keen eye) enhanced greatly in Blade 2, the computer effects departement obviously are so proud of this, that even a sliding burning ashes got its own camera close up for 2-3 seconds, the highlight of CGI in here is however the transformation of real flesh and blood actors to a silicone rendered one, shown especially in a fresh original way and enhanced by the kinetic camera work, you just have to see it for yourself to experience it, its almost like watching a virtual animated comic book.<br/><br/>costumes, gadgets and locations, need i say more? the props and set designer departement deserves heaps credit here,the G.I Joe's Snake Eyes look-a-like costume that Assad and Nyssa wears at the first time, the mini gun used in the night club..yep.. think aliens or predator..the character designs of the bloodpack, straight out of manga, yet too cool to be criticized,the Reaper character almost fails to impress me as it took too much reference from other parasytical creatures of other films, i like the Bone shielded heart idea though.<br/><br/>Bad points here will be the acting, somehow Snipes looks tired, and aged, his one liner utterings,and superficial grimmacings that occured whenever a fight scene commences doesnt help his character development (and believe me theres so much fighting scenes, you wont even have time to take a pop corn break here), whenever Blade shares screen with the bloodpack or reapers he shines less, but i think its probably due to Snipes height and dimming persona, he is after all reached his Fourth decade, plus Blade's costume looks too thick that it hides wesley's muscular figure and makes him somehow looks thick and over protected... whilst the figures of bloodpack members looks mighty cool, it is better when some of them do not speak at all, as i Assume some of these dudes are martial artists that usually appears in gary Daniels B martial art duds. Donnie Yen as snowman is criminally underused, ok, so he did a good swordplay scene, however later on, dispatched in the silliest way when he suppose to be this silent Shinobi type character, Ron Perlman repeats his role in Enemy of the Gates(2001) and Alien Ressurection(1997) , but we love him anyway (a freudian slip for comic geeks here; he is set to play Hellboy, he got the attitude and look, but he, like Snipes here is a bit too old to play these inhuman anti heroes, plus with his current non leading status, one can't help to assume that a 'Spawn-played-by-michael-jay-who?' syndrome might repeat itself).<br/><br/>Ok last minor flaw i want to mention anyway; when Assad and Nyssa character was first introduced as the night marauders, their fighting skills equalizes that of Blade's, however as the film goes,they become so mighty weak, Heck..like that Scud character say ""wot's up with that B?"" and also Scud character is almost unecessary, but like Donald logue in Blade 1st, he is a comic relief. well, if youre looking for an ultimate kung fu, WWF enhanced vampire shoot em up flicker with 1001 sound effects of bone crunching, sword toring the flesh and sinew stuffed in it.. then this is a must, if youre looking for a tragedy-romance vampire type of film then fast forward to the last 5 minute scene, its a bit on the cheese side but Leonor Varela is a hottie and the panorama helps.<br/><br/>3 outta 5 for this solid horror action flick.<br/><br/>+3 for production value,energy and non stop action scenes.<br/><br/>-2 for the cliche ""entering the thumping Sodom and Gomora night club scene"" and repetitive use of sound effects,existence of Scud character and for non stop action scenes."

","Slick, stylish, action-packed...these are just some of the words that come to mind when describing Blade II.  Oh, and incredibly gory.  If gratuitous blood-n-guts isn't your thing, I'd recommend you stay well away...<br/><br/>As far as big-budget sequels go, Blade II isn't that bad a trip.  For the most part it retains the same basic feel that made the original Blade enjoyable, and this time the film is set in Prague and a decidedly European slash Gothic feel is evident, a very moody one at that.  Blade II kinda skimps on the story (as you'd expect), and is instead packed full of stylish action sequences, and lots of blood and guts.  There were a few moments where I was squirming in my seat at what was onscreen, so it's definitely not one for the faint of heart.  That said though, the story is a good effort, it's sufficient and you wont be bored.  I read a review describing Wesley Snipes as one big show-pony in this film, and I couldn't agree more.

During preparations, yes. During testosterone-indulging conversations, yes. But during ACTION - BIG NO! Heavy tunes, heavy tunes- either rock (Worked beautifully in Crow) or techno / hard trance (works best, as seen in Blade 1, Replacement killers etc.) And a word about the using of trance: before putting on anything that sounds cool in that side of the Atlantic, ask an opinion about it from Europe. ""Confusion"" [P.P.R. RMX] was a lucky shot in the beginning of Blade 1, but ""Blood Is Pumping"" by Voodoo & Serano in Blade 2 is not just VERY old news in here, it's also a bad example of a rip-off remake (the original is  ""Up to no Good"" by Porn Kings).

","I was rooting for this to be a first rate action/horror movie, but it never really gets around its kung fu and techno music fixation enough to satisfy in that department. I blame this largely on the script, which does little to develop Blade as an interesting hero. Snipes just deadpans a lot and spouts tired old cliches like ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer"". The plot is too much of a rehash from Blade 1 (Blade gets captured  and has to suck blood to escape etc). And I didn't really see a pressing need to bring back Kris Kristofferson for part two (As good as he is in general). I think that action movies as a genre need to branch out and take a few more risks than this film does."

","The first Blade was a travesty. It was an unexcusable mess compiled together with quick cuts, flashing technology and a never-ending soundtrack of techno music.  It had no sense of joy or adventure; it was just a slice and dice film with no purpose and blood oozing out of every frame. Now, Blade 2 is here with its quick cuts, flashing technology and a never-ending soundtrack of techno music. The only difference between the first Blade and the second is, the second one is good. <br/><br/>Blade (Wesley Snipes) is half man and half vampire. He chooses to side with the humans, rather than the vampires. He hunts down vampires, kills them, and they explode like a Fourth of July firework. In the first one, Blade got his weapons specially made from Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), but Whistler met his untimely demise. But, in actuality, the vampires took Whistler's body and kept it and nursed him back to health so he could become a vampire. Blade is searching the entire world and finally he finds Whistler. Vampires confront Whistler and Blade. They don't want to kill him, they want him to help them. There's a new breed of killing machine, which feeds off of humans and vampires. They want to put aside their differences and try and stop these Reapers, as they are called. The Reapers appear to be normal, but they have a `scar' on the chin that opens up to a giant mouth with about nine tounges. <br/><br/>The reason Blade 2 is better than the fist is because Blade 2 has a story to back up its action scenes. The first was just an endless killing spree that got boring after about five minutes. Blade 2 has substance to match with its style. <br/><br/>Wesley Snipes, who returns in the role, has about a much enthusiasm as a rock. But, he does give Blade the certain edge he needs. Kristofferson has much better material to work with this time and provides a lot of comedy relief when its needed and keeps his mouth shut when the time is inappropriate. Director Guillermo del Toro knows how to mix computer effects when the time is right. The first Blade had an overkill of special effects, but in Blade 2 uses them  to perform stunts the human body is incapable of doing. Del Toro also has a way with the camera. When Blade spins, the camera spins right along with him. <br/><br/>Blade 2 will probably be the best popcorn movie of the year. It differs from Resident Evil in that Evil was just an exercise in special effects and zombies. Blade 2 is a smart popcorn movie that knows its audience doesn't always need everything spelled out. Resident Evil, which I did enjoy, had the plot planned out around the action. Blade 2 has the action planned into the plot so it makes sense and fight scenes just don't break out for any good reason. Blade 2 is extremely above average when it comes to popcorn movies. If only Tomb Raider would have been this good.---------8/10"

Del Toro ups the ante and delivers a movie that grabs you by the eyeballs and doesn´t let go until the credits start to roll. It is impossible to take it all in in the first sitting and BLADE II looks so great and is told so smoothly that you´ll want to see it again and again. And again. There isn´t much to challenge your cerebral cortex but it's good, old and very beautiful entertainment. An absolute must."

","If your looking for a movie with a complex plot you went to the wrong movie. BUt if your looking for a thrill ride laced with adrenile coated horror and violence then you found the right movie.(MAYBE ONE OR TWO SPOILERS)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Blade two was a honey of a bloodfest and certainly out did the original. I have been reading comment after comment about the plot holes and horrible dialouge and my response is. It has no more bad plot holes or poor dialogue then some other more popular summer action block busters(Or Did his sense just work when they felt like!)Blade is fast paced and quick. This complies with the action scenes and the dialouge there is no room for complex story line and idea because Blade's life isn't terribly complex. If you didn't see blade one then I guess that would be a problem to comprehend that fact. But you don't have to see blade one to know that his main goal in life is to erradicate vampires. Everything centers around that one premiss. The CGI in the movie is used well. It wasn't the latest, but one on Blades budget it was way better done then movies with larger budgets. Two Blade is a comic book movie so it is more about the attitude of the character rather than the coherence of the dialogue. THese people fit their roles.<br/><br/>
So if you were some how looking for a Movie which was going to contemplate the meaning of life in the vast reaches of the universe, you pick the wrong movie. ANd should really pay attention to commercials and ads more. But if you were looking for a movie which will entertain you and keep you cheering for the villian as much as the hero then I recommand blade 2. Also if your a comic book fan he does way more justice to the character than marvels last two comic book movies from their company."

","`Blade 2' is the sequel to the enjoyable `Blade'. Sequels are notorious for disappointing, being weaker than the original with the very few exceptions (only `Aliens' springs to mind, as the `The Godfather, Part II' is not a bona fide sequel). `Blade 2', while not being exactly a brilliant movie, surprises by being a grand sequel and great fun.<br/><br/>Acting? It's all camped up here. Everyone appears to be having fun. Wesley Snipes is the titular character and delivers his lines with smooth sheer coolness. Nothing phases him and Snipes is the perfect man to carry it off. Kris Kristofferson, as his sidekick Whistler, provides the humour with a great laidback charm. Ron Perlman is delicious as Blade's unwanted help, leader of a gang of vampires called the Bloodpack. The motley Bloodpack are a great example of the eclectic team found often in action movies and they work well here, as they help Blade battle a new form of vampires called Reapers who, as they feed on vampires as well as humans, represent a threat to the whole world.<br/><br/>The plot's paper thin, but it's nicely over looked when you're watching a movie replete with action sequences. The fight sequences are lovingly choreographed, and shot with an established eye for action by director Guillermo del Toro. There's a whole sense of fun, almost a tongue-in-cheek tone to the proceedings at times. The gore is strong, the violence furious, but never offensive  - it is based on a comic book, and these roots show in the picture.<br/><br/>As action movies go, `Blade 2' can hold it's head proud. It's never trying to be more than it should be, never adopting pretentious airs. It's a movie revelling in delivering adrenaline pumping action, slick movement and a dose of fun. It's not intelligent or innovative enough to become a classic but it's a welcome popcorn diversion for a night, and a sequel worthy to the franchise that would encourage you to see a `Blade 3'. 6.5/10."

","I was pretty pleased with ""Blade II"" for the most part.  There was a lot of things that I didn't like, but not enough to ruin the movie for me.  Some of the fight scenes were down-right incredible, but a few times the director went a little overboard with the computer effects.  Some of the scenes looked a little silly due to the computer effects.  This is going to sound a little odd, but I thought some of the fight scenes were a little too much of a comic book (flying all over the place, people getting thrown across the room, impossible martial arts moves, etc).  Being a movie made from a comic book, that might sound odd, but they were just too over-the-top.  But, like I said for the most part, it was a pretty decent movie.  I liked all the characters, and in some cases I was sad to see them die so soon because I thought there was potential for a kick-ass fight with him/her, but that didn't pan out.<br/><br/>Compared to the first Blade, I thought it was probably just as good.  I liked the story in Blade II a lot actually, it was pretty interesting, and I loved that Blade and the Vampires were forced to team-up to take on these new breed of vampires called ""Reapers"".  Very ironic!  Anyhow, the action is great, the story is great, the characters are great.  If you've seen the original Blade and liked it, then you'll probably like this one as well.  Be forewarned though, this movie is a lot more bloody than the first film.<br/><br/>As far as a third installment goes, I'm all for it.  I'd love to see Blade again in another adventure.

Blade II compares favorably to the original and actually has more action and even has some funny one-liners.  The film also seemed to be more gruesome and the reapers were almost scary at some parts of the film.<br/><br/>The action in Blade II seemed to be mostly based upon Jujitsu and Pro-wrestling.  Some of the action sequences were improved via the use of CGI and resulted in some cool and impossible moves such as the elbow drop off the wall in the final Blade/Nomak fight.<br/><br/>I can't recommend Blade II to somebody who wants to see a revolutionary and realistic film with an amazing story, but I strongly recommend this film to anybody who wishes to see a cool film with a lot of great action.

"nicksteier","6","0","2","24 March 2002"," Set your standards low and you'll be impressed
","I can't say I was disappointed in this film- my expectations were low at best.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, but sequels to these types of movies are motivated by money, and are traditionally best left unmade. The story was fairly solid, but like so many trashy vampire movies as of late (i.e. ""Queen of the Damned,"" the 'worst-movie-I've-ever-seen-save-Battlefield Earth ""John Carpenter's Vampires"") it focused on action, mindlessness, and gore rather than character development and/or plot.<br/><br/>The correlation between the original ""Blade"" and the sequel is shaky, but they at least make an attempt to bridge them together with an opening monologue (these never usually work- this was no exception) and several flashbacks.  Surprisingly, the flashbacks actually add flavor, especially if it's been a while since you've seen the first movie.<br/><br/>The sound was solid, both musically and effects-wise, but the visual effects appear as if they were done on some college kid's Macintosh: they looked pretty much like one of those Jeff Goldblum-endorsed home movies.  The supernatural-like abilities, such as quick swordplay, towering jumps, and kicks that knocked the opponents back 10 meters, were incredibly cheesy at best.  A big disappointment compared with the quality of the effects in ""Blade.<br/><br/>There were some highlights however.  Kris Kristofferson was miraculously decent, not so much in his portrayal of Whistler as in his overall acting ability.  But I guess anything is an improvement from the 'zero' of the first movie.  Wesley Snipes proves that Blade is his character and nobody else's.  The surprise was in the appearance of Danny John-Jules (the memorable ""Cat"" in TV's ""Red Dwarf"" series)- his first big screen appearance since ""Lock, Stock...""  It's cool to hear him with his accent.  And no one plays a cocky a**hole like Ron Perlman, and he doesn't fail in this role.<br/><br/>These high points were quickly absolved however with the ""elbow drop from the top ropes"" scene near the end of the film.  This scene was probably elaborated with the fact that the film opened with a preview for ""The Scorpion King.""  Nonetheless, it ruined it for me.  If you're into the WWF, it'll probably make you go ""whoah"" like you did in 3rd grade when that sort of crap might have been cool.<br/><br/>If you're in to these types of flicks, you'll be entertained; like I said, it was better than ""Queen of the Damned.""  Heck, if you go in with the lowest possible expectations you might even be impressed."

","Great movie.  The story was completely believable and melds well with the original.  Blade II basically begins with Blade searching for Whistler, missing for two years.  He succeeds in finding him but there are hints of a lack of trust between the two.  In the meantime a new threat has appeared in the form of ""mutated vampires"".  The leader of this new group, named Reapers, and his minions are bent on destroying all normal vampires.  Blade is asked to lead an elite vampire commando team to track down and eliminate this new threat.  Things take off from there with no one sure who they can trust.<br/><br/>The Reapers are bad, they are a definite step ahead of normal vampires and the scenes where they are involved are the best.  I thought the action was fast and furious without being over the top.  I mean they are vampires after all.  Some of the fight scenes are wholly computer generated and they suffer.  However, there are only a few brief moments of this and the rest of the action makes up for it.<br/><br/>A good follow-up to the original."

","I am going to make a statement that may tork off you anal movie-goers, so brace yourselves. Blade 2 is the only sequel that with out a doubt blows the first one away (although the first one was great) since Terminator 2. I will say that the plot wasn't as tight and good as T2, but it surpassed its' predessesor on many levels.<br/><br/>The first thing that is great about this film: the character that is Blade. Half-man, half-vampire, (which raises the question, which came first, Blade or Angel?) Blade looks like a cross between a ninja, a biker, and Batman. Finally there is a black action lead character that does not need to spout ebonics, crack wise about everybody else's race, and try to be ""the blackest guy on earth"" (Learn from this Will Smith, Chris Rock, Chris Tucker...). Wesley plays his role with confidence, and a very cool attitude, and as normal as a vampire-man would be.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about the enemy in this flick, the Reapers. Not since the early 1990's have I seen a better thought out creature than this. The design behind the anatomy of the Reapers is extremely well thought out, and a lot of appriciated detail was put into it. I don't feel like giving away all attributes about them, but just think of them as a cross between Predator and Marilyn Manson during his Holywood phase.<br/><br/>So here lies the plot, these Reapers drink both human and vampire blood, so therefore the Vampire nation calls Blade to lead a team of Vampires (who were origionally trained to kill Blade) to destroy these Reapers before they reak havoc on everybody. It's not extremely complicated, but it works dammit.<br/><br/>The greatest thing in this film is the fights, I knew that Wesley Snipes knew martial arts, I just didn't know he was THIS good at it. I sat in awe as I watched Wesley whip out moves that would make Jet Li jealous. The film does use computer effects during the fights to make Blade and these other super powered creatures fly and get thrown in the air with a grand flow to it all, and it works really well.<br/><br/>Long review short: If you wanna see a action/horror/martial arts/vampire/superhero film (Lord knows how many of those are out there)then go see Blade 2 right now!"

","I liked Blade 1, and I know sequals are usually weaker than the original so I wasn't expecting as much from this film.  And it was worse than I thought. The fight scenes were good, the plot was shaky, reminded me of Vampire Jurassic Park, but the part that got me was the complete character stupidity.   Spoiler....  When the characters say, only UV Light will kill them, then why not just have Blade walk through the tunnels with big UV lights strapped to his body?  The Vamps were told to cover up, so they do, EXCEPT FOR THEIR HEADS!!!!!!  Why couldn't they use the same uniform they used to go into Blade's hideout and use big huge UV lights???  Sorry, I can accept some character stupidity but when the characters themselves say UV lights can kill them, then they use tiny little lights and 10 second delay bombs, please, that's insulting to me.  And did anyone else notice that when the UV grenade bomb went off in the tunnel, that the main female vamp either saw the light coming, or heard the explosion of the light bombs and DODGED THE LIGHT????   I understand vamps are fast, but she was able to move FASTER THAN THE LIGHT???  Just too silly.  One cool thing, the preview for Jason X. Did it remind anyone else of Leprechaun in Space?"

","I went down to the local movie theater on the opening night of Blade 2, and boy was I surprised. It's just like Blade says during the opening credits of the film, ""Forget everything you know."" Right when you think you know this movie, those darn old Reapers seem to take a bite out of you. The special effects on this movie surpasses amazement and as far as the fight scenes go, pick up your lower jaw before stepping out of the theater. The original Blade film is in no way, shape or form superior to this film, so you wouldn't want to miss this one on the big screen. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'll give this one: An awesome 10+"

","Hat's off to Del Toro. Blade 2 left me gasping for breath and wanting more. Don't delude yourself. Del Toro did not set out to make Citizen Kane. Blade 2 may be a bit  short on story but the plot is diabolical and the action almost never stops. It's full of horrific images that are like a grizzly kind of  fine art. The Reapers are both nasty as hell  and yet horribly tragic.  When you are not looking at lush images of  Vampire warriors you are watching them and Blade performing a balletic and crisply choreographed tour de force of violence. Ash flying, bones splintering, bodies twisting. It is like a hyper live action comic book that hit's you like a punch in the throat. From the ghastly sewers beneath Prague to the underground lair of the ancient Vampire lord, the sets blend high tech Vampire technology and centuries old gothic architecture which makes for some stunning eye candy. The colors are lush in their limited pallet, sodium yellows, ambers, greys, greens and subdued blues. There is more to this film than meets the eye on a first viewing. It's horror/action yes, no doubt about it. But it's anything but  a one dimensional vision.  In my opinion it ranks as one of the best comic book movies ever. Is it for everybody? Certainly not. but if the above overview appeals to you, this is your movie. These are my feelings and impressions of the film, to tell more would be to spoil this wonderful danse macabre. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
"jademist17","Null","0","1","24 March 2002"," It's all about the action...
","I'll try to keep this short and sweet. The movie is all about the action, SFX, and the atmosphere. Yes, the plot was a bit weak and characterization was almost non-existent (maybe except for Blade and Whistler), but this is an Action/FX movie. Take it for what it is and you'll love it! The fights were crisp and shows the masterful fight choreography from Donnie Yen, who also plays the blatantly underdeveloped role of Snowman. I guess the didn't want the fight choregrapher to upstage Snipes. Without Yen, Snipes would never had performed at this movie's potential. Snipes's other flicks show the weak action choreography, but Blade II is a showcase for Yen's directional skills.<br/><br/>One of biggest gripes was the first action scene (set was too dark to really make anything out and too much American action scene editing in which the camera cuts fast back and forth WAY too much). The second and most noticeable flop was Donnie Yen's character. He was utterly pointless and was onscreen for about 5 minutes and even wasn't in some team scenes at all. He speaks English, yet doesn't say ONE word. HE'S THE FREAKIN FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHER, yet the give him a garbage role and show him doing a flying triple-kick. Many viewers were expecting something big with Donnie Yen, but were left asking, even during the movie, ""Where the hell is Snowman?"" or ""Where is that Asian guy with the katana?"" Also, some of the CG was OBVIOUSLY CG. It was best used sparingly with real actors (particularly the last fight scene), but not in 5 second increments of total CG rendering (the fight against the woman vampire).<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SEQUEL SPOILER* Donnie Yen's character also leaves a plot hole. That big guy with the Samoan tatoos should've turned Snowman into a Reaper. After the scene where we see him munch on Yen's neck, that's the last we see of Snowman. This is either a BIG plot hole or a precursor for a another sequel."

"eddy_currents","Null","0","1","24 March 2002"," Excellent action flick
","The best action flick I've seen in months. Snipes is back as the vampire killing half-vampire superhero, and is more likeable in the sequel as he has mellowed a bit over the couple years he has been on his own. They brought Kristofferson back in a reasonable way, which is good because he was the best character from the first movie.<br/><br/>The plot is serviceable. It's predictable but there are some subtleties, like: when there are 3 factions alliances keep shifting and no one trusts anyone. ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend.""<br/><br/>The action is fantastic. Good pacing too, not overwhelming. The combat sequences have the frenetic and floating look that is taking over Hollywood since Crouching Tiger.<br/><br/>The film is very violent and gory though. If you like vampire movies, and you liked Blade, you will love this movie. If neither is true, you probably won't like Blade 2... but you still might. The sequel is better than the original in some ways."

He is tough, but very likeable.  The fight scenes were great.  And as hard as this might be to believe, this is BETTER than the first.<br/><br/>One note about the blood and guts: There is LOTS of it.  Almost EVERY creature in this movie seems to bleed from some place.  But, unlike some movies, the bleeding does add to the movie."

","There's plenty of movies out that have to do with Vampires.  When Blade came out, I was hesitant to see it, after hearing about the Vampire's weakness to Silver (which generically isn't true).  After seeing the movie though, I was surprised, it kicked ass. Going into the theater to see Blade II, I was expecting something not as great as the original.  After all, the original was a ""break-out"" hit, like Rush Hour.  Blade II not only exceeded my expectations, it blew me away. The action scenes are on par with the Matrix, and most are better than any in Blade.  The plot isn't great, but it didn't make you feel like they were just trying to make a sequel.  Some parts of the plot and story are spotty, but if you take it with a grain of salt, you should enjoy the film. Bottom line, If you liked Blade, go see Blade II.  If you didn't enjoy the story in Blade, but you liked the action, go see Blade II anyways."

Lots and lots of makeup/FX/ and action, but too much of a good thing can be a bummer. It's hard to put a finger on what's wrong with the movie. It wasn't a total bummer, overall it's pretty good. The fighting scenes are amazing, too bad that chinese guy (from Iron Monkey) had to die so soon. Just because he doesn't speak any english doesn't mean he should be the first one to go!!

","Just a quick note here: I am a cheeseball.<br/><br/>I dig Blade, and not just because he drives a mean-as-hell primer black Charger (for that, I *love* him ).<br/><br/>Back in '98, I remember wondering if the first movie ""Blade"" was going to be as dull as ""Money Train"" or ""Drop Zone"" -- but hey, he drove a cool car, so it can't be all bad, right? Well, watching it I was pleasantly surprised to find myself guiltily enjoying it, rap music and all (and let me tell ya, I *despise* rap music).<br/><br/>Fast forward four years later and I'm watching previews to ""Blade 2"". I'm looking at the absolute over-the-top stunts, vampires in body armor, and bad bad-ass puns being dropped, and I'm thinking to myself, ""Heh, I bet this will suck worse than 'Highlander 2'"". But hey, he's still got that bad-ass black B-body Mopar, right? How bad can it be?<br/><br/>Well, let me just say that I am extraordinarily surprised and pleased to report that ""Blade 2"", while graphic and at times gory, is a great thrill ride -- just flat-out fun. Snipes shows he's still got the moves (man, does that guy even have a stunt double?), and the director Guillermo del Toro raised himself in my eyes after directing the somewhat predictable movie ""Mimic"".<br/><br/>The fight scenes are not only fast, sharp displays of martial mastery and acrobatic artistry, but there are a *lot* of 'em. There's plenty of gunplay, swordplay, with extra helpings of fist- and foot-play, too. Capping off all of this excellent Eastern fighting fu is a bit of the egregious West that caused the audience that I was with to bust out and cheer (and I clapped with them -- damn me to redneck hell!).<br/><br/>While weak plot-twists do funk up the pacing a little bit, the cast soldiers on through with straight faces -- but let's be frank here: this is not Saving Private Ryan. If you want Academy-level performances and story, go check out E.T., it opened this weekend also.<br/><br/>If, however, you want some *serious* don't-mess-with-me vibe to go with your put-a-boot-in-someone's-ass appetite, I can't think of another movie out anytime soon that will come close to satiating your thirst, as it were.<br/><br/>Blade is a baaad, bad man...<br/><br/><ul><li>novicius -</li></ul>"

Just listen to the silence, with the occasional scream during the screening, and the loud applause at the end, and you'd be wondering how people could possibly dislike this movie! Wesley Snipes gosh, I do like this guy, not only because he's never afraid to take on roles for lessening racially romantic barriers! He is charismatic, even while flexing his muscles!<br/><br/>Hey, I don't know what to think of our new Blade's wisdom! Our hero, ganging up with those Shadow-of-Nation vampires? Got to be kidding!  I just rented and saw the predecessor! I wonder whether he's now having a problem with his testosterone-overflow, and Nyssa is the cause of his slacking sapience! (Hey, didn't Cleopatra make Caesar a wimp?)<br/><br/>And society's new threat? Rippers? Nope, not some hooded descendants of Jack the Ripper, or of old Nosterafu unless our genome-dealing organizations are keeping some dark secret from us! Oh well, who cares as long as this flick projects the `good vs. evil' theme of the comics well on to the big screen. And it does! Who says it's never difficult to distinguish the good guys from the baddies?  Gosh, I love the stunts; I love the fast actions thanks to Hong Kong for whetting our appetites for martial arts! Yep, the actions are mesmerizing! Yep, the takes are as exciting as when Ellen Ripley's deadly encounter with the alien species!<br/><br/>Overall, the film's character development is mediocre. But as a quixotic action actor, Snipes is phenomenal! Love his indestructible character! Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is very lame not much credibility! And Scud, gosh, he is rather predictable! Yet, there's a definite sense and purpose for every character's presence! Unfortunately, there're too many subplots dumped into the main plot, thus weakening the character development. And the one-liners appear as scatter-brained material to hold strong for worthwhile memorizing! Hello, Coen Brothers, where are you in the development of the script's dialogue?  But I DO LIKE the cinematic effects and the creative composite of horrific creatures (truthfully, better than what LOTR has provided!)  Whoa, I was jitter-bugging in my seat, and literally playing hide-seek with the screen! Can't say I wasn't enticed with this film! And the hip-hop soundtrack far too loud and sometimes incoherent  definitely prevents the feel of horror and schlock in various scenes!<br/><br/>Go see this flick if you're an action-horror film freak! Rest assured, you won't need a partner to put you in a jitter-bugging mood, throughout this flick!  Thumbs up for Guillermo Del Toro (heard he's not e'en a distant cousin to Benicio!) After this flick, and The Devil's Backbone, he sure is my sort of Director one who knows how to thrill and scare me! A solid rating of A- from me and I definitely will encourage my young buddies to keep away from this flick! Not unless, they enjoy having nightmares!"

"smakawhat","7","0","1","22 March 2002"," Picture Aliens II but without the fear and terror...
","Enter once again that realm of Hollywood action marketing...<br/><br/>The sequel....<br/><br/>In this case what is new?!?!?  Well they stuck pretty much with the same winning formula.  Blade is his old comic book self as well as his sidekick and nemisis parts, little on dialogue, big on action and looks.  Here director Guillermo De Toro (Mimic, Devil's Backbone) tries to see if he can put his crowning touch on this very likable character.<br/><br/>In short this film was kind of odd, It started off kind of dissapointing, and then got better, and actually kind of did real good towards the end. It also had some GREAT scenes.  The basic plot involves a new breed of vampires (Reapers) that are stalking all of the planet including the ordinary vampires.  The high council asks Blade for his assistance in stopping the threat which is more powerful and more thirst ridden and could wipe away all life..  Henceforth Blade allies himself (cautiously with his small team of humans) AND with the 'Bloodpack' an elite vampire fighting force that was originaly set up to kill none other than the daywalker himself.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this film was that there wasn't alot that was new. That being said the first Blade was just a great neat thing, but watching this I couldn't help but have the feeling, yeah I've seen this already... been there done that.  However, with the addition of these new Reapers there was something more to get excited about.. only problem is they are introduced very slowly into the picture... just enough to tease the audience..<br/><br/>Also the director has some great looking shots that are very eerie..  there is alot of suspense.. but not much dialogue but after all it is a comic book like script.  The action is first rate involving some great fight scenes that are 1 half Matrix like, 1 half standard bone crunching, and 1 half WWF!! (I think the director has this thing about wrestling moves)...  In the end it comes out very unique as the Reapers are no EASY kill..<br/><br/>My biggest beef though was that the film wasn't scary..  unlike the first one.  Maybe they needed more women stalking guys and then ready to do the ole praying mantis thing (in the first film that just gave me the chills), here however, the film comes across as re-make of Aliens II with the Reapers (LOTS OF THEM) and the rag tag 'Bloodpack' is a knock off of the alien marine fighters but without any of the charisma, depth or likeableness. Picture Aliens II with the spaceship co-ridors and aliens replaced with improved vampires and sewer tunnels but without the chilling edge of your seat terror.<br/><br/>That being said the film is what it is, a simple action film, with some good fight scenes, neat villain(s), and some good shots.  I just wish they could have made some of the supporting cast have more lines, and more insight into their characters.... some of them were kind of bland and they could have done WAY more with the script. But overall it was a good film.<br/><br/>Rating 7 out of 10"

","There are two types of sequels it seems: ones that, to put it lightly, aren't all that good and ones that surpass the original (like Terminator II and the Empire Strikes Back). Thankfully, Blade 2 happens to fall in the second category. This is, quite frankly, the best comic book movie I have ever seen mainly because the people who made it knew exactly what they were making. It is true that the plot is not all that much but it is full of enough twists and turns and blood (gallons and gallons of it) and guts to keep us interested. Anyways, compared to the crap we've been getting lately, crap that's even gone as far as to win Oscars (Gladiator anybody?), this is Shakespeare. I mean, I even found one of the last scenes rather genuinely beautiful and tragic (I'm not kidding, please don't throw tomatoes at me 'cause I'm over-sentimental). But anyways, for people who want to see a really gory, action packed movie that's actually good well you really can't go wrong with Blade 2. In fact I think it is the only gory, action packed movie that's actually good I've seen in quite a while."

Blade II picks up pretty much right after the first film's last point and introduces a new and creepy vampire foes to the mix.  Blade II keeps the action going full blast and the introduction of the Blood Pack adds a new level of character development to the story and a new element for Blade's character to contend with. The story is not the best and some of the plot twists are little contrived by this is not Shakespeare either just a film comic book translation to film. The special make-up FX are wonderful adding a sinster edge to the Reapers that clearly outclasses anything in the first film.  The CGI effects are not nearly as overdone as the first film either which is nice.  Del Toro's direction is solid for the film that he is making here.  Blade II is a much more darker and fun film with a gruesome punch that should please both the horror and action film crowds.  A Definate must see for the year."

Wesley Snipes is bad-ass personified, Kris Kristopherson is excellent, Leonor Valera is so hot! And Ron Perlman is scary yet funny.

","Contains Spoilers First of all, not to insult some people's intelligence, but after reading about half of the reviews for BLADE 2, it was more than a little obvious that a lot of you haven't the slightest idea who the hell Guillermo del Toro is. So let me preface this review with a bit of videostore-geek advice: if you did NOT see the first BLADE, rent that. If you have not seen or heard of CRONOS or MIMIC (the first one), hunt those down and rent them, too, if possible. If any of the aforementioned films is not your cuppa blood, go see THE SWEETEST THING, LIFE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT or ICE AGE. Stay as far away from BLADE 2 as your local multraplex will allow.<br/><br/>Now, that THAT'S out of the way, how was the movie? As sequels go, I've definitely seen better. As sequels directed by Guillermo del Toro rate, it was nothing less than AMAZING. As with most Marvel/DC-oriented superhero film franchises these days, you always have to begin with the story of the hero's origins, and Stephen Norrington did a more-than-capable job of providing us with that in the first BLADE.  Not a whole lot of character development, (but then what were you expecting, people? For God's sake, it's based on a COMIC BOOK!!)  but Blade's origins, his mission and his relationship with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), were firmly established.<br/><br/>With the preliminaries out of the way, it was time for a director to step in, who leaves his mark on a film in a way that few others can, and del Toro definitely ranks among the top twenty in this category. If you have seen any of his other work, you already know that whether the script is a sensation or a stink bomb, he still interprets it in his own unique way. To wit: you don't go to a movie by David Lynch or Oliver Stone expecting to see HEIDI: THE MUSICAL; you won't get that here, either.<br/><br/>With a penchant for painting pictures more with darkness than light, a fondness for the supernatural and all the oozy, slimy, slitheriness that goes with it, and an obsession with unearthing the ultraviolent subtext so obviously begging for further exploration in its predecessor, del Toro's BLADE 2 takes the audience and David S. Goyer's script, and shakes them both like a pit bull whose Kibble was recently laced with PCP.<br/><br/>Now that he's had a chance to get comfortable with the character, Wesley Snipes now walks and talks Blade as if he created the Daywalker himself, and much like Sean Connery as 007, you'll never be able to picture anyone else making the feeble attempt to essay the role in his place after this. Those looking for stunning dialogue and deeply constructed plot points had better look elsewhere; the plot here is all about providing every opportunity for Blade to kick undead ass, and he does so with a gusto I wish half the other working actors in Hollywood would bring to their roles in ""A""-list pictures.<br/><br/>The story is thankfully very simple, and it wisely tackles the question on everyone's mind from the opening frames: if Whistler died in the first installment, what is he doing back in the sequel? After failing to take his own life and being captured by Blade's enemies, the Daywalker has been following his trail for a few years, bent on destroying those who kidnapped Whistler, and determined to bring an end to his mentor's suffering.<br/><br/>He finally tracks Whistler to Prague (good for the mythic locale and also the producers, since it's much cheaper to shoot there), where instead of outright killing the old vampire hunter, he helps cure him of his condition, assisted more or less by a new punky sidekick named Scud, (Norman Reedus, who channels David Arquette at his least quirky/annoying).<br/><br/>No sooner does the reunion take place, than an elite vampire squad finds the new hideout. Strangely enough, though, they're not here to eradicate Blade and company; they want to strike a bargain. It seems a new, mutant strain of bloodsuckers has somehow evolved, and their primary goal is to drain, infect or destroy all life on the planet, both vampire and human. The ""pure-bred"" vamps want to enlist Blade's help to stop the scourge, and there you have it.<br/><br/>Del Toro, who has a fondness for the themes of vampirism and the more unhealthy symbiotic aspects of man's dependence upon his technology and vice-versa, could not have been able to resist the opportunities this script must have presented, and he doesn't miss a trick here. Though the fight scenes could be categorized as ""fantasy violence,"" he presents the set-pieces here with all the finesse and style of an EVIL DEAD remake with Jet Li as the star, scored with the sound of depth charges going off. The choreography is as sharp-edged as anything you've seen in THE MATRIX or CROUCHING TIGER, and the gore as prevalent and pustulent as a book of H.R. Giger's unused ideas for ALIEN or SPECIES.  The makeup and visuals departments get to have a field day, especially with some biological traits displayed by the mutant vampires, that will have you wishing you'd skipped dinner before the movie.<br/><br/>One of the most outstanding special effects on display, however, isn't even a prop or a visual. Del Toro and other directors of his caliber, (like Jean-Pierre Jeunet) all share a fondness for using one incredible actor: Ron Perlman. The former BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-star has one of the most recognizable anti-leading man mugs in cinematic history; he makes Kristofferson look like the next GQ cover by comparison. And Perlman is nearly peerless in his fearless dedication to a full exploration of how the most unsavory of characters is motivated, (with strong runners-up being the likes of Nicholson, Walken, Hopper and Woods).<br/><br/>Which is how he nearly walks away with the movie as Reinhardt, the leader of the elite ""Bloodpack"" charged to help Blade hunt down the mutant vamps' leader (as opposed to their original mission, which was to hunt down and kill Blade.) A vampire with a fascist outlook and bloodsucker-supremacist leanings? What a truly sick, original idea. And what a magnificent opportunity for an actor of Perlman's gifts to pull it off. Only someone with Snipes daunting ability for manifesting his physical presence on-screen, could even hope not to be overshadowed, and their physical and verbal sparring matches make you wish that del Toro had made room for more such moments throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Thomas Kretschmann and Luke Goss are impressive as the main antagonists of the piece, and Leonor Varela as the comely non-mutant vamp Nyssa kicks butt with the best of the guys, but is given little to do otherwise, especially in a painfully underdeveloped romantic subplot involving Blade, which rings really false later in the finale, shot as beautifully as a Calvin Klein commercial directed by Anne Rice, and carrying about as much emotional weight.<br/><br/>If an all-out mega-assault on your senses is what you're looking for, BLADE is more than happy to oblige. But unlike similarly CGI-rich gorefests like RESIDENT EVIL, this one has one badass Daywalker to keep it (and the audience) riveted and reasonably centered amidst the chaotic designer mayhem.<br/><br/>And besides, where else can you hear an actor tackle a line like ""You want us to spray ourselves with some suckpuppy's nut-juice?"" with a totally straight face, and make it believable, even as you chortle at the purple outlandishness of the dialogue?"

","The sequel to the hit movie Blade, which was about the half-vampire, half-human, and vampire hunter, was expected to be far greater than the first. This is true, and I have the proof. This movie picks up directly 4 years after the first film. It gives you an idea of what the story is about. Has the opening titles then goes straight into the action. You can already tell that this movie is going to be better than the first. I liked this movie because of the special effects. They have improved from the first movie. But in some scenes you can tell that it isn't real. I noticed that all the technology, buildings and structures are very complex and futuristic. The buildings are all silver and shiny. Blade has very advanced weapons to eradicate the vampires off the face of the earth.<br/><br/>Because you don't know if vampires exist or not, this is a very realistic situation. The make-up for the monsters makes them look freaky and terrifying I don't like this movie because of Blade's sidekick, Whistler, comes back and it doesn't fully explain how.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to a Blade 3, if there is going to be one<br/><br/>I rate this movie 8.5 out of 10"

","Energetic, fast-paced sequel has Blade and his trusted mentor Whistler forming an uneasy alliance with their sworn enemies the vampires.

Despite his instinctive dislike and distrust of the vampires, Blade gradually begins to develop an admirable affection for one vampire in particular, which only exacerbates the troublesome mission. Fans of the original should have fun as the film boasts intense, non-stop action scenes, impressive visuals, and silly one-liners, but without a good, sound story or significant character development it eventually runs out of steam. **½"

","Usually I like watching movies with a good story and characters, but once in a while there are times where you say, ""To heck with that, turn off the brain, and lets see some crap being blown up"".  Make no mistake, Blade 2 is one of those movies.  If you take it for what it is (an action/martial arts/horror film) you won't be disappointed.  I can't imagine anyone wanting to watch this movie expecting anything else different, because if you are, this movie would not be worth your time.<br/><br/>Hollywood has been quick to mass produce action movies, but even though a lot of them have high production values, few are really good (Con Air anyone?)  I've seen a lot of action movies, and thankfully, Blade 2 is probably one of the better ones I've seen since The Matrix.  I would even say it's better than the Matrix.  Both had a combination of action and martial arts(okay, some might laugh at the fighting in the Matrix) with the only difference was that the Matrix was set in a ""cyber"" setting and Blade 2 has blood sucking vampires as the backdrop.<br/><br/>The martial arts is probably the best I've seen in any Hollywood movie. There is never a dull moment in the movie, and the action is fast and furious.  Like every comic book hero, Blade has his trusty Ginsu sword and ""boomerang"" from the first movie, along with some special neat ""UV"" grenades which made for a nice bang.  The gore, surprisingly, was more than I was expecting.  Vampires and victims alike will be devoured, dismembered, sliced, blown up, shot, and impaled in the most creative ways that will make you want to say ""ouch"".  The gore in this film practically makes the chestburster in Aliens seem like Micky Mouse.  The autopsy of one of the Reapers will make you think twice about eating liver again.<br/><br/>While it lacked in what little story and character development the first movie had was more than made up by the action and fighting scenes.  There is even a little, unoriginal ""twist"" if you can call it that near the end. There are some funny moments in the film, especially with Kris Kristofferson who reprises his role as the Hillbilly vampire slaying sob.<br/><br/>The only turnoffs might be the excessive language in the film and maybe the rap music, if those 2 things aren't your cup of tea.  While not approaching Tarantino proportions of cussing, you'll probably lose count how many times the f-word is repeated.  The rap music gets too annoying.  On the other hand, the movie would seem kind of a lacking in some way if the cussing and rapping wasn't in there.  In a way, they kind of lend to the atmosphere and grittiness of the movie.<br/><br/>I've never read the comic book before, but Blade 2 definitely kicks Batman's ass in so many ways and is probably the best comic book movie adaption (well, so far) that i've seen.  If you are in the mood for kick ass marital arts, kinetic action, and aren't offended by gross out scenes or cussing, this movie is highly recommended to be seen on the big screen<br/><br/>Action: 8.5/10 Martial Arts: 8.5/10 Gross Outness: 8/5/10 Swearing: 7.5/10<br/><br/>Overall:  8/10"

Blade's finesse and charm are far from lost or replaced by cheesy and corny lines with this action-packed sequel.

","Spoiler warning.  Could a film be more stripped-down, more efficient, more mind-blowing, more recklessly disregarding of such niceties as plot, character and sense than ""Blade II""?  Probably. But even so, it's fair to say that in terms of production design, editing, special effects and cinematography, this is the most awe-inspiring film you are likely to see for quite some time.  Unfortunately, in terms of script, dialogue and character development, this is on a par with ""The Fast and the Furious"".  But don't let that put you off, for ""Blade II"" is truly rip-roaring entertainment - a non-stop rollercoaster of insane violence and comic-strip action, held together by two things: Snipes' incredible anti-acting (he just stands there, shooting, or looking mean, or putting on/taking off his sunglasses, and it works) and Guillermo Del Toro's direction.  This is by no means Del Toro's finest work, but at least he has the right attitude to this kind of ludicrous entertainment: pull out all the stops, fling everything at the screen, keep the camera moving, dazzle the audience with incredible special effects, and chuck in a few jokes. The evil vampire bastards that Snipes is after in this movie are the most disturbing things I've seen on screen since ""Existenz"".  The first time you see one of their mouths in all its glory will be a moment you won't forget in a hurry. The action sequences are complicated and ludicrous but edited so expertly that you never lose track of who's whacking whom at any given moment.  The ""House of Pain"" sequence in itself should be used as a textbook example of action film-making at its very best. However, ""Blade II"" fails in its attempts to be anything more than a high-octane, double-barrelled fight-fest.  There is little or no sensible interaction between any of the characters.  Early in the film ""Whistler"" slams his gun into the young guy's mouth, surely causing him some serious pain, but this seems to be of no consequence whatsoever in the film's ""plot"".  The twists at the end are perfunctory and of no real interest. There is no emotional bond between Blade and the woman, or between her and her father, or between him and his son.  The son, by the way, is played by the Bloke out of Bros.  Just one of the many incredible things about this film. The finale sees Blade embracing the woman in the lethal sunlight, trying to keep hold of her as she slowly shatters and crumbles in his arms.  It should be affecting, but beyond marvelling at the great computer graphics, it is completely devoid of any emotion whatsoever. Which is a shame, as we know Del Toro's work can be both genuinely thrilling and emotionally involving (see ""The Devil's Backbone"" for proof).<br/><br/>It's probably unrealistic to expect much from a movie like this, but considering the talent involved, it's a shame that we get a satisfyingly visceral assault on the senses, but nothing more."

","I loved the first Blade, and was excited to see Blade 2 when I heard they were going to make it (after I saw the first one years ago).<br/><br/>
Blade 2 delivers, but on my way out of the cinema I could not rid my mind of emptiness. Maybe it's just the type of mood I was in. Don't get me wrong, I am a big action fan. But, lets stop for a moment and see where it's going. Much like Resident Evil (which is also out at the time of this review) The action and effects deliver, but it just feels empty. Perhaps I could have missed this void if I had watched Blade 1 a few days, maybe even hours before the viewing of the second film. So everything and the characters would be fresh in my mind. Guess I won't know now. I do know one thing however... Blade 2 still kicked some serious butt. Those looking for a good time will not be let down. Just don't expect much, plot/character development.<br/><br/>I think Ill give it and 8 out of 10."

","As a rule, I don't belive movies should sacrifice plot for action...but Blade II is so full of flawless action scenes that I'm shocked to find that I don't care about the plot's flimsiness and inconsistencies.  From the first scene, with its blindingly fast pace and pulse-pounding music, I welcomed ANY excuse for Snipes to kick ass.  And he doesn't disappoint: this movie has more and better fight scenes than the original film!  There is one swordfight scene that is so fast and so impressive, I have seen nothing like it before, not in Blade I, not in Crouching Tiger, not in any of the Star Wars movies.  It will take your breath away.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie The One should have been.  I salute Wesley Snipes--he has outdone himself with this one, and that's saying a lot."

","With the addition of a small clip at the end of Blade I, Blade II was already on the cards. Thankfully, Wesley Snipes has been retained as the eponymous daywalker bloke along with Kris Kristofferson, but much around them has changed, including the setting. Now set in Eastern Europe somewhere, the vampires are meaner, the streets are darker and hopefully the action will be better. For the record, Blade I was an excellent film, and in the return, Blade has gone to Eastern Europe with his trusty Whistler in search of newer, more ghoulish vampires - the ante has been upped significantly - but some of the features from Blade I have been kept. We still see glimpses of the seedy vampire underworld suffused with lots of leather and shiny things, which worked wonderfully in Blade I, but here it's overdone. Particularly in the early scenes (which are as confusing as hell), it's almost nauseatingly post-Matrix and post-modern, with the frames being `CGI-ed' to death. Superficially it's very flashy, almost conventionally experimental, with great emphasis on close-ups, movement and darkness as a major player. But it fails to capture any kind of cheap thrill or enjoyment. Part of the blame has to lie with highly rated director Guillermo del Toro. While Stephen Norrington's Blade I was simple yet eerily dark, and stylish in a controlled sort of way, del Toro's attempts to create a supercharged atmosphere fail miserably. Everything about this film is tastelessly lathered on, and the dark tones that are so enthusiastically employed in the film are never really given a chance to develop. A clear example of this film's immaturity is in the kind of vampires seen. Here they are gaunt, emaciated figures who hiss and snarl like the Orcs in 'Lord Of The Rings', and while their appearance and the Gothic setting seems to be a winning combination, a high-speed battle between Nosferatu-style goons just can't hold our attention. The only saving grace of this film comes when the action slows down a bit and Wes is allowed to let his character come out, but such instances are frustratingly brief. Instead, he merely handles some weak subplots (dealing with Blade's, em, emotional issues) while the main plot is played out by the supporting cast. However, the script manages to hold itself together just when it threatens to fall apart, probably because of 2 excellent performances from Snipes & Kristofferson, who keep us half-interested even though they have been reduced to smirking presences in the background. Two stars."

The look of those things was disgusting, and if it could disgust me, then it's a keeper.  Even until the very end of the movie, the appearance of those things was...odd, to say the least.  I never really got used to seeing them.<br/><br/>So basically, a new vampire race had emerged, one that fed on both vampires and humans, one they termed as Reaper.

The Blade character has no development or depth; the fight sequences are repetitious and boring, and the CGI special effects are very ropey indeed.<br/><br/>Any positive aspects to the film? The Whistler character seems to me to be the more interesting... I think I'll just stick to the first film."
"dzk70","7","0","1","24 March 2002"," Simple, yet full of fun and blood
","I have to say that I got what I expected from ""Blade 2"", a fast and fun horror/action flick. To begin with the downside I wish there could have been more of a relationship development with Blade and Whistler. The partial love story was alright but the torment of not belonging to either world wasn't stressed enough in Blade's character. I felt the love story of this movie could have touched a little more on this. Now, to cast doubt on my last comments, Blade does seem to be a character who shows his pain and loneliness on his face, but it is hard to see that pain when he is wearing sunglasses through out half the movie. I also wish that directors who feel ""martial arts"" is the cool thing in action flicks now a days, would stop allowing every single character know martial arts to make the movie look cool. Blade was fighting the head of the ""Reapers"" (new vampires) and he (Reaper leader) seemed to know the same fighting style as Blade. I have a theory for this to argue my last statement but it would ruin the flick for those who haven't seen it. <br/><br/>Now for the good stuff, the ""Blade hunter"" vampires were very cool, full of attitude and arrogance. The names the writer thought of for these characters were very cool, almost comic book-like (image that). One character is massive and carries a huge hammer and his name is ""Lighthammer"" I like that name. The choreography of the action scenes had some cg bumps but in the end I really enjoyed them because in the end this is a movie to fully entertain you and not make you think about social issues. Blade was great as usual, he seemed to be faster and stronger than in the first one. They bring back Whistler, who I thought died in the first one, so I was skeptical when I read and saw he was in the sequel but there was a good explanation for it. Finally the Reapers. These vampires look great!!!! They look like zombies (and I love Zombies!!!!)The sounds that were edited for them were superb and there superior strength and movements were awesome!!!The way they look matched with the dark and gritty cinematography enhanced their characters. All in all a good flick for a bunch of friends to see, for a you action buffs, give it a try you might like it. Sorry, the sets for one of the ""Ancient Vampires"" was alright, I don't know if I like old Victorian style (Gothic statues, paintings, etc) in a modern day setting, but just an opinion. Anyway, worth seeing!!"

","There is a valuable lesson that Hollywood rarely learns: bigger does not mean better.  Again and again we are subjected to second rate sequels that just copy the good segments from the original, add more main characters and baddies that no one really cares about and then the makers sit back as the general public pour in to see a cash in on a great film.  I know this because I am one of the public that loved the original so much and despite knowing Hollywood's reputation on sequels, I paid my hard earned money over and hoped for the best.  What a pillock I am sometimes.<br/><br/>Yes, you can clearly tell that I did not like Blade 2.  To put it plainly, the acting is sub standard, the script is dire, it's not dark enough by far, the music is not as good and tragically, Blade 2 mainly falls victim of the points I described earlier.  It reminds me of other guilty sequels such as The Crow: City Of Angels,  Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, sequels that take the rules laid down by their predecessors, breaks them and then conveniently makes feeble excuses.  I am so tired of Hollywood doing this.<br/><br/>There is very little for me to recommend about Blade 2.  It is certainly quite stylish in places (but not a patch on Blade) and the effects are gruesomely brought to life.  There are a couple of excellent fight scenes as expected but not enough fights with the emphasis on Blade.  In fact, he almost takes a back seat in most of the film.  It is very interesting to see former Bros man, Luke Goss in a horror film and he does provide one of the few good performances in the film.<br/><br/>What else can I say?  This is simply terrible fodder that from the very beginning, made me feel like it was a dumbed down sequel, preparing the waters for a few direct to video sequels and a tv series.<br/><br/>3/10.  Shameful."

"greengeek_85","9","0","1","6 April 2002"," Surprisingly Exhilarating
","What can I say about this movie, other than...stunned silence.  I loved the first Blade movie, the cast, the effects, and the way the characters was brought to life.  Luke Gross was my favorite suprise.  From the trailers I believed that the lead villain in this would be more of a monster physically with no psychological twists.(Stephen 'Dwarf' made up for dimminutiveness in performance) The character of Nomak starts as an unlabeled creature and at times becomes the one you find yourself cheering for.  His character is special effects laden but is performance is great fun to watch, and he seems to really enjoy being bad and exacting his revenge.  I liked the bloodpack but something was a bit neo-stereotypical about the mouthy skinhead leader (played devilishly by Ron Pearlman, this guy owns the screen when he's present.)and the clan of hardly spoken warriors, they reinvent the stereotype that we have all seen.  The individual look for each member was very defining and added a zest to the screen, especially the character of Lighthammer, who's face is highly detailed with hentai-style tattoos.($5 he has or will be a Vin Diesel stunt double) Now lets move on the the reason this movie isn't called the adventures of Whistler & Scud...Wesley Snipes.  I gaurantee he had fun making this because it oozes out of his performance.  His one-liners are heard more often and spoken with more enthusiasm, and his action sequences are jacked up through the roof.  One thing I liked is he smiled a lot more.  Not in a cheesy way, but he is an emotionally damaged character with eyes that could burn through you like UV, when he's not wearing his glasses, but when he smiles or riffs on somebody his exhuberance is very humanizing and brings this tragedy-ridden superhero down to earth for a moment. I thought the movie was excellent, it had humor, eye candy, and suprisingly a plot that came together nicely in the end.  I will not compare it to the original because they are both a hell of a ride, Blade's continuing quest stays entertaining throughout both movies, so I say watch 'em both, don't compare them to each other, just enjoy, cause that's why they were made."

","I went to this movie with great expectancy since the first one was IMHO absolutely fantastic. But at first I got pretty disappointed. The movie starts of with a really bad story and some totally exaggerated martial acts scenes. In fact the scenes have been computer supported to much all over the movie. But you get uses to that. And after the first 20 minutes the real plot is about to begin. This is the point where the movie turns to good. Del Torro managed to put the scenes in perfect light and color. Wesley Snipes is again a cool vampire hunter, but he also shows feelings this time.<br/><br/>Overall this movie has much more visual effects than the old one. In my opinion it's too much. Other things that made me scoring only 8 of 10 are the martial act scenes and the weak plot.

When I went into the theater, I was expecting the same ultraviolent fare as the original Blade.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect is an element of horror added into the mix. It was an excellent idea to have vampires, the always cool villains of the silver screen, as prey to the disgusting brood of reapers (or reavers as I heard it) created by Nomak.<br/><br/>Blade, even more kick-ass and near invincible than ever, is out to recover and tie up some loose ends, namely Whistler. This is just the beginning of the whole set-up involving the Bloodpack, Nomak and his reapers.<br/><br/>Blade unwillingly teams up with the Bloodpack, a team of vamps that have trained ever since the events of ""Blade"" to kill the Daywalker. Now their concern is not Blade, but Nomak, a new strain of vampire who is a threat to vampire and human-kind alike.<br/><br/>The bloodpack is an interesting, made-to-be-action-figures group: among them is Nyssa is the vampire princess; Asad, a clean cut British accented black guy; Light Hammer, a big, silent stong man; Verlaine, Light hammer's lady; Chupa, a foul mouthed Vamp, and snowman, a samurai-weilding japanese vamp (The incredible Donnie yen, who needed more screen time in my opinion).<br/><br/>But the real focus is on the reapers, who add some creepiness to the picture. they climb and stick on walls like spider man and stalk their prey like a pack of those Aliens Sigourney Weaver fought.<br/><br/>There is a lot more running, biting and shooting than fighting in this movie, but when Blade goes at it, the action is as violent as you can imagine.<br/><br/>The main difference between parts I and II is that Blade and his adversaries are enhanced by CGI so that some unimaginable superhuman moves can be performed.<br/><br/>For example, when the BloodPack intrudes onto Blade's hideout, his fight with one of the 'pack is done noticably by puppets.<br/><br/>Also, the illusion of distance is enhanced by CGI as well, making bone breaking moves seem even more harmul.<br/><br/>There is a twist in Blade II's plot, which I did welcome.<br/><br/>Guilermo Del Toro has put together a fine movie, denying anyone who says ""sequels suck"" to say that Blade II is not on the same level of Blade."

The sequel is better looking and better directed (it is, however, the least involving of Guillermo del Toro's directorial works--everyone looking for a more interesting take on vampirism by him should check out Chronos), and the idea behind the story is interesting enough, but very little plot shows up on screen.

I loved the look of it.  Blade fans will either like or absolutely LOVE this movies. And yes, i think this movie is better than the original Blade.  If there was one thing negative i have to say about it, it's that i missed Deacon Frost. The main character in this movie was cool but not as cool as Frost.  BTW the last Fight scene is incredible. The final scene is hilarious.  This film DESERVES to make a heck of alot more money than Blade did.  I will definitely see this movie again.

","Wesley Snipes is back in the role of the title character, in this offering that leans decidedly more toward the Wes Craven horror/action side of the genre than to Anne Rice gothic, and be advised that there is enough blood-letting and gore on hand to appease even the most insatiable viewer, in `Blade II,' directed by Guillermo del Toro.  <br/><br/>	Half human, half vampire, Blade has all of the powers of the vampire, but none of the weaknesses; he is called `Daywalker' by his sworn enemies, the vampires he has vowed to destroy, because of his ability to move about unimpaired in the light of day.  And, knowing his mission, the vampires have formed and trained a special unit, the `Bloodpack,' whose sole purpose is to hunt Blade down and eliminate him, before he can get to them. <br/><br/>
	But the story begins with an unusual twist:  Instead of hunting Blade down to kill him, the vampire `Shadow Council' reaches out to him with the offer of an alliance; in fact, they want him to lead the Bloodpack against a new enemy, one who threatens to wipe out the living and the undead alike, if allowed to proliferate.  They are mutant vampires known as `Reapers,' a new breed with a thirst for blood that is unquenchable.  Initially, Blade demurs, until the vampires provide him with proof of what the Reapers can do.  <br/><br/>	Before he will begin, however, Blade first secures the aid of an ally and weapons expert named Scud (Norman Reedus), then insists on tracking down his old friend Whistler (Kris Kristoffererson), whom he has not seen for some time, and fears has been `turned' by the vampires.  And when that is accomplished, and once the entire team is in place, Blade and the Bloodpack begin their nocturnal hunt for the Reapers.<br/><br/>	Del Toro has crafted and delivered a movie that is pure action and entertainment, geared to those whose appetites run especially toward the blunt, hard-edged and graphic.  And once it begins, the blood flows freely (including a vat of the stuff); rest assured, all who enter here will have their thirsts quenched.  Del Toro presents the story itself in a fairly straightforward manner, offers a couple of twists and has enough threads going to successfully hold it all together within the framework of the action.  Most importantly, he provides the kind of thrills that get the blood pumping and the adrenaline flowing, and the F/X are first rate (get ready for a rush when one of the Reapers opens his mouth and zeros in on the throat of a victim).<br/><br/>	For a film like this to work, it is dependent on the ability of the audience to suspend disbelief and be able to immerse themselves in the story, and to do that, the protagonist must at least be a credible character.  And that's what Wesley Snipes gives you as Blade.  He's got the moves and the look, and he makes it convincing to a degree that enables you to go with the flow without having to think too much about the whys and the wherefores of it all.  This is pure escapist fare, and Snipes provides exactly the kind of character it needs to be successful. <br/><br/>
	The supporting cast includes Ron Perlman (Rienhardt), Luke Goss (Nomak), Leonor Varela (Nyssa), Matt Schulze (Chupa), Danny John-Jules (Asad), Donnie Yen (Snowman), Daz Crawford (Lighthammer), Rey-Phillip Santos (Red Eye/Reaper), Thomas Kretschmann (Pox) Tony Curran (Priest), Pete Lee-Wilson (Blood Bank Doctor) and Marit Velle Kile (Verlaine).  In the end, what you see is what you get, and what you get is very likely to be exactly what you expected from `Blade II,' which is plenty of blood-drenched action wrapped around a story soaked with intrigue, betrayal and things that go bump (in a BIG way) in that long, eternal night of the undead.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10."
"Blackace","8","0","1","5 April 2002"," Ohh My!! Blade 2 Is One Bloody Good Sequel.
","I'm not going to write a long review for Blade 2. I just want to say..""SEE IT!!"" This sequel is much better then the original, with more fight scenes, more gore, way more vampires and a lot of cool surprises. I was very impressed. Wesley Snipes did a great job reprising his role as the DayWalker. In a recent interview he said he would be happy to do a Blade 3 if the story was decent and other comic book characters we're introduced. So there's a good chance for a sequel. The plot for Blade 2 is about a new breed of vampire that doesn't have any weaknesses. Trying to use silver bullets, garlic, holy water, or crosses just don't work. The only thing that can kill them is sunlight and a stake through the heart (I guess they DO have a couple weaknesses). They are twice as strong and agile as the normal vampire. They also have a heartier (no pun intended) appetite for blood. The Daywalker is teamed up with the BloodPack (group of Vampires that we're trained to terminate the DayWalker) to stop the new breed known as Reapers. The plot isn't anything special, but it keeps the movie moving in the right direction and provides plenty of action along the way. My only disappointment was with some of the cheesy special effects use during the fight scenes. One fight between Blade & Nyssa was partly done in CGI and looked pretty bad. Why wasn't wire-style fighting used instead? More could have been with the plot as well, but what's here isn't terrible.<br/><br/>Overall it's a must see movie. If you watched the first Blade and enjoyed it, Blade 2 should be on your list of things to do."

Of course, the plot is very weak, but I was expecting that, plus the action is so unrelenting, you don't really have time to think about it.  I saw this movie in a cinema with newly installed Dolby Digital sound, and it put it to good use, the bone-snapping, skull-crunching, gut-ripping and decapitations all had a sickeningly loud noise which completely immerse you into the action on screen.  Just when I thought that comic book adaptations were all doomed to be terrible, this one (although I don't know how faithful it is to the original comic) breaks the mould to be a thoroughly enjoyable piece of absolute nonsense."

"Time Tripper","7","0","1","3 April 2002"," Action packed good time.
","Blade II is an excellent film if you are only seeing it for its action sequences.  There are many, they are big, and they are loud.  Wesley Snipes is again great as Blade, who seems a little more human this time out.  He seems more vulnerable this time around thanks in part to Blade's student/mentor relationship with Kris Kristopherson's Whistler. <br/><br/>
Blade also has a new partner, ""Scud"", who provides comic relief and helps move the plot along when it needs it.  Blade is also teamed with a team of vampire commandos.  The commandos were awesome for the screentime they were given, and I really wish that they'd been developed more.  Ron Pearlman really stands out as the vampire with the biggest grudge against Blade. Snipes and Pearlman play well against each other in this movie.<br/><br/>One drag on the movie, unfortunately, is Leonor Varela, playing the beautiful daughter of the vampires' supreme leader (one can assume he took over after the vampire council was destroyed in the first film).  She and Blade become a little too attached to each other a little too quickly. Varela's acting ability doesn't add anything to the part.  She only sounds believable when delivering the all-important exposition that furthers the plot.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the plot isn't particularly clever beyond its premise.  Beyond the idea that Blade would have to team up with vampires to kill even more merciless super-vampires, the movie pretty much writes itself.  None of the double crosses that litter the film come as a surprise, and you might find yourself wondering how Blade got himself into several of the dumb situations he finds himself in.<br/><br/>Beyond those flaws, however, you are still left with an incredible non-stop action extravaganza.  Blades deadly skills have seemed to increased since his previous film, as have his arsenal of anti-vampire gadgets.  The props and design departments for Blade II certainly did an amazing job.  Also, thanks to computer effects, Blade moves faster and is more agile than ever before.<br/><br/>Blade II is a very well done action film.  Although it does have a few flaws, those flaws DO NOT take away from the non-stop, fast-paced action of this movie.  Not as good as the Matrix, but one hell of a good time."

This sequel was even better than the first, making it the sequel that Batman Returns failed to be, and the sequel X2 can only HOPE to be.

Right now, Wesley Snipes is sitting atop the mountain of comic-films. The battle may wage on soon, however, when Tobey Maguire web-slings his way to square off against the vampire slayer."

The characters are more put together and animated. Ron Pearlman,(Cronos, Quest For Fire, City of Lost Children) puts out a great performance, three dimensional. Wesley Snipes,( Blade.

The only thing I saw that might be copied from another movie was the hinged jaw of the mutants, and I saw that in a movie called Predator, and It was not a carbon copy, but enough to remind. Christopherson was not too bad, at least he had more scenes than he did in Blade.

","Most of the films that come out each year belong to certain genre, whether drama, horror, action, etc. But once in a while, there are films that not only belong to a genre but redefine it, films that change your vision to this certain genre. The kind of films that make you think ""Just when we thought we had seen it all...this comes out"". And this year that film has a name... Blade II.<br/><br/>Since it is a sequel, it is obvious if not logical to compare it to its predecessor, but no matter how much you might like the first one, or how much you hate sequels, this is far superior than the other one. The mood is incredible, the action top notch, the music adequate, the visuals stunning. And what I love the most, scenes in which I went ""How the heck did they do that?!!!!"". By the end of the film I had to wait for the lights to come to find my jaw because I dropped it sometime during the movie.<br/><br/>
Of course it has its flaws, but the film is so hyperactive that you don't have time to think about then while the movie is on. I mean, why is it that the bad guys are so dumb and many and the good guys agile and few? huh? But then again... This is part of a folklore you have to follow like the slowiness of the zombies or the shredded pants on werewolves, right? So it is not a problem here either. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD and see it over and over again during my insomnia nights at 3:00 am.<br/><br/>I read Wesley Snipes suffered a lot during the shooting, I guess you have to pay with your own blood for something to be alright. And what can I say about Guillermo del Toro that hasn't been said before without sounding like a ridiculous butt kisser or a pretentious liar. Just this ""Good job"". Ohh, and this is for all those stupid so called ""action"" directors that have let us down lately with lame excuses of film like rollerball or collateral damage...SHUT UP, LISTEN, SEE THIS AND LEARN.

","If nothing else, it is easy to say Blade II surpasses its predecessor in every way.  Guillermo del Toro is a director of unique vision, one who obviously put pride into this work, instead of treating it like a paycheck job.  Sure, there's bad CG here and there, and Donnie Yen was a waste (though he did choreograph the fights too), but what you have here is a solid chunk of entertainment, with well-planned (and more importantly, WELL-EDITED!) fights abounding, no great lulls in the action, and a satisfying ending.  It's amazing they were able to write Whistler back in without it being too ridiculous, and then not wasting his return!  Ron Perlman walks all over his scenes, I really hope del Toro can convince the studio to let him be Hellboy instead of Vin Diesel.

"slimjack","9","0","1","29 March 2002"," Delivers fast and gory atmospheric action.
","I don't know what's gotten into vampires lately.  They use to be such a genteel and refined bunch.  Well dressed. Intelligent conversationalists. All in all, a satanic monster you could bring home to Mom.  Nowadays, vampires dress like bikers, swear like dock workers and take a chunk out of your neck without so much as a by-your-leave. Dracula would be rolling in his grave if it weren't for the stake.  As the vampires get rougher, so do the vampire hunters. The ascetic, professorial Van Helsing type wouldn't last a second in today's undead environment.  We need a shotgun welding, sword fighting, tattooed warrior of the night. Enter Mr. Blade. After the fine Blade I, he returns in the superior  if unimaginably titled  sequel, Blade II. It's crammed with style, action, flamboyant acting and twocount em, two kinds of vampires!  Let me tell you, you get your moneys worth with this movie. There is a new kind of vampire in Budapest called The Reapers. They are so unmitigatedly evil that even Anne Rice would be repulsed.  Normal means of vampiric elimination won't work with them.  They laugh at garlic, gargle holy water and use wooden stakes for toothpicks. Their Achilles heal is that blood is more than sustenance for them; it is a crack-like drug that they must constantly imbibe or die. To defeat this menace, the old guard vampires reluctantly join forces with their scourge Blade. Of course, bloody mayhem ensues.  In fact, there are times when Blade II resembles a baroque anatomy class. Gore this extreme is usually a mistake as it has a tendency to anesthetize the audience.  The director, however, knows what he's doing. Guillermo del Toro shoots the bloody business with all the attention to mood and atmosphere that a Val Lewton or a James Whale would bring to a classic Universal horror movie. Blade II is never too campy or so strait as to be depressing.  The action is fast, furious and genuinely exciting.  There were a few problems here and there, though. Blade and company have obvious computer doppelgangers for some of the more unlikely stunts. Also the fights were interspersed with professional wrestling moves that struck me as clownish. The rest of the audience, however, cheered every flying knee drop that cropped up. The cast is pretty high rent for a movie like this. You'll have as much fun watching the actors do their thing as you will with the action and special effects. Wesley Snipes does Blade perfectly. He plays the part dryer than a martini, yet with just enough swagger that we know he isn't going for a serious character study.  Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is the best cantankerous old coot since Star Trek's Doctor McCoy. Ron Perlman is excellent as Reinhardt, a really hard-case vampire none to pleased to be working with Blade. Luke Goss is completely repulsive as Nomak, the lead Reaper. Great work all around. Blade II is not a movie for the faint of heart. The violence is bloody, extreme and graphic and all that gore is there simply for your morbid pleasure. No social relevance. No comments on the human condition. Blade II is an old-fashioned exploitation flick dressed up with all the wiz-bang bells and whistles of modern movie making. It's grand fun while you are watching but you may hate yourself for enjoying it."

","As director Del Toro himself stated in Total Film magazine 'Don't f*** with the formula!' Hence we get very little that's new in Blade II, save, perhaps, for the new (and impressive) Reaper strain of vampire.<br/><br/>But, if you dug the original, there's plenty more to float yer boat this go around: gallons of O.T.T gore, bone-crunching violence and Snipes's agreeably cool-as-ice, bad-ass superhero, all backed up (natch!) by that incessantly thumping techno muzak.<br/><br/>Del Toro is undoubtedly a greater visual stylist than Norrington, the first part's helmer, and you could argue that there's (slightly) more story, but this is still unashamedly one for the popcorn crowd and over-exciteable young men that still think lots of leather and lots of gunplay is 'Way coooooooool, dude!'

I always see films during the day so it only costs $4.50.  Would I see this at ""prime time""?  Not really, although all the bangs and stereo sound is used superbly (in some scenes, you could hear stuff happening all around you), you can still get a good experience by renting it.

","I have always thought that Blade was an underrated action classic and one of the coolest, most stylish action flicks ever and so the sequel filled me with excitement. I knew it would be bigger, badder and bloodier but my god it surpassed my expectations. Wesley is lightning in this film, even more than in Blade 1. He has more one-liners and opportunities for some humour and he delivers his lines with his usual charismatic class. Del Torro has basically taken the sort of style that Stephan Norrington used in the first film and charged it up to even more super cool levels, the soundtrack is also excellent and the vast array of weaponry on offer puts the first film in the shadows. Del Torros history of directing horro flicks plays well in this film, and also the visuals are suitably dank and lurid. The cinematography in this film is pure excellence. The fight sequences are brilliant. They are extremely well choreographed, frequent and suitably violent and gore filled. Also the new super Vampires known as Reapers really give the film a fresh edge it needed to have after the first film. Not since I saw Brotherhood of the Wolf have I come out of the cinema wanting a repeat viewing so badly. Its pure adrenaline, clapping of the hands, excellence from start to finish. Us Brits are not usually known to show are appreciation for a film too outwardly during its presentation but the whole audience were cheerin, laughing and applauding in ore at the movie. The few minor quibbles would be that despite the excellent special effects there was one scene, when Blade first encounters the bloodpack in a fight, which had a completely computer generated Wesley for a few moves which did not look to realistic but the rest of the effects were first rate and the action in the rest of the film made up for it.

","Blade II is one of those rare films, like The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part II, that surpasses its predecessor in the most wonderful and satisfying ways.<br/><br/>Blade II succeeds thanks to the efforts of Guillermo del Toro, a talented, underappreciated (not much longer, hopefully) director, and the writing skills of David S. Goyer, the writer of the original film.  Blade II has a stronger script and director and this shines through every action-packed, thrilling minute.<br/><br/>The film builds upon the characters and mythos of the original and continues to expand them, weaving an intricate, interesting environment for Blade and his vampiric nemeses.<br/><br/>Wesley Snipes wears the role of Blade as well as that leather jacket and sunglasses.  He is so comfortable at being this truly awe-inspiring superhero...it proves that Blade was the role he was born to play.  Kris Kristofferson returns as Blade's mentor Whistler in a terrific plot-twist led by the explosive opening.  While the supporting players and villains, like Luke Goss as the fearsome Nomak, are all well-cast and perform admirably, Blade II is Snipes' show, and we can all thank God for that!<br/><br/>Blade II leads Marvel Comics and its film properties on a fantastic charge just as its predecessor did.

Blade 2 takes place about a few years after the first one and starts in Eastern Europe.  He finds out there is a mutant strain of vampire, and the Vampire Nation wants Blade to help them dispatch the monsters.  They give him a group of vampires called the Blood Pack and then proceed to destroy vampire after vampire. Okay, so the plot is basic and simple.  But somehow the movie is extremely fun.  This isn't ""Monster's Ball"" or some other art film, but a crowd pleaser with plenty of kicks and even wrestling moves.  Leonor Varela is horrible, in fact, one of the worst actress I've ever seen (Next to Lee Lee Sobeski) but Wesley and Kris make the movie better. Then there is Ron Perlman... who actually does a good job being a bad@#$. My favorite part was the gore.  Being a huge fan of horror the film hit home, and I was impressed with the wonderful CGI.

","Well, damn... Just when I thought 2002 was headed for the turd bowl in the mainstream action-film department, Guillermo Del Toro (director of CRONOS, the DEVIL'S BACKBONE, and THE MIMIC) had to go and bust out an essentially rare item: a sequel that outdoes its predecessor (see Aliens and Evil Dead 2 for further examples).  BLADE 2, which essentially picks off where the first one left off, is a hyper kinetic blast of a flick that doesn't stop to breatheand yesthat's a good thing. The original BLADE, albeit a powerful contribution to the action/horror genre in itself, suffered from extensive space between entertainment and the horrifying acting job delivered by N'Bushe Wright (who doesn't come back for the sequel).  Its action sequences, however, were top notch, and it's this element that Del Toro has capitalized on.  The movie is basically a 2-hour fight session, with guns, spikes, blade-arangs, and kung fu sequences layering every available minute.  And I repeat, folkthis is a good thing. As far as plots go, this one lifts off those old G.I. Joe episodes where The Joes had to team up with Cobra to fight a greater menace (Yeahso I'm a geek).  After a new brand of vampires, the Reapers (think of a vampire crossed with a crack addict), start attacking vamps and humans alike, the Vampire Nation offers Blade a temporary truce in return for the annihilation of said Reapers. He teams up with the Blood Pack, an elite team of vampire warriors (headed by the beautiful Leonor Varela, and featuring Ron Perlman and Donnie Yena kung-fu badass in his own right) and heads out to kill the b*****ds off. Never mind that, thoughthe movie's main concern is kicking some visual tail, and with the exception of a few clumsy CGI-enhanced fight sequences (the characters seem to turn into cartoons for a split second), Del Toro achieves excellence.  With a pleasant blend of humor, horror, and high velocity choreography, BLADE 2 actually deliversa statement that, sadly, cannot be made for the majority of mainstream martial arts-related action flicks that have emerged in recent months (Jet Li's `Kiss of the Dragon', in particular, was a painful disappointment). (MINOR SPOILER ALERT!) Highlights from the flick include an amazing opener, a killer club shoot-out, and the vertical slicing of an entire vampire's body.  Those particular sequences, coupled with an excellent climax, make BLADE 2 the first `real' action flick of 2002.  Let's hope others prick up their ears and get a clue"

"DGP311","9","0","1","26 March 2002"," Best action movie I've seen in a long time!
","The action sequences were fantastic, and the rest of the movie was amazing as well.  Leonor Varela (as Nyssa) was smoking hot and a welcome addition. The storyline is not the most complicated but for anyone that liked the first Blade, Blade II will blow you away."

","""Blade II"" is a superior continuation to the 1998 hit that reunites Wesley Snipes as the dark comic book superhero who continues his spree of taking on vampires.The first ""Blade"" was one hell of a film and this one is even better.The sequel is directed by Guilermo Del Toro and centers on Blade teaming up with a group of vampires to destroy a race of mutant vampires which are indestructible against Blade's weaponry.Del Toro takes ""Blade II"" to a higher exciting action level and Wesley Snipes is fiercely entertaining and gives the audience what they paid for.The martial arts sequences were cheorographed by Donnie Yen who also plays one of the vampires who is a member of Blade's team.I have this film twice already and I plan on seeing it again and again.I would highly recommend this film if you are really into films like this."
"chuckrules","Null","0","1","26 March 2002"," A worthy sequel
","Blade II:  Blood Hunt<br/><br/>	Sequels are a tricky business.  You can take a perfectly good movie and in the interest of bringing in more dough, end up with something that isn't near as good (witness the glory of Highlander and the sequel we won't discuss), or, you can write a story well enough that you have something which improves on the first (see the fun Rush Hour and the improved Rush Hour 2).  Thankfully the folks from Marvel Comics movie line were able to fall into the latter category with Blade II. 	Those of us who saw the first one (or read the comics which he appeared in) know that Blade (played by Wesley Snipes) was infected by the vampire virus while in utero and was born with all the strengths of the vampire (nearly invulnerable, enhanced strength, increased speed and agility) and none of their weaknesses (crosses, sunlight, silver).  He does have the blood lust of the vampire but through serums is able to keep it under control.  As we saw in the first movie, with the assistance of his ally Whistler, Kris Kristofferson, Blade is the scourge of the vampire nations. 	Since the end of the first movie approximately three years have passed.  It appeared at the time of that movie that Whistler had died but apparently he had been whisked away by the vampires and was constantly being moved as Blade and his new weapons ally, Scud, tracked them across the world.  Blade finally frees Whistler and the three find their hideout under attack by some vampire warriors.  However the warriors are only bringing a message to Blade from the leader of the vampires.  They are proposing a truce as something far worse than Blade has begun hunting them.  A new breed of vampires known as Reapers have mutated and begun attacking vampires.  Unfortunately a bite from a Reaper tends to turn the attacked vampire into a new Reaper with the urge to kill more vampires.  Typically this wouldn't bother Blade but once the vampires are gone, humanity would be the next prey. 	Blade agrees to lead a group of warrior known as The Bloodpack against the Reapers.  The irony here occurs in that the Bloodpack has spent the better part of two years training to fight their new leader.  The pack on a whole is anonymous with two standing out, Reinhardt played by Ron Perlman is their deposed leader and Nyssa played by Leonor Varela carries a secret which will unfold throughout the movie. 	The first meeting of Blade's group doesn't go near as well as they hoped since they discover most of the typical weapons against vampires are now useless.  Through some research they discover the main weapon, sunlight, still works and set about making new weapons. 	The final battle against the Reapers carries some consequences unforeseen and then treachery strikes Blade with the actual villain being revealed. 	This movie is heavily action oriented, is about a vampire hunter, and is quite gory.  If those things turn you off, don't go see this movie.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind those, you will most likely find this an entertaining movie.  Spanish Director Guillermo del Toro brings a dark, macabre look to this film.  His Reapers are as different from vampires as vampires from humanity.  Their look is stylized and fresh.  Their method of attack must be seen to be believed.  His pacing of the movie is right on pace with possibly more action than the original yet still maintaining some semblance's of an adequate plot. 	The actors tend to be what makes this movie.  Many people see Wesley in only action roles and don't realize that he can act.  Here he handles the action sequences superbly and has an understated method for delivering his lines in the best possible manner.  He gets off many worthy of laughs.  Ron Perlman is probably doing the best role I have seen from him in a long time. Usually his characters die relatively quickly but Reinhardt survives much of the movie and is one truly evil personuh vampire. 	The fight choreography is spectacular.  Donnie Yen, most recently seen in Highlander: Endgame and soon to be seen in Shanghai Knights, plays as one of the Bloodpack.  His character doesn't get much screen time but his pacing for the fights is wonderful.  The sequences are much more intricate than the previous film and lead to a glorious treat for action fans. 	Are there problems with this movie?  Sure, a couple.  The relationship between Blade and Nyssa isn't explained too well and some of the computer graphics do go way over the top.  In fact an early scene had me wondering but they pulled it together before going further.  However, those are just a small sampling which otherwise don't detract from a wonderful addition to the Blade universe. ***"
"Gu","7","0","1","23 March 2002"," 90% Action, 10% Plot, 100% Fun!
","Let's start off by dispelling the downsides of this movie.  Sure, the plot isn't solid as a rock, it's a bit predictable, and it's gory as hell...now to the good...Director Del Toro literally FORCE FEEDS you action in this movie! It still amazes me to realize how much fighting was in those two hours!  Wesley Snipes is his usual bad@$$ self, and Blade's confidence in his skills are comical at times.  The new twist of Blade fighting alongside of the vampires is interesting, since you'll find out *SPOILER* that the group of fighters he joins with were actually trained to kill HIM!  There's a lot more hand to hand combat in this movie...just straight fists, which is alright, but I prefer Blade's sword! haha  There were a couple more downsides to the movie, such as obvious computer animation (but if you take into account the impossible moves, you'll understand), the weak love story, and the moderate villian, who, I'm sorry, but does not compare at all to the slick and crafty Deacon Frost.  However, if you're thirsting for some blood...Errrr...Action...pay the seven bucks because you'll end up getting 100 dollars worth!  And Blade fans...I don't even need to tell you to see it...you already have!"
"nivek_nailgun","7","0","1","26 March 2002"," as good as the first
","I didn't think this was any better or worse than the first installment (which is a rarity if you ask me) and I really enjoyed it. Without gushing on and on,I've got to address the lengthy criticism posted below simply because the plot holes weren't quite as bad as the one commenter had thought:<br/><br/>Alleged problems with the plot:<br/><br/>I. The ancient vampire...<br/><br/>1- Yes,he managed to live for centuries and build himself up,but he was certainly not guaranteed eternity and hence what he was searching for. The new breed wasn't to replace him so much as to see his 'kind' become invincible and dominate.<br/><br/>2- Lost control of the Reaper simply because it was experimentation.<br/><br/>3- I'm sure the ancient vampire brought Blade to his home rather than another location simply because he felt safest there.<br/><br/>4- Had the ancient vampire had intermediaries talk with Blade and present the entire plan to him,Blade may well not have gone for the whole idea. In other words,it would seem more genuine coming directly from your mortal enemy than one of his lackeys.<br/><br/>5- The only thing I can say to objection #5 is that the movie is fantasy,so it should be given some leeway here.<br/><br/>6- Again,a film. Had the ancient vampire not shown the enemy (and hence the viewer) the test tube vamps,we would have been left in the dark and the critics would have screamed 'Plot hole!' all the way to the bank.<br/><br/>7- Doesn't kill Blade when he can. Well,that isn't so much a criticism against Blade II as it is action movies in general. This will probably be the case with 98% action movies forever.<br/><br/>8- I'm not sure where else the ancient vampire should have ran off to. I say again,perhaps he felt safer in his lifelong stronghold.<br/><br/>II. The Reaper Virus (aka Zombie Movie hides as Vampire Flick)<br/><br/>1-5- No real complaints here,just how the script went and I personally liked the idea. But opinions will always vary.<br/><br/>6 - The original Reaper takes his own life at the end of the film after being mortally wounded. He merely thrusts the blade further into his heart after feeling the release from his painful existence begin.<br/><br/>III. The lackeys (Other Vampires & Human agents)<br/><br/>1 - Perhaps the Vampire Nation only had a pair of prototype suits...it's never stated otherwise.<br/><br/>2-3- Typical movie action. This is another sin committed by 98% of action movies and not just Blade II.<br/><br/>4 - Willingly follow Blade into the sewers to hunt the Reapers with UV grenades and no way to shield themselves .....BUT it was the best and fastest plan available.<br/><br/>III. Lovestory between Blade and the Vampire Princess<br/><br/>Blade killed his mother in the first movie when he realized she was a complete traitor. He didn't fall for Nyssa's attractiveness so much as her genuine personality. Besides,it's a movie and they just added a small twist to it with the small bit of lovestory.<br/><br/>IV. The Fight Scenes<br/><br/>I liked the fight scenes myself overall but have a bit of a complaint with the computer rendering. Some of it was just too obvious and could have been done better.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to flame here or anything,but I certainly think the movie is worth a viewing and if you're really not going to like it,that's fine...but complaints about 'holes' aren't quite as penetrating as some folks might lead you to believe."
"stephendhodgson","Null","0","1","25 March 2002"," Superior to original
","This film joins T2 and the Matrix as one of Hollywood's action movie greats.<br/><br/>The special effects are much better than the original (which weren't good), but are also good on there own terms.  Fight choreography is more varied, the camera more fluid, the editing precise. More importantly, Blade II's story is much better.  Blade is caught in the middle of a war.  Who are his friends and who are his enemies?  Blade is about two things:  trust and compassion.<br/><br/>Not a perfect movie.  Whistler's recovery is contrived, and the movie explains more than it needs to.  But the FX, action, and story make up for these flaws many, many times over."
"sriker","9","0","1","25 March 2002"," Awesome!
","Probably the best action flick I've seen since The Matrix.  A little less empasis on story than in the original Blade, but the action is stepped up several notches.  Wesley Snipes is fantastic as Blade, as are the rest of the cast in their roles.  Ron Pearlman is a particular standout as one of the ""Blood Pact"" vampies.  There's also an element of dark comedy here, which helps to keep the gore from laying in too heavy. :)<br/><br/>Bring on Blade III!"
"lcaruso4","Null","0","1","25 March 2002"," excellent action packed slasher
","I saw this movie not knowing what to expect, because I never had seen the first movie in the series. Within the first five minutes we get some fast paced action/fighting. This movie was what an action film should be about. It had good fighting scenes, and a semi-interesting plot to keep you satisfied between them.<br/><br/>I rate this one an 8/10"
"Buggy-4","Null","0","1","23 March 2002"," This one beats ""Blade"" hands down!
","Ooh boy, put the bacon in the frying pan and kick the cave man's teeth in, this movie was something else.  I was skeptical of course because i did not enjoy ""Blade"" very much, despite the excellent opening.  So when I was done watching ""Blade 2"" I felt overjoyed almost.  The CGI is so much better in this movie, and unlike the original, ""Blade 2"" was actually scary in some parts.  I loved the hip hop/techno soundtrack as well, it added a certain air of chaos to the film.  The reapers are a new installment to the series and not for one minute do they look fake.  The only downside was the opening could not top the wicked opening of the original's Vampire Rave.  Also, do all fight movies after ""The Matrix"" have to look like it?  I feel it could have tried to use some of it own ideas for filming a fight scene.<br/><br/>*** OUT OF **** VAMPIRE SKULLS. <br/><br/>Also check out the awesome ""Dracula 2000"" and ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" which, no offence to B2, school this movie."
"CWagner","7","0","1","18 March 2002"," Solid horror/action
","""Blade 2""'s biggest weaknesses are a weak plot with a number of holes in it; however, its strengths overwhelm that flaw and produce a very solid piece of horror/action fare that follows the original movie very well.<br/><br/>Del Toro's direction is top-notch, with darkness and light playing a much greater role in this film than the original. With character design and art consulting by comic-book masters Timothy Bradstreet and Mike Mignola, and sets taken straight from the decaying inner cities of Eastern Europe, the film has a consistantly strong texture. Of special note are the character designs for the ""Bloodpack"", the group of vampire warriors which Blade must lead. The detail level of their costumes and equipment is phenominal.<br/><br/>Ron Perlman's character ""Rheinhart"" will be quite surprising for those of us you who only know the actor from movies like ""The City Of Lost Children"". As Blade's mirror-image (as the former leader of the Bloodpack), Rheinhart shows off Perlman's ability to play villians to the hilt.<br/><br/>The primary ""bad guys"" of the film, the uber-vampires known as ""Reapers"", are extremely well-created. None of the trailers show off their most important feature, which will both shock and amaze you when you see it. Similarly, the gore effects are quite amazing, with excellent blending between computer effects and classic methods.<br/><br/>That said, there are a number of moments where the computer effects are sub-par; in particular, the scenes where Blade is rendered fully by computers are lacking in believability. Those scenes are short, however.<br/><br/>Finally, the action scenes are choreographed extremely well. There are a number of scenes that are deliberately evocative of the original movie, but Del Toro's direction is distinctly his own. My only complaint is that Donnie Yen (the HK film star, known to US audiences for his role in ""Iron Monkey"") didn't get to kick enough ass... but this wasn't a starring role for him, so I guess I can't expect too much.<br/><br/>Overall a good sequel. Now I'm waiting for ""Hellboy"" with even more baited breath."
